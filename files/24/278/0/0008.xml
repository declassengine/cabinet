IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;GOVERNMENT.iGRET.COPY NO.P.173(38)C A B I N E T.- COAL:     INTER-DISTRICT CO-ORDINATION OF PRICES, AND THE EXPORT TRADE.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate herewith a memorandum by the Secretary for Mines on the inter-related prohlems of the inter-district co-ordination of coal prices and the future of our coal export trade.The Central Council of Colliery Owners on 12th July resolved, by slightly more than the requisite majority (under the Coal Mines Act of 1930)  of 85 per cent,  of the tonnage for the country as a whole,  to seek statutory powers    to collect a levy of 3d.  a ton on all coal produced and to use the fund so obtained for reducing, as may he necessary, the price of British coal in contested markets abroad.    In that way,  it is hoped, the &quot;burden of the competition of surplus coal in the exporting districts would he lifted from the inland markets and inter-district co-ordination would he made practicable.The Central Council attach two provisos to their resolution, both, I understand, originating from South Wales.    The first contemplates that the levy subsidy scheme may be insufficient and therefore ineffective and provides in that event for its withdrawal after 31st March, 1940, if there is not an 85 per cent, majority in favour of continuance.    The second is the expression of an &quot;expectation&quot; that the Government will contribute to the levy in order to increase its effectiveness.    Neither of these provisos can, I think,
be seriously considered at this stage, but on&apos; the -assumption that the coal industry would, in the end accept the powers without the provisos, there are still two difficulties in the way of granting them.The first difficulty concerns Parliamentary procedure.      The Central Council wish us to proceed by an Order under the Coal Mines Act - a course which I understand is legally possible.      I do not like the suggestion that we should ask Parliament by Affirmative Order to put back into the Coal Mines Act something that Parliament rejected when that measure was before them, namely, a national levy and subsidy scheme for coal.      But even if we were prepared, on the ground that urgency overrules propriety, to contemplate proceeding in that way rather than by new legislation, I still cannot think that we should be justified in attempting to rush through both Houses this month, practically without notice, a proposal which is so controversial and so far-reaching in its effects.    The public utility and industrial consumers would have strong additional arguments to justify their inevitable opposition.      Action mast in my judgment wait until Parliament reassembles after the recess;    and if that is agreed we need not now consider by what Parliamentary process we should meet the coal owners&apos;  request, if we decide to meet it at all.The second difficulty concerns the provisions of existing Trade Agreements, principally with the Scandinavian and Baltic Countries, who have contracted to buy definite percentages of their coal requirements from the United Kingdom on the understanding that they will not be xolaced in a less favourable position as regards the purchase of United Kingdom coal than the buyers in any other country.      As at present advised, in order to implement the coal industry &apos;s ass\irances,-2-
we should have either (l) to adopt the absurd policy of subsidising to secure coal markets of which we are already assured, or (2) to allow e.g. the Scandinavians without protest to ignore their obligations to buy our coal,  or (3)  to try to persuade the Scandinavians to accept the view that the levy subsidy scheme will not worsen their position, or (4)  to re-negotiate the Trade Agreements on a new basis,,    The subject is more fully dealt with in paragraphs 9-11 of the Secretary for Mines&apos; memorandum, but if my proposal to defer consideration until the autumn is accepted, we need not immediately examine this difficulty furthersWhile so far my proposals tend to defer action, I recognise that something must be done   very soon if we are to check the falling off and to recover ground already lost in our coal markets abroad through the compotition of subsidised German coalo    The coal export position is rapidly getting worse and is having an increasingly serious repercussion on the maintenance of reasonable prices at home, and so, ultimately,  on wages.In my view, an international coal cartel is the only satisfactory solution.    I have taken every opportunity, during the recent Anglo-German negotiations, to press upon the German official delegates the need for improving our trade relations with particular reference to our contested coal markets, and I hope that if   -further trade discussions actually open in the autumn it will be possible to press the German representatives further.Meanwhile, as is stated in paragraph 14 of the Secretary for Minos&apos; memorandum, conversations with regard to a coal cartel have been proceeding between the producers in the principal European countries and a further meoY.ing is to take place on 29th -July.-13-nilllllllllllllllllll.......Ill......I............mi...........mum.........1 mi ii .........mm _-__
The coal owners have asked rne to receive a deputation to discuss further methods of support from the export trade and I am inclined to see them and to urge them to make the fullest possible use, in the discussions on the 29th July with their European colleagues, of their decision as an industry to create a fund to combat the competition of subsidised foreign coal.      I would propose, if my colleagues agree, to allow our coal industry&apos;s representatives to say further that they have been in constant consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government and that they have been made aware of our sympathy v/ith them in their determination to take effective steps to protect the interests of the British coal export trade.I should add in my talk with the coal owners that the Government is continuing to pursue vigorously a policy of negotiation with France, and as opportunity offers with other countries,  to secure by agreement the greatest possible scope for the export of British coal.O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,15th July, 1938.
Inter-District Co-ordination of Coal Prices and the British Coal Export Trade.1. During the past few weeks I have been concerned at indications that it was not unlikely that intense price competition between the several coal mining districts would break out in both the inland and export markets.    Competition between individual collieries within the districts is kept in check by the statutory selling schemes, but I have not been satisfied that the operation of those schemes is yet properly co-ordinated as between the districts.    This is a matter that I have discussed on two recent occasions with the Central Council of Colliery Owners.2. As you are aware, I have been equally concerned at the position and prospects of the British export trade in coal. My apprehensions in this matter can perhaps best be summed up as follows:- Even in a time of rising demand,  our coal exports have not maintained their position relative to our competitors (particularly Germany).    Now that a new recession in exports seems to have started,  their position is likely to become relatively even worse,  and once again,  the loss of trade is likely to be to Germany.3. The Central Council has had under consideration the questions of national co-ordination,  complicated by the differing interests of the inland and export trade,  and also the future of our export trade and they have now propounded a solution of the two inter-related problems.    Put shortly, it is necessary to prevent coal, normally exported, from forcing itself on to the inland market during a period of depression in the export trade.      The Council claims that that end can be achieved only by offering such assistance to the exporting collieries as will hold out hopes of maintaining and increasing their export sales.      A system of co-ordination
of prices between the districts depends largely upon a reasonable method of sharing the available inland trade,  and the Council have come to the conclusion that the adoption of the system is entirely dependent on a scheme which will enable subsidies to be given as required to maintain exports of coal against competition,  also subsidised, from Continental producers.      They are prepared to finance such a scheme themselves.4.  In brief,  this subsidy proposal (which will be called a Trade Maintenance Fund, since a very small part of the available monies may he used to encourage the use of coal at home)  is that by a levy of not more than 3d. per ton on all coal produced a fund of some S3 million per annum shall be created which will be used as necessary to reduce the price of British coal in export markets.5.  I am. told by Sir Walter Benton Jones,  the Chairman of the Central Council,  that this scheme is put forward as an indivisible whole by the industry and that it has been accex^ted by the requisite majority of the industry on the condition that the necessary statutory powers will be provided -that is to say,  the industry ask the Government for powers to amend the Central Scheme in force under the Coal Mines Act,  1930,  in order to provide for the collection of the levy and the paj/ment of the subsidy, etc.The Resolution of the Central Council to that end, which I understand was carried by a tonnage majority of over 86 per cent,  is qualified as follows:    Unless before the 31st December, 1939,  a resolution of the Council that the amended Scheme shall continue in operation beyond the 31st march 1940,  is carried by at least an 85 per cent, majority,  the amended Scheme shall revert to its present form,  (that is to say that the levy and subsidy scheme and the improvements proposed in inter-district co-ordination come to an end).
A further resolution was passed at the same time that 11 the Government be informed that their support of the export trade by way of financial aid and other forms of assistance is essential to the success and continuance of the proposals and that it be recorded that certain of the districts have agreed to the proposals with that expectation&quot;.6.  In my discussions with Sir Walter Benton Jones,  I have called his attention to the public statements made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in connection with the Anglo-German Payments Agreement, foreshadowing,  in due course, negotiations between the British and German Governments with a view to increasing the mutual trade and to improving the trade.relations between the two countries.      Sir Waiter was aware of those statements and appreciated that such discussions would almost certainly include coal.      In this connection he stressed that the possession of the weapon of subsidy was essential in the discussions which are still proceeding between the principal European coal producers for the formation of a Cartel.      lie did not deny that the negotiations referred to by the Chancellor would assist the formation of a Cartel. But,  in his view,  the urgency of the problems of the British coal export trade and of inter-district co-ordination was such that it was in the national interest impossible to wait upon the result of those negotiations.      He pressed therefore that H.M.  Government should give all the assistance in its power to the British coal industry in its efforts itself    to deal at once with the situation.7.  The question for decision by the Government is whether it will agree to submit forthwith proposals to Parliament to confer on the coal industry powers to enable it to operate a levy and subsidy scheme similar in principle to that which has been operating for a long time in the German coal industry.      It is perhaps unnecessary for me to mention the
obvious line of attack against such a proposal - for example that it involves supplying cheap coal abroad at the expense of an increased price to home consumers.    There are, however, two points of particular    difficulty to which I think I must direct attention.8.    I would recall that during the passage of the Goal Mines Act, 1930, a proposal, originally included in the Bill, that there should be a national levy and subsidy scheme (which is, of course, the present proposal) was rejected by Parliaments It would be possible, by means of Orders laid before both Houses of Parliament under Section 2(4) of the Act (which Orders would require positive approval) legally to provide for the required amendment of the Central Scheme.   But it is for consideration whether, since Parliament in 1929/30 considered and rejected the proposal, it would now be proper for a similar proposal to be put forward under the Order procedure even though a positive resolution of both Houses is required. I would remind you that in 1930 a proposal for district levy and subsidy schemes on exactly the same lines as a national scheme was struck out of the Bill by the Lords.    Nevertheless, to demonstrate that the words of the clause were wide enough to cover levy and subsidy, a proviso to Section 3(4) was ultimately added to the effect that an Order for a district levy and subsidy scheme could be made under that Section but that Parliaments special attention should be drawn to any such order by providing for five extra lay days.    A similar provision with regard to a national levy could not be inserted in the statute, as orders for amendment of the Central Scheme require the positive approval of Parliament, but the words of the section dealing with the powers of the Central Scheme are, in this respect, the same as in Section 3(4).
The coal industry has urged most strongly that it is essential that its proposals should he made effective before the Recess.      If Orders were laid, this could possibly be done.      If, however, this is regarded as an improper course, the alternative (assuming, of course, that the Government is prepared to support the subsidy proposal) is to introduce legislation, which obviously could not he done until the autumn.      Sir Walter Benton Jones does not think that he can hold the price position in the industry until then.     He adds that while Parliament may have rejected the subsidy proposal on good ground eight years ago, circumstances have now changed entirely, and the present proposal of the industry is little more than a partial pooling of proceeds, the principle of which has already been accepted by Parliament in connection with the Lancashire Central Selling Scheme.9. Yesterday I received a Deputation comprising the Joint Consultative Committee of owners and men in the coal industry who put before me jointly their unanimous and emphatic views -(a) that the position of the export coal tradewas most serious and growing rapidly worse.(b) that it must be made publicly known at homeand abroad that the full weight of the Government was behind the industry and that the Government would take all necessary steps to combat subsidised competition from abroad.(c) that the Government has now an opportunityof making a great contribution to industrial peace and of avoiding those difficult labour
problems that are bound to arise between the two sides of the industry if no steps are taken to meet the competition of subsidised foreign coal,(d) that in the last resort Government financial support of the Trade Maintenance Fund might well be necessary.    That Fund was a means to an endof securing an international agreement which would provide the economic price essential to the industry&apos;s well being,(e) that it is essential that the Government&apos;s approval of the industry&apos;s plan of self-help should be given at once, the next meeting of the Central Council being on the 20th July,(f) that the seriousness of the situation warranted a conference between the Joint Consultative Committee and the head of the Government,10, The other point to which I must direct attention is the position that would arise, if the proposal were put into force, under the Trade Agreements with the Scandinavian and Baltic countries,      I would remind you that as part of these agreements (under which United Kingdom coal was guaranteed a specified share of the coal market in those countries) the British coal industry undertook that there would be no attempt by means of concerted arrangements to fix higher prices for those countries than are charged to buyers of United Kingdom coal in other export markets.      Furthermore, the coal industry undertook that under no circumstances would those countries be placed in a less favourable position as regards the purchase of coal from the United Kingdom than any other country, ^
( Lk11. The Central Council argue that their present proposals are not designed to worsen the position of the Trade Agreement countries.    On the other hand they claim that neither the intention of the Agreements nor the wording of their assurances should he regarded as a tar to legitimate attempts on their part to maintain their exports against subsidised competition by their competitors.12. I understand from the Board of Trade that there is little doubt that the scheme involves a breach of the colliery owners&apos;  assurances to the Trade Agreement countries, unless, which is absurd,  exports to those countries were subsidised equally with any other;    and that in every case the other party to the Agreement will make the most of the infringement in order to secure some compensating advantage.      The result might be claims by the Agreement countries for some concession; in other words there might be a possibility of having to renegotiate the Agreements.    The Board of Trade consider it is very necessary, and I agree,  that the prior assent to the subsidy scheme of the countries concerned should be obtained rather than that they should be presented with a fait accompli.13. I recognise that these difficulties are real.    I would, however, remark that, perhaps for the first time,  the coal industry has come forward with a proposal of self-help,  and is asking the Government to assist it to put the proposal into operation.      If this assistance is denied not only will the coal export trade continue to decline, but inter-district competition with possible repercussions on labour will also result.14.  I undertook to ascertain the views of the Government -upon the following questions -(a) the principle of the levy and subsidy scheme forthe coal industry;(b) the propriety of securing its operation by Orderprocedure under the 1930 Act;(c) the effect of the levy subsidy proposal on the scandinavian and Baltic Trade Agreements. -7-
(d15. A further point to he kept in mind is that the conversations which have &quot;been going on for a long time between the delegates of the British and other coal producing countries (of which the Germans are far the most important)  are to be resumed on 29th July.      It is just possible that,  owing to what was said to the German Government delegates a fortnight ago,  the German coal owners may then be more forthcoming.16,.  There is,  of course, much to he said for the coal industry&apos;s arming itself with a big stick to struggle to maintain and indeed to recover its export business.      The. point is whether Parliament will give it this stick and whether given it would be big enough to he at all effective.      In my view a 3d. levy - 3 million pounds - if used would go but a little way if it came to a real fight*      If (as appears to be the case) Parliament cannot be asked to give the necessary powers before the Recess,  I recommend that the position of the British Coal-owners in the forthcoming negotiations should be strengthened by a statement which they could use,  of the Governments intention to support the coal export trade to the fullest possible extent.      This should not, be in such a form as necessarily to mean   acceptance whether     of the levy-subsidy plan or of direct financial assistance,  though neither of these methods would be excluded if one or both were later found to be essential. *H. C.ines Department 14th July,  1938.
