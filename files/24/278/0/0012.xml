In his memorandum the Secretary for Mines suggests that he should be authorised to announce, before the Recess, a decision by the Government to introduce in the autumn a Bill to increase the Miners&apos; Welfare levy on coal output from -gd, to Id, per ton, for a period of five years (commencing with the levy upon the output of 1938 which becomes payable on 31st March, 1939),O.F.G.S.Board of Trade,22nd July,  1938.
- .12?THE MINERSV Y/BLFARE FUND:    PIT HEAD BATHS PROGRAMME.. Memo ran dura by. the Secretary for Mines 9 IntroductoryoThe Miners&apos; Welfare Fund is a purely domestic  concern of the coal industry s and no public money is involved,,     The Fund was constituted -under Section 20 of the Mining Industry Act, 1920s  and the money is derived from an annual levy on every ton of coal produced.     The levy is collected by the Mines Department and the duty of allocating the money is vested by the Act in the Miners&apos; Welfare Committee, which ie appointed by the Board of Trade and contains representatives of both sides in the industry.     The levy was originally imposed at the rate of one penny for a -period of five and a- half years, but it was extended for a further five years by the Mining Industry (Welfare Fund) Act, 1925, and again for a similar period by the Mining Industry (Welfare Fund) Act, 19310      In 1954 following upon an inquiry into the position of the fund by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Chelmsford*, the output levy was reduced to -gd. , but its life was extended by 16 years &apos; to 1951,In the meantime, under Part III, of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, a new levy had been imposed - upon coal Royalty Owners -of one shilling in the pound on the value of mineral rentals. The money produced by this second levy, which is permanent, is also allocated by the Miners&apos; Welfare Committee, but is specifically earmarked (by statute) for the provision of pithead baths, until the Board of Trade otherwise direct.     This formed the nucleus of what has by custom come to be known as the &quot;Baths Fund&quot; ,The Baths Fund,When the output levy was reduced by the Act of 1934.. it was generally accepted that the provision of baths was far the most important welfare work remaining to be done, and accordingly* See Report:    Cmd, 4236 (1933), -1-
statutory provision was made in that Act for a portion of the future output levy to he added to the Baths Fund (viz: sufficient to &quot;bring up the total credits to that fund each year to  375,000 It was then calculated that this annual sum would he sufficient to provide for the completion of the baths programme in 18 years (the remaining period of the output levy as extended by the Act of 1934) i,e,  at a total cost of  6,750,000,In visualizing this programme, it had, of course? been necessary to cut the coat according to the cloth that was likely to be available.    Accordingly, the contemplated provision of baths was limited to collieries which (a) employ a substantial number of men, and (b) have a reasonably long expectation of life - limitations which would result in an appreciable fringe of mines and miners being left unprovided for.Acceleration of the Baths Programme,In view of the insistent demand from the industry for more rapid provision of baths, the Miners1 Welfare Committee decided,in 1936, that they w ould he justified in accelerating the building programme to the extent of provicling   for expenditure at the rate of  625,000 a year.    They estimated that expenditure at this rate over a. period of 8 years ( 5,000,000 altogether) would break the back of the programme within that much shorter period.    The Committee were enabled to embark on this higher rate of expenditure by taking advantage of the time lags between the placing of contracts and the actual payments.      It was clear, however, that this expedient would not suffice to finance the acceleration of the programme for more than about tv/o years, and accordingly the Committee approached me last year, and asked me whether they should proceed, nevertheless, with their accelerated programme. In view of the growing urgency of the demand for baths (which in my view is fully justified), of the improvement in the finances of the industry at that time, and of opinions expressed in debate in the House of Commons? I asked them to make their plans on the assumption that money for the accelerated programme would be available,
The Financial Position.With the arrears of work being steadily reduced and the rate of payments-out being thereby increased   it is estimated that the accumulated balances will be exhausted by the middle of next year. The Baths Fund will then begin to require additional finance (over and above its statutory annual income of  375,000);    and in respect of the period 1939-46* inclusive, a total additional sum of about  2,000,000 will be needed if the accelerated programme is to be maintained and carried through.As a first step I invited the Joint Standing Consultative Committee of the.Mining Association and the Mineworkers&apos; Federation to consider the question of how the necessary additional finance for completing the accelerated baths programme could best be provided.      The Committee failed to reach any agreement, however;    and accordingly I interviewed the two sides separately.The Owners&apos; views may be summarized as follows.      They are opposed to any increase in the Output Levy, on the grounds (a) that the financial prospects of the industry, particularly on the export side,  do not justify it, and (b)  that the recent concession of holidays with pay has meant an appreciable addition to costs of production.      I think that the short answer to these arguments is that apart from the export trade the industry as a whole has been making good profits (the average district credit balance for the March Quarter over the country as a whole was l/lld. per ton,  as compared, with 1/- for the corresponding Quarter of 1934),  and although prices are now falling in the export trade and there is a great risk that this will spread to the inland trade,  the coal owners have it in their power by e proper use of the selling schemes to maintain inland prices at a level which would enable this to be carried withoutimportant effect.* Payments in respect of contracts placed in 1943-4, will not fall due until 1945-6.Consultations with theIndustry.
The owners suggest that the additional finance required could be- obtained (if necessary) by borrowing (which would, no doubt, require enabling legislation);    but for several reasons, which I will indicate later, I cannot recommend this expedient.The Miners take the view that the output levy should he temporarily increased, to an extent sufficient not merely to ensure the completion of the present programme of accelerated building, but also to provide for a supplementary baths programme (see below).      They urge, too, that additional expenditure is required, for replacements and additions to many of the baths already built.     They contend that the financial condition of the industry is such as to justify some addition to the levy, and they point out that except when wages are &quot;on the minimum&quot;, the wage ascertainment machinery has the effect of putting 85 per cent, of the cost of the levy upon the men themselves.      They ask that there should be an addition of -g-d. to the levy, and that this should be statutorily earmarked for baths for a period of 5 years, without in any way committing themselves as to what should happen thereafter.A supplementary Baths Programme.The present baths programme was designed (in 1934) to provide the most extensive possible accommodation compatible with the funds then likely to be available.     But even after its completion there will still be something like 100,000 men without baths accommodation owing to the accident of their employment at small mines, or mines with only a comparatively short life.*   To budget for the provision of accommodation for at least a substantial proportion of these men, as well as to make reasonable provision for replacements and additions to existing installations, for rising costs of building, and for other unforeseen emergencies, will necessitate a much larger additional provision than  2,000,000. Exactly what such provision* Incidentally, I have reason to believe that the Royal Commission on Safety in Coal Mines, which is now sitting is likely to urge the provision of baths for these men.
might amount to, it is impossible to say at present, since the circumstances of each colliery have.to he examined in detail at the time at which its turn for consideration arrives. But it is safe to Bay that the cost of such a supplementary programme would substantially exceed the estimated unspent balance -  500,000 (viz    at the end of 1944) of an additional g-d. levy.Borrowing Proposals.As stated above, the coalowners, in opposing any increase in the rate of the output levy, suggest that the extra funds should.be secured by borrowing.      While they have not placed any official proposals before me, I have good reason to believe that they envisage first of all borrowing from the unexpended balances&apos; for the time being of what are known as the District Fund and the General Fund, which comprise the Welfare Fund proper apart from the Baths Fund.      This proposal, however, involves insurmountable difficulties, which I need not particularize here.Alternatively they suggest borrowing from outside on the security of future income.     Any such proposal would require amending legislation and a Government guarantee, since the security of future income is independent on an Act of Parliament which might at any time be cancelled or amended by a future Parliament.It is difficult to make a very exact estimate of the amount which could be borrowed on the basis of the future income provided by the present Welfare Act but approximately  200,000 per annum could be borrowed for eight years and be repaid both as to interest and capital by the expiration of the present Act in 1952.This would make available to the Baths Fund an annual amouir of  575,000 instead of  625,000 required to meet the accelerated programme only without provision until after 1952 for the  100,000 per annum for the extension of the programme to smaller pits.
si-ftTo provide security for ari annual borrowing of  550,000, so as to provide  725,000 annually for both the accelerated ana extended programme,  it would he necessary to extend the life of the present Welfare Act by 7.years,  i.e., to 1909 instead of 1952,  and even then practically no money would be available for baths at a LI between the years 1946 and 1959.If this method of meeting the Baths demand should be adopted I tnink it must be anticipated that the liineworkers1 Federation of Great Britain will still press for the additional  d. levy to be imposed for general welfare purposes, including pension funds for aged miners.Conclusions.During the passage of the 1954 Bill, the then Secretary for Mines,  in justifying the reduction of the output levy to -g-d. ,  said that it would be for Parliament to consider the whole position again in the event of an improvement in the financial condition of the industry.    While I do not propose to re-open the question in relation to the Welfare Fund&apos;s work as a whole (indeed the miners themselves have not hitherto asked for this),  I am satisfied that there is now ample justification for a limited increase in the levy for the specific purpose of accelerating and extending the building of baths,  the value of which to the miners themselves can hardly be overestimated;    but legislation to provide for an increase in the levy may provoke protests from consumers of coal, particularly if put forward at the same time as the levy subsidy  scheme which was considered at last week&apos;s Cabinet.I have considered the possibility of a ^d. increase only for 5 years. This, assuming maintenance of the present rate of coal output, would produce about  1,250,000 in ail, a suim which would not be sufficient even to complete the present
, &apos; accelerated programme, and would,  therefore, leave nothin^^^an;/ unforeseen expenses or for- a supplementary programme.While I have shown what could he done &quot;by borrowing (under Treasury guarantee) on the security of future income under the Welfare Act I do not  consider this a satisfactory method of meeting the position.   &apos;Apart from the fact that sufficient money for an adequate supplementary programme could not be secured by this means without extending the duration of the id.  output levy much beyond the term of 16 years provided for in the Act of 1934,  any such proposal would arouse the strongest opposition from the miners,  who would then undoubtedly start a campaign for the restoration of the penny levy for the full term, not merely for the provision of baths, but for extra welfare objects of all kinds,  including miners&apos; pensions&apos;&quot;.     This we should have to resist;    with the result that our amending Bill would be vehemently opposed at all stages in the House of Commons.I therefore suggest that I may be given authority to announce in Parliament, before the Recess,  that it has been decided to introduce a Bill in the autumn to increase the output levy from -gd. to Id.,  commencing with the levy upon the output of 1933 (which becomes payable on 31st March, 1939),  for a period of five years  only,  the extra amount to be earmarked by Statute for the provision of baths accomnodation.    This would make  875,000 per annum in all available for the Baths Fund, until 31st March, 1944, by which time,  so far as can be foreseen,the work should be substantially completed.The reason why I ask that, in that event, an announcement of the Government&apos;s policy should be made before Parliament rises,  is that it is only right to give the industry as long notice as possible,  in order that when maKing forward contracts they may be able to take this new factor into account.In the event of the other alternative (borrowing) being accepted, there would be no need for any advance announce;;ir-nt .H.C.Mines Department,21st July,  1938.&quot; the Parliamentary Question by Mr.James Griffiths on the 19th July,-7-
