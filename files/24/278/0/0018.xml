THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET cabinet. NAVAL BRIGADES.Memorandum &quot;by the First Lord of the Admiralty.,I have been impressed by the evidence which has reached me of the unused resources of the country for voluntary effort in the Naval sphere.     There is a large number of men who are not attracted by land service but are anxious to volunteer in any organisations which have connections with the Naval Service.     For this traditional sea sense in the country the limited establishments of the Naval Reserves do not provide a sufficient outlet.     The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve can accept only limited numbers from certain districtso     All the divisions of that Reserve are very nearly up to establishment and in London patfticularljr applicants are daily being turned away. Demands for the formation of new Divisions of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve are frequent.     The Port of Hull, for instance, is most insistent, and in other parts there is evidence of large resources of volunteers for sea service for whom &quot;the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve can make no provisiono     So long as the voluntary principle is retained it seems highly desirable that no source of voluntary effort should be left unused and that no volunteers should be sent away discouraged.for this voluntary effort by the formation of Naval Brigades composed of men who volunteer for sea service but cannot be received into the Naval Reserves.      One such Naval BrigadeCP. 183(38).A proposal has been put forward to provide an outlet
is already in beingo     It was formed in Hampstead in 1911 by voluntary effort without official recognition or support. When war broke out,  its officers and 58 members joined the Forces.     Training was resumed after the war and still continues-     The officers of this Brigade are put to considerable expense and the rank and file themselves pay a small contribution.     There is no lack of volunteers. I am receiving offers to raise similar bodies elsewhere. For examples a gentleman at Slough has offered to raise a Naval Brigades mostly with private funds, but although he has the promise of  2?000 to build a drill hall he awaits assurance of Admiralty recognition and some material support before proceeding.     As a still more important example, the Navy League are anxious to form Naval Brigades from the excellent material provided by those who have been Sea Cadets and under the present regulations must leave the Sea Cadet Corps when they attain the age of eighteen.     By their re-incorporation into Naval Brigades the value of the useful training given to Sea Cadets would be conserved.The Naval Brigades would be formed under the control of recognised bodies and would be under Admiralty inspection. The members of the Brigades would undertake to serve in the Navy in the event of war.     For mobilisation requirements, the Naval Reserves are in general adequate, but the personnel of these Naval Brigades would form a nucleus of the 50,000 men whom the Navy will require to enter and train during the first year of waroBach Naval Brigade,  on recognition by the Admiralty, would receive for its equipment a grant of public stores not exceeding  100 in value, and would receive annually from public funds a capitation grant at the rate of  1 for each member.     All other expenses,  including the cost of
providing drill halls9 would be met from funds raised by the Naval Brigades themselves, with or without assistance from such Central Associations as the Navy League to whic^ they may be affiliated.-The cost of the scheme oannot be estimated until the extent of its development is disclosed.      In the firfit year. Admiralty recognition would be limited to ten units and to 19 000 men in all.      For this first year.,  the maximum cost would be  2S000^  including a non-recurrent expenditure of  19000.What is desired at present is Cabinet approval of the principle involved., which is that full use should be made in peacetime of the voluntary material available and that no opportunity should be missed of increasing the number of trained and disciplined men even though the services of all of them may not be required at the outbreak of hostilitieso     All details of schemes adopted would of course be subject to Treasury approval.(Initialled)    dec..Admiralty, S.W.1.21st july&apos;s  1938o
