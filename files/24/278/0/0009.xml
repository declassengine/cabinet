At their Meeting on the 29th June,  1938 (Cabinet 30 (38)Conclusion 6) the Cabinet agreed as followsi-&quot;(a) That a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence (In the Chair),-The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Secretary of State for India, The First Lord of the Admiralty, The Secretary of State for War, The Secretary of State for Air, With such technical advisers as theymight deem necessary,should consider and report on the results of the conversations between the War Office and the India Office on the subject of the defence of India;(b) That for the purposes of this CabinetCommittee,  the technical experts attending the Committee should have the same duty as have the Chiefs of Staff in the Service Departments at meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence to express their opinions freely whether asked for them or not,&quot;2.      We have held two meetings, and it has become clear that our investigation will occupy some considerable time. -   The issues referred to us will have to be considered from a number of aspects - military,  financial,  constitutional and political before we are in a position to submit final recommendations.]S E C R E T. CP.   174 (38).
+ CP.  26 (38), entitled &quot;The Organisation of the Army for its Role in War&quot;.r\ *3.      There are, however, two matters which are capable of being settled at the outset, on their own merits and without prejudice to the ultimate main decisions of policy.4.     The first of these matters is the following. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have recommended that India should reduce her establishments by four battalions of British infantry, which should be placed at the disposal of the War Office to meet its urgent requirements.     The Secretary of State for War is anxious to use these battalions,for the discharge of certain of our commitments abroad, on lines contemplated in a memorandum&quot;1&quot; circulated by him in February last.     Three of the battalions would con-stitute the additional brigade required in Palestine, and the fourth would form part of the garrison of Malta.     The Secretary of State for War has informed us that he can provide permanent barrack accommodation for two of the battalions in April, 1939, and for the other two during the trooping season 1939-40.5.     The Secretary of State for India informs us that he is prepared to dispense with the battalions in question.      Prom a financial point of view, the Chancellor of the Exchequer states that he is willing to assent to the additional charge being borne upon British Army Votes, as soon as the permanent quarters referred to in the preceding paragraph are available.-2-
Accordingly we recommend this proposal to the Cabinet,Existing Indian Defence expenditure: possibility of economiess proposed Committee of Inquiry.6.     Our second immediate recommendation relates to finance.-     There is general agreement as to the urgency of re-equipping the Defence Forces in India, both for the defence of India and for Imperial defence as a whole.     The Secretary of State for India, however, takes the view that the Indian Budget is unable to bear the cost of their modern-isation, and is even unable to meet the increased future maintenance charges involved in that modernisation, and in the improved conditions of service now to be granted to British officers and men.     The financial and political situation in India is stated to preclude the possibility of increasing the Defence Estimates beyond their present figure of approximately  34 million a year.The Government of India have therefore asked that the Home Government shall come to their assistance by providing both the capital cost of modernisation and the increased future maintenance charges which that modernisation will involve.7.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the other hand, while not entirely ruling out the possibility of making some contribution at the present time towards the capital cost of modernisation, is unable to accept it as a principle of general *or permanent application that, if more than a certain provision cannot be made from India&quot; s own resources, the remaining liability should fall upon the British
taxpayer.      In particular he regards it as completely out of the question that the British taxpayer should he saddled with a permanent liability in respect of fature increased maintenance charges resulting from the modernisation of the Defence Forces in India.8.      In these circumstances the Committee agreed that, before we attempt to determine the incidence of the capital and recurrent costs of modernisation, we should satisfy ourselves as to whether or not it is possible for savings to be made in the existing Indian Defence expenditure which can be set against those costs.The best method of reviewing the existing expenditure would appear to be an examination by a Committee of Inquiry, sent to India for the purpose. We have no doubt that the Government of India would afford such a Committee all necessary assistance.If our proposal is approved we think that the Committee should proceed to India as early as possible, with a view to reporting if practicable by January, 1939.9.     We suggest that the terms of reference and the precise composition of the proposed Committee of Inquiry should be left to us to determine.     We have in mind a composition consisting of an impartial Chairman,  together with representatives of the War Office and Air Ministry.Summary of 10.    To sum up,  our immediate recommendations are asecommendations.followss-(i) That the War Office should be authorisedto arrange for the transfer of four British infantry battalions from the Indian to the British establishment as soon as the necessary barrack accommodation is ready.
According to our present information, accommodation for two of the battalions will be available in April, 1939, and for the other two during the trooping season 1939/40.(ii) That a Committee of Inquiry should proceed to India at an early date to consider and report whether savings can be made in existing Indian Defence expenditure to set against the cost of modernisation of the Defence Forces in India, and in particular to meet increased future maintenance charges involved in that modernisation, and in the improved conditions of service.(iii) That the terms of reference and the precise composition of the proposed Committee of Inquiry should be left to the present Cabinet Committee to determine.Signed on behalf of the committee.W.H.
