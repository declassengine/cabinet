(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT] .COPY No.SECRET.CP.  No.   188/38CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, hy the Government of India,, dated 22nd July, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 22nd July, 1958 issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1. Provincial Ministries.    Nausiier Ali in Bengal(see last appreciation) having, refused to resign alone, the whole Ministry resigned  - the second instance of this procedure, the first being the Assam purge mentioned in the February appreciation. .   The same Ministers (without Nausher Ali) were at once reappointed.    It is too early to estimate the effect of the change on the stability of the Ministry.While discussions continue with Mr. Gandhi and his deputies about the release of &quot;political&quot; prisoners the Ministry pursues its. policy of releasing detenues from time to time.In the Central Provinces the settlement reported in the last appreciation proved to be an uneasy truce.    The correspondence bet-ween the Premier and the recalcitrant Ministers found its way into the Press and revealed sharp differences of policy and temper.      The defects of the Ministry have been trenchantly attached by   Mr. Eaghavendra Rao  (who was headiof the &quot;interim&quot; Ministry) in letters to Mr.  Gandhi.      The tone of these renders unlikely the speculation that, in their search for a more reputable Ministry, the Congress High Command would favour an&apos;invitation to Mr. Raghavendra Rao to take office.      The Congress Working Committee Meeting on 23rd July was to have attempted a fresh solution of the discord in the Ministry;    but the Premier (Dr. Khare) forced the issue on 20th July by tendering to the Governor his resignation and that of his colleaguies.    In this he had the concurrence of two of his colleagues, but not of the other three.
The Governor, having ascertained from three dissentients that they were not prepared to resign, relieved them of their duties;    and at once, in consultation with Dr. Khare, appointed a new Ministry which contains Dr. Khare as Premier, his two supporters in the defunct Council, and two fresh members in place of the three recalcitrant minister so- . -.&apos;&apos;.. The Bi la spur election enquiry drags on.     Since it iscosting ahout Rs. 10,000 a month and at the present rate of progress may well last a year more, there is a growingvolume of opinion in favour of closing it down.aRetrenchment Committees are at work in/number of Provinces: and the Bihar Committee is reported to have made recommendations which inclxide reductions in the salaries of the Governor and High Court Judges and the discontinuance of recruitment to the Secretary of State&apos;s services.The Bombay &quot;prohibition&quot; experiment, which was to have begun on July 20th, was postponed, but is to be introduced very shortly in the Ahmedabad,area,The Madras Government have recently ordered the release of four &quot;political&quot; prisoners who were convicted of violent crimes committed in the Presidency about five years ago.The prisoners belonged to the Punjab and the United Provinces and were serving their sentences in those Provinces. They were the last prisoners of political complexion remaining on the hands of the Madras Governments      But a new class of &quot;political&quot; prisoner is being created in the Province in the attempt to suppress agitation against the compulsory introduction of Hindi in schools.     The agitation has grown in spite of drastic measures taken to repress it -which include a year&apos;s imprisonment for one of the leaders.
9 t ^hi tJ iThe result of the &quot;prohibition&quot; experiment in one district is considered to he such as to justify its extension to two more districts in October nextBThe appointment of an Advisory Committee to assist the North West Frontier Province Ministry seems designed to fetter its freedom.      A&apos;start has been made with &quot;prohibition&quot; in one district in this Province.In Sind a Ministerial crisis has been threatened over the question of rates of assessment in the Lloyd Barrage area, which is one of the Governor&apos;s special responsibilities.      The latest position appears to be that the Ministry have accepted the need for an enhancement of the rates:    The attitude of their supporters has still to be declared,In the United Provinces, the Congress party has been weakened by faction, which threatens danger to the Ministry from the Left-Wing:    but for the moment the Government has gained strength from the settlement of the Cawnpore strike (see below).2.      Provincial Legislatures.    The Bihar Assembly met on June 24th to consider agrarian legislation.     An agreement between due Government and land owners about provisions of the most important Bill broke down, and the House adjourned on the 29th without making any progress.      Shortly afterwards, through the intervention of a member of the Congress Working Committee, agreement was reached, and the Assembly will meet again at the end of this month to proceed with the Bill.The Punjab Assembly commenced a session on June 20th. The Government have embarked on a programme of agrarian legislation designed to benefit the agriculturist and to protect him against the moneylender.
m j 0The urban and money lending classes (mostly Hindus) are protesting strongly against these &quot;black bills&quot;.      The position of Congress Members of the Legislature is awkward, since&apos; they can scarcely express their dislike of proposals not dissimilar to legislation sponsored by Congress Ministries in other Provinces.The Governor of the North West Frontier Province has refused assent to a private Bill which repealed the law of sedition and other &quot;repressive measures&quot; - (see appreciation dated March 20th).3. The Moslem League and Congress.    On June 23rda number of Congress leaders gathered at Wardha to consider the Moslem League1s propositions mentioned in last appreciation, and are believed to have decided that the terms were impossible and left no alternative hut to discont negotiations.      The subject is likely to he taken up at a forthcoming meeting of Congress Working Committee.4. The Congress Party.      Subhas Bose, the CongressPresident, has recently had a good deal to say on the Congress attitude to Federation. &apos;   Excited by a suggestion that Congress would accept the Federal scheme as it had accepted provincial autonomy, he vehemently denies the possibility of any such surrender;    and adds that, should &quot;the unthinkable contingency arise&quot; of a majority of Congress adopting the scheme, he would feel it his duty to resign his office in order to carry on his &quot;unmitigated and unrelenting opposition to the monstrous federal scheme&quot;. This statement has elicited from Mr. Satyamurti, deputy leader of the Congress Party in the Central Assembly, both a rebuke for the threat of splitting Congress and an
5.exposition of the amendments to the scheme which in Mr. Satymurti&apos;s opinion should make it acceptable.The controversy is of interest as showing the dissidence between the Left and Right Wings of Congress on this subject, and some apprehension among the Left Wing that parliamentarians may have their way.Capitalist pressure on Congress policy has always been strong, and there is evidence that it is being exercised to obtain a pronouncement iii favour of reducing the rupee ratio.      The Working Committee is likely to consider the matter at its forthcoming meeting.5.     Labour.    The. Cawnpore strike, after lasting for more than seven weeks, ended on July 5th.     The two main points in the settlement are that the employers have consented to certain wage increases, while Government agreed that the labour union should 5e reorganised before formal recognition is accorded to it.      The union will give a fortnight&apos;s notice of strikes and will oppose all unauthorised strikes.The settlement was effected by the personal intervention of the Premier.      It is a matter for congratulations that violence during the conduct of the strike was almost entirely absent;    and the ministry has certainly gained prestige, both from its handling of the problem of public order and from its success in bringing about an agreement.In Madras Presidency about 2000 workers in Choolai mills (Madras) struck in the middle of June, and a general strike is threatening in Coimbatore.      The strikes in the jute mills in Vizagapatarn District, and in a match factory near Madras continue.In the Central Provinces the general strike which was- to have been begun on July 1st was
:gfg:;:i::;:a:f:laverted at the eleventh hour, on the intervention of a member of the Congress Working Committee,In Bihar the parties in the main disputes have agreed to the appointment by the Government of conciliation boards to investigate their claims.In Bengal, however, the strike .at Edit I has spread to workshops under the same&apos; management at Hirapur,6, Agrarian.    Swami Sahajanand has continued hisextremist agitation inBihar.     Military Police have been drafted to the area where the danger of disorder is greatest. Landlords have had great difficulty in recovering their rents.In Orissa, where left wing activity has been rife, it has been necessary for the Premier to warn tenants in one area that, if they will not pay their rents, landowners will be given police assistance to make clistraints.In the United. Provinces also, the Government have found it necessary to warn tenants again that non-payment of rent will deprive them of the benefits of the forthcoming legislation.7, Misce1laneous,    The official report about therailway accident in Bihar, mentioned in the last appreciation, states that sabotage by the deliberate interference with the track has been established.      The culprits have not yet been traced..8. Economic.    The monsoon is promising.      Conditionsin the scarcity Area in the Madras Presidency are rapidly improving.. Parts of Assam, Bengal&apos;and Sind have been affected by floods.9. Waziristan. The main interest during the month was provided by the activities of the Shami Pir in South
Waziristan.      Tills individual, whose name is Saiyid Muhammad Sadi (alias Sadi el Keilany) a naturalised Turkish subject domiciled in Damascus, arrived in the North West Frontier Province in January 1938.      In March he entered South Waziristan, where he occupied himself in collecting funds for charitable purposes in Syria and in settling tribal feuds among the Mahsuds.    &apos;His activities were carefully watched by the local officials, and appeared to be entirely unobjectionable.On June 13th, at a large gathering of tribesmen at Kaniguram, he declared himself a supporter of ex-King Amanullah, and incited the British tribesmen to join him in an attempt to overthrow the reigning dynasty of Afghanistan on the ground that they were usurpers.      His appeal was based mainly on religious grounds, and aroused such enthusiasm that an invasion of Afghanistan under his direction at one time seemed inevitable.      Such an invasion would have produced an exceedingly dangerous position for the Afghan Government, who were engaged in dealing with serious insurrections among their own tribesmen in various parts of Afghanistan.      The Government of India therefore immediately applied all possible pressure, including threats of force, to restrain their tribesmen from interfering in Afghanistan.      This pressure, combined with an air patrol of the Durand Line, succeeded in detaching some of his followers from The Pir, but large bodies of tribesmen were collected ready to go, and it was only by removing their leader that they were eventually persuaded to disperse to their homes.     As the result of negotiations between the Political Agent and Sharai Pir, the Pir was persuaded to come in on safe conduct, where he agreed to cease his
activities, recall such tribesmen as he had raised for purposes of invasion, and leave India.    He was flown, from Wana to Karachi in an R.A.F. aicraft, and left India for &quot;Damascus by air on July 4th.10. These events, while they lasted, overshadowedthe operations of the Faqir of Ipi and his lieutenants, who fortunately decided not to throw in their lot with the Pir.    They were however by no means inactive in their own sphere,11. As a result of operations in the MamiroghaArea the lashkar dispersed, but by the middle of June another had assembled which attacked &quot;Mamirogha Camp. One Indian Other Hank was killed and 4 were wounded.Next day troops moved out to re-establish the severed water supply;    the R.A.F.. co-operated.      In an engagement about 45 of the enemy (numbering between 250 and 300) are known to have been killed or seriously wounded..     One British Officer and 4 Indian Other Banks were killed, and 20 Indian Other Banks wounded.      Thereafter the lashkar again dispersed to the area around the Boya Datta Khel Eoad, whence they have since made sporadic attempts to harass communications and to attack camps and scouts posts. On July 6th, troops engaged an hostile gang which had attacked a mail lorry on the Razmak Road;    the R.A.F.  again co-operated.      Our casualties were 1 killed and 2 wounded, and   the enemy are known to have suffered several casualties.12. As result, of pressure brought to bear by air onthe Ivladda Khel tribe, in whose country he had been making his headquarters, the Faqir of Ipi moved to the Khars in, (or Kharre) area in the vicinity of the Durand Line just
III -        9&apos;east of the liadda Khel limits.    Here he has concentrated the main &quot;body of his lashlcar, two thirds of which, is compos of Afghan tribesmen.     He is believed to be awaiting the arrival of further reinforcements of Afghan tribesmen before undertaking any further large scale hostile action.13.      Towards the end of June a large gang composed of Kliattaks, Wazirs and. Bannuchis gathered in the hills north and. North-West of Bannu, and. threatened the safety of the Bannu-Kohat Road.     As a result of action by air and mobile troops from Bannu on Jul2r 3rd., this gang was dispersed and the remnants took refuge in the Junijlighar Hills in the Bannu tribal area.&apos; about 12 miles north of Bannu.      In South Waziristan, apart from excitement caused by Shami Pir, the situation has been quiet.A disturbance of the peace is however threatened by the recent return to the Mahsucl &quot;Bahlolzai&quot; country of the hostile leader Slier Ali.
