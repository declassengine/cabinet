At their Meeting on 22nd June,  1938 (Cabinet 29(33)Conclusion 10) the Cabinet agreed inter alia that the Memorandumby the Postmaster-General relating to the operation of RelayServices and Wire Broadcasting (Paper CP. 132(38)) should bereferred in the first instance to the Committee of Imperial defence in order to ascertain to what extent it was safe to utilisewireless broadcasting in time of war, or whether from the pointof view of national defence, it was necessary or desirable toestablish some form of wire relay service.     The Committee ofImperial Defence was requested to report as soon as possible and,in any event, before the Parliamentary Recess.2. At their Meeting on the 23rd June, 1938 (C.I.D. 327thMeeting, Minute l)  the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed thatthe questions referred to them by the Cabinet should be examined by a Sub-Committee, the report of which should be submitted at theearliest possible date, and in any event in time for referenceto the Cabinet before the Recess.     The Prime Minister subsequentlyapproved the inquiry being undertaken by the Cabinet committee on overseas Broadcasting with the addition of the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.3. As it proved impossible in the time available for theCommittee of Imperial Defence to examine this Report before its submission to the Cabinet, we submit our Report direct to the Cabinet, at the same time arranging for copies of it to be circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence.4. We have examined the questions contained in otirterms of reference in consultation with the expert advisers
of the Departments principally concerned..      In addition to the documents which were before the Cabinet on 22nd June, we have had before us departmental memoranda and in particular a Report dated July, 1938 (Paper No.  C.R.T.24) by the Sub-Committee on the Control of Radio Transmission, hereinafter referred to as the Sub-Committee?       This Report, a copy of which is attached as Appendix I, after setting out the position to date and the arguments for and against the adoption of various possible alternative courses of action summarises in paragraphs 28 and 29 the Sub-Committees conclusions and recommendations.5B        At the outset we discussed the first part ofour terms of reference, &quot;namely,  to what extent it wouldbe safe to utilise wireless broadcasting in time of war.Empire Broadcasting from the United Kingdom to the broadcasts.Empire, is carried out on a short wave length, and we are assured by the Sub-Committee   (see paragraph 27 of Appendix I) that, with the technical equipment at present available,  transmissions on such frequencies would not provide any navigational assistance to enemy aircraft approaching or over this country^      The objections summarised in Appendix I to wireless broadcasting on peacetime lines in wartime are applicable to wireless broadcasting on long and medium wave lengths,   and not to such broadcasting on short wave lengths, the continuance of which in wartime could safely be sanctioned, at all events for the present.      Accordingly we recommend that Empire broadcasting from the United Kingdom on short&apos; wave lengths should be allowed to continue in wartime, but that this decision should be kept under close and constant expert review in the light of the development of wireless navigational technique.      In this connection
Broadcasting on long and medium wave lengths for reception primarily within the United Kingdom.we draw attention to the Sub-Co2fuiivGGOT s warning . on this aspect of the question contained in para-graph 28 of Appendix I and reproduced in paragraph21(f) of this Report. The following paragraphs are concerned only with wireles broadcasting on long and medium wave lengths.7o The grave dangers and objections from the active defence aspect to the continuance on the peace-time scale of wireless broadcasting in wartime are conveniently set out in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of appendix I and in paragraph 28 (a)   the Sub-Committee unanimousrecord their/conclusion that the &quot;continuance of broadcasting on the peacetime scale would afford navigational assistance to enemy aircraft of the highest value and would gravely impede our active defence operations&apos;,   whilst in   paragraph 29 (i) they recommend that &quot;wireless broadcasting under the existing peacetime arrangements should be discon-tinued from the first moment of the war, or in the precautionary stage if there are any grounds for expecting enemy air attack before the declaration of war&apos;.8. We are in agreement with these findings ofthe Sub-Commi-ttee -     Accordingly our answer :to the question in the first part of our terms of reference is that wireless broadcasting if maintained under the normal peacetime arrangements   would &quot;be lof great assistance to enemy aircraft and of serious detriment to our own defence measures.9. We now turn to the second part of our termsof reference, namely &apos; or whether, from the point of view of
national defences it is necessary or desirable toestablish some form of wire relay service&apos;010.       The Sub-Committee have reported that the only way toprevent all navigational assistance to enemy aircraft is to close down broadcasting stations for the whole period of thewar, at the same time pointing out that such a coursewould be inconsistent with the minimum essential requirement of the passive defence services.(Appendix I, paragraph 28 (2)).II. We accept this expression of opinion and also thexSub-Committee&apos;s view that the only possible alternatives to the peacetime arrangements are:-I.      Wire Broadcasting.II.      A synchronised scheme for fixed wireless stations on the lines of the B.B.C&apos;s scheme in Annex I to Appendix I. (paras. 19 and 20).III. A scheme which may materialise from the Sub-Committee&apos;s further investigations, (para. 21).12.       Some references are made to the advantages and disadvantages of a national system of wire broadcasting in paragraphs 22 to 25 of Appendix I.      Stated very briefly such a system is technically practicable and is the only system which would completely meet the requirements of both active and passive defence services.     But it would take some years to complete and would be very costly.     There is no likelihood of such a system being extended to a majority of existing wireless recipients  unless the Government provide    the capital cost.     Wireless listeners would be slow to change over to the wire system unless the charges were extremely low.     The scheme would be stronglyx The Sub-Committee reject the possibility of low power unsynchronised mobile stations and a fixed station in Scotland., see paragraphs 15 to 20 inclusive of Appendix I.
opposed by the wireless trade and to some extent by the publico     The scheme would also no doubt arouse considerable political criticism.13o       At our request the Post Office have examined the possibilities of a wire relay service and we attach (Appendix II)  a Memorandum by the Assistant Postmaster General on the subject.      It will be noted that of the 12 million households in the country 8-g million have wireless licences.      Of these 250,000 are subscribers to the wire service of the relay companies, and the remaining 8^: millions use wireless sets       In the view of the Post Office the best substitute for the existing broadcast service would be for the Post Office to. provide a wire broadcasting service for all telephone subscribers and for the Government to encourage- the relay companies to develop as rapidly as possible.If,no charge was made, from 1 to 1^ million telephone subscribers could be given the service within two years at a capital cost not exceeding  64. millions.     At best the relay companies might double their clientele in the same period.In these ways a relay service meeting the needs of the upper and upper middle classes would be available, but the lower middle and poorer classes would be unprovided for. For example 64 million users of wireless sets are not telephone subscribers.      The capital cost of providing a wire relay service for these 6:t millions is estimated at  100jOOO?000 divided between  65s0003000 urban areas and  35,000,000 rural areas,55 The Lord Privy Seal draws   attention to the fact that this particular suggestion would be open to the objection that it conflicts with the recommendations of the Ullswater Committee.
14.       We are satisfied that even if the financial and other grave objections to the institution of a national system of wire broadcasting could be overcomes  such a system could not in any event provide a short-term solution of the problem in view of the considerable period of time which must elapse before a satisfactory relay v^ire service covering the whole country could be completed.      In our view it is of great importance that5 if war broke out before a wire service was fully installed, wireless broadcasting should in some form be available.15*       Accordingly we cannot recommend the adoption of a   national system of wire broadcasting as an immediate or short-term solution of the problem,. We favour however the adoption of the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation in paragraph 25 of Appendix I that the possibility and implications of the introduction in peacetime of such a system on a scale sufficient to justify reliance being placed upon it in time of war should be fully examined from every point of view by some authoritative body.
A. Syn chronisation   16.        The British Broadcasting Cor-Scheme forFixe d S tat ions.     poration!s    synchronisation scheme    forfixed stations in two groups each comprising four stations will he found in Annex I to Appendix I to this Report.     The views of the Sub-Committee in regard to such a scheme are set out in paragraphs 7 to 14 inclusive, and 19 and 20 of that Appendix. In view of the importance of the matter we draw -t.hp special attention of the Cabinet to these paragraphs.17.       The main considerations may be very briefly summarised as followsActive Defence Aspects.(l)    The synchronisation scheme would greatly reduce,&quot;though not entirely eliminate, the navigational assistance to enemy aircraft and the obstruction to active defence operations provided that the stations are closed down on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of the station.(2)    The active Defence Sei^vices think that air attacks necessitating the closing of some of these stations are likely to be so frequent that they may in practice be closed for longer periods in the aggregate than they are open.(3)    The active Defence Services regard the &quot;closing down&apos; condition as essential and, if that condition is fulfilled, they will acquiesce in the adoption of the synchronisation scheme, should the Cabinet decide that some measvLre of broadcasting must be continued in time of war.Passive Defence Aspect-Sa(a)    On the other hand the Home Office view is that to meet the full requirements of passive defence, broadcasting should continue without interruption over the whole country sufficiently to enable all listeners to receive both speech and entertainment programmes and that no permanent arrangement which does not fulfil these conditions can be regarded as satisfactory.
(b)   Failing a full solution as in (a) above,it is essential that means should exist for communicating to the public without interruption at any time Government announcements, bulletins and instructions.(c)    The synchronised service will deterioratein varying degrees over the area covered by a group of stations and there may frequently be occasions on which all broadcasting within the area will completely stop-(d)    The cessation of broadcasting by astation would be recognised by manylisteners as an indication of the presence of enemy aircraft in the vicinity and would be regarded by them also increase the dislocation of business inevitably resulting from the approach of hostile aircraft..as an air raid warning.It wouldWe at t a c h (Ap Ippendix iii) a Memorandum by theHome Secretary in support of the contention that, asthe full requirementsof passive defence can only bemet by allowing 1broadcasting to continue during air raids without interruption over the whole country,the  1 closing down5 condition, which the activeDefence Services regard as essential,  should be abandoned.The Memorandum also emphasises the psychological aspects of the problem and the supreme importance of maintaining the national morale at times of intensive enemy air action.-
Short term and        19.     After giving most careful consideration to Long termPolicies. the whole matter, we have reached the conclusion thatthe best course in present circumstances will be to adopt an interim short term policy covering, say, the next six months.     By so doing provision will be made to meet any sudden emergency that may arise within that period and more time will be provided for the formulation by our expert advisers and the con-sideration by Ministers of a permanent long term policy.Short term policy^ 20.    &apos;We have satisfied ourselves that, if it is decided to continue wireless broadcasting in war-time the only practicable short term policy that can at once be brought into operation is the synchronised scheme of fixed stations in two groups of four stations each, outlined in Annex I to Appendix I.     We accept the view of the active Defence Services that it is essential that a station must close down on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of it. In order, however, to meet as far as possible the requirements of passive defence we have considered a proposal designed to mitigate the disadvantages of closing down.     The proposal is that whenever a station is closed down for a period longer than one hour at a time, it should then be allowed to broadcast short announcements, of about one minute duration, at intermittent intervals.
21.       We invited the Sub-Committee to examine the question whether satisfactory arrangements to this end could, in fact, be devised.     We attach (Appendix IV) a Report, dated today (22nd July), containing the Sub-Committee^ recommendation on this subject which is as follows:-That the Scheme for synchronised stations should be accompanied by a cond.ition authorising, when all stations in a group are closed down, the broadcasting, from all stations in the group, at irregular intervals of announcements of varying length but not exceeding two minutes in duration;    the first announcement not to be made until at least half an hour after the stations have closed down and subsequent announcements at the rate of not more than one per half hour measured from the time of the first announcement.In the opinion of the Air Ministry that Department should be authorised to postpone the issue of an announcement should the circum-stances justify such action.It will be clearly understood that the HomeSecretary&apos;s acceptance of our recommendation in regard tothe short term policy is subject to his being satisfiedthat the arrangements now proposed by the Sub-Committee willmeet the requirements of passive defence while the shortterm policy is in operation,,Long Term        22.       In paragraph 25 of Appendix I the Sub-Committee Policy.point out that wire broadcasting would, seem to provide asolution  of the problem of broadcasting in time of war and that all other alternatives constitute, at best, unsatis-factory compromises.      In these circumstances a thorough investigation of the possibility and implications of developing a system of wire broadcasting to such an extent in peacetime, as would justify complete reliance upon it in war for passive defence purposes, should be undertaken. We recommend that some ad. hoc authox^itative body with an independent Chairman should carry out the inquiry and that their Report should includ.e conclusions and recommendations in regard to the proposals for a service to telephone subscribers, etc. contained in the Memorandum of the Assistant   Postmaster-General, Appendix II to this Report.
23. We also recommend in connection with the longterm policy, that the Bub-Committee should make further inquiry into all other possible alternative solutions, including, as proposed by them in paragraph 21 of Appendix I, the possibilities of (i) 2 or 3 high power synchronised fixed stations situated well away from the vulnerable areas and (ii) high power mobile stations (a) synchronised or (b) unsynchronised, located away from vulnerable areas.24. i/e further recommend that the Home Office and thePost Office,should consider together ways and means of providing, otherwise than by some form of broadcasting, for the requirements of passive defence in connection with the dissemination of Government announcements.Progress in 25. We draw attention to the bub-Committee&apos;sWirelessNavigation. warning in paragraph 28 of Appendix I, that theymay find it necessary at some future date to advise that further restrictions should be placed on transmissions from wireless stations in time of war. in view of the advances which continue to be made in the development of wireless navigational technique and that therefore any solution based on the methods of wireless broadcasting so far considered may prove to have only a passing value and should not be allowed to delay the development of some practicable alternative arrangement of a permanent and more satisfactory character.

June, 1938,Broadcast inpc.&quot;&quot;   &apos; &quot; (Cabinet 29 (38) Conclusion 11) the cabinet referred to the Committee for consideration a Memorandum (CP.  133 (38)) by the Postmaster-General on Sponsored Programmes.    It has not been possible^ in the time available,  for the Committee to investigate this question and they have decided to postpone such investigation until after the Recess when they hope that the Postmaster-General, will be able to resume his attendance at their meetings after his indisposition. Conclusions and 27. Our conclusions and recommendations may besummarised as follows(l) As regards the question to, ;what;, extent - it would be safe to -utilize, wireless broad-castink in time of war.Recommendations,Short wave lengths.Long and medium wave lengths.(a) We recommend that Empire broadcastingfrom the United Kingdom on short wave lengths should be allowed to continue in war time but that this conclusion should be kept under close and constant expert review in the light of the development of wireless navigational technique.(b) We are of opinion that continuance of longand medium wave length broadcasting on the peace-time scale would afford navigational assistance to enemy air-craft of the highest value and would gravely impede our active defence operations.    Accordingly we endorse the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendation that wireless broadcasting on long and medium wave lengths under the existing peacetime arrangements should be discontinued from the first moment of the war or in the.precautionary stage if there are grounds for expecting enemy air attack before the declaration of war0
As regards the quest ion &apos; or whether, from, the point of view of,^natipnal^defence,  it isnecessary pr^plesirable tp- establish some form of     wire.......n relay^service&apos;.(a) We think that  to close down allbroadcasting stations for the whole period of the war as the only sure and effective way of denying all navigational aid.to enemy aircraft would be inconsistent with the minimum essential requirements of the passive defence services.(b) We recommend the adoption in presentcircumstances of a short-term policy . coverings  sayr, the next six months. By so doing provision will be made to meet any sudden emergency that may arise within that period and more time will be provided for the formulation by.the experts and the consideration by Ministers of a permanent long-term policy,(c) Assuming that it is decided not to discontinue altogether wireless broadcasting in war-time we are satisfied that the only practicable short-term policy that can at once be brought Snto operation is the synchronised scheme of fixed stations in the two groups of four stations each outlined in Annex I to Appendix I. We recommend the adoption of that scheme, which can be brought into existence in 48 hours, as a short-term expedient but subject to the condition that a station must close down on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of it. To this condition must in the interests of passive defence be added the stipulation authorisings when all stations in a group are closed   down, the broadcasting   from all    stations in the group    at irregular intervals of announcements of varying length but not exceeding two minutes in duration;    the first announcement not to be made until at least half an hour after the stations have closed down and subsequent announcements at the rate of not more than one per half hour measured from the time of the first anno unc emen t.In the opinion of the Air Ministry that department should be authorised to postpone the issue of an announcement should the circumstances justify such action,

BROADCASTING IN TIME OF WAR.REPORT.ON the 23rd July, 1936, the Sub-Committee submitted a report* to the Committee of Imperial Defence recommending, inter alia, the closing down of certain radio stations, for the period of an air raid, which would involve the cessation of all broadcasting during such periods. If this condition was unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government, three alternative courses were suggested : &quot; (i) The issue of short announcements during a raid for the guidance of the public. This would preclude the transmission of any entertainment programme.(ii) The adoption of a scheme of synchronised stations prepared by the British Broadcasting Corporation working in groups, which would allow the continuance of entertainment programmes covering the majority of populous areas, (iii) A combination of (i) and (ii).&quot;2. The Committee of Imperial Defence considered this report at its 281st Meeting on the 30th July, 1936, and recorded the following decisions : &quot; (a) That the decision as to whether or not broadcasting should continue in war, and if so to what extent, was one to be taken by the Government of the day as and when an emergency arose. (&amp;) That preparations should be made on the assumption that broadcasting would continue in time of war and consequently that one of the following courses would be adopted : (i) The adoption of a system under which broadcasting is limited to short announcements during an air raid for the guidance of the public in safety measures.(ii) The adoption of a system of synchronisation.   This method would permit the continuance of entertainment programmes in the majority of thickly populated areas.(iii) A combination of (i) and (ii) by which it would be possible to achieve a reasonable measure of security whilst allowing enter-tainment programmes to be continued except during the actual progress of a raid.&quot;3. At its 327th Meeting on the 23rd June, 1938, the Committee of Imperial Defence considered a reference from the Cabinet concerning the extent to which it was safe to utilize wireless broadcasting in time of war, or whether, from the point of view of national defence, it was necessary or desirable to establish some form of Wire Relay Service. The Committee referred the question to a special Ministerial Committee, which, at its first meeting on the 6th July, agreed : &quot; That the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Control of Radio Transmission in Time of War should be invited to report as soon as possible on the question of how far, in their view, a synchronised system of broadcasting would provide a satisfactory alternative to the existing arrangements.&quot;4. The Committee also requested the Sub-Committee on Control of Radio Transmission in Time of War to report on the navigational assistance, if any, rendered to the enemy by the Empire broadcasts from Daventry.5. Following the decision of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th July, 1936, the Sub-Committee appointed a Technical Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of the Director of Signals, Air Ministry with representatives from the Home Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation to study in further detail the Corporation^ synchronised scheme and to report how far it met or, by modifications, could be made to meet the requirements both of the Home Office and the Defence Services, and whether other measures could be devised to fulfil the necessary conditions.[17580]* C.I.D. Paper No. 235-A.
6. The Technical Inter-departmental Committee has considered various modifications and alternatives to the original scheme submitted by the British Broadcasting Corporation. So far as wireless broadcasting is concerned, the following alternatives call for special comment: (A) The   Corporation^   synchronisation   scheme,   set  out   originally   inAppendix A of C.I.D. Paper No. 235-A, and subsequently modified. The latest version is described in Annex I to this Report.(B) Low-power unsynchronised Mobile Stations.(C) A fixed station in Scotland transmitting at night.None of these alternatives fully satisfy the requirements of both the Home Office and the Defence Services. The only known solution which would do this is to be found in some form of wire broadcasting which reaches all or nearly all existing wireless listeners.(A) Synchronisation. Scheme for Fixed Stations.Active Defence Aspects.7. The Air Ministry have worked out in detail the errors in direction-finding which are to be expected in different areas over the British Isles and their surrounding seas, in the event of the adoption of a scheme, of synchronised fixed stations. The results of these computations are shown on the charts reproduced as Annexes II and IIa, and indicate clearly that there are avenues of approach from overseas to the different broadcasting stations in which direction-finding errors are small and along which &apos;&apos; homing&apos;&apos; to the stations could be readily effected. Moreover, in an area within approximately 40 to 50 miles from any station errors are so small that an enemy aircraft could fix its position accurately (i.e., within a mile) and thus navigate to its objective. Enemy aircraft will be able by dead reckoning, to approach an objective with an error of the order of&apos; 20/30 miles. They could thus enter the area surrounding a station unseen in bad weather in or above the clouds, and then obtain their exact position by reference to the transmitting station before coming out of the clouds to attack their target. Although they could not conceal their presence from our defensive organisation they would be able to avoid contact with, our anti-aircraft active defence measures.8. A further important consideration in regard to this scheme is that the transmitting stations are practically all situated within or adjacent to important centres of population and industry, so that they would be of particular advantage to the enemy. Not only are these areas specially vulnerable, but it is around them that the main efforts of the Defence Forces will be concentrated. These will be frustrated if the enemy is provided Avith means of progressing towards his objective whilst remaining out of sight.9. It follows, therefore, that from the point of view of the active Defence Services it is essential that stations under a synchronised scheme should close down before enemy aircraft approach within 50 miles of them. Failure to do so will give the enemy positive advantages both by assisting his.navigation and by impeding anti-aircraft defence. The active Defence Services consider that air attacks necessitating the closing of some of these stations are likely to be so frequent that they may in practice be closed for longer periods than they are open. On the other hand, if the condition in regard to closing down is fulfilled, the active Defence Services would be prepared to acquiesce in the adoption of this scheme if it was decided that some measure of broadcasting must be continued in time of war.Passive Defence Aspects.10. The Home Office consider that, to meet the full requirements of passive defence, broadcasting should continue without interruption over the whole country sufficiently to enable all listeners to receive both speech and entertainment programmes, and that no permanent arrangement which does not fulfil these conditions can be regarded as satisfactory. In fact the closer that wartime broadcasting can approximate to the peace time system, both in quality and duratioa, the better from the passive defence point of view.   Pending a solution
of the problem which will give this result, the Home Office hold the view that the essential minimum requirements of passive defence entail the ability to issue to the public without interruption at any time Government announcements, official bulletins and instructions, i.e., speech broadcasts, capable of reception over the whole country.11. Reception depends on a number of factors outside the control of the transmitting authority, such as atmospheric conditions and the nature and type of the receiving apparatus, but maps have been prepared, attached to this Report as Annexes III and III A, which show the areas by day and night where transmission would normally be of sufficiently high standard to allow the reception of entertainment programmes. It will be seen that there are large areas of the country, including Nottinghamshire, Northampton, Portsmouth and Southampton and the South Coast, where it would be impossible to provide this standard, though reception of intelligible speech would be possible.12. Moreover, if stations are to be closed down as soon as enemy aircraft approach within 50 miles of them, reception over large areas of the country will be affected. Whilst reception will in general be possible from other stations in the group which are still broadcasting, the standard of service will deteriorate in varying degree over the whole of the area covered by the closed-down station, though not below the level of just intelligible speech. The deterioration would be less marked during darkness than daylight. If enemy aircraft were to be within 50 miles of the three out of the four stations in a group simultaneously, it would necessitate the closing of the remaining station and the complete cessation of broadcasting in the areas covered by the group, since the continuation of broad-casting from one station alone would afford assistance to the enemy. The pro-bability that some of the transmitting stations will have to remain closed for considerable periods has already been referred to in paragraph 8 above.13. But, in the opinion of the Home Office, there is a further grave difficulty arising from the pi*oposed closing down of stations on the approach of enemy aircraft, apart from the need to continue broadcasting throughout an air raid for morale and instructional purposes. The system of air raid warnings devised by the Home Office has been designed to limit the period of action warning for the general public to not more than five minutes in order to limit, as far as possible, the area over which such a warning has to be given and to avoid, to the greatest possible extent, unnecessary warnings, with their resultant interruption of industrial output and general dislocation of activities necessary for the conduct of the war. The cessation of broadcasting by one of the synchronised stations would be recognised by many listeners as an indication of the presence of enemy aircraft in the vicinity, and would inevitably be regarded by them as an air raid warning. This closing down would have to take place at least 15 minutes before the raiders reached the station, and would thus not only greatly increase the number of unnecessary warnings, but spread the consequential dislocation of business over much larger areas.14. It will be seen, therefore, that the synchronisation scheme of fixed stations, accompanied by a closing down condition, carries with it disadvantages from the point of view of passive defence, and falls short of the minimum require-ments of the Home Office. Without that condition the Home Office would be prepared to accept it as a solution.(B) Low-Power TJnsynchronised Mobile Stations.15. The second alternative submitted by the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion is for the use of mobile transmitters having a power varying between 2 and 5 kilowatts and situated at, say, 10-15 miles from any probable air raid objective. The Corporation considers that, if these stations change frequency and situation at least once a day, they would be of no value to the enemy, since, although aircraft could take bearings on the stations, they would not know the situation of the station. In the view of the Air Ministry, hoAvever, knowledge regarding site, frequency and power would be available to the enemy, since the Intelligence Services in enemy countries would maintain Direction-Finding
stations continuously on watch, which would be able to obtain this information for the use of their pilots. There are two ways in which the enemy can utilise these Broadcasting Stations : the first is for the enemy ground organisation to fix the position of the station and then inform their pilots, and the other is for the navigator in the enemy aircraft to fix his position when crossing the coast, then take a series of bearings on the given Transmitting Station, thereby fixing its position, and thereafter to use it to enable him to navigate accurately to his objective whilst flying in clouds and avoiding our defences. Closing of the stations during a raid would, therefore, be essential, from the active defence point of view.16. The Home Office would not, however, be prepared to accept this arrangement, in view of the suspension of broadcasting during air raids. Moreover, reception of intelligible speech would be restricted to a greater extent than under the scheme for synchronised fixed stations, and this is an additional reason for the rejection of the scheme by the Home Office.(C) A Scottish Station Transmitting at Night.17. The third alternative is the possibility of using a station in Scotland during the hours of darkness. The existing transmitter at Burghead (near Inverness) could be adapted for this purpose. It is a high-power station working on a medium wave. During the day the British Broadcasting-Corporation consider that it would not be able to extend its range beyond the north of England, although it might prove fairly satisfactory at night. Bearings obtained on such a station by aircraft operating by night over England and the industrial area of Scotland would, in the present stage of development, be of insufficient accuracy to enable the pilot to find definite objectives in these areas. Transmission would therefore have to be restricted to night periods. At this time, however, the general public would be in their homes, and the best service could be given from the station. It would enable Government messages, announcements and propaganda to be broadcast regularly at night, but in the case of some listeners in industrial areas it is doubtful whether reception would reach the standard of intelligible speech.18. The Home Office reject the use of Burghead as a solution in view of the restriction of its operation to night working and doubtful efficiency. Moreover, the active Defence Services cannot accept continuous working even at night in view of the probable Fleet Bases at Scapa Flow and Invergordon, which are within the area in which valuable navigational assistance would be given if the station was transmitting continuously.Summary of Schemes (A), (B) and (C).19. Of the three schemes so far discussed it will be seen that two of them  Low-Power Mobile unsynchronised stations and the Scottish Station must be regarded as quite unsuitable as a means of meeting the requirements of passive defence without helping the enemy either by assisting navigation or by impeding active defence. The nearest approach to the Home Office requirements is provided by the scheme of synchronised fixed stations which is accepted by the active Defence Services if accompanied by a closing down condition when the enemy are within 50 miles of the stations. This scheme gives reception of enter-tainment quality over the bulk of the more populous areas and of intelligible speech quality over virtually the whole country. When enemy aircraft are within 50 miles of one station in a group, reception of not below the level of just intelligible speech will still be available over practically the whole country. Only when enemy aircraft are simultaneously within 50 miles of two stations or more in each group will substantially large areas of the country be totally unable to receive speech broadcasts, and total cessation of reception will only materialise when enemy aircraft are within the^ critical range of three stations in each group.  This scheme can be put into force within 48 hours&apos; notice.20. If wireless broadcasting in time of war is to continue, we recommend  the Home Office representative dissenting the adoption of this scheme for the
immediate future as being the nearest approach, in the light of the investigations we have so far been able to make, towards meeting the minimum requirements of passive defence which is practicable without giving direct navigational assistance to the enemy and handicapping the active defence measures. The Home Office representative feels unable to accept this recommendation for the reasons set out in paragraphs 10 to 13 above.Further Investigations by the Sub-Committee.&apos; 21. The Sub-Committee propose to continue their enquiries into possible means of solving the problem of the conflicting interests of passive and active defence, and they have in view investigations into, inter alia, the following possibilities : (i) 2 or 3 high power synchronised fixed stations situated well away from vulnerable areas.(ii) High power mobile stations (a) synchronised or (b) unsynchronised, located away from vulnerable areas.These investigations must necessarily take some time to complete, and the schemes, even if adopted, could not come into effect until after a further lapse of at least one year to allow for the construction and delivery of plant. Even if they prove more satisfactory than the proposed scheme of synchronised fixed stations, they cannot be regarded as providing an early alternative to it. Moreover, neither of them is likely to lead to a solution which will fully meet the present requirements of both the passive and active Defence Services.:    &quot;N,.- :--N /-&apos;&apos;-Wire Broadcasting.22. From the foregoing it will be seen that none of the schemes so far examined or in prospect reconciles both aspects of defence. There is, however, another alternative which is mentioned in the reference by the Cabinet to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 23rd June last, recorded in paragraph 3 above, namely, wire broadcasting. We had already given this question some consideration.23. There is no doubt that wire broadcasting by a number of alternative methods has passed through the experimental stages and has become a practicable proposition. In some respects in peace-time it offers considerable advantages over a wireless broadcasting system, e.g., in ease of operation, and, in many cases, efficiency of reception. In certain urban parts of the country it is already being operated on a satisfactory commercial basis. It enables continuous broadcasting to be carried out without in any way assisting the enemy or impeding the active defence services. The adoption of this alternative would, when the system has been installed on a sufficiently widespread scale, meet the requirements of both the Home Office and the Defence Services, and would be welcomed by both.24. On the other hand, the installation of this system will take some years to complete even for the populous centres, whilst its extension to the less populated areas may present some difficult problems. The capital outlay involved is bound to be very large, though, having regard to the results of the systems at present in operation, there seems good reason to suppose that a great part of the outlay should prove remunerative, if the present scales of charges were maintained and the service were confined to the most favourable areas. If, however, it is desired to convert the great majority of listeners to the system, low charges would be essential and the service would have to be extended to unremunerative areas. It would, of course, result in somewhat drastic changes in broadcasting reception and great opposition would doubtless be encountered from the wireless trade, other interested authorities, and, to some extent, from the general public.25. We recognise that the implications of any such system on the technique, practice and development of broadcasting would be very far-reaching. Neverthe-less, since it apparently p solution to the problem of broadcasting in timeof war and since all other alternatives constitute at best unsatisfactory com-
promises, we think that a thorough investigation of the possibility and implications of developing a system of wire broadcasting to such an extent in peace-time as would justify complete reliance upon it in war for passive defence purposes, should be carried out by some authoritative body, before it is rejected as a long-term solution of the war-time problem.Arrangements in France and Germany.26. As regards the practice of foreign countries in relation to broadcasting in time of war, it is understood that the German Government propose to install a widespread system of wire broadcasting. The ostensible object is to prevent the German people from being accessible to the influences of foreign propaganda, but there can be no doubt also that it is a war measure which will enable the German authorities to keep control of their population whilst making it possible for them to close down any broadcasting stations which might be of value to enemy aircraft. Further, it has been ascertained, through the Air Attache in Paris, that the French Government in the event of war envisage : (a) Closing down all transmission north and east of a line followingapproximately the course of the Loire.(b) Positioning of transmitters away from all populated areas and from allcentres which are of military value.(c) An organisation for closing all wireless stations likely to be of use fordirection finding to enemy formations in times of emergency.It will be observed that the arrangements in these countries are in line with those now recommended by the Sub-Committee.Empire Broadcasts.27. With reference to the specific enquiry by the Ministerial Committee we report that these broadcasts are carried out on a short wave length, and that, with the technical equipment at present available, transmissions on such frequencies would not provide any navigational assistance to enemy aircraft approaching or over this country.Progress in Wireless Navigation.28. In this connection, however, we think it right to point out that advances continue to be made in the development of wireless navigational technique. The Sub-Committee has this progress continuously under review, and it may be found necessary at some future date to advise that further restrictions should be placed on transmissions from wireless stations in view of this progress. A solution based, therefore, on the methods of wireless broadcasting so far considered may prove to be temporary only and should not be allowed to delay the development of some permanent alternative arrangement of a more satisfactory character.Conclusions.29.   The conclusions of the Sub-Committee can be summarised as follows :  (a) Continuance of broadcasting on the peace-time scale would afford navigational assistance to enemy aircraft of the highest value and would gravely impede our active defence operations.(&amp;) The only way to prevent all navigational assistance to enemy aircraft is to close down broadcasting stations for the whole period of the war. Such a course would, however, be inconsistent with the minimum essential requirements of the passive defence services.(c) A scheme of fixed synchronised transmitting stations operating in two groups would greatly reduce, though not entirely eliminate, the navigational assistance to the enemy and the obstruction to active defence operations provided that the stations were closed down on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of the station (para-graphs 7-9).
[17580]c?(d) The plosing down of stations on the approach of enemy aircraft will leadto a reduction in the quality of reception over large areas of the country, though not to below the standard of just intelligible speech. If 3 out of the 4 stations in a group have to close, the fourth must do so, and there will be a complete cessation of reception over large areas. Closing down will conflict with the arrangements for issuing air raid warnings and augment the dislocation of business inevitably resulting from the approach of hostile aircraft. For these reasons, the Home Office do not consider the scheme adequate (paragraphs 10-14).(e) Low power unsynchronised mobile stations would require to be closed down on the approach of enemy aircraft and the areas of reception of intelligible speech would be more restricted than under the scheme for synchronised fixed stations (paragraphs 15 and 16). (/) A powerful station at Burghead in Scotland operating at night would provide a regular medium for the broadcasting of Government messages and propaganda; but the restriction to night working renders it unacceptable to the Home Office and its proximity to Naval Bases would make it necessary to close down on the approach of enemy aircraft (paragraphs 17 and 18).(g) Other possible measures to be investigated include (i) 2 or 3 high powersynchronised fixed stations away from vulnerable areas, or (ii) high power mobile stations, (a) synchronised, or (b) unsynchronised, away from vulnerable areas. But none of these schemes is likely to reconcile in full the conflicting interests of active and passive defence (paragraph 21).(h) A system of broadcasting by wire is technically practicable and is theonly system which would completely meet the requirements of both active and passive defence services. But it would take some years to complete, and would involve the outlay of a very large sum of money. Wireless listeners would be slow to change over to the wire system unless the charges were extremely low. The scheme would be strongly opposed by the wireless trade, and to some extent by the public (paragraphs 22-25).(i) French and German plans are understood to provide for drastic curtail-ment of wireless broadcasting, whilst in Germany some form of wire broadcasting is being developed (paragraph 26). (;) The short wave Empire Broadcasts do not at present give any naviga-tional assistance to enemy aircraft in the vicinity of this country (paragraph 27).(k) Progress in Wireless Navigational Technique in aircraft is still being made and is under constant review by the Sub-Committee. It may therefore be found necessary in the future to recommend further restrictions on transmissions from Wireless stations (paragraph 28).Recommendations. 30.   The Sub-Committee makes the following i^recommendations : (i) Wireless broadcasting under  the existing peace-time  arrangements should be discontinued from the first moment of the war. or in the precautionary stage if there are any grounds for expecting enemy air attack before the declaration of war.(ii) Since a system of wire broadcasting would meet the requirements ofboth the active and passive defence services, the possibility and implications of its introduction in peace on a scale sufficient to rely on it exclusively in time of war should be considered by an authoritative body before it is rejected as a long-term solution of the problem.(iii) Further enquiry should be made by the Sub-Committee into possible alternative measures to the scheme of synchronised stations outlined in Annex I, including the use of (i) 2 or 3 high-power synchronised fixed stations, situated away from vulnerable areas, or (ii) high-power mobile stations, (a) synchronised or (b) unsynchronised. located away from vulnerable areas.
(iv) As an immediate measure,* the system of synchronised fixed stations outlined in Annex I should be adopted in time of war (if wireless broadcasting is to be continued), on condition that a station closes down on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of it, until some other scheme, possibly materialising from the investigations under recommendations (ii) and (iii) above, is approved to replace it.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :C.

W. 1, July 18, 1938.* The Home Office representative is unable to agree to this recommendation for the reasons set out in paragraphs 10-13.ANNEX I.THE synchronised scheme on which the charts and maps attached to this report are based consists of two groups each of four stations as follows : Northern Burghhead (near Elgin). Westerglen (near Falkirk). Lisnagarvey (N. Ireland). Stagsnaw (near Newcastle).Southern Moorside Edge (near Huddersfield). Droitwich (near Birmingham). Washford (near Minehead). Brookman&apos;s Park (North London).2. The northern group will work on a wave-length pf 391-1 metres (767 Kc/s) and the southern on 449-1 metres (668 Kc/s), both groups using what is known as the synchronised method.3. The above arrangements represent a considerable modification of the scheme set out in Appendix A of C.I.D. Paper No. 235-A, and result from an examination of the original scheme with a view to ensuring that broadcast programmes would be received in as large an area as possible whilst reducing to a minimum the area around each transmitter inside which direction-finding apparatus would give a bearing on the transmitter of sufficient accuracy to assist navigation.

APPENDIX 11^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET. COPY NO.  _-A.B.G. (37)  20,CABINET. COMMITTEE ON OVERSEAS BROADCASTING. MEMORANDUM BY THE ASSISTANT POSTMASTER GENERAL.(l) It is obvious that it is not possible to create a national system of wire broadcasting within the space of a few months;    and it is suggested that the needs of the immediate future must be met, if they are to T&quot;.e met at all, by some system of wireless transmission.      It is the view of the Post Office that the Burghead proposal would 13.01 meet those needs, but that a tolerable service could lie provided at no great risk &quot;by a system of synchronised wireless .    ;transmission from grouped stations.      The service so given would admittedly be defective in certain respects and, on the assumption that the entire elimination of wireless transmission is the ultimate desideratum, it is clear that steps should be taken as speedily as possible first to supplement it and ultimately to supersede it - in part if not in whole - by a system of wire broadcasting,,      The suggestions which follow are directed to that end but, however great their efficacy and however rapidly they are applied, the problem of providing for the immediate future remains and calls for a separate solution whether synchronised wireless transmission be that solution or notaWp..?..^.  a dp a s t i.ng c(2) It is understood that there are about 12 million households in this country;    and in the case of some 8-g-millions Q. (0)926/38.
millions of them wireless licences are held.     A quarter of a million of the licensees are subscribers to the wire service of the relay companies, while the remainixig 8^ millions use wireless sets.     The question at issue is. how to provide a wire service quickly to that remainder or a substantial proportion of it.(3) It is suggested that the desired result can best be attained by the Post Office undertaking to provide a wire broadcasting service to all telephone subscribers who are willing to avail themselves of it and by the Government encouraging the relay exchange companies to develop as rapidly as possible.Service to Telephone Subscribers.(4) The Post Office could arrange for the transmission of broadcast programmes by carrier frequency over the telephone network where the subscriber has a wireless set.     This could be done without interference with the telephone or the wireless service.     Calls could be made and answered by a subscriber while other members of his household were listening to a broadcast programme over the same line, and there would be no deterioration in the efficiency of the wireless set if used in the ordinary.way.     The capital cost to the Post Office of carrying out the scheme would be of the order of  4 to  5 per subscriber.(5) There are about one million residential telephone subscribers and about 700,000 business subscribers.      Some 85 per cent of these subscribers are located in urban districts and about 15 per cent in rural areas.      It is thought that, if the service were given without extra charge, from 1 to 1^ million subscribers would wish to avail themselves of it.     It eould be provided to auch subscribers within about two years at a capital cost of the order of four to six and a quarter million pounds.f6)
(6) If a commercial charge were made for the service progress would he very much slower.      Subscribers wo\ild have to &quot;be canvassed, and it is difficult to say what proportion of them would adopt the system immediately or eventually.      If rapid progress is imperative the service must be provided free to the public as an additional amenity of the telephone service;    and special arrangements would &quot;be necessary to relieve Post Office finance of the cost of what would be in effect a war measure. That cost would at the outset be of the order of. l to  1.10,0 per annum per line,(7) If the Post Office undertook this task ordinary telephone work would have tc be set aside to some extent and there would inevitably be some impairment of the efficiency of the service,.(8) Priority could, if desired, be given to London, Birmingham and other large cities where the risk of air attack is most serious, or where conditions are otherwise unfavourable for wireless reception under an emergency scheme of synchronised broadcasting.      The numbers of telephone subscribers in the case of certain of the localities in question are set out below:-	Locality.	Business Subscribers,	1       Residential Subscribers,*	London	190,000	381,870	Birmingham	26,380	36,300	Liverpool	23,480	35,220	Manchester	31,130	32,150*	Bristol	6,400	11,140*	Leeds	12,530	13,030*	Bradford	13,140	17,880	Sheffield	9,600	13,600	Southampton	&apos;6,200	5, 500*	Portsmouth	2,670	5,700*	Plymouth	2,580	4,070*	Newcastle	10,000	11,430	TOTAL	331,110	572,890&apos;   In the localities marked with an asterisk relay exchange systems have been established covering part, at any rate, of the area.
(6) If a commercial charge were made for the service progress would be very much slower.      Subscribers would have to be canvassed, and it is difficult to say what proportion of them would adopt the system immediately or eventually.      If rapid progress is imperative the service must be provided free to the public as an additional amenity of the telephone service;    and special arrangements would &quot;be necessary to relieve Post Office finance of the cost of what would be in effect a war measure. That cost would at the outset be of the order of  1 to  1.10.0 per annum per line.(7) If the Pest Office undertook this task ordinary telephone work would have tc be. set aside to some extent and there wouii.&apos; inevitably be some impairment of the efficiency of the service,,(8) Priority could, if desired, be given to London, Birmingham and other large cities where the risk of air attack is most serious, or where conditions are otherwise unfavourable for wireless reception under an emergency scheme of synchronised broadcastingc      The numbers of telephone subscribers in the case of certain of the localities in question are set out below:-Locality.		Business Subscribers,	Residential Subscribers.*	London	190,000	381,870	Birmingham	26,380	36,300	Liverpool	23,480	35,220	Manchester	31,130	32,150*	Bristol	6,400	11,140*	Leeds	12,530	13,030*	Bradford	13,140	17,880	Sheffield	9,600	13,600	Southampton	3,200	5,500*	Portsmouth	2,670	5,700*	Plymouth	2,580	4,070*	Newcastle	10,000	11,430	TOTAL	331,110	572,890*   In the localities marked with an asterisk relay exchange systems have been established covering part, at any rate, of the area.
If it were decided that a service must be provided as speeaily as possible in these and similar places - without regard to the public convenience in the matter of ordinary telephone provision - such a service could be provided to the great bulk of the existing subscribers in about 12 months from the date on which authority to proceed is given,(9)    If the Government so desired it would be possible, when telephone subscribers had been catered for, to extend the system to non-telephone subscribers by linking up their wireless sets to a telephone line which serves a neighbours house.    Five non-telephone subscribers, on the average,  could be. served by means of each subscribers line.    The additional capital cost would be of the order of  2.15.0. per wireless set connected.    Maintenance charges would be a more serious consideration, but the service could be provided at a reasonable price - say of the order of  1 to  1.10.0. per annum - and might make some appeal.    Canvassing could proceed while the work of connecting telephone subscribers was in hand, and it might well prove that a broadcasting service could be provided to \ to -5- a million additional homes in this way.     It would, however, probably be possible to increase this figure to a million or even more if the price was reduced to 10/-or thereabouts and the balance defrayed from Defence funds. Action on these lines would be in keeping with what is proposed in the case oi telephone subscribers.Relay Companies1 Services.(10) There are at present 327 relay exchange systems serving about a quarter of a million subscribers.    The Government decided in 1936 that the companies&apos; licences should be extended to the end of 1939, when the Post Office would have power, if the Government so desired, to take over the services on &quot;tramway terms&quot;.    During the last two years the companies have naturally refrained from incurring any appreciable capital expenditure onthe
the development of their services, and the number of subscribers has remained practically stationary.(11) There can be little doubt that if the Government extended the existing licences for a minimum period of, say, ten j years - i.e., to the 31st December, 1949 - and was prepared to issue licences for new exchanges valid up to the same date, the companies would develop the service    energetically, especially during the earlier years of the extended period.    Development would be stimulated by the announcement of the Government that i time of war wireless broadcasting would have to be drastically reduced or even closed down altogether, whereas service by wire would continue.    The rate of growth would depend on many factors - scale of charges,  intensity of canvassing, local conditions and so on;    but it seems safe to assume that the companies1 subscribers would be increased during a period of two years from a quarter of a million to,  say, half a million.    If more than -this is essential, it. would be necessary to subsidise the relay companies.    Their normal charge is l/6d.  a week, and a subsidy to be effective would have to be of the order of 6d. a week, or  1.6.0.  a year per subscriber.(IS) If licences were extended for ten years it would be necessary to reconsider the conditions on which they are granted, and certain points which will inevitably arise in this connectiox are referred to in the accompanying Appendix A.Gonclusi on.(13) It is estimated that under the scheme outlined above some 2 million wireless licensees out of a total of 8-g- millions might be served by wire at the end of 2 years or soon thereafter, viz.,(a) 1 to \\ million by telephone direct  (free of charge);(b ) \ to -g- million by linking up non-telephone subscribers to the telephone network (at a charge.of  1 to  1.10.0. a year);and(o)
(c)    -g- million by the relay companies (at their normal charges).The net cost to the  Exchequer would be of the order of1-g- million pounds per annum.    If the services referred to inScheme B. (b) and (c) were subsidised, the total of 2 millions might wellbe increased by a further million or more at an additional costof about one million pounds per annum.(14) It is the view of the Post Office that, accepting theassumption referred to in paragraph (1), one or other of these alternatives would give better results than could be obtained inany other way and that the service so provided would meet theneeds of the case so far as upper and upper middle class areas are concerned.    It^might not, however,  suffice as a permanent solution in the case of lower middle class and poorer districts where the proportion of telephone subscribers is low.    Athoroughly satisfactory service could only be secured in suchdistricts by extending relay exchange user;    and it is suggestedthat if,  after the end of the 2 years period, the relay companies&apos; clientele does not materially exceed the -g- millionreferred to above, consideration should be given to thedevelopment of the relay exchange system by the Post Office inthose areas in which the companies are not operating, preferencebeing given to populous districts in the danger zone.    A roughanalysis of the incidence between urban and rural areas of thetotal capital cost of wire broadcasting schemes is given inAppendix B.(15) The Post Office feels constrained to reiterate that the proposals set out above are based on the assumption that the entire elimination of wireless broadcasting in war time is the desideratum.    It is not, however, clear from the arguments hitherto advanced why the situation could not be sufficiently Scheme C. well met by erecting two or three powerful long wave wireless stations, located at a distance of over 50 miles from any vitalcentre -
IllGSN3RAL POST 0FFIC3. 15 July,  1938.centre - say in the Grampians,  the Quantocks and the Isle of Man - and operating on one wave length.    They would take about two years to build and the cost of erection would be  100,000 to  150,000 per station.    If this solution, which is on similar lines to that contemplated by the French Government, proved feasible, the Post Office would suggest that the interim programme outlined in the earlier paragraphs of this memorandum should be adhered to, save in one important particular, viz., the suggestion to give subscribers broadcasting facilities free or partially free.    It would be proposed to offer these facilities at an economic rate, say, at a charge of  1 or  1,10.0. per annum.    The advantages, financial and political, of such a modification of the scheme - which would avoid subsidising a service given to the well-to-do members of the community - are palpable.    Its disadvantage   is that the number of persons to whom the wire broadcasting service would be afforded during the interim period would be substantially reduced.(Initialled) W.W.
APPENDIX   A.Special points arising in connection with extension of Relay Companies&apos; licences.(a) Emergency.   The existing emergency clause should he expanded to provide not only that the Government should have complete control of the services in time of emergency hut also that the service could be linked up by Post office lines and used jointly as a national network during an emergency.(b) Programmes. The present licences provide that at least two programmes should be distributed, of which one should always be a B.B.C. programme when available.    In practice, however, a number of small exchanges have been allowed to continue with one programme only.    The extended licences might provide - at any rate for new exchanges - that two B.B.C. programmes (National and Regional) should always be given when available.    The Post Office telephone relay system would supply at least two programmes.(c) Purchase by Government.    The existing provision that the service may be taken over by the Post Office if so desired on &quot;tramway terms&quot; at the end of the licence period should presumably be applied to the extended licences.(d) Finance.    The question arises whether the companies should make any payment for their user of the B.B.C. programmes. Alternatively it is a matter for consideration whether the grant of free user could or should be made a ground for insisting on low charges and controlled profits.
APPWDIi.   B.The best - estimate that oar; be made by the Post Office of the incidence between Urban and Rural areas of the total capital cost of schemes for serving 8,000,000 subscribers  (excluding -g- million on Relay exchanges) by wire broadcasting is as indicated belowTotalType of Service, Capital Post,It- million Telephone Subscribers 6,250,000jt million Won-Telephone Subscriberslinked to telephone network 1,375,000Be-lance of 6-\- millions to be served by Audio System 100,000,000Total         107,625,000or say,     100,000,000The distribution of telephone subscribers between Urban and Rural areas is approximately as follows;-85%   in Urban areas. 15/v    in Rural areas. It seems probable that the proportion of wireless listeners in Rural areas is higher than the telephone proportion,  though the latter figure which is based on rural areas no doubt includes some areas which are Urban in character.    In the absence of any precise information the assumption is made that the proportion may be of the order of 20$.&apos;.    On this basis and allowing for the higher costs in providing wire broadcasting in Rural areas,  the capital cost is very broadly put at 65,000,000    in Urban areas,  35,000,000    in Rural areas. It is clear that the total cost could be materially reduced if the extension to listeners in Rural areas was limited so as to exclude the less accessible cases,    There is,  however, no basis for framing any estimate in figures of the possibilities of limitation on these lines .

Copy No........CABIN E T.A.B.0.(37)  21.COMMITTEE  on OVERSEAS BROADCASTING.PROHIBITION op BROADCASTING DURING __AIR RAIDS ._Memorandum by the Home Secretary.While the assistance for direction finding afforded to enemy raiders by broadcasting transmission is not disputed, the Home Office would view with grave apprehension a decision that on this account broadcasting should be prohibited when enemy aircraft came within 50 miles of a station.No one can foresee the situation which might develop if continuous air attacks sweep over a large section of the country,  including many important and densely populated industrial districts.      The maintenance of the morale of the civil population is a pre-requisite of any policy designed to beat back air attack on a large scale.The damage that would occur in industrial areas if raiders get through will in itself be serious enough, and most of the A.R.P.  scheme is designed to reduce the material effects of that damage as far as possible.      But the psychological damage of rumours and ignorance might well prove far more serious and might gravely embarrass the Government&apos;s policy.The only way which the Home Office believe that these dangers to morale can be obviated is to ensure that frequent authoritative bulletins as to the consequences of the raid and the success of the counter attack are issued in such a way that they reach substantially the whole of the population in industrial areas.     The only way in which this is possible under present conditions is to use the broadcasting system.     To
distribute printed bulletins might well prove impossible and in any case such bulletins would necessarily be very short and compressed and not nearly so convincing as a statement heard over the wireless.     During the last ten years the country has been tuned in to wireless as the medium of important communications.In addition to these general considerations there are particular reasons why the Home Office are bound to resist the proposed closing down of broadcasting:-(a)    The system of air raid warnings devised by the HomeOffice is designed to delay the distribution of the Action Warning till the raiders are about five minutes flying time from the district to be warned, and the warning districts are small in size.      The object is to limit,  as far as possible, the area over which such a warning has to be given and to avoid, to the greatest possible extent, unnecessary warnings, with their resultant interruption of industrial output and general dislocation of activities necessary for the conduct of the war.     The scheme was redently approved in all its details by the Committee of Imperial Defence.      The cessation of broadcasting by one of the synchronised stations would be recognised by listeners as an indication of the presence of enemy aircraft in the vicinity and would inevitably be regarded as an air raid warning throughout the whole of the area covered by the station.     This closing down would have to take place at least 15 minutes before the raiders reached the station and would &quot;warn&quot; a very large area.      It would enormously increase the number of unnecessary warnings,  stultify the warning system and cause widespread dislocation of industrial

The calming and steadying effect of broadcast messages would be very largely lost.(c) In the early and vital days of the war,  it is to beanticipated that raids would be more or less continuous, and the effect of closing down when a raider was within 50 miles of a station would be to bring about a more or less - cK*mp.l^te--^e-s^tj^n&quot;of .--over-wide areas.s.h.

SUB-COMMITTEE ON THE CONTROL OP RADIO TRANSMISSION.BROADCASTING IN TIME OF WAR.SHORT INTERMITTENT ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM SYNCHRONISED BROADCASTING STATIONS DURING CLOSED DOWN PERIODS.18th July, 1938, (C.I.D. paper No. 290-A) we proposed (the representative of the Home Office dissenting) that: -&quot;as an immediate measure the system of synchronised fixed stations outlined in Annex I of the report should, he adopted in time of war (if wireless broadcasting is to be continued) on condition that a station closes do-:n on the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of it......&quot;referred to in paragraph 3 of the above report we ha.ve considered whether it would, be possible, without rendering navigational assistance to the enemy,  to broadcast short announcements from a synchronised station during the period when it must remain otherwise closed owing to&apos; the1 presence of the.-enemy within the critical are&apos;a&quot; and&apos; we &apos; now report a*s&quot; follows:3. The programmes sent out from all synchronisedstations in a group must be identical.     If different programmes are sent out from such stations the majority of listeners will receive nothing intelligible.      ItREPORT.1.In recommendation (iv) of our report dated2.On the instructions of the Ministerial Committee
follows, therefore, that when one station in a group is closed down it is not practicable to make &quot;shortintermittent announcements11 from it whilst the current programme is being continued from the other stations.Nor is it necessary to do so for, as pointed out inparagraph 19 of our report:&quot;When enemy aircraft are within 50 miles of one station in a group, reception of not below the level of just intelligible speech will still be available over practically the whole country.&quot;4. It follows, therefore, that if a station is closed down any announcements that it may be desired to make can be broadcast as part of the current programme from the other stations in the group and will reach the area normally served by the closed down station.5. When all four stations in a group are closed downeither because enemy aircraft are within 50 miles of all of them or of three of them, we do    not consider that the number of occasions on which material navigational assistance would be given to the enemy if short announcements of varying duration were made at irregular intervals during the period the full programme has to be suspended,, is such that the Air Ministry is prepared to accept the risk incurred..      No announcement should exceed two minutes in length, and the first announcement should not take place until half an hour after all stations in the group have closed down and subsequent announcements at a rate not exceeding one per half hour measured, from the time of the first announcement.      It is most important that irregularity should be maintained both as regards intervals and duration of announcements.
6.The Air Ministry representative desires thatthe scheme for short intermittent announcements should . he accompanied by the proviso that the Air Ministry should have authority to postpone the transmission of announcements should exceptional circumstances require such action.RECOMMENDATION.7. We therefore recommend: -that the scheme for synchronised stations suggested in recommendation (iv) of C.I.D. Paper No.  290-A should be accompanied by a condition authorising, when all stations in a group are closed down, the broadcasting from all stations in the group at irregular intervals of announcements of varying length but not exceeding two minutes in duration;    the first announcement not to be made until at least half an hour after the stations have closed down and subsequent announce-ments at the rate of not more than one per half hour measured from the time of the first announcement, and draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the fact that, in the opinion of the Air Ministry,  that Department should have authority to postpone the issue of announcements should the circumstances justify such action.Signed on behalf of the Sub-committee before.W.
