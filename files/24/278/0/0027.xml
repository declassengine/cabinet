(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 01&apos; HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).COPY No.secret.CP.No.  192/38.cabinet india.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 19th August;  1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 19th August, 1938,  issued on.the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1. Provincial Ministries^   Three Ministries, those of Bengal, Central Provinces and Sind, have recently suffered strain more or less severe.    In Bengal the uneasiness in the coalition which resulted in the dis-appearance of Nausher Ali from the Ministry caused some doubt of its stability.    The fate of the Tenancy Bill (mentioned in the fifth and sixth appreciations of thisyear) would naturally have an important effect on the Ministry which sponsored it.    The Bill was returned by the Governor for further consideration:    the amendments suggested in his message were accepted by both Houses and the Governor then gave his assent.    But meanwhile the hopes of the opposition found expression in ten votes of &quot;no confidence&quot; tabled against the Ministers individually. Peeling ran high in the city, excited by demonstrations and counter demonstrations:    and a numb ex1 of opposition members of the Assembly were,  or pretended, to be, so alarmed for their safety that they spend the night in the House before the first motion came up.    The motion was rejected by a margin of nineteen   votes;  the next two motions were defeated without a division;  and the rest were then abandened.    The Ministry therefore survives: but majority was so small - less in fact than the number of the European group which supported the Ministry -that its security must be regarded as still liable to be threatened by any sudden development or sapped by dissension and intrigue.In Sind, the Government, at the end of July, issued orders on the revision of the rates of assessment in the
Lloyd Barrage area.    Though the rates were enhanced, a sliding scale was adopted which would practically bring the increase into effect only with a rise in prices of the cotton crop.    Even so, all parties at once demanded that the. operation of- the orders should he formally post-poned for a year.    The Ministry seems, at the moment, to have few friends: but, as the Legislature is not likely to meet in the near future, and as the various groups (including the Congress group) which would be glad to profit by the discomfiture of the Ministry have not yet come to terms with each other, it is possible that the storm may he weathered.In the Central Provinces, the. Ministry has fallen. For months past the Share administration had been torn with dissension between one faction. - the Premier and two colleagues - belonging to the Maharashtra area, and the remaining three Ministers belonging to the Mahakosal (Hindi speaking) area.    The efforts of the Congress High Command ^Q settle the differences had been unavailing. As was mentioned in the last appreciation, an attempt was to be made by the Working Committee, at its Wardha session beginning on 23rd July, to find a fresh solution but, in the meantime, Dr. Khare and his two supporters resigned and the other three ministers, who refused to resign without the orders of the Working Committee, were relieved of their duties by the Governor.On the 21st, Dr Khare formed a new ministry: on the 22nd, he was summoned to Wardha (50 miles from the capital of the province), made his submission to the Congress High Command, and tendered to the Governor the resignation of himself and his colleagues.    As a meeting of the
Provincial Assembly Congress party was summoned for the 27th to elect a new leader, the Governor asked Dr. Khare to remain in office till then.    On the 26th, the Working Committee issued a resolution which condemned Dr. Khare for having, by his errors of judgment and gross indiscipline, given occasion for the use by the Governor of his power of dismissal:  and went on to censure the Governor for &quot;ugly haste&quot; in forcing a crisis, and to impute to him the motive of being eager to weaken and discredit the Congress. On the 27th,  the Assembly party met and elected as their leader Pandit Shukla, one of the three dismissed Mahakosal ministers.    The new ministry, containing Pandit Shukla as Premier, the other two Mahakosal ex-ministers, and two new recruits, was sworn in on the 29th.The Congress High Command can hardly congratulate itself on the result.lt..   The election of Pandit Shukla on the 27th was achieved only by the virtual excommunication of Dr. Khare, and by the presence at the meeting of the Congress   President (who took the chair) and three members of the Congress Parliamentary sub-Committee.    The treat-ment of Dr. Khare has brought him a good deal of sympathy: and new&quot;Ministry is weak through lack of support from the Maharashtra area.The language of the Working Committee resolution is attributed to Gandhi himself, but it nevertheless met with general criticism even in Congress press.    Ho part of it has escaped condemnation - either the over-weening interference of the High Command in provincial affairs, or its denial of constitutional relations between the Governor and Ministers, or its imputation of motive to the Governor.    Ganhi in a later publication has attempted to reaffirm the position: but even his authority has failed
to upset the general verdict that the attach on the Governor was baseless, and that the usurpation of authority by the High Command is a danger to.the growth of democratic practice.2. Otherwise the administration of the provinces hasbeen in the main uneventful.    In the Central Provinces the Bilaspur enquiry (mentioned in previous appreciations-) has been postponed until the monsoon is over.In Madras the anti-Hindi agitation continues; and the Ministry has earned &quot;disfavour&quot; in orthodox Congress circles by the use in combating it of the &quot;repressive&quot; provisional law designed against picketing.    The opposi-tion have taken advantage of the situation by giving notice of a Bill to repeal the obnoxious lav/.In Bombay &quot;prohibition&quot; was introduced in the Ahmedabad area on 20th July.      Consumption of alcoholic liquor is restricted to licenced persons selected by an Advisory Committee.In the United Provinces two prisoners who have been serving long sentences for complicity in the notorious Chaurichara case of 1922 (when a number of policemen were killed in circumstances of great brutality) have been released before the expiry of their sentences. 3. Some of the provincial Legislatures have been in session. The measures under consideration have been mostly agrarian.The Bihar Assembly passed two important agrarian Bills early in August.    The Council now has them under discussion.The Punjab Assembly in the course of a month&apos;s session passed all except one of the agrarian measures referred to in last appreciation;  these now await the Governor&apos;s
assent..    Opposition to them has heen vigorous among the non-agriculturist classes; and the Congress party in the Province has lost influence by its failure, under orders from the High Command, to oppose Bills detrimental to the interests of the sections which mainly support Congress.The United Provinces Assembly should have taken up consideration of the important and contentious Tenancy Bill; but this has not yet emerged from the Select Committee.    The Assembly has rejected all amendments made by the Upper House in two important Bills, and in the debates adverse comment was made on Council interference. 4.    The Cjentral Assembly.    The summer session of the Central Assembly started on 8th August.    Party Alignment has been altered by the formation of a new Moslem League party under the leadership of Mr.  Jinnah, the President of the League, with a membership of about 15, at the expense of the two old parties.On the first day the G-overnment escaped defeat on an adjournment motion by the inargin of one vote;  the intention of the motion was to censure the Government for the importation of an insurance expert from England.On the next day,  the Assembly carried by 71 votes to 33 a motion intended to censure the Government of India for acquiescing in the increase of Indian Defence charges resulting from increased amenities granted to officers of the Army by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    A Government Bill designed to penalise anti-recruiting propaganda is under discussion.    Speeches disc caraging enlistment in the Army have lately become common, especially in the Punjab, whence come most of the recruits.    The
Congress creed requires that India should refrain from assisting Britain in &quot;Imperialist&quot; wars, and speeches generally take this as their text.5.    The Moslem League and Congress.    The Congress Working Committee, which met towards the end of July, communicated to Mr. Jinnah its views on the League&apos;s main demands; though the tone of the letter was friendly and was supposed to leave the door open for further negotiations, the substance amounted to rejection.    The Moslem League Executive Council met on July 30th-51st, the result of their deliberations has not been published but it is understood that Mr. Jinnah sent a long reply to Congress maintaining his previous position.    In public, he has once more denounced Congress and has declared that there can he no compromise because the League has not yet strength to compel Congress to abide by the terms of any pact that might be made.    The faiIvors of the negotia-tions has surprised nobody.6. The Congress party.    The working Committee&apos;s sessionduring the last week of July was mainly concerned with the Moslem League negotiations and ministerial dissensions in the Central Provinces.       No time was found fordiscussion of the rupee ratio.    Though no further pron-ouncement has been made on federation, Subhas Bose, whoseutterance of the subject (mentioned in the last apprecia-tion) created a heated controversy, is believed to havebeen rebuked for ventilating his views without authority.7. The Moslem League.    The Executive Council of theLeague, during its session in Delhi on July 30th -July 31st, is understood to have considered two importantitems, besides negotiations with Congress.    It was decidedthat agitation against 3ritish policy in Palestine should
9 0 9 to 00be maintained;  that &quot;Palestine Day&quot; should, he observed on August 20th; and that a sub-committee should be set up to consider the sending of Moslem deputations to England and Palestine - methods of bringing effective pressure to bear on the British Government.    The other decision was to form a Moslem &quot;National Guard&quot; of volunteers,  to tea disciplined organisation on quasi-military lines to carry out in a concerted manner such economic,  social and political schemes as may be planned for the betterment of the community and country;  a sub-committee was formed to examine this proposal.    (The formation of volunteer corps is becoming increasingly fashionable, beside Congress and the Moslem League, some class organisations, such as tenants and landlords, talk of forming such bodies: but such schemes have rarely been put in practice).8.    Labour.    An improvement is noticeable in the labour situation.    In Madras the strike at the Choolai mills ended on 20th July, the parties agreeing to the appoint-ment of an Investigating Officer.    Government decided to appoint a Court of Enquiry into the jute mills strike, but as the men have not returned to work the appointment has not yet been made.    In Coimbatore the situation remains unsettled.    In Bengal the strikers at the Kulti and Hirapur steel works resumed work on the 21st July and a Conciliation Board was appointed.    In Bihar work has been resumed in the iron and steel industries.    In Bombay a strike of workers in the Gokak mills (nearly 3,000 in number) began on 20th July, the immediate cause being the management1s refusal to reinstate a discharged worker. 9. Agrarian.    Agrarian agitation has been responsiblefor disturbances in the Amritsar District of the Punjab.
A grievance was created out of Government1s proposals for a new revenue settlement of the district (which will not take effect for 5 years) and the remodelling of certain irrigation works.    Peasants were persuaded to court arrest by disobeying an order forbidding meetings in a part of Amritsar City.    On 20th July the police had to disperse a crowd of demonstrators, of whom a number received injuries, and thereafter parties of volunteers courted arrest daily until agitation ceased and the prohibitory order was cancelled on 10th August after the Premier had visited the district.10._Communa1 troubles.    In the middle of July a pettyBazaar dispute resulted in a communal riot at Pilibhit in the United Provinces during which some 50 Hindus and Moslems were injured.    Order was quickly restored.A more serious riot occurred at Shagalpur, in Bihar, on July 29th-July 30th, following a Hindu-Mussulman dispute about a religious procession.    Several persons were killed and injured,  and the situation still causes anxiety.11. Delhi.    To protest against the alleged &quot;repressiveadministration&quot; of the centrally administered province of Delhi, the Congress organised a har-tal on July 22nd. In the Hindu quarter the hartal was almost complete. More than 60 arrests for molestation of workers had to be mode.    In a very recent article in &quot;Harnai&quot;, Gandhi, without mentioning this incident, has condemned the methods of . picketing there practised.12. Economically, the monsoon has been responsiblefor severe floods, causing acute distress in Assam and the United Provinces and some damage in the Central Provinces. On the other hand, water is scarce in parts of the Punjab.
Elsewhere conditions are normal.15.__Waairistan.      The Faqir of Ipi remains theprincipal focus of unrest in Waziristan,    In order to eject him from his new.headquarters and to disperse his lashkar,  two brigades carried out a joint operation in the middle of July, and,  assisted by the Royal Air Force, attained their object.The Faqir&apos;s followers were dispersed with heavy casualties.    One British Officer and twelve other ranks were killed and a number were wounded.    Despite the success of these operations, the general situation in Waziristan did not improve.    The Faqir of Ipi fled into Afghan territory but returned to Waziristan ?;here his followers split up into small bands, scattered over Waziristan and the adjoining tribal area of Bannu district and renewed intensified gang warfare.There have been frequent and increasingly daring outrages.    On July 12th a large gang under leadership of an hostile Mahsud attacked a Scout Convoy but was dispersed with severe casualties by Scouts with co-operation of the Royal Air Force.    On July 18th a road patrol of South Waziristan Scouts was fired on by the same gang;  two Scouts were killed and one Indian Officer and two Scouts wounded.    On July 20th, when a party of the Military Engineering Service was fired on by a gang in the Wana area, one Indian Officer was killed and an Assistant Garrison Engineer wounded.    On July 21st three civilian lorries were held up in North Waziristan and a Sikh boy was kidnapped.On 23rd July occurred the most serious incident of the month.    A lashkar of about 200, which had been lurking in tribal territory north of Bannu for some time, made a
sudden raid on Bannu city and cantonment in the evening. The attack on the cantonment was a feint, designed to keep the troops occupied while the main body penetrated the centre of the city, where they looted shops and houses and set fire to a large area.    Troops and police entered the city and dispersed the raiders -without difficulty.    The fire was extinguished, but not before it did extensive damage.    The casualties to the civil population are reported to have been 8 killed and 17 wounded.    Of the raiders 4 were killed and 21 were taken prisoners, of whom 8 were wounded.    The tribal area from which the raide rs came a nd to which they returned has since been subjected to air proscription.On 31st July three Hindus were kidnapped in North Waziristan.    On 3rd August extensive damage was done to a railway bridge in Bannu district by a bomb explosion. On 5th August two private lorries were looted and 9 persons kidnapped also in North Waziristan.    On 6th August one Indian Other Rank was killed and 2 were wounded when Razmak road protection troops were sniped during wi thdrswal.
