IS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT.CRET. COPY NO.     jjjP. 172(38)CABINET.AMENDMENT OF PATENTS ANT) DESIGNS ACTS: Statutory Time Limits. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I should like authority to proceed with the preparation of a short Bill to remedy an unsatisfactory state of affairs relating to the statutory time limits within which certain actions precedent to the grant or maintenance of a patent must be performed at the Patent Office under the Patents and Designs Acts, 1907 to 1932.Under Section 8A of those Acts, unless the complete specification - which particularly describes the naturesof the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed - has undergone the orescribed procedure of examination and any necessary revision and has been formally &quot;accepted&quot; by the Comptroller within eighteen months from the date of application, the application becomes void (with certain exceptions) but the Comptroller is obliged on request, and on payment of the prescribed fee, to grant an extension of time up to three months.The practice of the Patent Office for over forty years, based upon Law Officers&apos; Directions given in 1895 under a somewhat similar provision in the Act of 1885, has been to grant such an extension of time even if it was not asked for until after the period of extension had begun to run.    The Patents Appeal Tribunal has recently held that the request for extension ought to be made before the period of extension commences, and it may thus be that a large number of patents granted upon applications extended on requests made during the period of extension in accordance with this long-established practice are legally invalid and open to attack with consequent serious loss to the owners of the patents.    The practice in question is,
however, a convenient one and has all along &quot;been considered to &quot;be right &quot;both by the Office and &quot;by those transacting business with it.      It is proposed that it should be validated as regards the past and clarified in terms as regards the future.It is suggested that the Bill should similarly clarify difficulties in regard to the existing provisions in the Patents and Designs Acts regarding extensions of time for lodging the complete specification following a provisional specification, and for payment of renewal fees for the maintenance of a patent, and certain other acts of minor importance where it would appear from the decision of the Patents Appeal Trihunal that on the true construction of the statute an application for an extension of time must be asked for before the extended period has begun to run.It is further desirable that the opportunity should be taken to validate another old-established practice of the Patent Office.      It frequently happens that, owing to the time occupied by the consideration of matters revealed in the examination of the application, the complete specification in the form finally desired is not re-filed at the Patent Office by the applicant until the last day of the period allowed for &quot;acceptance&quot;, and with no time, or insufficient time, within the period for the Office to examine the final specification as to its suitability for acceptance.      In such cases it has for many years been the practice, where the Office examination has subsequently shown that the specification filed within the period was in a condition fit for acceptance, to accept it &quot;as of&quot; the last day of the period.      This practice has been found convenient to applicants for patents, but it is feared that, if it were tested in the Court, it may have adversely affected tne validity of patents granted on
applications so treated.    It is accordingly suggested that the Act should provide, not, as at present, that a complete specification must he accepted within the periods mentioned in Section 8A, hut that it must he either duly filed in a condition fit for acceptance or re-filed within fiose periods in such a condition,,  and that this shall he deemed to bave all along been the lawDThe Bill is limited to validating old-established practices of the Patent Office and should he non-controversial. It is a matter of some urgency;    and I should like authority to proceed with its preparation at once, with a view to its introduction as soon as the Parliamentary programme allows0Board of Trade,14th July, 1938,
