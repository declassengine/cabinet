THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF Hid BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1938.SECRET.CP. 190 (38)CABINET.DISCUSSIONS ON PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues may like to glance at the accounts of my more important conversations with various individuals regarding Palestine during the summer. If their holiday is liable to be ruined by extremely heavy reading, I advise them not to read further than this.They will see that with those who speak as representatives of or sympathisers with the Palestinian Arabs I have felt it necessary to abide rigidly by His Majesty&apos;s Governments declaration in favour of Partition. Great harm has already been done in Palestine by rumours that the wisdom of Partition has been questioned in the Cabinet, which have encouraged the Arab terrorists and those behind them to believe that if only they persist in their campaign they will force us to abandon this policy. I should perhaps explain that Dr. Izzat Tannous is in charge of the Arab Centre in London, an organisation formed to conduct propaganda in support of the Palestinian Arabs. He is an Arab Christian, but has been in the past closely associated with the Mufti, and was with Jamal Husseini (who fled to Syria with the Mufti) a member of the Arab delegation to London in 1936. He has always tended to be a moderate, and therefore his influence in Palestine is probably not very great. His conversations with me may help to increase his prestige and influence amongst his fellow-countrymen, but they are just as likely to limit his influence through earning for him the hostility of the extremists, who seem to be so powerful that they virtually dictate Arab policy. Therefore I do not count on his being of much effective assistance in all this business. Nevertheless, he is a man capable of reason and some courage, and at least has some official political position in the Palestinian Arab world. I am sure that whatever influence he may have will be exerted on the side of peace in Palestine. During his present visit to Palestine he will no doubt gain an up-to-date view of Arab opinion there; for all I know he will have communications with the Mufti; he may even visit him. I asked no questions. He is the one faint ray of hope that I see at present of our being able to establish some kind of useful contact with politically important Arab opinion in Palestine, though the High Commissioner may also succeed in time in getting the moderate members of the Supreme Moslem Council to help to break the extremist front.In my talks with Dr. Weizmann I reiterated my view that Partition is the best policy, but warned him that further consideration might make me change that view and offer different advice to the Cabinet. I think it a proper precaution to prepare him for this possibility, and there is no danger of his communicating this element of doubt to anyone who might pass it on to the Arabs. He is too conscious of the harm which would result from that.It is premature to express any conclusions as to what our policy should finally be; we have to wait for the Woodhead Commission^ Report, which will greatly influence the situation one way or the other. But the following is a summary of my present views :  1. A scheme of Partition on lines similar to those sketched in the Peel Report is still the best solution of the problem, if it proves practicable from the point of view of conditions inside Palestine and opinion outside the country. The arguments in its favour are very powerful, and most of them are set out in the Peel Report itself.[17795] copy^Nb.
2. We sitc-uld not abandon this general solution lightly, and should recognise that the arguments in its favour can be made very effective not only from the point of view of the Jews, but also from the point of view of the neighbouring Arab countries who fear Jewish domination in the Near East.3. But two considerations may destroy this solution. First, practical considerations inside Palestine may lead the Woodhead Commission to recommend a Jewish State so small that the Jews themselves (who are divided, even in the Zionist Movement, on Partition) finally decide against Partition. Second, opinion in the surrounding Arab countries and in Egypt may be so bitterly opposed to Partition, and their hostility to us be so dangerous in the. present international situation, that we ourselves are forced to seek an alternative solution.4. In view of this possibility, I am examining a variety of other proposed solutions. (I can assure my colleagues that I am not suffering from a lack of advisers; almost everybody that I meet produces some fresh solution.) None of them is really satisfactory; so far as I am able to judge, all of them would be rejected by either the Arabs or the Jews or both; we are faced by a choice between evils. Whatever we do, there is likely to be difficulty and trouble in Palestine for a long time to come. What we have to try to find is the solution which, whilst it may not bring pacification at once, is most likely over a period of years to heal the breach between Jews and Arabs and ultimately to create an enduring peace.M. M.Colonial Office, August 21, 1938.
APPENDIX.I.Dr. Weizmann and Representatives of the Jewish Agency.% (a)I HAD a long talk with Dr. Weizmann yesterday evening when I asked him to let me have his views, first on the question of security in Palestine, and secondly regarding policy. He stated these at great length, and indeed took the whole of the available time in doing so. Apart from throwing in one or two inter-objections and asking two or three questions, I did not utter a word, and we have arranged for a further talk in the course of the next few days.With regard to security, Dr. Weizmann expressed satisfaction with what was at present being done. He thought that the High Commissioner, General Haining and Sir Charles Tegart had worked in perfect co-operation together and the police and military generally were also working without any of the earlier friction or stand-offishness from each other. He thought that the Administration had adequate forces both of police and military at their disposal, and when I pressed him on this confirmed his view. He considered that terrorism would be reduced as a result of the building of Tegarfs Wall and the new military and police dispositions, but did not think it would disappear so long as there was uncertainty as to the precise policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government were going to pursue. We had to expect a desperate effort on the part of the Arabs, by making as much trouble as they could in Palestine, to frighten us into abandoning partition and accepting their own view as to what should be done in Palestine. That effort would be sustained until we made it clear that we had definitely formulated our policy and meant to put it through. Therefore, in Dr. Weizmann&apos;s view the most essential contribution that we can make towards the complete re-e&apos;stablishment of law and order is to make up our mind on policy as soon as possible.He said that the present terrorism was being largely engineered by the Mufti. The efforts of the French authorities in Syria and the Lebanon to restrict the Mufti&apos;s activities were farcical. He realised our difficulties in this respect, and said that he himself when in Paris had often pressed French Ministers to exert their authority over their subordinates in Syria, but without any success.I asked Dr. Weizmann whether he thought that it would make much difference to the Mufti&apos;s power of stirring up trouble if he went to some other country such as Iraq or Egypt. Dr. Weizmann did not think that this would appreciably affect the situation.With regard to policy, he recognised that we must await the report of the Woodhead Commission. He himself had spent eight hours being examined by the Commission, and on the whole he was impressed with them as a body competent to do their work. He had been especially impressed by Mr. Waterfield, who was &quot; the brains of the Commission.&quot; He did not feel that he could yet discern in what direction the minds of the Commission were moving, but he thought that they were rather worried on some points in particular. For instance, they were evidently greatly exercised about what should happen to the Galilee district in case of partition. They had questioned him and other witnesses a great deal on this point. He had tried to impress the Commission with the fact that partition really would not be acceptable to the Jews if the plan for a Jewish state which had been outlined in the Peel Commission were to be reduced by the exclusion of Galilee. If the right policy was to establish a Jewish state in a part of Palestine, then that state must be of such a nature that it could stand on its own legs. Of all the mistakes which could be made the worst would be to give the Jews an area for a state which proved too small to enable the normal administration of a state to function. He had in mind an area which should be able to support a total Jewish population of about H millions, which might grow to 2 millions as a result of natural increase in the course of time. That would be possible, in his opinion, in the area which had been sketched by the Pee). Commission, with the[17795] b 2
adjustments which he had already suggested to Lord Harlech, and which he had presented before the Woodhead Commission.He made it plain that he still strongly favours partition, but only on the condition set out above. He hoped that the Woodhead Commission would produce a plan which satisfied this requirement; but he hoped that the Commission would not draw up a plan which they would put forward on a &quot; take-it-or-leave-it&quot; basis. He thought that their function was to produce the best plan that they could, and then leave it for His Majesty&apos;s Government to negotiate with that plan as a rough basis. He urged that when the Commission reported a decision should be taken quickly, and that the consequential action should be taken quickly.I need not repeat at length his general contentions, with which we are all familiar.I said that what I wanted was an agreed settlement, which meant a settle-ment which was acceptable to the Jews and the Arabs as well as to the Mandatory Power. But an agreed settlement seemed out of the question unless the represen-tatives of the Mandatory Power could talk not only with Jews but also with Arabs. It was essential that we should have a contact with representatives of the Arabs; but no such contact seemed possible at the present time. I wondered whether he thought there was any chance of establishing such a contact with men who could speak for the Arabs, and, if so, who those individuals might be.He replied that he thought no Arab could enter into negotiations at the present time. They still hoped to upset partition. But if the Government made it plain, on the receipt of the Woodhead report, that partition was their policy, and that they were going ahead with it, then the Arabs would realise that it was no good carrying on the anti-partition campaign, and they would begin to be ready to negotiate with a view to getting the best bargain that they could. When the Jewish state came into being, the Arabs would certainly make contact with the authorities with a view to getting as much as they could out of the new Jewish Government. Already the Jews were approached from time to time by this or that influential Arab who foresaw that partition was likely to come about, and who wanted to be in a postion of friendliness with the Jews when the day came.I observed that he seemed to envisage a long period before the Arabs were in a mood to negotiate, for I understood him to say that they would only reach this stage on the establishment of a Jewish state. I hoped that some sort of negotia-tion would be possible at a much earlier stage, i.e., at about the time when we were reaching a final conclusion on the main principle of our policy. I asked Dr. Weizmann whether he really thought that the Arabs would continue a non-co-operation policy until policy had not only been decided but fully implemented, assuming that the policy was to be partition. If this was so, then I presumed we had to look forward to a long and bitter Arab opposition, which would involve the maintenance of considerable forces in Palestine throughout.Dr. Weizmann replied that he thought that some negotiation might be possible when we had decided on policy, though it would still be difficult for reasonable Arabs to play much part.I asked him whether he had in mind any Arabs with whom a contact might be made. He replied that by far the best was Ibn Saud, and that he was really the man with whom we should maintain a close contact.June 23.(&amp;)I had a further talk with Dr. Weizmann yesterday afternoon regarding policy in Palestine.Before we got on to the general question, I asked him what was his view of the shootings and bombings which had taken place in Palestine that morning. He was clearly worried, saying that so far as the Jews were responsible it was the work of the Revisionists. As&apos; soon as he knew that a Jewish boy was to be hanged by the authorities, as had happened at the end of last week, he could have told us that the Revisionists wpuld.exploit the occasion for further outrages. He understood that the Chief Rabbi in Jerusalem had sent a message to Mr. J abotinsky during the last day or two, asking him to appeal to his supporters in Palestine to remain calm. Mr., Jabotinsky had refused to do this. Dr. Weizmann said that the Revisionists were really in a difficulty. They had expected the report of the Royal Commission to be a very bad one from the point
of view of the Jews, and that the recommendation of the Commission would have been to the effect that further Jewish immigration into Palestine was to be more or less stopped. Such a report, with the situation which it would have been bound to produce, would have been welcome to the Revisionists. It would have made the task of the moderate Zionists impossible, and given power to the extremists. But no such report had appeared.. Instead the Commission recommended the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine. This had taken the Revisionists completely by surprise, and robbed them of their thunder. They were now in a quandary, but they were counting on His Majesty&apos;s Government to reject the proposal for partition. If the proposal were rejected, then the Revisionists would be immensely strengthened as against the moderates, and there would be serious trouble. If, on the other hand, partition were finally decided upon and put into effect, Revisionist influence would be very greatly weakened. Mr. Jabotinsky had said as much in conversation.I then said to Dr. Weizmann that I was anxious to put before him very frankly certain considerations which I had to keep in mind. What I was going to say did not mean that I myself was opposed to partition. On the contrary, I personally was still inclined to think that partition was the wisest policy at the present time; it was the least of the evils that we had to choose between. That might not be my final view two or three months hence when I had to advise the Cabinet on policy, though I thought it very likely would still be my view then. A great deal would depend on the terms of the report of the Woodhead Commission. In the meantime, I was deliberately refraining from reaching final conclusions, and was exploring every possibility so that I could make up my mind eventually with a full knowledge of the facts and the alternatives. I was talking to a good many people of different shades of opinion, and examining various solutions.I reminded him that in our earlier talk he expressed the view that, if we decided on the policy of partition and not only made it clear that we were going to carry it through, but did rapidly put it into effect and establish a Jewish State, then Arab opposition would in practice disappear and reputable Arab leaders would be ready to negotiate a settlement on the basis of partition.   He was one of the people most entitled to have a view on that matter, and it was possible that his view was correct.    Nevertheless, there was another view, diametrically opposed to his, which I would state.   It was held by many people who knew the Arab world.   It was to the effect that Arab opposition, both inside and outside Palestine, to partition was intense and permanent, and that the final adoption of the policy of partition would be followed at once by a considerable rebellion in Palestine which would receive material and moral support from Arabs and Moslems elsewhere.   If that view were correct, and we were to adopt partition, then there would be various consequences.   Pirst, any chance of peace in the near future in Palestine must be abandoned, and we should have to be prepared to face the undying hostility of Palestinian Arabs.   Secondly, we should lose much of the friendship of the authorities and peoples of a number of important surrounding countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Syria.  This would happen at a time when we were facing a very uncertain situation in Europe, in which both Germany and Italy were potential enemies; and serious trouble for us in Palestine would be an additional inducement to our enemies in Europe to start some active aggression, the outcome of which would be Avar. Thirdly, we should arouse hostility amongst Moslems in India, at a moment when we might well be facing considerable constitutional difficulties connected with Eederation; and this embarrassment to us might encourage Congress to make real difficulties.   Fourthly, in order to maintain our authority in the face of rebellion in Palestine, we should have to keep considerable armed forces there, thus immobilising them for action anywhere else.   The whole situation would, at the very best, weaken our power of diplomacy at a very critical time.   If there was substance in the argument that these might be consequences of partition, then any Colonial Secretary would have to consider the matter with the greatest possible care and contemplate the possibility of rejecting partition and adopting some other policy.   It was in the interests of the Jews that this should be so. Great Britain was the principal friend in the world to-day of the sorely tried Jewish people, and any weakening of Britain&apos;s power and authority was a blow to the Jews as much as to anybody.   I wondered what view Dr. Weizmann took of the picture I had painted.
He replied that it was no new picture. It was always being conjured up, and at regular intervals the authorities in Palestine had been threatened with an Arab rebellion. He did not deny that this was a possibility; no one could speak with certainty; but his own view was that the picture was very much exaggerated. He thought that, if we tried, we could persuade important Arab interests that partition was the right policy. But we had never made any sustained effort in this direction. For instance, we had never made the case fully to Ibn Saud. We could make a very good case, for since the War we had given the Arabs generally 90 per cent, of what they wanted. They had a number of independent States, and under the Peel Commission^ proposal a new area in the Near East would come under complete Arab sovereignty. The Arabs were already greatly indebted to us, and they would- not so lightly cast aside our friendship. Moreover, if we were now to abandon partition having already in principle accepted it the Arabs would not regard this as a concession from a generous British people. They would regard it as a concession wrung from a weak British people, as a result of the terrorist campaign. The Germans and Italians would be quick to encourage this view throughout the Near East, where their propaganda was deliberately and continuously anti-British. They would rub in the lesson that Great Britain was effete, and the peoples of Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the other countries would regard the concession as fresh evidence of this fact. We should not thereby secure Arab friendship, for the Arabs were uncertain in their loyalties. On the other hand, we should have lost the friendship of the Jews, which at present was something that we could really count on in peace or in war. The abandonment of partition now would leave the Jews completely disillusioned regarding the reliability of Britain. Even though he and individuals like him would understand our difficulties and the reasons for our policy, they could not convey that understanding to the great masses of their people. The moderates would be swept from office in the Zionist Organisation, and the extremists would come in. We should not even solve our problems in Palestine itself, for the 450,000 Jews now in Palestine would be in a trap. They would be a helpless and permanent minority; their position would get weaker and weaker, and their position would gradually become very distressing.I replied that I, of course, had not contemplated that the alternative to partition was a policy of stopping immigration and sale of land to the Jews. If partition were abandoned, then the Mandate, perhaps somewhat modified, would continue. What 1 would hope for would be a settlement negotiated and agreed by Jews, Arabs and the British Government. We would have a round-table conference; no doubt the chances of any agreement coming out of that conference were extremely remote, and in that case the Government would have to impose a settlement. But the settlement would be based on the negotiations and would go as near as possible to what might have been agreed between Jews and Arabs. I would reject any idea of a permanent Jewish minority in Palestine, and also any idea of the Mandate being replaced by the establishment of an Arab State. The proposal that appealed to me most assuming partition to have been abandoned  was that for a settlement which should last for something like ten years, at the end of which time the Jews would be 40 per cent, of the total population in Palestine. This was the proposal which Lord Samuel had discussed with some Moslem leaders. It would allow the Jews to double their present population over, say, a ten-year period. It would also include the possibility of Jewish settlement in Trans-Jordan. At the end of the allotted period of years the matter would come up for further consideration. There would be certain advantages in some such arrangement, both for Jews and for Arabs. In addition, there would be the advantage that for a period of years we would have peace. I did not suppose that peace would last for the whole of the period, for towards its end both sides would no doubt start to agitate with a view to preparing the ground for the next set of negotiations, and the great disadvantage of the proposal was that, in fact, it did not involve a final- settlement, but only a postponement of that settlement with all its attendant difficulties. However, many things might happen in ten years, and some of our major difficulties of the moment might have dissolved.Dr. Weizmann said that if any such suggestion had been made to him a few years ago he would have been ready to accept it. He was good enough to add that if there were any prospect of my remaining Secretary of State for a period of years he personally would be ready to accept it now.   But there would be new
Governments and new Secretaries of State, and he had to confess that his people&apos;s confidence in the British Government&apos;s ability to decide on a policy and stick to it had been shaken. If such a settlement as I had proposed were concluded now, there was no assurance that in two or three years&apos; time the British Government  mo doubt for very good reasons would come forward and say that the situation had changed, new dangers had arisen and there had to be a whittling down of the promises which had been made to the Jews. He and his friends wanted to get rid of all this uncertainty, and it would be a good thing for us as well as for them to get rid of it.I said that I did not think he could seriously accuse us of having changed our policy from time to time in any way which involved a broken promise to the Jews. The trouble Avas that our promise had been vague. We had undertaken to facilitate the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. What on earth was a Jewish National Home ? It was open to various interpretations, and our policy at any given time had been perfectly consistent with one or other of the interpretations of that vague promise. The proposal which I had mentioned, and which I put forward for the sake of argument, involved an undertaking by the British Government that certain specific developments should take place in Palestine over a period of years. They would be worked out in a reasonable amount of detail. For instance, it might be possible to suggest some definite percentage of the total population of Palestine which would be allotted to the Jews, such as the 40 per cent, which many people talked about, and which at any rate some Arabs seemed willing to accept. That promise would be a perfectly definite promise, and there could be no question of the British authorities on their part breaking the promise. Therefore he could surely feel assured that the plan would be carried out, despite changes of Government.Dr. Weizmann produced various detailed arguments against this idea which I need not repeat, for they are matters of detail and might be overcome. But he insisted throughout on two points. First, that he himself would not feel sufficiently assured by any such scheme that Jewish development in Palestine could, in fact, be carried out without periodical checks and interruptions, and, secondly, that in any case the mood of his supporters was now such that they could not accept any proposal of the kind. He said two or three times that he could only tell me frankly that he himself could not sign any agreement of the kind. He urged strongly that partition would be the wise policy from the point of view of Great Britain herself. If we changed the policy now we Avould not, as he had already tried to explain, win the certain confidence and friendship of the Arab peoples, and we should definitely lose the confidence and friendship of the Jews. On the other hand, if a Jewish State were established in Palestine we could count absolutely on the support of that State. They would have a consider -able Jewish army and they would be a source of various military supplies. They would be an extremely effective addition to our strength in that very important strategic quarter. He went so far as to say that, in his view, within a year of the establishment of a Jewish State we could withdraw our own military, forces from Palestine.I said that I thought this was very optimistic, though I appreciated the strength of the argument that we could count on the Jewish State being a friend and ally under all circumstances. But if it was also a source of trouble and friction in the Near East, to that extent it was an additional liability.Dr. Weizmann said that in establishing a Jewish State we would be creating the certainty of a new and powerful friend in the Near East, whereas we were only taking a risk of alienating the Arab peoples. He thought that we should at least be prepared to try the experiment.I retorted that the experiment might prove fatal.He agreed, but expressed again his strong conviction that this would not be so, and he urged once more that, if we really set about making to the Arab Rulers and other Governments friendly to the Arab cause the case for partition from the point of view of the Arabs themselves, we would be able to allay a great deal of the hostility. If we then proceeded to put the policy through we should, in fact, find that that was the signal for their coming in to make an agreement.I suggested that we should have a further talk a little later on, explaining again that I was merely turning over in my mind every possibility. He thanked me warmly for speaking so frankly, and said that he would welcome the opportunity of another talk when I was ready.July 5.
(o)I had a talk with Dr. Weizmann this afternoon. We agreed that we could hardly carry our discussions on general policy further than they had gone until the Woodhead Commission returned from Palestine and I knew what sort of proposals they were likely to make. I told him that the Commissioners would probably be back in England during the second week of August, and that I under-stood they proposed to start taking evidence in London on the 15th. Dr. Weizmann remarked that he expected to be away in France until the first week of September.He said that he was very disturbed at the continuance of violence by Jews in Palestine. To some extent this was no doubt the work of the Revisionists, but he suspected that it was by no means all their work. Other parties were interested in stirring up this strife. It was significant -that Jamal Hussein had recently paid a visit to Germany. This had been nominally for the purpose of consulting a doctor, but that was an old excuse which had been employed by many people on many occasions.Again, there was evidence that an anti-Jewish propaganda campaign was being worked up in the newspapers of Egypt and other countries in that part of the world. Articles of an identic nature, and sometimes with identic wording, were appearing in various of these newspapers, obviously inspired from some central source. They bore the stamp of German authorship. Again, it was clear that a good deal of illegal immigration of Jews into Palestine was being organized in Europe. We were aware of the arrival of some 350 Jews who landed a fortnight ago at a place near Haifa. His information was that 180 of these were definitely Revisionists, whilst the rest might well have been undesirable characters sent on account of their capacity for stirring up trouble. He had been told by an individual who was qualified to know the facts that their departure had been financed by Nazis.In fact, in his opinion we should take very seriously the suggestion that Germany was at the back of a good deal of our present trouble in Palestine. After all, the Germans were doing all that they could to create difficulties for us in Europe and round the Mediterranean, and their technique was to provoke internal and apparently spontaneous trouble in this or that country. They had done it in Austria and were doing it in Spain, and might well do the same thing in Czechoslovakia later on.July 18.(d)I saw Professor Namier and two other representatives of the Jewish Agency (in the absence of Dr. Weizmann) this afternoon. I explained to them the purpose of my visit to Palestine, saying that the rumours which I understood to be &apos; circulating in some Jewish quarters to the effect that my sudden visit indicated that there had been some disagreement between the Palestine Administration and the Colonial Office were quite unfounded. My visit had not been as sudden as all that. I had contemplated visiting the High Commissioner for some time, but could not get away from London whilst Parliament was sitting. Though I had met Sir Harold MacMichael when I was at the Colonial Office three years ago, I had not had a chance of a talk with him since he became High Commis-sioner and I returned to the Colonial Office this year. He had already gone to Jerusalem before I became Colonial Secretary. Although he and I kept in close touch by telegraph, despatch, and private letter, we both felt that some hours of personal discussion would be worth months and months of exchanging communications at long range. The High Commissioner could not come to London at present, and therefore I had gone to Jerusalem. There had been no difference of opinion whatever on any aspect of policy in Palestine between the High Commissioner and us in London.1 On the contrary, we had great confidence in both the High Commissioner and General Haining. I had gone to get from the authorities in Palestine a complete picture of their view of the present situation, especially as regards measures for security. We had surveyed the whole field, and I was therefore able to bring back for my colleagues a comprehensive report on the situation. No other significance attached to my visit. The High Commissioner and I had naturally considered questions of procedure concerning the impending Woodhead Commission^ Report, but there was no alteration in
the Governments policy. We must all wait for the presentation of the Report before that question could usefully be considered further.Professor Namier said that the rumours which I had referred to had circulated for a short while at first after the announcement that I had been in Jerusalem. Some of their friends in Palestine had telegraphed to them in London asking whether they thought that there was any foundation for these rumours. He himself and most of his colleagues in London had discounted the rumours from the beginning and had replied to Jerusalem to that effect. He had always assumed that the purpose of my visit was exactly as I had described it, and he was glad of the opportunity of hearing this authoritatively.August 12.II.Dr. Izzat Tannous. (a)I had a talk with Dr. Tannous yesterday morning. After a cordial exchange of greetings, he launched into a statement of the Arab case against the Mandate and the proposal for partition. He said that the feeling of hostility in the Arab world and in Palestine was spontaneous; it had not been engineered from Italy or any other external source. The Arab complaint against the Mandate was that it differed from the principle of all the other &quot;Mandates in that, instead of pro-viding that the interests of the existing inhabitants of Palestine should be safe-guarded, it actually gave preference to the interests of a new immigrant race. He spoke at some length about the iniquity of letting the Jews or rather the Zionist Jews pour into Palestine, so that now there was actually a demand that a part of Palestine should be handed over to them in full sovereignty. I need not give the details of the well-known case which Dr. Tannous repeated forcefully.I replied that I did not think that the Palestine Mandate had been so contrary to the principles of the other Mandates as he suggested. Great Britain had undertaken a double obligation in Palestine. It was true that we had undertaken to facilitate the establishment of the Jewish National Home, but we were also obliged to safeguard the interests of the Arab population of the country. In our view there was room for both a large Jewish population and a large Arab popula-tion in Palestine. The interests of the Arabs could be safeguarded at the same time as we were facilitating the immigration of Jews. It would be our constant endeavour to promote the interests of the Arab population.Dr. Tannous replied that the interests of the Arabs were being, and had always been, subordinated to those of the Jews in Palestine. He could not under-stand why Great Britain pursued this policy with regard to Jewish immigration. We had created the situation, which the Royal Commission had described so well, in which there were two irreconcilable nationalist movements in Palestine, one Jewish and the other Arab. Partition would only aggravate this situation, for the Arabs would never consent, except if they were forced to, to the surrender of a part of their country to an immigrant race; and if a Jewish State were estab-lished, the Arabs would only await the day when they could attack that State and drive the Jews out. All the Arabs sincerely wanted a peaceful settlement of the present difficulties, and if the Arabs in Palestine and the Jews in Palestine were left to themselves, he thought they would be able to reach an accommodation. But the Jews in the outside world put on a pressure which made a friendly settlement impossible. Those Jews apparently received the support of the British Government. If that support continued, the traditional friendship of the Arabs for the British which they still felt would disappear. That would be extremely serious, and he hoped that we would soon reach a settlement which preserved Arab-British friendship.I answered that I also was extremely anxious that a settlement should be reached which preserved the friendship between our two peoples. All of us here cherished that friendship. But I understood him to suggest that in order to preserve it we should repudiate the Mandate. That was impossible. We had [17795] c
given our promise in the Mandate not only to the Jewish people on the one hand and the Arab people in Palestine on the other hand, but also to the nations represented in the League of Nations. Even if we wanted to break that promise, we could not do it. But in any case we did not propose to break the promise. If our promise to the Jews had meant that we should act contrary to the interests of the Arabs in Palestine, I could understand the argument in favour of repudiating the Mandate. But, as I had said, it seemed fo me that we could very adequately safeguard the interests of the Arabs whilst carrying out the policy of the Mandate. I hoped that ultimately we should be able to reach a solution which was an agreed solution between the Arabs, the Jews and ourselves. But as far as I could see the chances of that were very remote, therefore we should probably have to impose such a solution. It was difficult at the present moment to discuss the details of policy in Palestine, because we were awaiting the report of the Woodhead Commission on partition. But I had been anxious to meet him (Dr. Tannous) as soon as possible after coming into the Colonial Office, and was very glad of this opportunity of making his acquaintance. I would like to have a further, longer conversation with him later on.Dr. Tannous said that he would welcome this. He was glad of the oppor-tunity on the present occasion of expressing the Arab point of view, and hoped that I did realise that the present unhappy state of affairs in Palestine was brought about by a spontaneous Arab hostility against our policy. They all regretted the acts of terrorism, but they were inevitable in the circumstances.I replied that the present terrorist campaign was doing the Arab case a great deal of harm, especially in this country.Dr. Tannous asked when our next talk might take place. Could it be before the end of July 1I answered that I certainly had it in mind to see him again before the summer recess. I should speak to him then with complete frankness, as I knew that he would speak to me with complete frankness. I should probably say things with which he would strongly disagree, jiisf as he would say things with which I would no doubt disagree. But I felt sure that we would discuss the problem in a very friendly spirit.He replied that he thought such a talk would be very helpful. A frank and friendly discussion could do no harm and might do a lot of good.June 21.(6)I had a further talk with Dr. Tannous this morning. I said that in one of his recent notes to me he had raised two questions : The first concerned the Municipal Council of Jerusalem, where there was now an Arab minority owing to two of its members having had to leave the country. I had received a communi-cation from the High Commissioner in the last two or three days which indicated that he was giving the matter his personal attention with a view to taking some action which might help the position. Dr. Tannous expressed his thanks for this.The second point concerned the treatment of an Arab who had gone on hunger strike in the concentration camp at Acre, and who, it was alleged, had heen maltreated by some of the police in charge of the camp. I had received a report which indicated that an inquiry had failed to reveal any evidence of some of the violent treatment which had been alleged, such as that the prisoner had been beaten on the head. On the other hand, the authorities felt that the force used in the man&apos;s removal had exceeded what was necessary, but they were not able to fix blame precisely on one or other of the camp officers. However, I had heen assured that the authorities intended to take disciplinary action against their men in any such cases.Dr. Tannous said that what made his friends suspicious regarding this case was the fact that the authorities apparently could not discover the individual or individuals who had been guilty of using excessive force. Surely they could do so if they wished to.I said that I did not know what the local circumstances might be, but that I thought it possible in some cases that there would be confusion as to which officer was responsible. I could&apos;assure him that the British Administration were interested only in treating Arabs and Jews with impartial justice in Palestine. If a Jew broke the law, he would be punished in the same way as an Arab who
broke the law, and in the treatment of prisoners there was the same desire for impartiality.Dr. Tannous said that he hoped this would be displayed in all cases, for it would do something to restore Arab confidence in the British Administration.Turning to the general question of Palestine, I said that the Arabs some-times complained that they had very few friends in Parliament, whereas the Jews had many. I would not deny that the Jews, who lived in considerable numbers in London, had facilities for approaching Members of Parliament and others which were not shared by the Arabs, who were not present in large numbers in London. But I could assure him that the Arabs had many friends not only in London, but in the House of Commons itself, though they were rapidly losing them. I knew this, because during the last three or four weeks many individuals had come to me and told me that they had felt keen sympathy for the Arab case in Palestine until the outbreak of the campaign of Arab terrorism. I thought that the violence in which Arabs were indulging in Palestine just now had done their cause a great deal of harm, just as the retaliation which some of the extremist Jews were now embarked upon was doing their cause harm.Dr. Tannous said that he appreciated this. He and his friends earnestly desired the restoration of peace in Palestine. The only reason why so many of the Arabs were resorting to violent methods was their despair. The British Government had made up its mind to put through the policy of partitioning the Arabs&apos; own country. This was a terrible thing for his people to contemplate; they could never consent to the alienation of a part of their native land. But as we seemed determined on this, many Arabs felt that they must demonstrate their feelings by giving up their lives for their- country. That was why they were fighting in Palestine to-day. He said that the situation was all the more incom-prehensible to the Arabs because our proposal ignored so completely their interests. We had never listened to the Arab case against partition. We had decided upon our policy without consulting them. In that situation his people were filled with despair. If only we made an offer to postpone our decision on partition, and to consult with the Arabs with a view to working out some settle-ment which protected their interests, then there would be peace in Palestine.I replied that our conduct did not seem to me to be quite as he described it. Great Britain had been consistently friendly to the Arab peoples. It was largely as a result of our help to them in war and peace that they had achieved, since the Great War, almost everything which they had desired. There were various States in Arabia where they were sovereign. Over practically the whole of that country they ruled themselves without oppression or interference from any master. They were free. As for the position in Palestine, it could not be said that we had not consulted the xArabs. The Peel Commission went out to Palestine in order to meet the Arabs and the Jews on the spot and consider with them what our policy should be. The Arabs had been invited to give information and evidence, and to express their views as freely as they liked. To some extent they had accepted this invitation, and if they felt that they had not been able to discuss this problem sufficiently with the royal Commission, that was their own fault. They had boycotted the Commission during most of its time in Palestine. Nevertheless, the Commission had been at pains to get as much information as possible about Arab opinion, and it was only after considering this as well as other factors that they reached the conclusion that partition was the best solution. We had now sent a technical Commission to Palestine again for the very purpose of making contacts with the people of Palestine, and on this occasion, too, it was not the British Commission who refused to discuss with the Arabs, but the Arabs who refused to meet the Commission.Dr. Tannous said that he admitted the position regarding the Arabs outside Palestine. But as regards the Arabs inside Palestine, they could not discuss partition, for they were wholly opposed to it. They were ready to reach a peaceful settlement, and they were ready to go on living side by side with the Jews in Palestine as neighbours. They recognised that the two races had to live together. There were now 450,000 Jews in the country, and the Arabs were reconciled to accepting this large Jewish population in their country, and to giving them full rights as citizens. They could do this without partition. The Holy Land ought not to be divided, and whilst partition was the policy there would be no peace. Would not the British Government be prepared to let Palestine remain one country with Jews and Arabs living peacefully together?[17795] c 2
I answered that this was the policy which we had been pursuing for twenty years. But it had proved in the end not workable, except on conditions which we could not accept. We had given a pledge to the Jews that we would facilitate the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine, and we were also under an obligation to the League of Nations to carry that policy out. But at the same time we were pledged to pursue it without prejudicing the interests of the Arab population in Palestine. In order to safeguard these latter interests, we had adopted the policy of allowing only so much Jewish immigration as the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine at any time permitted. Immigration had been governed strictly by this principle, which meant that the economic interests of the Arabs were not to be prejudiced. In our view the interests of the Arabs and Jews in Palestine - did not clash; we could facilitate Jewish immigration and develop the country so that the Arab population did not suffer from the new people coming in. It was one of our keenest desires that the interests of the Arab population should be protected. The trouble was that the Arabs were opposed to any further Jewish immigration and to any further sale of lands to Jews in any circumstances. If we were to accept those conditions, then we should be failing to carry out our promise to the Jews and to the League of Nations. We would not break those promises, especially as their implementing wras consistent with our carrying out our promise to the Arab population. I said that if we returned to our old policy of governing the whole of Palestine as one mandated country, we should only be faced by periodic recurrences of the sort of Arab violence against Jews which we had experienced during recent years. That policy had definitely broken down, and therefore we were turning to the alternative policy of partition.Dr. Tannous said that he certainly did not advocate, as-the alternative to partition, a return to the old Mandate. That Mandate had been unworkable from the beginning. Surely we had learned by now that it was wrong to bring the Jews into Palestine, and that it only produced a racial clash which was unfortunate for everybody concerned. However, the Arabs were prepared to accept the present Jewish population in Palestine, and he even thought it possible later on, if the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine allowed it, that some additional Jewish immigration would be permitted. The Arabs would be ready to concede this, if they thought the economic absorptive capacity allowed it.I said that, if I understood him correctly, he was advocating the establish-ment of an Arab State of the whole of Palestine, in which the Arabs would decide whether further Jewish immigration should be allowed or not. In that case he and I had better admit frankly that not a single additional Jew would ever be allowed in Palestine. Whatever the economic absorptive capacity of the country, Arab nationalism had been so aroused that no Arab authority could ever consent to fresh Jewish immigration.Dr. Tannous agreed, and then suggested that a united Palestine might have a body composed of British, Arabs and Jews, who should together settle this question of immigration.I said that that proposal also was impracticable. The Jewish representatives -on the body to be set up would always clamour for a large Jewish immigration; the Arabs would always urge that no immigration should be allowed. There would never be any agreement on this point in a three-party committee. The only way of settling this question, if Palestine were to continue one country, was by the British who were impartial as between the two other parties retaining the decision. This was the practice of the last twenty years, and we had, in fact, been impartial. Every six months the Jews had a&quot;sked for a large schedule of immigrants, but our authorities had usually cut down their demands by at least 50 per cent. We were guided entirely by considerations of what Jewish immigration could take place without damaging the interests either of the Jews already in Palestine or of the Arab population. It might have been possible to continue this system, if the Arabs had really been willing to live at peace with the Jews in Palestine. But periodically the Arabs had broken out into violent action against the Jews or against the Government, and he knew as well as I did that if we were to resume the old system now, the old consequences would flow from it. Therefore, we had to turn to another solution, that recommended by the impartial Royal Commission. The solution which he himself advocated, which in effect meant that there should be no more Jewish immigration into Palestine whatever the economic absorptive capacity, was impossible, because it meant the British Government breaking pledges which it had solemnly given.
Continuing, I said that it seemed to me that the policy of partition offered considerable advantages to the Arabs themselves. As 1 had already said, we had been one of the most powerful instruments in giving the peoples of Arabia generally what they wanted in the way of freedom and sell-government. We were now contemplating that a part of Palestine itself should be added to this great area where the Arabs were a sovereign people. Moreover, we would give assistance to the Arabs of this country in its development, so that their well-being would steadily increase. If they desired closer union with other Arab countries, we would be friendly to that desire.Dr. Tannous replied that the Jews would not be content with their small State. The Arabs knew&apos; only too well what were the ambitions of the Zionists. They would constantly want to push beyond their State by immigration into neighbouring Arab countries. At the same time the Arabs would nurse their grudge against the Jews for having taken a part of their country from them, and they would only await an opportunity of reconquering the territory. There-fore partition held out no prospect of peace in Palestine.I answered that I appreciated the Arab fear of Zionist ambitions. It seemed to me that one of the greatest advantages of the partition proposal from the Arab point of view was that a limit would be set to Jewish expansion. The Jews would be free within the borders of their own State; they could bring into that area as many immigrants as they wished. But Jewish immigrants into the surrounding Arab countries would be forbidden, unless, of course, the Arab authorities in those countries desired it and agreed that it should take place. There could be no question of aggression by the Jews against their neighbours, for the British would be there to protect the Arabs against any such attack, just as they would help to protect the Jewish,State against attack.Dr. Tannous said that his people were afraid of dominance by the Jews: the latter were powerful and energetic, and they certainly meant to spread over the Near East. The idea of a Jewish National Home had never been given any limits. Where was it to stop? The Jews were now being persecuted in Europe, and the Zionists wanted to bring all the persecuted Jews into Palestine. But there was no room for them there, and Jewish ambitions could only be realised by the population spilling over and swamping other territories.I said that I agreed that there was no room for the whole persecuted Jewish population in Palestine. The Jewish National Home had never been conceived as a place where the whole Jewish people could settle, and I repeated that one of the great virtues of the partition proposal from the Arab point of view was that it set limits to Jewish settlement in Palestine, and offered a guarantee of those limits. The area which would go to the Jews was, I understood, about the size of Devonshire.Dr. Tannous urged that the Jews had already got all that they could expect in the way of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. It had become a centre of Jewish culture, where the spirit of the Jewish people could find a resting place. The National Home should have a spiritual rather than a physical character. If we encouraged any other conception, then the Jews would never be satisfied until millions of them had been settled in the Home.I assured Dr. Tannous that no one in the Government or, so far as I knew, in Parliament thought that there was room for all the persecuted Jewish popula-tion in Palestine. At the Evian Conference and elsewhere we steadily and publicly resisted any such suggestion. We had said that immigration to Palestine must not be regarded as a solution of the Jewish problem in Europe. Only a limited number of Jews would ever find room there. But there was room, given, economic development in the country, for more Jews than there were to-day, and so long as that was the position we were bound to facilitate a reasonable amount of Jewish immigration.The discussion continued on these points for an hour, and was cordial throughout. Dr. Tannous said two or three times at the end of the conversation that he hoped that when the Woodhead Commission came back to London we would consider the situation with them with an open mind, and reject partition, and invite an Arab delegation to come to London for the purpose of negotiation. He felt that such a gesture would bring immediate peace in Palestine, and that, as a result, a happy solution of the problem of future policy would be reached.I was as obstinate as he was in refusing to alter my position. I said that I hoped that before our next talk he would re-read the section of the Peel Report
in which the arguments in favour of partition from the Arab as well as the Jewish point of view were set forth. He replied, with a laugh, that, if I wished, he would recite that section of the Report to me straight away, for he had read it so often.I suggested that we- should have a further talk soon after the return of the Woodhead Commission. He replied that he would welcome this, but that he was anxious to return to Palestine fairly soon, and we agreed to meet on the 10th August. I understand that he is going back to Palestine for a brief visit, and that he will return to London later on.July 19.MI saw Dr. Tannous to-day, when I explained to him that the purpose of my visit to Jerusalem had been to get first-hand information on the spot from the High Commissioner and General Haining regarding the present situation in Palestine. We had surveyed the security position, and I could assure him that there would be no slackening in our plans to overcome terrorism. I had discussed with the High Commissioner certain questions regarding procedure in connection with the Report of the Woodhead Commission, but rumours that we had discussed the possibility of a change in British policy could be discounted.Dr. Tannous said that he was very glad that I had gone to Palestine. It would impress his people with the great interest which we here took in their country, and he thought that the brief statement which I had issued on leaving would help the moderate Arabs. The High Commissioners broadcast appeal for peace would also have its effect in time. He was afraid that peace would not be restored at once in Palestine; feeling was far too hard and bitter for that; but he and most of his people earnestly desired peace. They were deeply distressed at the present situation. He wondered whether we could not do something more to restore calmer conditions. He appreciated that nothing new could be said or done for some time to come regarding major policy. The Government had made its position perfectly clear on the issue of partition, and we should all have to wait now for the report of the Woodhead Commission. There would be no criticism of us for refraining from any additional statement in the meantime. The delay was unfortunate, and it did make the task of those who wished to restore peace difficult; but it was inevitable. But could we not do something in matters of minor policy which would have its effect on the Arabs ?I asked Dr. Tannous whether he had any particular suggestions to make.He replied that he would make two suggestions. The first was that we should let the Mufti and the other exiles return to Palestine. He could assure me that this would have an excellent effect. The Mufti and the others were not extremists, they did not approve of the terrorism which was going on. Of course, they felt strongly about the injustice which had been done to the Arabs in Palestine, but they had always tried to restrain their followers. For instance, when Mr. Andrews had been murdered, the Arab Higher Committee had issued a statement expressing their horror and dissociating themselves from the crime. This murder had been the start of the latest wave of terrorism, and all that had followed was the work of similar extremists. If the Mufti and other Arab leaders could be brought back, their influence would be very powerful on the side of restoring order.The second suggestion which he wished to make was that before the Govern-ment made up its mind finally on policy, following the publication of the Woodhead Commission^ Report, there should be further discussions with repre-sentatives of the Arabs. He and his friends had a real grievance in that we had not consulted them, but had decided our policy with the knowledge that it was directly opposed to their- wishes. 1 Pie thought it had been a mistake to publish the Peel recommendation in favour of partition and the Government&apos;s acceptance of that policy on one and the same day, without any attempt at sounding the Arabs. If the Arabs now&quot; felt that they would be given a chance of expressing their views to the Government before final conclusions were reached, they would not feel so desperate, and would recognize that they could perhaps rely on something else besides physical force to make their feelings known to His Majesty&apos;s Government.
I replied that the Government were anxious to do anything that they could which would be really helpful in the situation. But I could hold out no hope whatever of agreeing to his first proposal. I appreciated that he and I took a different view as to the responsibility of the Mufti and his colleagues for the campaign of violence in Palestine. I did not say that they were, responsible for every individual act which had been committed. But that they had encouraged and authorised the campaign in general I had no doubt. We had plenty of information on that point. Indeed, it seemed obvious to me that the campaign was still at this moment being encouraged from a source outside Palestine. Terrorism could not continue without that encouragement. The bandits had to be organised and supported, they had to have the wherewithal to recruit villagers to join in their work. Money and arms were being collected from various sources, their distribution was organised mainly from one centre. I had no doubt as to who had been and was still mainly responsible for the campaign of violence which was disgracing the Arab cause. It might be that people would come to me and say that if these leaders were allowed back to Palestine they would mend their ways, and really use their influence for peace. I would tell him frankly that I would not trust the word of the leaders who had been exiled, and I would not in any circumstances be responsible for their return now to Palestine.Dr. Tannous asked whether it would not be possible for the leaders to return later on.- If they could not come back for negotiations, did that mean that they were to be in exile for all time ?I replied that that was another matter. I could not give him an answer on the point. It might be that when a settlement had been reached and that settle-ment had been put into effect and peace had been restored, some of the exiles might return. I was making no promise, and indeed had hardly considered the matter. We all had more urgent work to do. I could say definitely that there was no prospect of their return before peaceful conditions had been re-established. With regard to Dr. Tannous&apos; second proposal, I had a more open mind. I was perfectly ready to consider it, and indeed had already given it some thought. I would like discussions to take place between Arab representatives and represen-tatives of the Government before policy was finally settled, if such discussions were practicable and might prove helpful. I would wish, however, to make two things clear straight away. In the first place the fact that I was considering the possibility of this did not mean that I was changing my mind on partition. I had always spoken emphatically to him on this, and I thought there was no misunderstanding between us. (Dr. Tannous assented.) However, I thought it-right that the Arabs should be able to express their views quite frankly to us before final decisions were taken. The second point that I must emphasise was that, if such discussions were possible at all, they should not be protracted. The worst element in the Palestine situation was the uncertainty as to policy, and so long as that uncertainty lasted all sorts of people would think they could still upset policy by causing trouble. It was important that there should be as little delay as possible between the publication of the Woodhead Report and the Governments announcement of policy. If discussions proved possible, I thought that there should be some understanding before they started as to how long they should continue. If they had not yielded results within two or three weeks they should be broken off altogether. Certainly they were not to be used for spinning out the present period of uncertainty. But I asked Dr. Tannous whether it would be possible for Arab representatives to come to any such conference if it were known that the Government adhered to the principle of partition.Dr. Tannous said that this would require very careful consideration. Arabs certainly could not come if by coming they themselves were to be committed to accepting partition. He thought we could overcome that difficulty somehow. He begged me to invite Arab representatives to come and discuss with us, even if we were irrevocably committed to partition. The very fact of discussions would do good, even though they might prove fruitless. The Arabs deeply resented not having been taken into consultation hitherto.I replied that I could not agree that they had not been consulted. We had been consulting them continuously for a long period of years. Our High Commissioners had kept in touch with their representatives, and of late the Peel Commission and the Wbodhead Commission had made every effort to hear the views of Arabs fully. I need not go into all that again. I would make no promise now that there would be further discussions; these might be quite inappropriate,
and much would depend on the Arabs themselves. But I would bear his suggestion in mind. In the meantime I thought that he should treat this part of our conversation as completely confidential, and not repeat its substance to his friends.Dr. Tannous agreed to this. He said that he would be returning to Palestine in the next few days. He was anxious to go there for family reasons, and to get in touch with his friends there. He was contemplating making an appeal to them to use their influence to end Arab terrorism. He did not know whether he would do this or not.  The moderates had to walk warily.I said that he must judge the situation for himself when he arrived in Palestine, and any appeal that he1 made would have to be made on his own responsibility. He understood my position on policy, and I need not repeat it. But he must know from his stay in London how great had been the effect of Arab terrorism on opinion here. It had lost the Arabs many of their friends. Such instances as the cold-blooded stabbing of women and children; the murder of Mr. Starkie, the distinguished archaeologist; and scores of other crimes against innocent people had left a stain on the reputation of the Palestinian Arabs which it would take a long time to erase. This campaign was the worst of all arguments for the Arab cause. Anything that Dr. Tannous could do to check it would be not only a service to everybody interested in peace in Palestine, but also a great service to his own people.He replied that he would remember this, but that he would have to consider the situation carefully when he got to Jerusalem. He hoped to see the High Commissioner there, and if there was anything that he thought I ought to know, he would send me the information. He expected to be back in London some time in October, but would return earlier if I thought he could be of any use. He said that his talks with me had been a very great help, and that the fact that they had taken place would do good.August 12.III.Mahmoud Pasha.The Egyptian Prime Minister called on me this afternoon to speak about Palestine. He said that he wished me to know that feeling in Egypt against our policy in Palestine was growing stronger and stronger, and that it was disturbing the friendly feeling towards Great Britain. He was very anxious about the situation, especially as he felt that it would get worse. The critical attitude towards Great Britain was not confined to the public in Egypt. The same hostility was being roused in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. He had a talk with the Viceroy of India the other evening, when Lord Linlithgow told him that Moslem opinion in India also was becoming steadily more critical of our Palestine policy.I said that I welcomed the opportunity of a talk with him, and was grateful for his telling me of the feeling in his country. All of us here would deplore that any policy of ours should disturb the friendly feelings between our two peoples. But the Palestine problem was not an easy one, and I could well appreciate that the situation there was a. matter of concern to his countrymen. I wondered what he proposed that we should do in order to improve the situation.He said that we ought to get the Arabs and Jews round a conference table and get an agreed settlement. Unfortunately we had deported some of the Arab leaders to the Seychelles, and others had had to fly the country. This had been a great mistake. It was&apos; not the first time that we had committed this error, for in the past we had deported Egyptian political leaders, and leaders from other countries. In the end&apos;&quot; there. was no peace until we brought them back and negotiated with them. Therefore he thought that we should offer these Arab leaders and the Jewish leaders a conference, and he was confident that as a result there would be a peaceful end, to the Palestine problem. But, of course. Jewish immigration into Palestine would have to be stopped during the period of the conference.  That was an essential preliminary to negotiation.
I said that nothing would please me better than a settlement agreed between the Arabs and the Jews. I was a firm believer in the policy of conducting inter-national relations by different peoples sitting down to confer as equals, in a spirit of reason, so that difficulties were resolved by peaceful agreements. But I could not share his confidence that a conference between Arabs and Jews on Palestine, even with us in the Chair, would have such a happy conclusion. The Arabs would wish for the permanent stoppage of Jewish immigration, whilst the Jews would want unrestricted immigration. 1 Even if both sides moved a little way from their original position, the gulf between them would still be so wide that there was in fact no chance of them agreeing.He said that a few days ago he had a talk with Lord Samuel, who put before him the proposal that the Jewish population should be allowed to increase until it was 40 per cent, of the total population. He thought that some proposal on those lines should be sought. Probably the Arabs would not agree to the Jewish population being as much as 40 per cent., but they might agree to 35 per cent., or something a little less.I answered that I was sure he was right in saying that the Arabs would not agree to 40 per cent., and that they might not agree to 35 per cent. The Jewish population was already some 30 per cent, of the total population in Palestine, and I did not think the Palestinian Arabs would agree to anything more than that. So much for the Arab position at a conference. The Jews, on the other hand, would not agree to 40 per cent., because they would want it to be something higher. So there really was no chance of the two parties emerging from a conference with a settlement. It would fall to the British Government in the end to make up its mind what the right policy was, and then to impose it.The Egyptian Ambassador intervened to say that, even if this were true, the conference would do good, because it would make the Arabs feel that they had had a chance to put forward their case. At present they did not feel that; they were not listened to.I answered that we had done our best to hear the Arab point of view. The Royal Commission had gone out to Palestine precisely that it might get into touch with the Arabs as well as the Jews there, and advise us on policy after hearing everything the Arabs wished to say and giving it careful and sympathetic con-sideration. But until a few days before the Commission left Palestine, the Arabs had flatly refused to meet the Commission. Under those circumstances it certainly had been difficult to hear the Arab point of view, but that was not our fault. However, we did know the Arab point of view well, for successive High Commissioners had been constantly in touch with it, and, so far as I was concerned, I missed no opportunity of listening to Arab representations here. I had had the benefit of two or three talks with Dr. Tannous, who was at present representing the Palestinian Arabs in London. And these talks confirmed several other pieces of evidence which showed that at the end of any conference between the Arabs and the Jews there would be wide disagreement, and it would be left for the British Government to decide what the policy should be. We were anxious to decide on a policy which would bring peace in Palestine and incidentally relieve the Egyptian Prime Minister of his anxieties. I did not think that such a policy was to be found by a renewal of the old policy of treating Palestine as a whole and permitting restricted Jewish immigration into the whole territory. Sooner or later there would be fresh Arab violence against Jewish immigration, however small. We had tried this policy for the last twenty years, and periodically it produced that result. Therefore, we were favourable to the Royal Commission^ solution of partition, which meant that Jewish immigration would be limited to one part of Palestine and could not take place at all in the other part.Mahmoud Pasha said that if we adopted the policy of partition we should never have peace. The Arabs of Palestine were firm in their opposition to it. Perhaps it did not matter very much what the Arabs of Palestine felt. But it would matter if people in Egypt and other neighbouring countries, and the Moslems in India, were not reconciled to our policy. He was afraid that partition would lose us these valuable friends.I said that I could fully appreciate the feelings of the sympathisers with the Arabs in Palestine. I greatly disliked the policy of partitioning a country. But the alternative in this case I had already sketched to him. Moreover, I really wondered whether partition was not the wisest policy from the point of view of[17795] d
IV.Sir Reader Bullard.I had a talk with Sir Reader Bullard this afternoon. I said that it was impossible yet to say what His Majesty&apos;s Governments ultimate policy regarding Palestine would be. A great deal would depend on the contents of the Woodhead Commission^ Report. But in the meantime at any rate the proposal for partition put forward by the Peel Commission held the field, and we had announced publicly that we accepted this policy as the best and most hopeful solution to the deadlock which had arisen. I personally felt strongly that it was the wisest policy, if practicable. I knew, however, that it had aroused the strongest possible hostility amongst the Palestinian Arabs, which had communicated itself to other countries beyond, including Saudi Arabia. The views of neighbouring Govern-ments were naturally of great concern to us, and we attached particular importance to Ibn Saud&apos;s. attitude. I had studied carefully Sir Reader&apos;s despatches on this subject; and had in mind his strong expressions of opinion that if we proceeded with the policy of partition we might find that this was the turning point so far as our relations with Saudi Arabia were concerned, and that Ibn Saud might change from a good friend to a reluctant potential enemy. I said I should be grateful if he could tell me more about the situation.Sir Reader Bullard replied that he himself had been in favour of partition in Palestine, and that he had hoped that the arguments in its favour might prevail with Ibn Saud.  He had endeavoured to put them forcibly to the Saudithe Arabs generally. It seemed to me that what they were chiefly afraid of was Jewish domination not only in Palestine, but beyond it. They wondered at present whether there was any limit to the Jewish National Home. They feared that unless some check was put upon Jewish immigration, the Jews would steadily increase until they dominated the whole of Palestine; afterwards they would flow over into neighbouring countries, and by their industry and wealth establish themselves securely. Their apprehension about this was understandable, and it seemed to me that one of the virtues of the partition proposal was that it, for the first time, set a definite and severe limit to the Jewish National Home. Certainly Jewish immigration into the Jewish State would be unrestricted, save in so far as the Jews themselves found it necessary to place restrictions upon it. But outside their State, which was a place about the size of Devonshire, no Jewish immigra-tion would be allowed at all, unless, of course, the Arab authorities wished it. The Arabs would not be left alone to resist any Jewish threat outside the Jewish State; if the Jews wished to expand, and their Arab neighbours wanted to resist this expansion, the Jews would not have to face the Arab peoples alone, but the Arabs with the support of the British Government.Though I think that this was a fresh argument to the Prime Minister, and he was evidently rather struck by it, he was far from satisfied by it. He repeated again that partition would not bring peace in Palestine. On the contrary, it would create permanent resentment and permanent unrest. He reiterated that his main concern was the state of feeling in Egypt, and that this was giving him real anxiety. He hoped that I would have a talk with Sir Miles Lampson when he came home, for he knew that Sir Miles agreed with him on this.I said that I would certainly have a talk with Sir Miles, and repeated that I was very grateful to him for letting me know so frankly his own views. I would keep them very much in mind, and could assure him that the Cabinet would keep them in mind. But in all the circumstances I felt that the policy of partition and of setting at last a limit which the Jews themselves would accept on their expansion in Palestine offered the best chance of an ultimately peaceful settlement of the problem.Though our talk was friendly, I fear that the Prime Minister thought me very obstinate and wrong-headed. But I felt it was essential that I, for my part, should speak in such a way that he could not afterwards tell his friends that I was wavering on partition and ready to consider something else. A word from him to this effect would go swiftly through Palestine, and be an encourage-ment to the Arab terrorists to redouble their efforts.July 29.
Arabian authorities. But he had to admit that their reception had been far from good. Ibn saud did not like partition. Moreover, this sentiment was shared widely in the Arabian world, and Ibn Saud was placed in a very difficult position on this account. He was constantly being pressed to help the cause of the Palestinian Arabs openly and definitely. He had so far restrained those who urged this, but he could not do this beyond a certain point without losing much of his authority in the Arab world. Other Arab leaders were ready to be more bold than he was in this matter. Sir Reader said that he found it difficult to speak with any confidence as to what might happen if we did go through with the policy of partition. But he thought the chance of Ibn Saud being definitely alienated from us was sufficiently great for us to pay it great heed.I said that I had shared the hope which he, with his great knowledge of the Arab world, apparently entertained in the early stages of this business, that the Governments neighbouring Palestine might be persuaded at least to acquiesce in the policy of partition. I still wondered whether we could not succeed in convincing them that partition was the wisest policy in the interests of the Arabs themselves. What they all seemed to fear was Jewish domination in Palestine and throughout the Near East. At present they had no guarantee against this; the Jewish National Home might go on expanding indefinitely. But the proposal for partition which had been sketched in the Peel Report might be carried out in a way which gave the Arabs an assurance on this matter. A limit to the expansion of the Jewish National Home in Palestine would be set by the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State. Beyond it Jewish immigration would not be allowed, except with the consent of any Government concerned. The Jewish State suggested in the Peel Report amounted to a comparatively small country, which was a minute fraction compared to the vast territories of the Arab States.Sir Reader agreed that the main trouble was the Arab fear of Jewish domination, but he said that their confidence in our power or willingness to insure them against this had been hopelessly shaken.I asked him whether he thought that Ibn Saud really appreciated how severe a limit the partition proposal would set to Jewish expansion in Palestine. I naturally anticipated that a part of any settlement involving the establishment of a Jewish State the boundaries of which were accepted by the Jews, would be guarantees that Jewish immigration beyond those bounds would not take place, except if any Government concerned beyond the Jewish State wished it. The British Government would be a party to these arrangements, and so far as we were concerned, we should regard the establishment of such a State as a complete fulfilment of our obligations to the Jews under the Balfour Declaration. We would not press for further Jewish immigration, and the whole Arab world as well as the whole Jewish world would be aware of this fact. The alternative was the continuation of something like the present state of affairs, which contained no guarantee to the Arabs as to any final limit to be set to Jewish expansion, and involved presumably continual friction and trouble in Palestine, with its resultant embarrassments to Ibn Saud as well as ourselves.Sir Reader Bullard said that this was a fresh point to him. It might make a difference to Ibn Saud if all this were made clear and definite. But he did not feel confident that it would be so. Feeling in the Arab world wras set strongly against partition, and this feeling would take a great deal of upsetting now. He repeated that Ibn Saud was in a very difficult position, and said that so far the King had behaved with as much friendliness to us as was possible.I said that during the next two months, whilst policy was being considered and decided here, we in the Colonial Office would of course work in close co-operation with the Foreign Office. I did not know what the Governments final conclusions might be, nor what action the Foreign Office might ask him to take arising out of our decisions. But, in any case, I was as anxious as anyone that we should keep in close touch with Ibn Saud and make his position as little difficult as possible. Indeed, Ibn Saud&apos;s opinions were one of the many important factors in the situation which would have their influence on our policy. We would continue the practice of letting Ibn Saud have as much information as possible regarding our policy, and almost certainly the Foreign Office would ask him to make contacts with Ibn Saud during the autumn, before our policy was announced, perhaps even before it was finally decided upon.  The present period[17795] e
of waiting for the Woodhead Commission^ Report before we could make much more progress in working out policy was a great nuisance, but it was inevitable.Sir Reader said that one of the difficulties in the situation in Saudi Arabia was that he was out of touch with the King for many months of the year. The King would be away during the autumn months, and when he was inaccessible like that it was difficult to influence him. He then came under other, and not always helpful, influences.August 3.;   v.Sir John Woodhead.I had a talk with Sir John Woodhead, the Chairman of the Technical Corn-mission, this morning. He told me that the Commission would probably present an Interim Report in the first place. Their terms of reference were very wide, and included the working out of details regarding financial administration, the organisation of railways, &amp;c, in Palestine under a scheme of partition. The working out of some of these details would take months, and they would depend to a large extent on exactly what the scheme of partition was to be. It would be a waste of the Commission^ time to work out a lot of these details on the assump-tion that the particular scheme of partition which they were to recommend was going to be accepted, if it turned out that that scheme ultimately was not accepted. Moreover, in order to work out these details they would have to consult a large number of officials in the local Administration and in the Railways and elsewhere in Palestine. Such consultation would mean that so many people in Palestine knew of the particular scheme of partition which was under examina-tion that it would be impossible to keep the Commission^ proposals a secret. In these circumstances he and his colleagues thought it best to present an Interim Report, which should draw the main lines of a scheme of partition and contain sufficient material on finance and other questions to make it clear that the scheme was a practicable one. Afterwards, if the scheme were officially adopted they could go on to work out the further details.He thought that the earliest date by which they could let me have this Interim Report was October 1, and it might be after that.I agreed that the method of presenting an Interim Report which they had in mind was sound, and added that I hoped it would be possible for it to be presented by October 1. I could well understand that the Commission had an immense amount of work to get through, but Sir John would appreciate the importance of bringing the present period of uncertainty to an end as soon as possible. If they really needed more time, no one would grudge it to them, and indeed everyone would understand the magnitude of their task. I certainly did not wish to hurry them unduly, but it seemed to me that October 1 would be a very suitable date. It would give the Government a month for consultations and consideration of policy amongst themselves before Parliament reassembled. Presumably it would take as long as that for the translation into Arabic and Hebrew of the Report and for its printing and publication.Sir John said that he understood that five weeks would be required for this process.I asked him whether he and his colleagues would be able to let me have private information concerning their conclusions before they presented their report. On the assumption that the written document would be in my hands on October 1, I assumed that they would know at least the main lines of their recommendations,by about the middle of September, or at any rate well before the beginning of October. It would be extremely useful to me if I could have from them an indication of their proposals in the middle of September. The Government would have to do a great deal of hard thinking from the moment that the Commission had informed them of their conclusions. We should have to engage in consultations with the Administration in Palestine, and perhaps with various other interested parties, before we finally determined our policy. If we could be. getting on with this from the middle of September onwards, we should save some valuable time.
in Sir John Woodhead saw our difficulty about this. But he said that he and his colleagues were extremely anxious to avoid any suggestion that they were consulting the Colonial Office as to what their recommendations should be. Indeed, some members of the Commission had been critical of his coming and seeing me at all. He thought that they might well take the line that they could not tell me anything until the report was placed in my hands.I replied that I appreciated their anxiety to avoid any idea of their being unduly influenced by the Colonial Office. I was equally anxious to avoid any suggestion of that. But the Government would have a very difficult task to perform from the moment that they knew of the Woodhead recommendations onwards, and I hoped that the Commission would help us as far as possible in performing that task. I thought there would be no difficulty about my coming and dining privately with them one evening as soon as they had made up their minds on their recommendations, when my sole purpose would be to seek informa-tion from them. I would make no comments on that information. But the information would enable me to be getting ahead with work which otherwise would have to be postponed for a week or a fortnight.Sir John said he would put this to his colleagues, but it was evident to me that he rather disliked the suggestion.   I will return to the charge later on.August 16.
