THIS4 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BBITAJMIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRETCP .176(38) Copy Ho.  U &amp;SCOTTISH ADMINISTRATION. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.      In November 1936 my predecessor set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir John Gilmour to enquire into,and report upon the duties and organisation of certain Scottish Departments under the control of the Secretary of State and to recommend what changes, if any, should be made, keeping in view the prospective concentration of Departments in one building in Edinburgh.      (This refers to the building now being erected on Calton Hill, Edinburgh).     The Committee reported in September 1937.      Some of their recommendations require legislation though most of their proposals do not.2.      The aim of the Committee was to improve the organisation of the Scottish Departments and to facilitate the concentration of Scottish administration in the new building.      Under their proposals there would be four major Departments in Edinburgh, namely, the existing Departments of Agriculture, Education and Health,  and a Scottish Home Department which would replace the present Scottish Office;     These Departments would be equal in status and each would be in charge of a Secretary directly responsible to the Secretary of State for the work of his department i      The organisation of certain smaller Departments would be improved by associating them more closely with one or other of the larger Departments.     Appropriate arrangements would be made for the discharge by officers of the Departments concerned of work which requires to be done in London,  including Parliamentary andliaison work.     The Secretary of State would have available to assist him an officer of high rank who, the Committee suggests, might be designated &quot;Permanent Secretary to the Secretary of State&quot;.3.      The Committees summary of its recommendations will be found in the Appendix to this Memorandum.      The proposals requiring legislation
are marked with an asterisk.     These proposals, with which I am in agreement may he summarised as follows(a) The abolition of the Departments of Agriculture,  Health and Prisons as statutory entities and the vesting of their functions in the Secretary of State.     The possession by these Departments of statutory-powers, distinct from those of the Secretary of State, has no advantage and involves practical difficulties.(b) The abolition of the present arrangement, under which the Scottish Education Department is nominally a Committee of the Privy Council, and the vesting of the Departments functions in the Secretary of State.      The Committee is now composed of the Lord President of the Council, the First Lord of the Treasury, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate.      It has not met since 1913 and my colleagues agree with me that its continued existence serves no useful purpose .(c) The abolition of the Fishery Board and its replacement by a Fisheries Division of the Scottish Home Department aided by a Statutory Advisory Council representing the fishing interests.(d) The reconstitution of the General Board of Control which administers the law in Scotland relating to lunacy and mental deficiency The main change recommended is the substitution of a whole-time Civil Servant for the present part-time Chairman.      The new Chairman would be an officer of the Department of Health in order to bring about closer association between the administration of mental and physical health services.The Treasury agree to these proposals . 4.      In regard to the recommendations that do not require legislation, the most important is that relating to the appointment of an officer of high rank to assist the Secretary of State to which reference is made in paragraph 2 above.      I agree that a chief adviser is required who could take a wider view than the Secretaries in charge of Departments, and who could assist in co-ordinating their work. On the other hand,  I see no reason for adopting the title for this
post of &quot;Permanent Secretary to the Secretary of State&quot; suggested &quot;by the Committee, and I would propose to retain the title of &quot;Permanent Under Secretary of State for Scotland&quot; which now is held by the permanent head of the Scottish Office.     The Treasury share this view.5.     The Committee were 1 instructed to keep in view the prospective concentration of Departments in one building in Edinburgh, namely, the new Government building on Calton Hill.     This will not be ready for occupation until the autumn of 1939*     It is essential that before that date the necessary preparations shall have been made which will enable the Departments, as soon as they enter into occupation of the new building, to function on the lines of the organisation recommended by the Committee.     In regard to some of the proposals,  it may not be possible to make effective preparations until the legislation has been passed.     The Bill should therefore&quot; become an Act not later than the 31st December next.      I should accordingly be glad to have authority to prepare a Bill for submission to the Committee of Home Affairs.6.     I am being pressed in the House of Commons to state the Government&apos;s attitude towards the Committee&apos;s recommendations and in reply I have expressed the hope that I shall be able to do so before the House rises.      I should therefore be glad to make a statement to the effect that the Government agree generally with the proposals of the Committee and that it is their intention to submit legislation early next Session so that the new organisation of the Scottish Departments contemplated by the Committee can be in operation as soon as it is possible to occupy the new Government building on Calton Hill, Edinburgh.J.
