annic IV?ajaj6sty&apos;s Government)SBCKETDepartment of Information1 r kw^&amp;fcfy Report on NorwayIntelligence Bureau82, Victoria Street GNW/002(November 29th 1917)Debate on fforeign Policy in the Storting Uov.ll)The ohief interest of this debate was a great attack on the Government in oonnexion with the food question - now the most 1m-portant of all public matters in Scandinavian countries.    The principal grievance of the Opposition was the delay on the part of the Government in making public the Memorandum from the U.S. Government of July 24 last.    The neglect to warn the country of the Blockade Policy of America was asserted to be the chief reason that timely measures had not been adopted to deal with the food shortage, the scarcity of provisions being much more serious than was generally supposed^    The explanation for the delay was that the Memorandum reached the Norwegian\Legation at Washington while the Minister was absent in New York to meet the Norwegian Delegation then in America to discuss eoonomio matters.    Its oon-tents were subsequently submitted to the Delegation which decided that it had no important bearing on the negotiations.    The Op-position was not satisfied with this explanation and while empha-sizing the mistake made by the Government in not publishing the American Memorandum as soon as possible demanded a change in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the dismissal of the Minister of Supplies, Mr Vik.    Several of the Opposition members took up the point of view that it was better that Norway should preserve her solidarity with the other Scandinavian countries even if it meant starvation rather than risk her neutrality by obtaining food through negotiation with America,    During the course of the Debate it
-2-became clear that the principal person attacked was the Minister of Supplies whose policy was characterised, as being a complete failure.   It was in vain that the Premier and others defended \&apos;r Vik and pointed out that Norway would not starve as there was plenty of fish and potatoes in the country.     The Leader of the Labour Democrats moved a resolution deploring that the Govem-ment had not kept the public better informed of the state of the supply of vital necessaries and that a stronger control of the provisions in the country was needed.   At an afternoon sitting it was decided for the present to put off the consideration of this resolution;   but the upshot of the debate was ultimately the resignation of the Minister of Supplies.The criticism and general attitude of the Press on this debate shows that there are two leading opinions in Norway as to foreign policy.   One party holds that Norway should gravitate towards the v;estern Powers, make a Commercial Treaty with America and break commercially with Germany and her sister Scandinavian States. The rival party would at all costs maintain solidarity with the other Scandinavian States, thereby promoting closer relations with the Central Powers.Feeling in Norway.Meanwhile the feeling against Germany, already intense, is kept at white heat by the repeated discoveries of cases of sabotage, incendiarism etc, by German spies, a number of whom are awaiting trial.Probably no one who has not lived in neutral countries during the war can adequately realise the army of German agents employed in them.   The Scandinavian mind is essentially slow in working and it is probably only after three years of war that the Norwegians
!29.11.17.have at length awakened to the danger in their midst.     It is, of course, true that the German agents have gradually become, if not more numerous,much more aggressive.   It would be useless here to give details of the cases now about to come before the Tribunals; but one serious matter, probably connected, if not directly at least indirectly, with espionage, is the existence of the notorious Z.E.G. or Zentral Einkauf Gesellschaft, which, ostensibly a Monopoly Company for the purchase of fish and tinned goods for Germany, is, as many Norwegians believe, the centre of the German spy system.   This institution has its ramifications all over the country, especially in the coast towns.   It is extensively believed in Norway that the 2.E.G. keeps the German Government carefully informed of the sailings of ships and that it has some means of communicating with the submarines.   It is hardly necessary to say that the Directors of the Z.E.G. indignantly deny all knowledge of espionage.    Whatever truth they may or may not be in the charges made against that Institution, what is certain is that Germans are setting up great businesses all over Scandinavia and that at the end of the war Norway, Sweden and Denmark may find themselves face to face with something like the old Hanseatio League on a much more formidable scale.   Is it possible that, despairing of an Eastern and Colonial Empire, Germany hopes to reooup herself for her lost &quot;Weltmacht&quot; in Russia and the Baltic?     It Is a common practice of the Germans to carry on espionage through commercial and tourist agencies.     The &quot;Berne Travellers Agency&quot; is a glaring instance.   Its   Director actually became a Swiss citizen for the purposes of covering his real profession.   He had been a spy for years.
