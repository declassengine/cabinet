Admiralty Memorandum by the First Lord for the War Cabinet,The Admiralty have proceeded with the preparations referred to in paragraph 37 of the Report of the Cabinet Committee on HThe Position of the Northern neutral Countries&quot;.Reliable information has, however, now been received that the Dutch have recently sent large numbers of troops into Walcheren and have expelled all civilians except those domiciled in the. Island,   It is stated that these measures have boon taken owing to the fear of British troops boing sent to occupy the Island, and it is reasonable to expect, therefore, that so long as Holland does not join the Central Powers she would also oppose an occupation of the Island by the enemy.Under these circumstances, it seems hardly necessary to proceed further with the preparations referred to, and it issuggested that this He -orandum should be referred to the before-mentioned Committee for consideration.(signed)   ERIC GHJDDES.3rd December 1917,
