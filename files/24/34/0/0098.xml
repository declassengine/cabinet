Iy57WAR L,OABIffET^ MILK PRODUCTION IN 1918 - 1919.Notes &quot;by the Chairman of the Committee on Production and Distribution of Milk.As stated in the Second Interim Report of the Milk Committee, no milk famine need be anticipated during the winter of 1917-1918, provided concentrated feeding staffs are properly distributed, and provided no new factors arise.   Local shortages of a remediable end so temporary character-are probable.    In addition to the normal increase in the milk yield which begins in February, measures have already been taken to make more milk available foe? the rest of this winter (a-g., prohibition of the use of cream and of the manufacture of milk &quot;chocolate).    Other recommendations have also been&apos;made.The&apos; Jlilk Committee are carefully examining the position for the winter 1918-19 when the situation may be far less satis -factory.    The main factors which may prejudice the output and supply of milk during the winter 1918-19 are  :-(l) The uncertainty as to the prices producers will receive during the summer of 1918 and the winter of 1918-19 respectively. (This must affect the number of milch cows next winter).(2) The uncertainty as to the quantity and prices of feeding stuffs available for the winter 1918-19.(3) The changed outlook of British farming.   With security from foreign competition assured for.corn growing, some farmers may be tempted to abandon dairying with its early and Jong hours, coupled with Saturday and Sunday labour.   Many farmers are middle-aged or old men who have been hustled and harried by the Government and expected to produce the same quantity of milk as heretofore as well as more cereals, with inefficient and in-dependent labour and by new methods of agriculture to which they are unac cuatomed.(4) The fact that owners (a) of small herds situated in certain counties-, e-.ge -. Eastern and North-Midland,  (b) of town dairies, neither of whom breed their own stock and who have been accustomed to fatten off their cows while going dry,  are unable to replace them except at extravagant prices or in many cases net even at such prices.The chief requirements needed to maintain the production of milk on an adequate scale for the winter 1918-19 are :-.(l)    The laying down at an early date of the guidingprinciples concerning the prices of milk and. mi2.k products for the summer 1918, and winter .1918-19, To safeguard the production of milk next&apos; autonn and winter, it is. essential that farmers should get their cows and heifers in calf without delay. They are more likely to do this and to maintain&apos;&apos; the numbers in their herds,  instead of reducing  -by slaughter, if they have reasonable prospects of obtaining a fair prof iid .
458(2) A better, more continuous and more far-reaching educational campaign among farmers, including demonstrations through Agricultural Colleges or County Fasfl&apos; Schools.     This should be designed particularly to show cowkeepers. who have been accustomed to produce milk mainly on grass how to produce the same . -,; &quot;&apos;: quantity of milk in spite of the breaking upof their pastures. This involves a big change in their method of feeding and in the crops which they haveto grow.(3) A guarantee,to cowkeepers that they shall have prior claims on such cake and other con-centrated feeding stuffs as are available next, winter, as.well as an indication that the prices of such feeding stuffs will be controlled; and that the feeding stuffs will be properly distributed.(4) An assurance to tzowkeepers that every assistance will be rendered in maintaining their supply of man labour and increasing the supply ofwoman labour.The foregoing are some of the main factors affecting the future production of milk, and some of the main requirements for guaranteeing the maintenance&apos; of such supply. The Milk Committee hope to be in a/position shortly to make definite and detailed recommendations on these&apos; and other points.(signed)    WALDO KB1 ASTOH.December 7th, 3.91.7.
