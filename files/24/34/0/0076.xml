Hubbard, editor of the Birmingham &quot;Daily Post&quot;0   This paper has lent a general support to Government since the outbreak of the war, and has shown no disposition to be hypercritical,Mrc Hubbard began by stating that in his opinion the shortage of food, if it had not caused the Coventry strike, had at least done much to prepare the ground for it, and to produce the frame of mind in which the strike became possible, He now stated that similar trouble was brewing in Birmingham, and for the same reason;   and he alleged that representations from the Birmingham Pood Cojnmittee received no answer from the department &apos;of the Pood Controller *3riefly his statement is as follows:-(l) The distribution of supplies takes no account of the greatly increased population which has been drawn Into centres like Coventry and Birmingham by the munition Works, Owing to the distribution being made 0n this faulty basis, the supplies in certain essentials were deficient at Coventry until a special allowance was made and are still deficient at Birmingham.(2)Apwrt from the gross shortage due to this cause, there is faulty distribution0     Small shoos in the suburbs and throughout the City generally are unable to get supolies of tea, butter, margarine and bacon0    Of these,, bacon is of the least consequence.     Tea, and butter, including margarine, are of very great consequence to all the small householdsa(3) The result of the failure to supply the small shops is that people from all over the large area of tho -City and its surroundings are driven to the great general Stores in the centre of the town.     The queues, numbering as many as five hundred people, are constantly to be seen waiting outside these shops. These queues are haony hunting grounds for pacifists and. other agitators, especially as busy people, after waiting for an hour and more in a queue, may finally only reach the door of the shop in time to see a notice exhibited that no more tea or butter is available. Idle    people may go from queue to queue, ana shop to shop, collecting stocks,.but the system falls with particular hardship on those homes where the women are engaged in munitions work and can only join the oueues at&apos;a late&quot;hour.
I have STMn.arl.sea Mr. HubbardTs statement as briefly as I can; and shall be glad if you sill circulate it to the &quot;ar Cabln-et in anticipation of their meetings     I attach copy of the leading article of the Birmingham &quot;Daily Post&quot; of yesterday de al ing with t hi s s ub J ec 10 o Mr. Hubbard suggests that if customers could be tied to -particular shops, as has now been done in the case of sugar, and the shops rationed in proportion to their trade and the general supplies available, a system of compulsory rations would in effect be established without the direct interference of the State with the individual consumer, and therefore in a manner which is least Invidious and requires least official interference and inspection.fSigne d)AUSTEK C&amp;lMBSHlAXKWhitehall Gardens, S.V.&apos;.

FOOD ffl3PSS,Any newspaper, any day, will furnish evidence of activity, on the part of the Food Controller and all who work tinder him in order to secure efficient conservation and distribution of the nation&apos;s food supplies.   A new sugar-ticket scheme has been pre-&quot;. . pared, and the registered retailers are doing their best to cope irith- the mass of clerical work it throws upon them;   though the ; Birmingham and Midland Counties Grocers1 Federation?;affirm they cannot, do it,&quot;the larger traders by.reason of the crowded state , of their shops end&apos;their depleted steff3, while the smaller onest many of whom Ere not sufficiently educated,  re entirely unqualified for the complicated nature of the autios involved.1&apos;   Sir Arthur Xeppt meanwhile, as if to prove his capability for foreseeing all things aiid dealing with the infinitely little, lays down guiding principles&apos; for the rationing of charwomen, ana discusses gravely how the commu-nity should comport itself in the presence of a hypothetical glut of sprats.     The bakers, v,*e believe, contemplate curtailment or abaadon-raeut of deliveries;   lord Hhondda insists that butchers and live-stock auctioneers shall henceforth take out licenses to ca^ry on their business.     The Bristol city authorities lay down rules to regulateof3ausagethe nature of the pastry to be used in the manufacture rolls.. : On one side and another there is every day on enormous display of energy.     In looking at it all one thinks instinctively of a disturbed anthill.    And still the general public finds cause for complaint -vith the manner in which its foodstuffs are distri-bated..    what is more some sections of &quot;oho public are not at all content with mere grumbling.     There hue jeen, as yet, no strike aimed directly at the Food Controller;   but it is matter of common Knowledge that action even of this sort has been threatened hero and there, and it is also perfectly well known that grievances arising out of inequalities of food supply have had much to do with the growth of such industrial unrest as lately came to a head at Coventry..     One is moved to askj then:    Is the Food Controller satisfied that his ordam cover the right ground?   Is he oontentwiththe system under whichcontrol the distribution of to ensure that no-one shall overlooked the necessity of fair chance of purchasing aofficials essential consume tooof his deoart-aent at present commodities?   In his anxiety much has he not thus ^arensuring that everyone shall^^^w^e a fair share of what is to be had?   It is true that the nation bore with exemplary patience the anomalies associated with the earlier attempts to regulate the distribution of sugar;   but it i3 also true that.&quot; the inconveniences arising out of ineffective efforts to deal justly with the sugar ,supply become worse than annoying - become, in fact, a grave matter - when they begin to be extended to such things as tea, cheese, butter, and margarine.  -enjoyaThere is,and in as far a......^tonnage or from doficientof course, a genuine shortage of these commodities, as our difficulties arise from absence of available_______ ^ofioient oroduction in certain neutral countriest.ie Food Controller must not be blamed for them.     The remedy must be found by others, not by him. But it is not this genuine national shortage which can be invoked to- explain the length of the queues daily to b; seen outside certain shops known to contain certain commodities or the absence of customers from other shops known to be destitute of supplies;   neither does the national shortage, such as it is, account for the really remarkable disparity in the supplies available in different towns. to be invoked in order toVerydifferent causes have___________ .u .xaoi  uy account for these phenomena.   One, webelieve, is dislocation of tho transport servioes.   Foodstuffs remain at the docks and there deteriorate for want of -aell-organised means of getting them away.   Consignments similarly remain in railway warehouses or uoon sidings - the consignees, -/ho have no horses and may not buy them, are denied the use of motor-spirit.
mmV,mAnother, probably, is to he found in insufficiently considered reflation   of prices.   It is notorious that Lord Rhondda&apos;8 irall-iwart effort to eliminate unnecessary dealings hy middlomen produced   a complete breakdown cf the mechanism of distribution in an important local branch cf the meat trade; and though we have no information cn thepcint, we have a suspicion that0somewhat the same thing might to-day be said of the te- trade. Why, otherwise^ bnould cargoes of tea remain unsaleable   in Wincing Lane at a time when the average Birmingham grower can either buy no Uq. at all from the wholesalers, or none that he can sell for less than 4/- a pound?   Finally (and as far as some large towns are concerned this is doubtless the most potent of all causeB of trouble), there is the fact that the Food Controller works habit-ually cn the basis of misleading, antiquated, radically unsound information.   His practice is (1) to obtain complete control of certain supplies, and (2) to allocate those supplies to the^ consuming centres on a definite basis, each district receiving suoh and such a proportion of the supplies it absorbed during a given period, possibly before the war, possibly more recent, but in any case dating some considerable distance back.   It would be -a good enough system, no doubtj if there had been no important movements of population   from one district to another.   But it breaks down in praotice because, as we all know, there have been such movements.   As a matter of fact, the last three years have produced changes in the distribution of population larger than would have been expected In a generation of normal national devel^ opment.   So it happens that rural districts and small non-industrial towns are rationed nowadays so amply as to leave them no ground for complaint, while great munition centres, such as Coventry, which have enormously increased their population, remain signally ill-supplied.   And the fact that the munition   workers,  as a class, are men and women with healthy appetites and well lined pockets does not help to mend matters.further, in cities such as1 Birmingham there is notable inequality of distribution as between shop and shop.   There is a very strong impression among the small traders - and we are bound to say that it would seem to be v/ell founded - that someone dis-criminates unfairly against them, and in favour of the large con-cerns, in particular the multiple shop business.   Probably if this does happen the wholesalers are responsible, for the fewer the number of their transactions the easier is their trade to conduct. In any case, whatever the cause,  some 3hops do receive supplies, while other3 go without; and one result ia the growth ofthe queue system, which is objectionable upon all accounts.   It lends itself to abuses.   She who has leisure can spend half the day in passing frcm shop to shop, picking up supplies at each;    .she who has none can hardly obtain supplies at all.   It is bad for the public health in these wintry days.   It breeds reasonable irrita-tion and resentment; we believe it also tends to depress moral by suggesting quite exaggerated ideas of the actual extent of the shortage cf commodities.   It bears especially hardly upon the women who are munition workers.   Since provision shops took to closing at eight o&apos;clock these women- have had none too much time for shopping.     What chance has such a one if, in order to reach the counter before closing time, she must take her place in a long queue at seven or so?   She has none.   Lord Rhondda may be invited to consider these matters.   They are more-important than some otheig upon which he has issued peremptory orders.   If he could secure lair division of suppliea as between one district and another, half of our existing difficulties would vanish, and as one conse-quence his colleague at the Ministry of Munitions would probably * Degm to find labour a little less awkward to deal with.   If he oould go a step further, and secure equitable division as between
shop and shop in the same area, he would remove half the rest of our food troubles,   Thus aided hy authority, traders themselves would probably be willing to do all in their power - and they could do much - to terminate the queue system by undertaking equitable distribution of supplies among their regular ioustomers. In this connection however, it may be urged that the munition worker v/ho is engaged all day would remain at a disadvantage.   That is true, and it suggests &apos;the question whether the closing hour for provision shops in munition areas does not need consideration.. It suggests also the   enquiry whether the possibilities of the canteens now common at munition establishments are sufficiently appreciated.   Is there any reason why the State should not make use of the canteens for the distribution among munition workers of the controlled supplies they cannot in existing circumstances buy at the ordinary shops?&apos;A,:S -h&apos;hs
