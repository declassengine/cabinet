q9W&apos;    \immAmiii from tme ably council to the war cabinet oh- request eroli tke prime llIHISTER eqr concrete proposals -Ad^to hod more heh are to be obtained eor the ar.my.Dated 3rd December, 1917.The Army Council have been informed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that, as a result of a conversation regarding the supply of men for the Army, the Prime Minister has expressed the wish to receive their concrete proposals as to ho^ more men are to be obtained.   They desire to submit the following conclusions at which they nave arrived.1.     At the iieeting of the War Cabinet held on Wednesday, 12th Septeuber, 1917 (War Cabinet 231, Minute 9), and amended at the War Cabinet iieeting held on Monday, 8th October, 1917 (War Cabinet 243, Minute 16), the Report of Lord Milner&apos;s Committee was accepted, in which   (Paragraph c(4)) it is laid down that within the numerical limits imposed by the War Cabinet, it is the function of the Director General of national Service to obtain such men for the Army as can be withdrawn from civil life without detriment to the maintenance of essential public services.2.    As the machinery which formerly existed in the War Office for reviewing the Man-power of the nation and for putting the views of the Army Council before the Cabinet in regard to how men can be obtained, has now been wholly handed over to the Director General of national Service, the Council feel that any proposals on their part would be based on insufficient knowledge of the industrial needs of the country.3.     At the same time the Army Council beg to draw the attention of t e War Cabinet to the Secretary of 8tate&apos;s Memorandum of the 7th June, 1917, forwarding a Review by the Adjutant General of the various occasions since April,1916, on which the Army Council brought the serious condition and prospects of Recruiting continuously to the notice of the Cabinet,     Concrete proposals were from time to tine submitted, more especially that referred to by the then Director General of Eational Service in his Report to the Cabinet, dated 13th January, 1917, under which all Government exemptions to certain men should be cancelled by &quot;age bltcks&quot; - a proposal that was made by the Director General of national Service after consultant ion with the Array Council.4.     The resources of the country in Kan-power are fuller set fortl: in the Memorandum by the Minister of Rational Service (1T.S.R. 22. G.174 - dated l*th Dovember, 1917) with which Memorandum the Council a,re in agreement, save in a few points of detail enumerated in their Memorandum of the 28th November, 1917. Table A. of the Memorandum of the Director General of national Service gives a full summary of the available Man-po^er of the Hation, and the quotas which could be taken under present conditions without disturbing the existing industrial policy of the Cabinet. These figures can be increased if the measures mentioned on pages 8 to 11 are approved and drastically enforced, but it appears to the Army Council that the question is also affected by the remark cf the Director General of Mational Service at the foot of page 1 of his Memorandum, via:-&quot;If
&quot;If- it be the considered policy of the Allies to draw on the resources of this country for munitions rather than for men, the number of men available for the armed forces must be further reduced&quot;.5.     An investigation of results throughout the past year shows clearly that not only have no adequate steps been taken to meet the reiterated warnings of the Army Council that our Forces in the Field will not be maintained unless further stews are taken to increase the flo?/ of recruits, but in every succeeding month the recruiting field has been restricted, and thousands of men have been withdrawn from the Army on the demand of other Departments of the State.The number of men discharged and passed to the Reserve amounts during the past 12 months to 18r,990, and this figure is only a portion of the number withdrawn from the Amy in that period.6,     Without venturing to intrude into the realms of politics, the Armey Council are unable to aa.ke further proposals than those set forth by the Direotor General of rational Service in his Uenorandu:a of 15th November, 1917, subject to the Council&apos;s Uenorandum of the 23th llovenber, 1917.i i7,     The Council are, however, of opinion that tie one source from which the Recruiting position nay be rapidly and effectively re-established is the application of a form of conscription to Ireland, free from the Tribunal and exemption elements which have rendered the Military Service Act in Great Britain cumbrous to administer and unsatisfactory in its results.8.     The Council recognise the strain that has already been n% I    put TmjJ8ii the country and the difficulties of increasing it, and they also realise the fact that the Army cannot be given absolute priority in the supply of nen regardless of all other considerations.     At the same tine they would fail in their duty if they did not warn the War Cabinet that in view of the probable release of enemy Forces on the Russian front, the war may well be lost unless, while awaiting substantial American assistance, our field armies are quickly brought up  to and maintained at full strength.     This is the grave risk incurred if the allotment of man power to other services involves the depletion of our field armies.rd December, 1917.
