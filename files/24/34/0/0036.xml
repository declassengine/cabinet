TREATMENT.HJ   Joi^t Institutional Committee for England and Fales. The Joint Committee of the Ministry of Pensions and the Rod Cross Society for the provision of institutions held their 31st meeting on the 29th ultimo-   A report of the proceedings is given in Appendix VI.    In addition to the discussion of proposals for the utilisation of individual properties for the treatment of neurasthenia, tuberculosis and epilepsy important points were raised to(a) the application of penalties provided by Article 4 of the Warrant to cases of neurasthenia,(b) the examination of discharged men by experts on tuberculosis in preference to the existing system of examination by Medical Boards - and(c) the means to be adopted to prevent patients whose disablement requires prolonged treatment (as in the case of epilepsy) leaving the institution prematurely when they had accumulated a substantial balance out of the allowances credited to them during treatment.12.    Joint Institutional Committee for^cotland^   A report of the proceedings of the 5th meeting of this Committee, to which reference was made in the report for the week ended 14th ultimo, is given In Appendix VII. 13 *   General Schemes of Treatment Submitted,   Appendix VIII contains a report of the general schemes of treatment submitted and sanctioned during the week.    Arrangements for treatment in hospitals by Local Committees are now being rapidly completed.14.    Numbers under Treatment^   Appendix IX shows the number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made cr approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are payable. It Yd 11 be seen that 380 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended the 28th November and that 3404 menwere
were under treatment on -that date, as compared with 3.^178 men at the end of the previous week.The table shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required, and it will be seen that more than two-fifths of the cases arc of wounds or  injuries, 2 per cent being cases of paraplegia.    90 cases of neurasthenia are under treatment at Golders Green and 36 of advanced tuberculosis in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in London.    The number of discharged men in Lunatic asylums who have been admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous roports was, on the 28th November 1,062, Of those 156 had been admitted during the week.TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT. 15.   Speeding up Training.   Up to the present the proportion of disabled mem who are taking advantage of the provisions of Article 6 of the Royal Warrant with respect to training is comparatively small.    On the other hand complaints are being received that men, although willing to be trained, have difficulty in obtaining the training for which they have applied.    In these circumstances a circular (Appendix X) has been issued urging Local and Joint Committees to submit training schemes which, when submitted, will be dealt with by the Ministry as expedit-iously as possible.   Local Committees are also asked to advertise the advantages of training and the special courses they provide, or, If there are no Local facilities, they are asked to put men in touch with training arrange -ments in other areas.16*    Trade Advisory Committees.    In the Printing trade the Secretaries of the Trade Union and of the Masters&apos; Association of-stereotypers and electrotypers agreed upon a scheme for training disabled men not formerly in the trade and the course of training was fixed for a year and a half.   Agreements were also reached with respect to copy-holders and warehousemen.In
In the Engineering Trade great progress was made and the conditions under which disabled men should be admitted were fixed by the Sub-Committee.     It was also agreed that men not formerly in the trade should be admitted-under a three ^rears course of training, into various skilled processes,  and the terms of training and rates of wages were agreed upon.      If the suggestions made are confirmed by the constituent Trade Unions there will be a large addition to the possible openings for disabled men (Appendix JCI).17.     London.     The London &quot;ar Pensions Committees are reported to be taking steps to extend the facilities already offered for training disabled men within the area.    In most cases the Technical Institutions are full in the day time, many of the students being engaged on special war work, consequently the accommodation at present available for the training of disabled men is of a somewhat limited nature.     Every effort is being made to meet the Increasing demand for training.     It is also anticipated that as tha ^xeas out-side London Increase their facilities for training the pressure on London Institutions will be relieved.18.     General Schemes of;Training.     Particulars are given in Appendix XII of the Schemes submitted or sanctioned during the week by the Belfast, Bristol, Cheshire, Chester, Croydon, Lancashire, Leicester, London, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Northampton, Portsmouth, Shropshire, Surrey, Wig an,   est Ham, heat Riding, &apos;&apos;est Sussex andimbledon Local Committees and the Lancashire and Westmorland, North Vales arid Monmouthshire Joint Committees.19.      Individual, Cases of Training.     During the week 81 oases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned.     In 178 cases further details have been asked for or modifications. &apos; SO.     Number of men under Training.   &apos;  appendix XIII shows that 184 men were admitted to and 13 discharged from training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week Is 953.  &apos;
21.     Training fcr Widows,     An arrangement has been arrived at with the Launderers 5 Association Ltd,, the Central organization representing the Laundry Trade throughout the United Kingdom, which will provide training for widows in Hand-Ironing and other skilled Branches of Laundry work, on favourable terms in the Laundries themselves.,The existing twenty-eight Provincial Associations will be utilized for the purpose of finding the widows training and subsequent employment as near their own homes as possible and the Trade Journals could be used if necessary.     A definite Scheme will shortly be formulated.Messrs, Worth, Ltd,  (Corset Makers) have &quot;agreed to take widows into their workshop and give them training.     They would receive a nominal wage of 10/- a week for the first month and after that,  if they proved satisfactory,  a commencing salary of 20/-,Organization.22.    Reports of Inspectors,      xixtracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for the week ending 28th November are contained in Appendix XIV .     In comparison with the lew e x p end i t ur e up on ad i s ab 1 fed ameni and:: t n e -ir d- e p end an t s&apos; -1 he administrative expenses of the Durham County Local Committee seem: high.     In the North ?.&apos;est Area, the Chorley Local Committe has had to double its staff;    Preston continues its good record at Oldham the payments are reported to be comparatively small. In the Southern Area (Central) the Hampshire sub-Committees are being thoroughly inspected,In South East Scotland the report on the Haddington Local Committee, upon whose working there was lately an article in the War Pensions Gazette, is very satisfactory;    Edinburgh Is also reported as well organized and well administered. 23o      May^Meetrng of Inter-Allied Conference in London.      At tin final sitting of the Permanent Committee of the Inter-Allied
Conference in London last month it was decided that the next meeting of the Conferende upon Disablement should take place in London towards the end of May.     To carry out this object the Ministry have taken steps to secure the use of the Central Hall, Westminster, from the 18th to the 27th May.     It is proposed that His Majesty the King should be asked to open the conference on -hit Monday (the 20th May), that there should be an exhibition of artificial limbs and appliances from all the Allied Countries, a display of work done by disabled men, and that H.R.K, the Duke of Connaught should be asked to attend the closing ceremony and thank the Allied Representatives for their attendance.     Further details regarding arrangements were discussed at a meeting summoned by the Minister which took place on the 28th November.     Copies of the proceedings of that meeting and of the subsequent one of an executive Committee appointed by the meeting are annexed as Appendices i VV and XVI hereto. 24.       ar Pensions Gazette,    In the 8th issue of this Gazette (Appendix XVII) Dr. addison in a leading article draws something of a parallel between the Ministry of &quot;Restoration&quot; and his own Ministry of Reconstruction and points out how the Pensions Ministry and Local Committees will be called upon to  assist in solving some of* the problems likely to arise on demobilization. This issue includes Mr. Harcourt Kitchin&apos;s article on the uses of publicity re^Srrerf to in last week1 a report, a note on the Leeds Scheme for the care of soldiers&apos; orphans, an account of the work of the&apos;Kent Local Committee and an interesting article by Rennet Copplestone, the author, on the First Home of Recovery at Golders Green for Neurasthenics.&quot; -   Staff etc.25.

Sir John Collie, Sir Harry Haward Major E.H.S*HartleyMr. C.P.A. Hore (Assistant Secretary to the Ministry) and Mr, G. ?/. Boughay were also present.1. MINUTES: -The minutes of last meeting wore confirmed. 2. NEURASTHENIA:-Sir John Collie reported as follows:-(a) Home of Recovery, Golders Green:    There wore 90 Patients in the Heme on 27th November 1917 and the number on the waiting list at that date was 86.(b) Cases of Neurasthenics who refuse treatment:   The Special Medical Board had reconsidered this flatter and were of opinion that in certain Cases the penal provisions of the Royal Warrant should be enforced as experience had shown the necessity for it.   The matter had been discussed at a meeting of the Committee on tho 4th October last.   He considered that the Speoial Medical Board should have authority to recommend direct to the Ministry in what cases the penal provisions should be enforced. The Committee agreed to the recommendation of tho Beard.(o)   Westgate. Beokenham,   This Home for Convalescent Officers was now open and ready for the reception of patients. A general discussion took place as to the Home and it was decided that as there is a Special Committee in existence to deal with the treatment of Officers the consideration of making use of the accommodation be referred to them at their next meeting.   Sir Alfred Pearce Gould said that this would be done.(i)     Allerten Hall. Leeds:   Tenders had been now accepted for the necessary work.   Tho Committee had modified the original proposition and were now only prepared to take from 55 to 65 cases on the ground that the building could not conveniently accommodate more.   If hewever, further accommodation was necessary there was plenty of room for oxtension.(e)     tfoedbourae. Altrincham:   Mr, Leigh was getting on with the work at Woodbourne and expected to have it open for thereception
reception of patients in a few weeks.   He was prepared to have accommodation provided for up to 100 Patients, Mr. Leigh had expressed a wish that he would like men to be transferred temporarily before they were discharged.   It was stated by the Chairman that this whole question was at present Uftder consider-ation-(f)    Broughton Astloy near Leicester:   u letter dated 18th November from Mr. Joseph Steel relative to the utilisation of this property   for tho treatment of flourasthenic patients was considered, &apos;  It was decided that as sufficient accommodation for the present was already provided in that area tho offer be not accepted and to recommend to tho Ministry that Mr. Steel be written to accordingly.(g)     Hamel Park:   The Scheme put forward by Dr. ifortnsoue i?ox and others was brought before the Committee by Sir George Bullock who said that the originators proposed to raise   5,000 and establish a curative and training village at Hamel Park. They thought they would not have any difficulty in raising the amount if tho Scheme had the approval of the Ministry.   Sir Arthur   Boscawen pointed out that although the Ministry had nothing to do with any question of housing thoro was not any reason why they should not utilise the scheme for treatment and training,It was decided to postpone consideration of the matter until a further report was furnished.   Sir George Bullock and Sir   John   Collie were asked by the Committee and agreed to1 visit the Colony and report on the Scheme to a later meeting the Secretary was authorised to hand the file H/G/137 to Sir John Collie for reference.TUBERCULOSIS:-Major Hartley reportod as follows:-(a) Bolton Isolation Hospital:   There was not room for the proposed pavilion at this Institution.(b) Peel Hall, near Bolton&apos;   A letter dated  3rd instant, from Mr, Hibbert Chairman of Sanatorium Committee of the Lancashire Tuberculosis Committee relative to the proposed Scheme at Poel Hall was considered.   Major Hartley explained that the Lancashire County Council were prepared to proceed with the adaptation of Peel Hall if the Ministry through the Institutiorsal Committee would erect a Pavilion on the site.    In this way with the adapted building and the pavilion prevision could be made fer 50 cases.   The probable cost of alteration to Peel Hall would be approximately  11,000.   A general discussion took place on the Scheme and particularly with regard to tho&apos;financial aspect. It was deoided that enquiries be made whether the Committee ?/ould in consideration of a payment of  2,000 give tho Committee a lien on 12 beds in the Institution   Iviajor Hartley was askedand agreed to make the necessary enquiries and report to a later meeting0(c) After care Tuberculosis:   A copy of the report prepared by  ajor Hartley was presented to the Committee,   a copy of the report is hereunto annexed marked &quot;ix&quot;v   Uajor Hartley explained the scheme for the appointment of visitors as set out therein.A general discussion topk place and it was finally agreed thatMajor
i-iajor   Hartley and Mr. Hore should communicate with the Local Government   Board and Local Health Authorities and report to a later meeting.   This they agreed to do.fd)   pinewood   Sanatorium, Hastings;   i- letter dated 23rd November, 1917 from the Insurance Committee for the Borough of Hastings relative to this Institution was read.   After a discussion it was decided that,the Institution would not be suitable for the Committees purposes and that it be recommended to the Ministry that a letter be written to the Insurance Committee to that effect.(o) Reboarding: Sir Arthur Boscawen said that Dr. Sims woodhoad had interviewed him with regard to the re-boarding of disoharged men who were suffering from tuberculosis.A general discussion took place and the Committee agreed that in these cases it was essential that a specialist in tuberoulosis should be a member of the Board or furnish a report aB to the ma^s condition.   It was finally resolved to make a recommendation to the Ministry that in oases where a man has to be re-boarded after he has been discharged from tho ij.rmy for tuber-culosis the Board should consist of tho Medical fteforeo and the Tuberculosis Officer for the man&apos;s district.3PIL2PSY;-(a)   Bosford Court Home, Worcestershire-   Dr. Bond reported on the visit made by Sir Arthur Boscawen and himself to this Institution on the 23rd and 24th instant.   They saw the Adminis-trator (the Hev.TcUewsome ) the resident Medical Officor. (Dr.parry) and the Rev.Hudson,   The Court was intended to receive 70 male and 50 femalo mental defectives between the ages of 7 and 16 and in the first instance to exclude Epileptics.    It had been certified by the Board of Education and is about to be certified by the Board of Control and the Home Office.   There are at the present time 15 boys in residenco and the feeling of the Managers is that in view of the arrangements thoy have entered into they ought not to receive discharged sailors or soldiers into any part of the main building, much as they -would like to do so.   They are however, willing; to assist in any way they can.   There are 150 acres belonging to the   Institution with independent farms adjoining. Ah inspection was made of one of these farms and an interview with the farmer (kr0 Bury) took place.   Ei8 house which has two staircases would accommodate ten men and a staff of two or possibly three, there were large lofts over tho farm buildings which with some renovation could, if required, be used to increase the accommodation.   Mr. Bury is willing (provided the Court authorities will buy or long lease his farm, a matter which is at present under consideration) at once to vacate his house and move into a neighbouring cottage.   He would welcomo the services of ten or more selected cases of discharged men to work and be trained in farm work.   If such a Scheme matures the Managers of the Court would administer the Home at a per capita change.   It would provide useful accommodation for a small number of men and seeing that it is a   Homan Catholic Institution the Committee would prefer to take members of that faith in preference to others but would be willing to take men who belong to othea, faiths when the accommodation is available.   The scheme would have the advantage of having the services of a resident medical officer who is also inclined to interest himself in the project,   u general discussion took place and it was agreed that if the schemewas
was considered the Committee should have tho right of nominating discharged men of any faith for treatment but were prepared to give priority to Roman Catholics at the Home.   In view of the fadi that a lettef was being sent to the Committee in connection with the scheme further discussion was postponed until the letter was received.(b)   National Hospital for Epilepsy (Queens SquareJt-   Dr. Bond reported that arrangements had been made for Sir Frederick Mc Millan and the Secretary (Mr, G. H. Hamilton) to interview Sir Arthur Boseawen on the 4th December with regard to the provision of Epileptic paraplegics at the Hospital.(q)   Chalfont Colony:   Dr. Bond reported that the first of the new villas was ready for occupation and the only obstacle to opening it was the difficulty of procuring staff,   Cn the 27th instant the Chairman (Mr.E.Montifiore Nicholls) and the Seoretary of the Committee (Mr.E.Penn Gaskell) with Captain Lane had called on him to discuss certain matters in connection with the Adminis-tration.   They feared the effect of the present arrangements for tho distribution of tho balanoo of the  7/6 allowance as when a fair amount is accumulated it will be a direct inducement to thG man to leave the Colony before he is fit to do so.   Mr, Hore explained that provision was made in tho Instructions to meet cases of this nature and if a man insisted on leaving before ho was fit to do so he would lose any balance which had accumulated. They further pointed out in connection with their request for an increase in the per capita cost that outfits of clothing will cost  7 each and that the oost of the Staff for farm and Garden and training is estimated to amount to  7 per head which is the sum the Board of Education allows them for children and that the extra medical attendance will cost the Colony between  120 to 1150 per year.     They proposed to appoint Sir1 George Seepage as Medical   Consultant to the Colony.(d)   Lingfiold:   Dr. Bond 3aid that he understood from the Hon. Sir Arthur   Stanley that tho  15,000 for the two new villas was included in the total sum definitely granted by the British Rod Cross   Society,   He desired to know if tenders could bo called. It was decided to let the matter stand over till the next meeting. Dr. Bond also presented a letter dated 29th instant addressed to him by Mra Basden (Chairman of the Mngfield Committee) on the oost of maintenance.   The matter was deferred for consideration to tho next meeting so that copies of the letter might be circulated amongst the members of tho Committee.5.   BBLVOIR IMSJOK BELFAST;-A letter dated 1st November from Mr, D.R.Lane, was presented to tho Committee offering this Mansion on behalf of Mr. Alec Wilson of Belfast either rent free or at a nominal rent for the balance of the term of the lease (three yours).     The consent of the Landlord (Baron Deramore) to the handing over of the lease had beon asked ah&amp; refused.   It was decided to ask Mr. Lane for farther &quot;information as to the terms on which the property could be acquired and particularly with regard to tho liability on covenants and also to inform the Committee if possible of the reasons for the Landlord^ refusal of consent to the sub-letting.6.   LIVERPOOL INSTITUTIONThe Hon. E. Cozens Hardy attended themeeting
meeting and spoke of the possibility of the acquisitiou of . a large   Home near Liverpool.   It had nine aores of ground attached and was in a good state of repair.   Accommodation could bo provided for 150 or more patients.   Tho place was much largor and more suitable than Gatacre Grange.   Mr. Cozens Hardy was askod and agreed to make further enquiries and submit full details to a subsequent meeting.TRUSTEES:-It was resolved that Lieutenant General Sir Georgo Bullook be appointed a Trustee for the Committee in the place of Colonel Sir v/altcr Lawronoe to act with tho Hon. Sir Arthur  Stanley in connection with the money advanced to tho Committoe by tho Joint Committeo of the British Red Cross Society and tho Ordor of Stc John of Jorusalom in England.
The   After-care of ox-Soldiers suffering from Consumption.I have boon thinking for some time past about our Tuberoulous soldiers, and I do not think we are doing as much for them as we should,    we give them at great expense Sanatorium treatments but we really make little effort to keep in touch with them while at the Sanatorium, or after they leave.   v,e do little to help them in finding suitable work on their return home.   Their dwellings are not visited as they should be, to see that the rules of hygiene which they have learnt are not for-gotten; and, as a result, they soon tend to break down again, and the nation gets but poor return for its money.The reason for this is that the problem is a large and increasing one, and is really more than the Medical Officers of Health and the Interim Tuberoulosis Care Committees (Tuberculosis After-care   Committees), eager though they are to do all possible, can manage with their present resources, unduly strained as they are by the war,   With further assistance, however, they could cope with the problem, and no new or different adminis-trative maohinery is required.It may perhaps be of assistance if I recapitulate the present position in regard to the after-care of the Tuberculous patient in Londonc(l)   In each of the 28 London Boroughs is a kedical Officer of Health, with throe trained visitors under him (all elected&apos;^&quot; by the   Borough Council and approved by the Local Government Board).     These visit the Consumptive on his first notification, but can do but little after-care visiting,(2)   In each Borough, too (with two exceptions) is a Tuberciilosis   Dispensary, sometimes &quot;imnicipal&quot; and run by Public Health Authorities (o&quot;g,, Chelsea - at the Bromptoh Hospital) and sometimes a &quot;Central i-und Dispensary&quot; (eg,, Paddington and Battersea), in which&apos;case the Dispensary is financed by a grant from the &quot; Central jhind&quot; for tho provision of Dispensaries (a Philanthropic Body) together with grants from the Borough Counoil, tho Insurance Committee, and voluntary contributions^(3)   Saoh Dispensary has a Tuberoulosis Officer in Charge, a Secretary, a Nurse and a Visitor,(4)   In connection with each Dispensary is also tho Intorim Tuberculosis Care Committees (LILCG. ) /whose duty it is to keep in touch with the Tuberculous patients in the Borough *   This Committee consists of the Tuberoulosis Officer and the Secretary of the Dispensary, and from 12-16 members representing tho London Insurance Committee, the Borough Council, (including the Medical Officer   ...    -     of Health) -with (as in Battersea) the Mayor as ex-offioio Chairman, and if it be a Central Amd Dispensary, members representing tho Central j^und,    To this Committee a member of the Local nar Pensions Committee has, I understand, now been added,    These I a 1.0 - G,Committees are zealous and anxious to do all that they can to help tho Consumptive, but they are largely amateur, and the work is arduous, exacting andincreasing
155increasing In extent, and more than they can manage.:y/hat, I submit, is required is that to each I.T.C.C. should be appointed a paid Visitor (preferably one who has been trained in suoh work), who should take charge of the visiting and after-care of the discharged tuberculous soldier in the area concerned, suoh visitors to be paid by the Pensions Ministry.Eventually one will probably be required for each Committee, but I should suggest that a start should be made in Lambeth with tho services of a half-time Visitor (whose salary would be about  60 per annum,/with expenses),    when the Ministry has seen the value of the work done, a similar Visitor could be appointed in other districts; and probably her full time would soon be required (the salary would then be about  120 per annum). I have little doubt that I eould find a suitable Lady Visitor for the post.   Speaking from my own experience of many yearsr work at Brompton, I may say that I believe the work of such visitors will be invaluable.In conclusion, it may perhaps be of interest to  he Ministry if I give some idea of our work carried out at Brompton in regard to the patients who are sont from there to our Primley Sanatorium, as the work in connection with the soldiers sent from the Military Hospitals to Sanatoria would be on similar lines.when it has been deoided that a patient should be transferred to the Sanatorium, he is visited, and family affairs, financial and otherwise, are carefully discussed with him.   Tho home is then visited and sleeping accommodation Is invariably re-arranged.   Opportunity is also taken to see the children, arrange for the medical examination of the &quot;oontaots&quot;r and the work for the growing lads and girls is discussed^ and often suitably arranged and started - all factors which will have a beneficial effeot on tho patient later on.Whilst at the Sanatorium, Medical reports are made at Intervals as to the patient1s progress, and the doctor(s opinion as to the work suitable for him in the future is obtained?   If the Patient is willing to carry out the Doctors advice, assistanoe is given, if neoessary, towards moving, 6r in training for other -work, if this be required.   In all oases every effort is made to move families from, for example, a damp unhealthy basement -ot dwelling to a healthier locality, If it oven be only from one Borough to another.,On his return home, the Visitor 3ees that the Patient continues under tho care of the Panel Doetor, and arranges that he be examined by the Tuberoulosis Offioerr or at a Chest Hospital, at periodical intervals.   Should he break down, she is there to assist in obtaining him admission to a Hospital, or perhaps to an &quot;advanced bed&quot;.   The home, too, is periodically visited to seo that the precautions are not relaxed.The value of such help to the Consumptive and his family is obvious, and if it could bo systematically extended to the discharged consumptive soldiers, great good would, I feel suro, be obtained at a very small cost,(Sgd) P,H.S.Hartloy.
Joint Institutional Committee for ScotlandMINUTES OF MEETING held on wth November, 1917.THE FIFTH MEETING of the Committee was held at the North British Hotel, Edinburgh, on Saturday, November 10th, 1917.Present :Lieut. Col. Sir ARTHUR GRIFFITH BOSCAWEN M.P., (Chairman).Bailie T. ADAMS.Sir GEORGE T. BEATSON.Lady BAXTER.Sir CHARLES j. CLELAND.Surgeon-General CULLING.Lieut. Colonel MACPHERSON. Colonel SCOTT RIDDELL. Mr. R. H. N. SELLAR. Lieut.-Colonel WALLACE. And the Secretary.The following were also present by Invitation;Sir John Cowan, Messrs. Grierson, Humphreys, Michie, Robin, Stenhouse, Mr. C F. A. Hore (Assistant Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions) was also present.1.    The minutes of  last  meeting were  confirmed, subject to the word Minutes. &apos;&apos;Provincial&quot;   being inserted instead of the word &quot;Provisional&quot; in line 9, page 2.2. Craigend Home. Bailie Adams reported that the District Committee had Neurasthenics held a meeting in connection with Craigend. and proposed plans were placed before them. The present building would not require many structural alterations, and could accommodate from thirty to thirty-five patients. It was proposed to erect an addition to the building, and make it capable of accommodating between fifty and sixty cases. The total cost of extension and equipment, etc., would be  3,500. The Sub-Committee yesterday were unanimously in favour of it. The place could be made a model home and the scheme for reconstruction would cost  3,500 in all. The plans for the proposed alterations were prepared by the Architect of the Office of Works. A number of cases . might be taken in at once, while the extra accommodation was being got ready.Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace -supported the proposal to extend the facilities for accommodation. He said that to carry on under present conditions would mean that the staff would be cramped, and no provision could be made for re-creation for the patients. By adding a dormitory at the north end of the present billiard-room provision could be made to take in fifty cases in all. All the men would be on one floor, the staff quarters would be completely separ-ated from the patients, and excellent accommodation could be provided for the medical officer. The new scheme had many advantages, and he could recom-mend it.It was resolved to agree to the completion of the scheme, and to the carrying out of the alterations as shown on the plan, which was presented to the meeting. The Home would be for the whole of Scotland, and all cases for admission must be passed by Colonel MacPhersoiPs Board. It was to be used for acute and not mild cases.
Light Work      3.    Light Work for Neurasthenics.   Mr. Hore explained the two new schemes for       .   for dealing with the lighter cases of Neurasthenics, and said that, at Walthamstow Neurasthenics an(j Birmingham, men were employed under medical supervision at light work in the Parks.   It is really curative treatment, and treatment allowances are paid.The Committee decided that the various District Committees should be asked to furnish a report, to be presented to the next meeting, as to the question of providing light work in Parks and other places for Neurasthenic patients.Orthopaedic 4. In connection with the establishment of Orthopaedic Annexes, reports were Annexes.       furnished to the Committee as follows: (a) Aberdeen. Mr. E. N. Sellar reported that the Aberdeen Annexe was to be opened by Sir Arthur Boscawen on Monday next, and they would be treating eighteen patients on Wednesday. The total cost of the full equipment was  1,500. Colonel Scott Kiddell had agreed to act as Honorary Medical Director, and a capable Matron aud Staff had been secured. Everything had now been arranged for the treatment which was solely for out-patients. Provision could be made for the treatment of 150 patients per day for massage, and 100 for electrical treatment.(6) Dundee. Lady Baxter reported that it had been decided to provide treatment at Dudhope House, and to use part of the  2,500 granted by the Committee to pay the rent. It was hoped to have the place ready for occupation in the beginning of December. The equipment part would be installed in two or three of the lower rooms. Some work was already being done at the Infirmary.Mr. Hore said that if treatment was being given at Dudhope House he did not anticipate there would be any difficulty about having the Institution recog-nised  and treatment allowances paid.Lady Baxter said that Dudhope House was let to the Institutional Commit-tee. The rent was about  170 per annum. About 5 acres would be taken away from the 17 acres comprising the ground.The Chairman asked Lady Baxter to submit a full report, giving particulars as to rent and ground, etc., to next meeting.(c) Edinburgh. Bailie Adams reported that plans were out for the build-ing on the site which had already been approved of. He suggested that in order to save delay the consideration of tenders and other matters in connection therewith be delegated to a Sub-Committee who could take whatever action was necessary, and report to the next meeting of Com-mittee. The plans and estimates were in, and there would probably be an expenditure of about  3,000. The Committee agreed to the suggestion and asked Sir George Beatson, Lieutenant-Colonel Wallace and Bailie Adams to act as a Sub-Committee.   This they agreed to do.(d) Glasgow. Sir Charles Cleland reported that it was expected that the Glasgow Annexe would be ready in about four weeks. The place was wired. They should be able to take between forty and fifty cases per day.Blind 5.    It was reported that the British Red Cross (Scottish Branch) had arrangedMasseurs. for the service of six blind masseurs from St. Dunstans, in connection with orthopaedic work. A general discussion took place with regard to orthopaedic treatment and massage work, and the qualification of the masseurs.   Sir GeorgeSir Arthur Boscawen announced that, as a result of the Ministry&apos;s application, the War Office had decided to release Major Cunyingham Brown from his Military duties, and were recalling him from Salonika to take up the position of Medical Superintendent at Craigend. Sir John Collie had withdrawn his objection to Major Cunyingham Brown&apos;s appointment.
idlBeatson said that the lied Gross would consider whether in auxiliary hospitals any extra facilities could be given for out-patient treatment, and he would report to tne Committee at a later meeting.6. (a) Farm Colonies. Sir iiobert Philip attended the meeting on the invi-tation of the Chairman, who explained tlie position with regard to harm Colony treatment, and said that the Ministry regarded harm Colony treat-ment as an admirable thing, and wanted to make a start as early as possible. He asked if it was possible to make any use of the Springfield institution, and, if so, what additional equipment was necessary? Could the men learn trades there, and what class of workshops were in existence? A general discussion followed, in which Sir liobert Philip took part. It was pointed out that (Springfield at present was held and worked by the Edin-burgh Corporation for after treatment, and any arrangements entered into would have to be done through the Health Committee of the Cor-poration. It is a Sanatorium under the Public Health Act, the only form of training there is for work on the land, and there were not any work-shops. Lord Balfour of BurleiglYs schemes for Tuberculosis treatment, to which reference was made at the last meeting, was to establish one main Colony in England. The Committee finally decided that the ques-tion of Springfield and Golinton Mains Farm for Farm Colony treatment be remitted to Sir Eobert Philip and the South Eastern Districts Joint Dis-ablement Committee to consider the question and furnish a report to a later meeting.(b) Seaiorth Sanatorium. Mr. Michie reported that, in company with Dr. Dittmar, one of the Medical Inspectors, and Mr. Wilson, of the Local Government Board, he had discussed with Colonel and Mrs. MacKenzie of Seaforth the proposal to extend the Sanatorium. A plan of the proposed extension on the ward system was considered, but Dr. Dittmar did not approve, and suggested a pavilion having a central block with a wing on either side containing a series of 16 cubicles or 32 beds in all. To this proposal Mrs. Maclvenzie agreed, and Mr. Wilson undertook to prepare a plan and estimate of the cost. The building is at present taken over by the Bed Cross, and accommodates 40, soldiers. As a Sanatorium it would provide for 18 and perhaps as many as 24 beds. It could be got ready to receive cases a week after it was vacated by the Military Author)-ties. With extension it could provide for 50 beds in all for early and advanced cases. A general discussion took place on the urgency of obtaining the accommodation, and in view of the necessity of it Surgeon-General Culling said he would arrange for the Military to vacate the Insti-tution, and make it available for the treatment of discharged men.(c) Culduthie, Inverness. Mr. Michie said that the whole question of tuberculosis treatment was one which required early attention, and in the Northern Area alone the returns from the various Local Committees show that from 1st August, 191G, to 30th September, 1917, the number of cases notified was 273. Dr. Dittmar was of opinion that further pro-vision ought to be made, and had recommended Culduthie as a very suit-able place for a hospital. It was a small property of about 30 acres, the property of the Inverness Town Council, and situated about two miles from Inverness. The Burgh Corporation Fever Hospital had recently been built there, and the Mansion House is to be used for administrative purposes. Dr. Dittmar and Dr. MacDonald the County Medical Officer of Health, had suggested a pavilion for 20 cases, and believed that the Town Council would willingly grant a site for the Hospital, and also give accommodation in the Mansion House for the nursing staff.(d) Stornoway. Mr. Michie reported that he had discussed the question of treatment of tuberculosis in Lewis with Dr. Bruce, Medical Officer of Health for Boss-shire, and also Dr. Dittmar. They both agreed that a hospital should be established in Stornoway for these cases, as it would be impossible to persuade Lewis men to come to the mainland for treat-ment. A pavilion for 10 beds would meet present needs, and the best site would be in the Bay of Stornoway, when it might be run in connec-tion with the Cottage Hospital there. There was a Tuberculosis Officer in Stornoway. Since August, 1916, 13 cases had been notified from Lewis. A general discussion took place as to the position. It was recognised that there were cases there in need of treatment, but the difficulty was who wasTuberculosis.
to provide it, and where was the medical and nursing staff to come from. The Insurance Commissioners were not providing the treatment generally which they should do, and something must be done. The Committee finally decided that the Northern Committee be asked to consider and bring up to the Institutional Committee for consideration at a subsequent-meeting a plan to provide the necessary accommodation for Lewis men, the cost of same, and where it should be established. Colonel MacPher-son was asked, and agreed to act, with the Northern Committee, and said he would &quot;give it all the information the Islands and Highlands Medical Board could furnish.7.   (a)   Muriston House.    Bailie Adams reported that the Home would be pi epsy&quot; opened as soon as the necessary alterations were complete.     The agree-ment with the proprietors had been concluded tbis week.(6) Bridge of Weir Homes. A letter, dated 5th November, was read from Dr. Bond relative to his interview with Sir Joseph MacLay as to the possibility of obtaining a limited amount of accommodation at the Homes. The Committee of the Homes had refused to take acute cases, but he thought that was due to a misunderstanding. He had assured Sir Joseph MacLay that no cases would be sent which might be anticipated would cause embarrassment to the Institution. Sir Joseph said it might be taken for granted that where a vacancy could be found any case recom-mended by Dr. Bond would be taken for the present charge of 10s. per week. Dr. Bond thought the same provision would be made for cases recommended by Colonel MacPherson, who was requested by the Com-mittee to act in the way of making recommendations, and agreed to do so.Convalescent 8. Convalescent Homes. A general discussion took place on the question of Homes. Convalescent Homes.   It was pointed out that there was such a demandfor soldier cases in the Auxiliary Hospitals at the present time that there was not any possibility of provision being made in them for the accom-modation of convalescents as was originally hoped. Sir George Beatson said that the Red Cross was very sympathetic and only too anxious to assist where possible. He had asked the four Red Cross Commissioners for Scotland to meet him that afternoon, and see if they could come to an arrangement whereby they could provide other facilities than the Auxiliary Hospital afforded, and place them at the Committee&apos;s disposal. He would report the result to a later meeting. A further discussion took place on the attitude of the medical profession towards convalescent patients in civil hospitals, and Mr. Hore explained fully to the meeting what was being done, and the attitude of the medical profession and hos-pital authorities in England.Next Meeting.    9.   The next meeting was fixed for Saturday, 8th December, next.
TREATMENT BRANCH.Report of Schemes etc, s&amp;actioned during week ending.1. The Local Committees of Kingls Lynn, Cambridge,Norfolk, Isle of Sly, East Suffolk, West Suffolk, Great Yarmouth and Norwich have submitted schemes for the treatment of disabled men in their area.     These have been co-ordinated into one scheme for the joint area of East Anglia, and 69 Institutions have been sanctioned for the use of the com-ponent local Committees.     Further enquiry has been made about a number of Institutions submitted and the question of expediting the three schemes remaining to complete the entire scheme for the Joint Area has been referred to the Minister&apos;s Representative.     The delay in submitting two of these has been occasioned by the present difficulty with the British Medical Association and the British Hospitals Association, but the matter is being taken up by the Minister&apos;s Representative who Is also dealing with the question of adequate provision for Convalescent Treatment for the whole area,2, The Warwickshire Local Committee have submitteda comprehensive scheme embodying the facilities in their area and including several civil Institutions and Convales-cent Homes outside of their area.     In all 54 Institutions have been sanctioned for the immediate use of the Local Committee.     This figure includes three Convalescent Homes at Bath, Bournemouth and Weston Super Mare, in which the rates of payment for treatment are in excess of the Schedule, but which were approved for cases medically recommended thereto In view of the scarcity of Institutional accommodation of this nature.     Further enquiry was made as to the facilities for Convalescent treatment existing in the area of the Local Committee itself.     The Local Committee also received sanction. &quot; to utilise the services of Mr, w*.W. Cobb for the provision of electrical treatment at a ^ee of 2/a   a visit.     This Goimflifetee ace ffofcktng in&apos;conjunction with their Joint Advisory Committee and this scheme will be incorporated with the one for the wider area.5. The Joint Advisory Committee of Bedfordshire, Hertsand Hunts have received sanction to use the Ampthill and laiton Wardown V.A.D, Hospitals at Schedule rates, which Institutions have been incorporated in the general scheme already approved. It Is further reported that the V.A.D.Hospitals in Huntingdon have accepted the terms arranged between the Ministry and the British Red Cross Society and these Institutions   together with the London Hospital, have been incorporated in the scheme for the area of the Joint Committee.     Enquiry is still proceeding as to the facilities in the area for Convalescent Treatment.4. The Bournemouth Local Committee reported that owingto the projected closing of the Mount Dore Military Hospitals and the present indefinite arrangements with the British Medical Association the problem of securing adequate treatment \*as becoming serious In their area.     The question was referred to the Minister&apos;s Representative who was requested to ascertain what Hospitals had refused treatment and to bring to the notice of their Governing Boards the fact that treatment was being given temporarily by the majority of Institutions in the Kingdom pending the result of the approaching conference between the Ministry and the British Hospitals Association.
4   A5, The Tyrone Local Committee received sanction to use theCounty Tyrone Hospital for in-patient treatment at the rate of 3/- per day.    Further enquiry was made as to the facilities for out-patient treatment,6, The Londonderry (fount yr and Londonderry City   Committeessubmitted a proposal to utilise &apos;the Military Hospital, Londonderry, the Londonderry County and County Borough Infirmary and the Coleraine Cottage Hospital.     These Institutions were approved, the .jratta of payment at the Infirmary being 3/- per day for in-patient treatment and Schedule rates for out-patient treatment and   at the Cottage Hospital 2l/** per week for in-patient.     The provisions for treatment made by these and the Tyrone Local Committee will be co-ordinated in the one general scheme for the area of the Joint Committee, but as it is definitely stated that no facilities for Convalescent treatment exist, the Ministerfs Representative has been asked what arrangements can be made to meet the probable requirements of all the component Local Committees,7. The engagement of a masseuse at the 2nd SouthernGeneral Hospital, Bristol was approved.

circular no. 30.MINISTRY OF PENSIONS,Westminster House,MlLLBANK,London, S.W.I.November.TRAINING.The Minister of Pensions is very desirous that advantage should be taken of the provisions for Training as set forth in the Royal Warrant by a larger number of Disabled Men. Up to tjie present the proportion of men who are taking up training courses is comparatively small.Local War Pensions Committees who have not yet submitted schemes for training are urged to do so immediately, and the question of sanction will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.. When once a scheme has been sanctioned by the Pensions Minister, the Local War Pensions Committee or the Joint (Disablement) Committee can immediately place men, either married or single, in their own area in training, and are empowered to pay the allowances set forth in the Royal Warrant.If it is desired to place men in training outside the area, application for sanction should be made to the Secretary of the Joint Disablement Committee of the area concerned, who will at once arrange for the training with the Committee of the locality where the training is to take place.The various Joint Disablement Committees who have not yet prepared schemes and lists of facilities available in their area are urged to expedite matters as much as possible, so that each Local Committee in their area may know what can be offered to disabled men anxious to be trained.The Minister has recently had many letters from disabled soldiers complaining of their inability to obtain the training for which they have applied. He is most desirous that every man who wishes for a course of training shall have an opportunity to take it up as soon as possible after the application, as if there is delay the man will often accept a temporary job and give up the idea of being a trained man.Directly a scheme of training has been arranged, it would be well for the Committee to issue posters in the district drawing attention to the special courses which have been, or are being, provided, and at the same time setting forth the advantages of training and the allowances payable.If in any particular case there is a class available, and the minimum number of students have not entered for it, an advertisement or paragraph in the Local papers will frequently bring forth the required men.(16317)  5917/g114.   10,000.   11/17.   m. &amp; s.
The Minister hopes that by a slight modification of the present instructions and by judicious advertisement that large numbers of disabled men will avail themselves of the offer of the Ministry to take up training for various Trades.In some instances letters have been received by the Minister stating that a disabled man has applied for training to a Local War Pensions Committee and has been referred to some outside body such as a Labour Bureau or Employment Agency. This should certainly be avoided. If the Committee have no training arrangements available, they should communicate immediately with the Secretary of the Joint Committee for their area and report fully the case and the training that is required. It will then be the duty of the Joint Committee to arrange for the Training desired either within the area, or, if not available there, at any other centre where it can be obtained. When this is done the Local Committee must be informed without delay of the arrangements that have been made for training the man and for housing him if the training is outside the area.A list of the various Training Centres throughout the Country and the subjects in which men are being trained is in course of preparation, and will be issued for the general information of Local War Pensions Committees and Joint Disablement Committees of the Various Areas.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Secretary.The Secretary,Local War Pensions Committee.
Trade Advisory Committees and the Training of Disabled Men.Report for Vfeek Ending November 21st, 1917.PRINTING.     November 22nd.The secretary of the Trade Union and of the Masters1 Association of Stereotypers and Electrotypers agreed upon a scheme for training disabled men not formerly employed in the trade *   The course of training with maintenance was fixed for a year and a half, during the first three months of which the man was to spend half of the working week in tho workshop and one half in the technical school, and eight hours per week at a technical school during the remainder of the year.Y/ith regard to copy-holders it was agreed that the first three months should be spent in a technical school and the next three months in a workshop and that men who were qualified might, if suitable openings were available, become proof-readers according to the usual custom of the trade .The course of training was also agreed upon for skilled V-arehousement    The first six months to be spent in a technical school during which the man was to get an all-round acquaintance of printing, materials etc.     During the second six months he is to receive 15/-- from the employer per week and during the third six months a minimum of 27/6 a week from the employer.The whole of the recommendations for Printing have now been sent out to the constituent Trade Unions and a general meeting is to be summoned shortly to give an official decision on the matter but it is understood that the report will be adopted practically en blocMr. Heath also attended a meeting of the National Society of Electrotyper and stereotypers and Assistants on Tuesday November 27th a    After hearing his report the Society agreed to adopt the recommendations of the Sub Com--ittee.ENGINEERING.   November 23rd.Great progress was made with regard to Engineering.   The. Sub Committee agreed to recommend that in the case of the simpler machine processes disabled men Should be admitted under the following conditions.I. A preliminary period of three months training in a technical school.ii. During the 4th-6th months labourers rate plus 2/6. During the 7th-9th months labourer&apos;s rate plus 3/6. During the I0th-12th months labourer&apos;s rate plus 5/-.SKILLED PROCESSES.It was agreed that disabled men not formerly employed in the trade should be admitted after training as iX) Patternmakers, 2) Moulders, 3) Fitters and Turners, including Brass Workers, 4) Coppersmiths, under a three years course of training, the first eighteen months of which should be training with maintenance and the second eighteen months training without maintenance; the rates of wages to follow those already agreed upon in the case of aeroplane woodwork.These suggestions will of course have to be submitted, to the constituent Trade Unions.   If they are agreed upon they wiXL^ mean a very large addition ;,o the possible openings for disabled wen

ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 28th November, 1917.CHORLEY LOCAL COMMITTEE,The staff has been doubled and is apparently sufficient for the work,    Cases are well investigated and allowances are In order.    The absence of local hospitals has caused difficulty regarding treatment cases but the Committee have now made arrangements with the Second Western General Hospital at Manchester to take many of these.    The men generally live at home and the Committee pay for their railway fares.HADDINGTON LOCAL COMMITTEE.This Committee is exceedingly well run, and has an able Secretary who takes great interest in his work.COUNTY OF DURHAM LOCAL COMMITTEE.The account keeping is a great deal more elaborate than is necessary but a simpler form will in future be adopted. Expenditure for the March Quarter  199.15.5.    Administrative Expenses for the same period  183.11.2,    The estimate of administrative expenses from the 17th May, 1917 to 31st March, 1918 has been passed by the County Council and approved by the Local Government Board as  437.10,0.HAMPSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The reconstruction of the District Committees previously reported upon by the Inspector Is now being carried out in a quite satisfactory manner,Havant Subcommittee.There is little being done by this Sub-Committee, not more than five cases under assistance.Gosport Sub-Committee.This Committee meets once a quarter, two members attend once a week* every Thursday, with the Secretary at a piibllo hall in Gosport from 11.a,m, to 12. noon to pay out funds and receive fresh applications.    The Regulations are not well adhered to.    A register of discharged men is kept but not on the prescribed form.Faroham Sub-Committee,Cases for assistance average 60 per week.    Some errors were discovered under Regulation 7(1)(b) but the work here is on the whole most satisfactory.Basingstoke Sub-Committee.The Committee meet every third week in the month. Cases assisted average 17 to 20 a week.    Complaints were made in respect of Civil Liabilities cases being rejected, and the delay to widows in obtaining pension arrears.
167Alton Sub-Committee.A Case Committee is formed by the Treasurer, Secretary and one member.    The Committee has apparently only met once and the payments do not appear to have been made in accordance with the Regulations.Peterfield Sub-Committee.Peterfield has a small Sub-Committee of three to deal with cases which meets as required, and a Committee of four meet onoe a month for Rural cases.Winohe ater Sub -0 ornmi11ee.This is an original branch of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors1 Families Association with some 14 villages included. Twenty-five oases inspected were found to be in oomplete aooordance with the Regulations.Droxford Subcommittee.This Committee consists of eleven, who find great difficulty in meeting j   oases are accordingly dealt with by the Chairman, Secretary and Representative oE&quot; the Distriot.    Good work may be expected of this Committee in the future.Kingsolere Subcommittee,A Committee of 22 who meet as required.    The Regulations are not properly observed,Romford Sub-CommitteeThis division Includes 17 villages and is worked by 12 visitors.    It has been found impossible to fill the vacancies caused by resignations.    There are 26 cases under assistance.    From particulars obtainable these appear to be in order but all oases will be revised.    Disabled men are well looked after.The Inspector for the area is going carefully through the Hampshire Sub-Committees and will report again when tho re-organization has been completed.PRESTON LOCAL COMMITTEE,The accounts are in good order.    A large number of case-papers were examined and with one or two exceptions found to be correct.    A local fund is making grants of 3/6 in many sickness cases.    The existing maternity grant of the National Health Insurance does not more than pay the doctorfs and nurse1s fees*OLpHAM LOCAL COMMITTEE.Considering the large population the payments are small.    A local fund deals with many cases outside the Regulations.     Tho grants are generally in order but the accounts are not very satisfactory owing to payments being entered under the wrong headings.    The recovery of advances is, however,good.EDINBURGH LOCAL COMMITTEE.This Committee is well organized and well administered.     The work is carefully and efficiently attended to by the Acting Clerk and the Treasurer.

Por Reconstruction pertains in some measure to similar post-war activities as Bestora-tion, though it has a different field of application.&quot; Eestoration &quot;-to help certain men towards certain conditions ; &quot; Eeconstruetion &quot; to bring certain conditions more accessible to the reach of all men. (The distinction is rough and ready but it will serve.) These great tasks present different problems problems necessitating different view-points, different means and different lines of research for their true solution; but they are nevertheless allied in the results for good they both must have for those concerned.Eeconstruction, too, must comprise Eestoration  the restoration of the Nation to more than its old-time peaceful and profitable productiveness. And in devising the quickest and surest means of effecting this Eestoration, when only the time for it shall come, the Ministry of Eeconstruction is now most earnestly engaged.But Eestoration, though an end and ideal as applied to men maimed by war, must be regarded as but a half-way house when applied to men and to conditions which are improvable. Eeconstruc-tion, therefore, must aim&apos; at improving as well as restoring, and if, with all the findings and experi-ence of these grim years of war, we do not improve as we restore then our case is deplorable indeed ; for the war will then have been doubly waste.That suggests one way in which war deals more generously with Eeconstruction than with Eestora-tion, for while we of Eeconstruction are frankly and greedily out to snatch profits from the war, by learning from it and becoming more efficient through its teaching, you of Eestoration are, broadly speaking, limited to mitigating its losses. Both of us are working for the same account from different ends, and it is in the same balance sheet that the fruits of our efforts will show. We are co-workers towards converting the deplorable &quot; debtor &quot; balance of war into the &quot; credit &quot; balance of renewed prosperity.It is possible already to foresee dimly places in which we shall be working with, or, within sight of, one another. Schemes for Demobilisation, for instance, which the Ministry of Eeconstruction
is maturing in concert with the departments concerned the Admiralty, the War Office, the Ministry of Labour, the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, the Scottish and Irish offices, and others must almost certainly provide such points. Facilities that may fall under these schemes to able-bodied soldiers must be available also to such pensioners as are able to take advan-tage of them. Suitable modifications of these schemes will no doubt be devised in order to enable partially-able pensioners to take this advantage. In this work will lie another point of convergence between us.It is clear already that demobilisation wiU see a considerable reshuffling of occupations. There will be men who will be unfitted for their old calling, though not necessarily unfitted for some other ; men, too, who, after a soldiers life will be disinclined to return to then- old callings, and many who will be anxious for an open-air life.The Pensions Ministry has already in hand well-considered plans for the treatment and training of men partially disabled. But there will be need, and place, in Beconstruction for training schemes for able-bodied men too.Local Committees working all over the country will be called upon to share in this task of demobi-lisation. For, in determining precedence among the men to be released, the claims and needs of industry at the moment must be taken carefully into account. The men most urgently needed must be demobilised early. Thus, a shipwright will be demobilised for return to his trade before, say, the keeper of a fish shop. To make possible this process of selection the Army is being carefully analysed and graded. Of course, a man&quot;s personal claims, as well as his &quot; family &quot; claims, must be taken into consideration also. His length of service, the number of Ms dependants and similar points cannot be lost sight of.The methods being considered for settling men on the land will no doubt also be of interest to many of your pensioners as well as to able-bodied soldiers. In concert with the Board of Agriculture and other departments such matters as the methods of obtaining land, the building of homesteads, the provision of tools and implements, stock and working capital are being carefully gone into by the Ministry.Nor will the needs of demobilised officers be overlooked. Many of them, there will be, who will return with businesses gone or openings not readily available; men Avho interrupted studies which they find it difficult or impracticable to resume; men, too, with altered circumstances and altered outlooks. For these men Recon-struction must do its part.But the function of the Ministry of Beconstruc-bion is to frame rather than to execute, to devise and suggest and to see that no course of actionthat can be of value in restoring and incre*asiu; the peaceful prosperity of the Nation is over looked; to see in short that all the vast grown which must be covered before this happy stat of things can be brought about, is first exploit and then adequately covered by somebody.There will be great temptations to emigrate, buj Britain will need her men.

Her marriage certificate eon-famed no clue as to age and the church at which she was baptised kept no records after 1849. There was no record in any book, and her name was absent from the family list in the census of 1851. As her brothers and sisters were included in that census the inference is that she was staying with some relatives at that time, but as she had no recollection of any such visit, inquiries in that direction as well led to nothing.The Uses of Publicity.-o-My purpose in writing this article is to explain to the Local War Pensions Committees how they may very materially assist the Ministry in securing what is known as a &quot; good Press.&quot; A good Press does not mean a Press which is merely complimentary and uncritical; that kind of Press is of no use to anyone and exasperates those who conceive that they have grievances which need ventilation. A &quot; good Press &quot; is one which is sympathetic because well informed, which criticises freely when with full understanding of the circumstances criticism appears to be called for, but which does not indulge in carping or nagging. Newspapers have no wish to be unfair even to Government Departments-notoriously unpopular institutions and they can be-come quite friendly if satisfied of two things : First, that a Department honestly is trying to carry out its duties in a humane spirit, and secondly, that it puts forward no claim to infallibility. If the Pensions Ministry and its Local Committees will take the Press frankly into their confidence, let it know of their diffi-culties and of what they seek, however imperfectly, to achieve for the benefit of discharged disabled men, for widows and for children and other dependants, and that they are alert to examine into all grievances-real or unreal-and to admit mistakes when they have been made, then the Press will do its best to help them. I have been a newspaper editor and most other things connected with newspapers for nearly 25 years and I know my colleagues. Be frank with them and they will respond and be frank with you.My first suggestion to the Local Committees under which general title I include the large Joint-Area Com-mittees for treatment and training, and the many Sub-Committees within county Areas- is &quot; that they should invite the representatives of the local newspapers to all their meetings.&quot; Large daily papers circulating in a district have not much space nowadays for reports of meetings of Local War Pensions Committees. Never-theless they should always be invited to send representa-tives. A skilfully condensed paragraph of a few lines is always worth having in a newspaper of wide circula-tion. The local evening newspapers should also be invited to send, and in my view, most important of all the weekly papers. The Local War Pensions Committees are doing work which is of wide public interest, their operations effect a great number of people who are the objects of public sympathy. If the general public are to be kept informed of their good work and how they are always trying to make that work better, the Committees must sit with open doors and ask the representatives of newspapers to come in. They will get more space in weekly papers which specialise in local news than in big morning and evening newspapers which are compelled to take the whole world for their province. Therefore while showing hospitality to the big papers let the Committees never neglect the smaller weekly ones. I am aware that several Local Committees already do what I am asking all to do.   Some neglect
the opportunities for publicity which are at their doors. I would have them all realise that the public cannot be made to understand fully, and sympathise fully, except through the information supplied by the newspapers.When the representatives of the Press attend the meetings of Committees, let them be treated as members of a most responsible profession. Let them be handed all information which may be published, and informed of what should be regarded as confidential. Do not say to them : &quot; You must not report this or that; you must not be told this or that because it is confidential.&quot; Let them know of everything which is being done, indicating what it is not desired should be immediately made public. Trust the representatives of the Press and they will not let you down. Some of us who are newspaper men know more of what is being done at home and abroad than most of the members of the Government, but we do not&apos; misuse our knowledge. The more we know the better we can understand the reasons for secrecy and the more certain we are to keep faith. Therefore I say, trust the Press, let its members know exactly what you are doing and why you do it, treat them as worthy of confidence, and you will not be disappointed.Try always when giving information for publication to put it in a form Avhich can be readily understood. Look out for the &quot; news &quot; value of information and supply it fresh and hot. &quot; News &quot; is not like wine ; it does not improve by keeping.There is another most important means by which the Local Committees may assist the Ministry to win the confidence of the country. From time to time letters or editorial notes will appear in newspapers dealing with the grievances of individuals discharged sailors or soldiers, widows or dependants against the Com-mittees or against the Ministry. It is almost inevitable that there should now and then be cases of real hardship. The numbers of men, women and children with whom the Ministry seeks to deal are expanding by thousands weekly, and it is working with an extemporised staff. Whenever cases of grievance are alleged they will usually be anonymous they should be instantly followed up. The editor should be written to at once by the Secretary of the Local Committee in whose district the newspaper publishing an allegation of hardship circu-lates. He should be asked to put the Local Committees in touch with the writer of the letter, or the inspire!&quot; of the note, in order that full details for investigation may be obtained. No newspaper ever gives away the name of a contributor or correspondent, but as a rule an editor will seek to bring a contributor or correspondent who states a case of hardship into touch with the Secretary of a Local Committee who desires to investi-gate it. If those who allege grievances refuse to give particulars then the editor should be informed at once. He will not continue to give publicity to statements which are not supported by evidence. If particulars are given then a full investigation should be made in the local records or in those of headquarters ; everything should be done which is necessary for complete elucidation.As soon as the Local Committee directly concerned has got to the bottom of the alleged grievance or hard-ship, the result should be communicated at once to the editor of the newspaper in which the charge originally appeared. Whether the result is favourable or un-favourable to the Ministry of Pensions and its Commit-tees should make no difference at all. The result should be communicated frankly and fully. If there has been a mistake made and a real grievance discovered then the immediate public assurance of redress will inspire confidence. If the grievance is baseless then the public-should be informed that their sympathies have been played with. We cannot ask editors of newspapers to submit allegations of grievance or hardship to the Local Committees before making them public though if we win their confidence we may in time arrive at this practical expression of it but we can show to tin editors that we are eager to investigate any charge against us and to plead guilty whenever the evidenei points to our guilt. The very worst thing which any officer of the Ministry or of any Local Committee can do is to claim infallibility for himself, or for the Depart-ment.F.

Such children presented a problem which the Committee decided to solve, and it has reached a very happy solution by the hearty acceptance of a generous offer by Mr. F. M. Lupton of the fine detached residence, &quot; Rockland,&quot; at Chapel-Allerton, for use as a home for soldiers&apos; orphans. This house will provide accommoda-tion for forty children, and the grounds are delightful and extensive.Mr. Lupton&apos;s offer of the residence at a nominal annual rental of  1 has been gratefully accepted, and it is to be called &quot; The Rockland Home for the Children of Soldiers and Sailors.&quot; It is proposed to establish forty children there, aged up to six years, but to avoid any painful division of families older children will be taken at the discretion of the Committee.&quot; Rockland&quot; will be conducted under the joint auspices of the Leeds War Pensions Committee and the Leeds Day Nursery and School for Mothers. It will be financed by the War Pensions Committee, who will solicit special funds for that purpose. A House Com-mittee has been elected consisting of representatives of the War Pensions Committee, Lady Mayoress&apos;s Committee, and regular voluntary helpers.Equipment is estimated to cost  500 and the annual maintenance to slightly exceed  1,100. Two other homes, to accommodate thirty children each, have been under contemplation, and they would each cost  905 annually, involving a total annual expenditure for the three of  2,919.To meet this, there is an anticipated State allowance of  1,560, and a donation of  250 from the Lady Mayoress&apos;s Committee, leaving a deficit of  1,109 to be met.The scheme is being laid before the Ministry of Pen-sions, with a request to know exactly what help might be anticipated.

Local Committees at Work.No. 8.-County of Kent.The County War Pensions, etc., Local Committee, whose work commenced on 1st October, 1916, was formed in accordance with a scheme framed by the Kent County Council, and consists of thirty members, of whom seventeen, including the County Medical Officer of Health, are Representatives of the Council, the other members being Representatives of the following organisations, namely : The Kent Federation of Trades&apos; Councils. The National Union of Railwaymen. Organisations in Kent affiliated to the Standing P Joint Committee of Industrial Women&apos;s Orga-p nisations.Soldiers and Sailors Families Association. Soldiers and Sailors Help Society.There are six lady members. The Chairman of the Committee is Coles Child, Esq. The Administrative Area of the Committee comprises a population of some-thing like one million people. The Committee has appointed a small Finance and General Purposes Sub-Committee and a Disablements Sub-Committee, which comprises all the members, with a Special Case Sub-Committee consisting of eight members. The various Committees hold regular quarterly meetings and special meetings as found necessary.Head Office.This is at Maidstone, and is in charge of a Secretary with the necessary staff. To this office, which act3 as a kind of clearing-house for the Sub-Committees, come all communications from the Ministry of Pensions affecting the Area, such as notifications of discharged men, awards of pensions and gratuities, alternative pensions, treatment cards A.F. E. 3555, showing further treatment required by men on discharge, medical reports of Special Boards of treatment required by men on re-examination, notifications of grants to dependants by the Civil Liabilities Committee, communications on misconduct cases, awards of grants in cases that have to be referred to the Ministry.under Regulation Part 2, all forms required for use in the Area, new circulars, etc., etc. In the office is kept a County Register of cases dealt with, and records of every description to enable full information to be supplied to the Ministry when called for. Difficult cases are referred daily by the Sub-Committees to the Head Office for decision, and the Secretary advises the Sub-Committees on the many matters about which they find it necessary to consult him. The work in the Head Office is con-tinually increasing and about one hundred envelopes arrive by post every day, necessitating some kind of dealing with two hundred to three hundred communica-tions.Accounts.The accounts of the Committee are all kept by thel County Accountant at his office and involve a great deal I of work.Divisional Sub-Committees.These have been appointed throughout the Area, one Sub-Committee being appointed for practically each petty-sessional division with certain modifications to meet special local conditions. These Sub-Committees (including several branches who have their own offices and executive) number thirty-seven. In the first instance the Sub-Committees consisted of the existing branches of the Soldiers and Sailors Families Association and the Soldiers and Sailors Help Society, which have since been and are still being strengthened as occasion arises by the addition of nominated representatives of local authorities gnd other bodies representing employers and labour in the county. Each Sub-Committee has its own offices, Secretary and Treasurer, and carries on its work in the manner found to be most convenient for its particular locality. The duties imposed on tlu Committee under Statutory Committee Regulations Part 2, have been delegated to the Sub-Committee-who have dealt with this portion of the work in ar efficient manner. The work under Statutory Committei Regulations, Part 1, has been carried on by the Sub Committees through the agency of the Head Office, and the work under Ministry of Pensions Instruction-and Notes on Alternative Pensions and Treatment, and Training is carried on in a similar way at present.Treatment.Under Instruction 8 of the Ministry of Pension-Instructions and Notes on Treatment and Training s classified list of hospitals in the Area has been prepare.; and treatment is available at all these hospitals a-occasion arises. They comprise eleven military hos-pitals, with some auxiliary hospitals, more than ft V.A.D. hospitals, various civil and general and speck hospitals. In addition, various hospitals outside thj Area are available such as military special and orthoj psedic hospitals, and hospitals at Bath, Buxton, eti Sanatorium and domiciliary treatment for tuberculosi cases is provided tlu&apos;ough the County Insurance Com mittee. Treatment is being given in a large numbfl of cases and is involving much work, no fewer than 2ii( cases having been recorded at the Head Office durm September.Training.Considering the number of discharges of which tit Committee has received notification since it starte; work on 1st October, 1916, namely, 4,977 during tli year ending 30th September, 1917, there have bee: very few applications for training. So far training ha actually been arranged for eighty-nine men in th following occupations, viz. : Brushmaking, boot an&apos; shoemaking and repairing, motor mechanics, upholstery electrical   engineering,   typewriting,   shorthand   aw
175December, 1917.T-oiumercial work, sanitary inspector, fruit growing, ahotography, etc. Most of the training cases arranged, o date have been dealt with by the various London [raining Institutions, who have kindly given every acility to the Committee to send men to them for raining. In these cases the training is arranged on behalf of the Committee by the London War Pensions Committee, who also have undertaken to pay the fees maintenance allowances to these, men. This arrangement is obviously a most convenient one and ares the necessity of remitling money through the )0st to men during their training.For a certain number of cases local training has been irranged, and it is hoped to develop this form of training is lime goes on, more especially in individual workshops, is the present facilities for training on a large scale in he county are not great, it being of corpse much more in agricultural than an industrial county. This fact vails attention to the South-Eastern Agricultural College at Wye, where training is available in all kinds if agricultural work. The Kent Education Committee are co-operating nth the Local Committee and have already formulated i scheme, which has been approved, for providing gaining in brass, bronze, copper, wrought iron and iieet iron at a Trades School near Chatham, and they ire prepared if desired, to make further arrangements if a similar kind.Reference should be made to the Joint Advisory Committee which has recently been formed for the areas ulnrinistered respectively by the Kent, Surrey and Sussex Local Committees, with Captain H. H. Baud, D.S.O., a Representative of the Ministry of Pensions is the Hon. Secretary. This Joint Committee has been formed with the idea of pooling the resources of the three Counties for disablement purposes, and it is hoped that as time goes on it will greatly increase the facilities lor dealing with cases which any individual Local Committee may experience difficulty in dealing with. Phis obviously opens up many possibilities ; for instance, io mention one thing only, the desirability of the provision in the future of one or more training institu-tions within the Joint Area, but at this stage it is of course impossible to know what future requirements nil be. At all events, machinery has been provided that should enable future problems arising in the Joint Area being dealt with through the help of the Joint Advisory Committee in the manner that may he found most advantageous.Employment.So far the question of employment has caused the Committee no anxiety owing to the abnormal demand for labour. The majority of the discharged men who do not require training either obtain work for themselves fir with the assistance of an Employment Exchange.In conclusion, this short article is barely more than a statement of the method&quot;of work adopted and the preliminary aiTangements made by the&quot; Committee. Time alone will show what new schemes may be neededfor the satisfactory performance of the Committee&apos;s onerous and responsible duties under the Ministry of Pensions, but it is certain that the Committee will spare no effort to ensure that all proper care and atten-tion shall be given to the case of every discharged disabled sailor or soldier residing in their administrative Area.P. G. STENNING, Maidstone, Secretary.October, 1917.Note.Since writing the foregoing account, there has been a large increase in the number of applications for training, and it is hoped in addition to making provision for training in private workshops, that with the assist-ance of the Kent Education Cornmittee, a scheme may shortly be submitted for the sanction of the Minister of Pensions for provision of training on a considerable scale in the technical institutes in the county.A scheme for training men on fruit farms in the various operations of the fruit-growing industry, has been prepared with the assistance of the Kent War Agricul-tural Committee, and is now under the consideration of the Minister of Pensions.A special Sub-Committee has recently been appointed, at the request of the Minister of Pensions, to undertake the investigation of, and to make reports on appeals to the Appeals Tribunal of discharged men who have been refused pensions on the ground that their disability was neither attributable to nor aggravated by their war service.The volume of the work of all kinds appears to be rapidly increasing. The Committee received notification of the discharge of nearly 800 men during October.F. G. S.Wallasey and the Civil Liabilities Department.-o-In addition to its other many duties the Wallasey Local Committee have undertaken on behalf of the Civil Liabilities Commissioner for the County of Chester, the investigation of all cases which he may refer to them. Since November, 1916, 450 cases have been so referred and the work of investigation is still proceeding at the rate of about seven per week. The Committee have also agreed to pay monthly all grants to those who ask to be paid more frequently than quarterly, and already 440 grants (about 40 per cent, of the total in Wallasey) have been notified by the Department to be paid through the Local Committee, involving a payment since the 1st July last of  3,010. The Committee understand that their services have been of much assistance to the County Commissioner and the Depart-ment as they are able to obtain knowledge through direct touch with the applicants which it is quite impossible for a Central Department to adduce from documentary evidence, no matter how carefulJy prepared,
The Care of War Orphans in France.-o-&quot; La Revue Philanthropique&quot; for August, 1917, contains the text of a Law promulgated on the 27th July, 1917, which provides for the State guardianship of of children whose parents have been killed or injured as a result of the war.The Law is entitled, &quot; Loi instituant des pupilles de la nation.&quot;The Law provides that children whose father, mother, guardian, or breadwinner has either been killed or has died as the result of the war, or is unable to gain a living by reason of wounds received or illness contracted as a result of the war, may be placed under public guardian-ship and maintained and educated at the charge of the State until they are of age. In the case of partial disability on the part of the parent or.breadwinner the State will undertake partial responsibility.A child will not, however, become automatically a ward of the State on becoming an orphan or in need. Application on its behalf must be made by certain per-sons prescribed in the Law, and local courts will decide whether or not the conditions which entitle a child to become a ward are fulfilled.An elaborate special organisation is set up to carry out the intentions of the law. A central office, the &quot; Office National,&quot; is to be attached to the Ministry of Public Instruction, but it is to have its own staff. The Council of the central office is to consist of 89 elected members, representative of the &quot; Conseils generaux,&quot; municipal authorities, educational interests and social organisations. This Council may co-opt as members women known for their work on behalf of children. Three at least of the permanent officers of the central office must be women.In each department also an office will be set up and a Council formed composed of members elected to represent the various local interests and representatives of the State. One-third of the elected delegates must be women.The department offices have power to set up Local Committees in each commune, if they think it desirable.The department offices become, in effect, the guardians of all children who are adopted in accordance with the Law as wards of the State. They have certain legal rights over-the children, and are responsible for their care and well-being. They may place them in families as boarders, or in institutions, and are responsible for their education, apprenticeship, and placing in employ -ment.The department offices will have funds at their disposal, derived from local (departmental and commu-nal) sources from the contributions of public and private associations, from legacies, and from the monies allotted to them by the central office out of the credits voted by Parliament for the purpose.Sixty-three thousand men are now drawing Common-wealth War Pensions, making a total sum of  2,140,000 annually.Meetings of Local Committees.--o--Enfield.This Sub-Committee has recently submitted a report on the first three months&apos; working of the Provident Fund, to which allusion was made in the &quot; War Pensior, Gazette &quot; for the month of July.It is stated therein that a sum of  38 14s. lid. has been collected. The number of cases in the various wards were as follow: Chase Ward, 171 ; Bush Hill Park, 76 ; Ponders End and Highway, 62.The Chairman said he considered the Fund an excel-lent idea, as it taught thrift and providence. They wen very grateful to the doctors for the help they had givenAt the meeting it was also stated that the Edmontoi. Board of Guardians had agreed to grant the use of their ambulance in the event of disabled soldiers, their wives or dependants requiring urgent removal to a hospital.Norfolk.The Chairman suggested that the following resolutioi should be adopted by the Committee: &quot; That thi War Pensions Committee is prepared to place its organi sation at the disposal of the Civil Liabilities authorities believing that the interests of soldiers and their depen dents would be better safeguarded by closer co-operatiui and co-ordination between the War Pensions authorit; and Civil Liabilities Commission, and they aske; whether the Ministry of Pensions was prepared to talo steps to secure that.&quot; This was agreed to, Hi Chairman pointing out that a Commissioner could no have the widespread knowledge that the members of i Committee had. The number of cases which had beei switched on them justified the passing of the resolution. !The Chairman drew the attention of the members 11 a well-made pair of gentleman&apos;s boots which wc-i displayed on the table, and stated that thev were mad by a disabled soldier who was sent by the Committee t Messrs. Rutland, Ltd., at Norwich, a few months ag to learn shoemaking. He had been an ostler and hai had no  previous  experience.Flxchley.At the annual meeting of the Committee the Chairma: gave a short resume of the Committee&apos;s work for llif past year. Over 2,000 separation allowance cases hat been dealt with during that time, and 325 discharge: men. About 40 visitors in the three Finchleys ant Whetstone are constantly visiting sailors and soldier-their wives and dependants in their own homes.The thanks of the Committee were cordially tenderc to all these helpers, and the Secretary was asked t express the same to those concerned.The Committee has had cards printed, one of whiei they are most anxious that every discharged man in tl) I district shall receive. The card is addressed to disable i soldiers and sailors, and states that they can get til fullest information as to what can be done for then I from their War Pensions Local Committee.

Bolton.Sir S. H. Scott has set aside  1,000 to meet emergency cases, which the Committee gratefully acknowledge as helping them to relieve much unnecessary anxiety.No public appeal for voluntary contributions has been made, and it is stated -elsewhere in the annual report that it has been proved that there are not very many cases that cannot be met by the comprehensive regula-tions governing this branch of the work, but in regard to some criticisms it was unfortunate that the Com-mittee should have been credited with greater powers than they possessed.Fifeshire.The Fifeshire Local Committee in their annual report state that it had been*found that the system adopted by the Ministry for the training of men had in practice liecn cumbersome. It was impossible to arrange training for a discharged man in any branch of industry without the consent of the Ministry of Pensions. The delay in receiving the consent of the Ministry in most cases was very great, and the result was that the men, instead of waiting to be trained, would rather accept employment in a temporary capacity, which, of course, was quite good while the war lasted, but might result disastrously for the men should they not be able to fid low their pre-war occupations after the war.Oldham.At a recent meeting the Oldham Local Committee discussed the regulation referring to pre-war income as governing the allowance of special assistance to soldiers&apos; dependents, and the following resolution was adopted : &quot; That we express to the Ministry of Pensions our strong disapproval and dissatisfaction with the regulation dealing with the applications for special allowances which have to be decided upon pre-war income, inflicting as it does great hardship by reason of the greatly increased cost of living. We suggest that it would be much more equitable if a suitable addition were made to meet the increased cost of commodities.&quot;East Ham.During a meeting the Mayor, on behalf of the Lord Kitchener National Memorial Fund, formally presented a hand-propelled invalids chair to Corp. R. Whebell, who has lost both legs.Wrexham.At a meeting of the Town Council the Mayor referred to pending developments of a most important character, Wrexham having been selected as a centre for the training of wounded soldiers. The Cimliffe estate at Acton Park had practically been acquired by -Mr. Oppenheimer, who was acting in co-opera-tion with the Ministry of Pensions, and about twenty-five acres would be devoted to the establishment of a diamond-cutting industry for the employment of disabled men. About sixty-nine acres would be resold to the Corporation for the erection of 700 houses for the working classes, and the remaining 140 acres or there-abouts would be presented by Mr. Oppenheimer to the Nation, to be utilised for the training of disabled soldiers in the cultivation of small holdings.Hayle-Marazion.Mr. Drew, the Secretary of the County Local Com-mittee, attended a meeting of this Sub-Committee, and, in the course of his address, he said that there was a big batch of men in Cornwall who were suffering from tuberculosis, but for these men there was nothing provided. For the past six months he had tried to bring home to the County Council the seriousness of the position, for there was no home of any kind or sanatorium in the county. The County Council should get this business started. The ^ounty Patriotic Com-mittee had offered  2,500 to the County Council, to be repaid after the war. The excuse had been that the County Council had no money. They had hunted the county over for a house. One place after another had failed them, but now he thought they had a reasonable proposition before them as a county, and he understood the Council would undertake to maintain a house and grounds providing they were given free. There could be no better war memorial than to provide such a home, or hospital or sanatorium, and he hoped the county would rise to the help of this most pressing need.Surrey.The Chairman, at a recent meeting, invited the members to take immediate action in all cases of hardship of which they heard either personally or through the Press, and communicate with the County Committee. In the first instance any such case could be inquired into by the Local Sub-Committees, and if necessary dealt with by them, or referred to the Secretary of the County Committee or himself. It was very desirable that statements which sometimes were not correct should appear in the public Press without at once being investigated. Very often inquiries showed that they were not substantiated. &quot; I think you will all agree that we should have the greatest publicity possible in regard to any case of complaint.&quot;Attention was also called to the enormous volume of work, and it was stated that it would be interesting to the public to know that the number dealt with since the Committee first came into being, from July 1st, 1916, to June 30th, 1917, was 23,386. He did not think anyone had any idea of the volume of work the Com-mittee had to do from day to day, and that volume was increasing.We have been requested to add the following addresses of the National Health Insurance Commis-sion to the list published last month : Scotland. 83, Princes Street, Edinburgh.Ireland.

The Treatment and Training of the Disabled.No. 8.-The First Home of Recovery, Golders Green.Shell Shock may make its appearance in at least half-a-dozen different forms, ranging from a temporary nervous disturbance, readily cured by rest and proper treatment, to an actual physical shattering of nerves, which leaves the sufferer to all appearance a permanently paralysed wreck. The cases with which I have now to deal for which the Home of Recovery, Golders Green, was established as the first model Institution, and of which there are already ten copies in many parts of the country come between the temporary and the per-manent. The Home of Recovery and Craig Avon (Belfast), and their as yet incompleted sister Institutions, seek to restore to health those whom continuous war strain has reduced to a condition of chronic functional nervous disease. The men treated there, and happily many of them cured there and returned to civil life as use-fid citizens, have all spent months in military hospitals before being given up as chronic cases and discharged from the Navy or Army. The Home of Recovery may almost be described as the &quot; Last Hope&quot; of the chronic nerve-shattered man. If this hope fails-  or if men foolishly leave before their cure has been carried so far as it can go then nothing is left to the men except to attend the Supplementary Clinics or to struggle on as best they may in their own homes. They receive pensions, of course, but the Ministry of Pensions has, in co-operation with the British Red Cross Society, set \ip the first Home of Becovery and is equipping other similar hospitals, because it refuses to abandon hope of curing nerve-shattered men and of training them for civil life, so long as any prospect of success remains..A Matter op Definition.I have described the men who are treated at the Home of Recovery, Golders Green, as sufferers from chronic functional nervous disorder, and I will do my best to explain what this description means. The first case which I myself saw at the headquarters of the Special Medical Board, 78, Lancaster Gate, gave me an example both of &quot; organic &quot; and &quot; functional &quot; nervous disorder. He had been shot through the arm and the nerves leading to two of his fingers had been severed by the bullet. These cut nerves had been joined as the result of a surgical operation, but as yet there was Httle movement, and no power in the two fingers, whose links with the brain had been interrupted. That nervous injury was &quot; organic,&quot; an actual physical defect. In addition the man was a sufferer from &quot; functional &quot; nervous trouble. His hands when stretched out fluttered so rapidly that the outlines became a haze. He could not remember the date of his enlistment, and all his answers to gently put questions were fhirried and inaccurate. His face was pale and his eyes painfully strained.   He looked a man terrifiedand yet nothing could have been kinder and more considerate than the attitude of the two doctors who sat at a little table with him and me. He brightened up a good deal when assured that he would be discharged from the Army and under no circumstances would return to the Army. When the man rose up and moved from the room his feet dragged like those of a paralytic. Yet, apart from the cut but healing nerves in his arm this man&apos;s nervous system was whole. His nerves had ceased to work properly, they were disordered, producing disease, they would not carry out their ordinary &quot; functions,&quot; yet they might be restored.The Origin of the First Home.Until their discharge disabled men are placed in military hospitals in France and in England, and their final discharge is not decided upon by the Specia Medical Board until it is judged that their Service days are over. What happens to the men is somewhat as follows : First, they go to hospitals in France behind the lines. Here most of the men quickly recover. If they are healthy subjects they are soon able to return to duty. Those less healthy, whose treatment yield.&apos; less favourable results, pass to base hospitals in France A further weeding out process goes on and, the demand upon space being very great, those who seem most likely to recover quickly go to ordinary military hospitals those whose nervous systems are more obdurate an sent to military hospitals which have neurologica departments. The last line of Army treatment in England before discharge consists of special neurologica: hospitals such as Maghull (Liverpool), and Springfield (Tooting). Very many men are cured here, and it i; only the men who during this final process of treatment fail to respond to it who are discharged from Maghull and Springfield into civil life.The establishment of the Home of Recovery, Golder Green, was due, in the first instance, to the untirini efforts of Colonel Sir John Collie, M.D., President of the Special Medical Board which examines the men. approves their discharge, and recommends them on discharge for pensions, temporary allowances n: gratuities. He saw that unless Institutions of the kincj could be provided and treatment in other way; arranged for at clinics, there would be large numbers ol sailors and soldiers returned to civil life as hopeles; wrecks. Once men with functional nervous disease become really chronics and all will power is lost the? are cured by stimulating their will power there is very little chance of their unaided recovery.The Ministry of Pensions supported the scheme, and the British Red Cross Society offered to put at the disposal of the Ministry funds which made the equip ment&apos; of the first Home possible, and a very suitable ho\ise and grounds at Golders Green which had beer designed, built, and laid out for a young ladies&apos; school-was available. Maida Vale Hospital consented to place its staff of physicians at the service of the discharged men who were to be treated there. The Medical Superintendent at the Home of Recovery, had, before
taking up this post, a large experience with chronic nervous cases at Springfield.This then is the story of how the Home of Recovery at Golders Green came into being-it was opened early in June of this year (1917).Men, who have been discharged at any stage in their naval or military treatment, may apply to enter the Home. Some are men who, in ordinary civil life, even if they had never served, would have been of a morbid, self-conscious, habit of mind. Not many men of out of doors sporting instincts find their way into chronic nervous lists and so into the Home of Recovery. And thus it comes about that the Home of Recovery has to deal with cases selected for difficulty, not for ease, of treatment. When it succeeds it is performing some-thing approaching a medical miracle. And yet the medical miracle quite often is performed.The Supplementary Clinics.It is not only at Golders Green and at its sister Institutions that nerve-shattered sailors and soldiers will be treated and cured. They are multiplying rapidly; the obvious merit of the work which they arc doing attracts to them the support not only of the Pensions Ministry, and the Red Cross Society, but also of the pious donor. While this pamphlet was in pre-paration a citizen of Manchester who desires to do good by stealth and to remain anonymous handed a cheque for  50,000 to the Minister of Pensions to aid the Department in equipping these and other similar Institutions. But when the first Home of Recovery and all the others have done their utmost much will remain to do. Many disabled men are unwilling to enter a special Institution, others are as adequately treated in clinics as out-patients. And the great advantage of the small clinic for out-patients over the large institution for residents is its comparative cheap-ness. One needs only a suitable house in a suitable district and a staff of doctors and nurses. It has been decided by the Ministry to start these small clinics at mice, several are projected for London, and the first is about to be opened at 80, Lancaster Gate under the charge of Major Kerr, R.A.M.C., a member of the Special Medical Board. The men who attend these clinics will receive the same personal attention as those who live at Golders Green for their cure is effected by personal influence more than by anything else they will be built up by gentle exercise in a gymnasium under the instruction of skilled nurses, and they will be able to live at home and even occupy their minds with light remunerative work.As the institutions and clinics expand, the chief difficulty will be to obtain the specially trained doctors upon whom depend the whole science and art of treat-ment. It is not a case with the nerve-shattered man of a facile amputation or the writing of a prescription. They have to be studied and influenced as individual human beings. Few medical men have had in ordinary practice any experience of the kind needed, and in order that a sufficient number may gain it there hasbeen set up what I may call a &quot; School &quot; for nerve specialists at Maghull, Liverpool.What the Home op Recovery is Like.Highfield, which has been turned into the first Home of Recovery, is a large house, standing back from Golders Green Road, and has attached to it beautiful grounds and a large garden. The estate covers 12  acres. There is accommodation for 100 cases, and before long there will be room for fifty more. No institution of the kind must be large within reasonable limits the smaller the better.In the grounds are workshops ; one for light en-gineering, in which men are taught the use of lathes and drilling machines, and that most ancient of all mechanical trades iron forging. In another shop are taught carpentering and. woodwork generally, and the men take much interest in making small articles of furniture for their own homes. There is a basket-making shop ; an old motor car, taken down and put together many times, serves for instruction in motor mechanics ; switchboards are made and lights fitted up, and so some acquaintance with electric light fitting-is acquired. A most interesting feature of the establish-ment is a large French garden equipped for producing vegetables by intensive culture. Major Fraser, one of the leading exponents in England of the French system, has at the request of the Ministry of Pensions moved the whole of his plant of frames and glass &quot;cloches &quot; to the Home, and there an almost incredible quantity of early vegetables will be grown upon a couple of acres. It is hoped that this French gardening will from the comparative light nature of the work inspire enthusiasm among these disabled men, and will also be a means of encouraging generally the extensive adoption of French methods of culture.The Courses at the Home. When a man has been recommended for the Home of Recovery by the Special Medical Board he is put first on a waiting list, for usually he cannot be entered at once. It happens, unfortunately, that a good many men who are offered what for simplicity we may call the Golders Green treatment, do not accept it, and a good many more who do accept change their nervous minds. When a man has entered he is placed in the hospital and brought under the direct personal influence of the resident medical staff and of the visiting physicians. The business of the doctors is by patience and gentle tact to make close friends of the individual men, to stimulate their will power and desire of recovery by direct personal influence, and to make them under-stand that the Ministry in caring for them is not anxious to save money over their pensions. Patients, though many of them have had twelve months or more in military hospitals, do respond fairly quickly to this personal intensive treatment and then become con-valescents. There are continual disappointments, con-tinual sets back, but the work goes on and the curve of improvement steadily rises. If it does not, if it proves immovable, then the Home of Recovery can do
nothing. During convalescence a man&apos;s physical strength is built up and his will power steadily improved. Soon he becomes able to &quot; sit up and take notice &quot; and show some intelligent interest in his surroundings. With interest comes a rapid advance towards a con-dition to which the word Health may be applied. Then when a man is considered well enough to do light work he passes to the garden or to one of the workshops and there his cure is carried so far as it will go.The Ministry&apos;s Inducements.No man can be forced to enter the Home at Golders Green or any similar Institution&apos;. All entry is voluntary. But the Ministry of Pensions has the financial powers, and exercises them freely, to induce men who suffer from chronic functional nervous disease to take advantage of the Home of Becovery. Every man who enters is put at once upon the highest scale of disablement pension. Upon the scale of pensions and allowances a great many men who go to the Home of Becovery are better off financially when there than they have ever been in their lives before. It is an essential part of the humane system of the Ministry of Pensions that men under treatment should be free from the worries which arise from anxiety for the comfort of their families.The Home is a hospital, yet it is not a bit like a hospital. It much more resembles a very comfortable country house. Very willingly would I spend there many weeks or months. The rooms are large and airy, the sun shines through the great clear windows. There are indoor and outdoor games and recreations to suit all tastes. It is a place very soothing to the nerves, an ideal spot in which to laze away a summer and in which to write a novel. I almost wish that I were a disabled soldier and could stay at Golders Green until I were reported to be cured. I should, I confess, be in no great hurry to be cured.    BENNET COPPLESTONE.Germany.-o-Unemployed Disabled Soldiers in the Rhine Province.In a recent number of &quot; Soziale Praxis &quot; a report issued at the beginning of June last by the Committee for the Care of the Disabled in the Rhine Provinces is summarised.The 43 Local Committees of the Province  report between them 927 cases of unemployed disabled soldiers ; this number represents 3-4 per cent, of the total number of disabled men known to the Provincial Committee. The cases are placed in four groups : 209 are classed as willing to work,92 as &quot; work-shy,&quot; 395 as temporarily unfit for work, 231 as permanently unfit. 447 are single men and 480 married.   The wives and children of the married men represent a total of 1,989 persons.The average loss of earnings for all these unemployed disabled men was estimated at 66-3 per cent. Tlu.. average monthly pension received by them worked out at 55&quot; 30 M.; in the case of the married men the pension represents 12&quot; 80 M. for each member of the family.The greatest number of unemployed in one class were the nervous cases, who number 189, or 20*5 per cent, j next the tubercular, 1S7 or 20-3 per cent. ; the blind number 16, or 1*8 per cent., and those with an ampu-tated arm 28, or 3 per cent.The men fit for work and willing to do it were as a rule unable to obtain it because their capacity was ton much reduced by their injuries. Those shy of work did not obtain it, either because their capacity to work was under-estimated, or because they had no desire to work, or because they received a pension or some other allowance which disinclined them to make any effort.The majority^ of the unemployed who are willing to work are disabled in the arm or leg, showing that such injuries are a severe handicap even in the present favourable state of the labour market. A large number are suffering from internal injuries ; in these cases the serious reduction of bodily strength appears to be a great hindrance in obtaining work.The majority of those classed as work-shy are injured in the arm. Nervous cases are also numerous, and case-of injury to the head and legs.The temporarily unfit for work are tuberevdar o: mental cases, or those suffering from internal complaintsAmong the permanently unfit are a large number oi hopeless cases, most of whom will have to be maintained in provincial institutions for an indefinite period. There are also a number of nervous cases and of mental cases in this class.Resumption of work is found to be easiest for agri-culturists, brain workers, hand workers, and professional men, and most difficult for unskilled men and miners.The amount of pension granted does not by any means correspond to the decrease in earning power. Pensions are lowest in the case of tubercular, nervous and internal cases. The highest pensions are paid foi arm and leg amputations, arm and leg wounds, head wounds, mental diseases and blindness.Loans for Disabled Soldiers.The Central Committee of the German Union of tin Red Cross have informed the Imperial Committee foi the Care of Disabled Soldiers that they are prepared t set aside certain sums to enable Provincial Committee; for the Care of the Disabled to grant loans free of interest to suitable disabled men.The loans will be granted only through the Provincia Committees for the Care of the Disabled, who will hi required to show that an applicant for a grant is a fit person as to character, past life and ability to use fcht money to advantage. Only married men of industrioii: habits are to be eligible. The loans are intended ti enable them to reinstate themselves in their forme: trade or profession. As a rule loans will not exceed  12; and must be repaid in 10 years.
The Eccentric Club Hostels.-o-In the early days of the training of disabled men, those who left Roehampton after a partial training were bv arrangement sent forward to the Regent Street Pi il ytechnic for a period of from four to six months to complete their training.The difficulty of providing suitable accommodation for the increasing number of men became apparent, and 1 approached Mr. G. F. Cripps with the view of his helping to provide a Hostel for the men. He at once generously offered rent free the upper part of the premises at 17, Hanover Street, Hanover Square, and at the same time handed me a cheque for  360 to cover the cost of furnishing it for about forty men.A sum of  1,000 was subscribed for maintenance, and 17, Hanover Street was opened by the Rt. Hon. G. N. Barnes, the Minister of Pensions, on April 20th, 1917.Subsequent gatherings of the Club were held and the need of more Hostels being put before the notice of the members, several amounts were raised, and frequently as much as  2,000 was subscribed in a single evening. Sir Charles and Lady Wyndham lent the New Theatre for a matinee, which realised  800, and Lady Wyndham organised a matinee at the Criterion and appeared in her old part in &quot; The Mollusc.&quot; This was also a very successful entertainment and realised over  500. Mr. Walter de Preece played the part of auctioneer at some of the Club dinners with such success that soon the sum of  10.000 had been realised. The burden of the work rested on Mr. G. F. Cripps, to whose energy and interest (he success of the scheme is mainly due. Mr. James White gave  1,000 towards a Hostel to the memory of Captain Ball, V.C. This was opened on July 4th by Brigadier-General Chaiiton, C.B., D.S.O. General Sir Francis Lloyd opened the Annexe to the Soho Square Hostel.The Rt. Hon. G. N. Barnes, accompanied by Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen, opened 16, Hanover Street and Parkers Place, the former premises being lent by Messrs. W. H. Smith &amp; Son and the latter by Messrs. Peter Robinson.The first provincial Hostels opened were provided hy the Yorkshire members of the Club, and two splendid buildings have been placed at the disposal of the Club fur the purpose, one being lent by the Corporation of Barnsley and the other by one of the principal firms in the town. The Rt. Hon. Jolm Hodge opened the next provincial Hostel at Brighton to provide accommodation for the men in training as diamond cutters, and Mr. Oppenheimer, a member of the Club, has given  1,000 for the establishment of a second Hostel in the town.The last to be opened was at Birmingham, and the ceremony was performed in the presence of a number of distinguished citizens of Birmingham by the Minister of Pensions on Saturday, October 13th.This last makes the tenth Hostel that has been fully furnished and equipped with accommodation for a total of about 350 men.The men in residence are provided with accommodationand attendance free, also a contribution of 3s. per week is made towards the men&apos;s mess account.The men form amongst themselves a Mess Committee, set out what they require for the week, the purchases are made by the Matron and the food is cooked and served by the Staff. Thus the men not only get an adequate quantity of food but they also obtain what they wish.As few rules as possible are laid down, the desire being that the men should cultivate self-control and that the Hostel should be a reflection of real home life, as far as possible, and a note is given to each guest on entering the Hostel setting out his personal responsibility for its being properly conducted.A Local Committee of Control is formed or being formed for each Hostel consisting of three members of the Eccentric Club and two members of the Local War Pensions Committee. This Committee has no financial liability, all such being borne by the Eccentric Club Central Hostel Control Committee.It is intended to open similar Hostels in Blackpool, Leicester, Nottingham, and other centres, but  1,000 has to be guaranteed by the district members in each case to ensure their maintenance.The Treasurer has on deposit  7,500 after payment of all expenses for equipping and fuiiiishing the ten Hostels, and it is calculated that this is sufficient for their maintenance for three years. Subscriptions are continually being received and the financial condition is quite sound. No one who is not a member of the Club is permitted to subscribe, and the sole object of the members in providing these Hostels is to afford every facility to the Local War Pensions Committees of the district in which the Hostels are situated for ensuring that the men under training are well housed, well fed and well cared for, and to give every encouragement to the men to take up such a course of training as wall enable them to fill useful spheres in the industrial life of the Nation.ROBERT MITCHELL, Major.A Letter to the Editor.Dear Sir,I have had an off a of marriage and if I accept it should I be entitled to the Gratuity and how should I go on for separation allowance as the man is serving in the Army and one of my husband biggest and best friend I should not like to take the chance when 1 don&apos;t know to go and as I lmre only seen the man once I don&apos;t know if he as enquired would you please let me know particulars.I remainP.S.

Pensions in Parliament.--o-Pensions.Mr. Needham asked the Pensions Minister whether a man discharged time-expired after the outbreak of the present war, and subsequently rejected for further military service on medical grounds, is entitled to a gratuity under Article 7 (2) of the Eoyal Warrant and Order in Council of the 29th March last, his medical unfitness being certified as neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service; if not, whether he proposes that provision should be made for such a case ; whether such a man has the right of appeal to the Pensions Appeals Tribunal against the decision that his unfitness is neither attributable to nor aggravated by military service ; and, if not, whether he proposes to give such a man the right of appeal ?Mr. Hodge: Unless a man has been discharged on medical grounds he has no claim to pension or gratuity, nor has he the right of appeal to the Pensions Appeals Tribunal He has a right, however, to represent his case to the Pensions Ministry for consideration under Article 9 of the Royal Warrant, and if he can prove his present disability to have arisen out of his service he will be admitted to pension in the same way as a man duly invalided. Further provision in the matter does not seem to me to be necessary.Mr. Peto asked the Secretary of State for India whether a decision has been arrived at with regard to extending the provisions of the Royal Warrant of August, 1917, relating to disability pensions to officers of the Indian Army and Indian Army Reserve ; and what is the minimum pension now granted to an officer with wife and chid invalided out of these forces owing to wounds sustained in the present war ?Mr. Herbert Fisher : The question of extending to officers of the Indian Army and the Indian Army Reserve the provisions of the Royal Warrant of August 1917, relating to officers&apos; disability pensions is under consideration. The minimum pension under Indian Army Regulations for an officer of the Indian Army or the Indian Army Reserve invalided out of the Service is half-pay at 3s. a day for a second-lieutenant or lieutenant, but to this may be added a wound pension of  100 a year if a limb has been lost, or  50 a year in other cases of permanent and very severe injury. These rates are not affected by the fact that an officer has a wife and child.Mr. Anderson asked the Pensions Minister whether he is aware that certain medical doctors when re-examining discharged men with a view to a possible revision of pension have a habit of asking them what wages they are earning ; whether he can state for what reason this inquiry is made ; and whether assessment for pension is based upon injuries received or whether it bears some relationship to economic circumstances ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : As regards the first part of the question inquiries as to earnings should not take place, but as it has been represented that the practice has not entirely ceased, the Army Council have at my request recently issued an Instruction in the matter. As regards the second part, the assessment for medium pension is based purely on the extent of a man&apos;s dis-ability without regard to what he may be&apos;able to earn. If, however, a man is unable to follow a remunerative pre-war occupation by reason of his disablement and has to undertake a less remunerative one, he can apply for an alternative pension based on his pre-war earnings.Mr. Snowden : Is it not a fact that it is the practice of the Department not only to inquire what the man himself is earning but what the members of his family are earning ?Sir A. Griffith Boscawen: No; in assessing the maximum pension we do not iuquire into tho earningsat all.&quot; As regards the alternative pension v^oniv inquire what the man himself earned before the war.Training.Mr. Anderson asked the Pensions Minister what i being done in regard to the industrial training of thi children of private soldiers and non-commissioiif i officers who died during service or after discharge whether any extra allowance is made in cases in whirl such children are to serve an apprenticeship at a trad, and to receive special training ; and whether he vil indicate the future plans of his Department on thi matter ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : The Special Grants Com mittee are empowered to make Grants for the purposi of technical training or apprenticeship up to  25 a year with  10 for travelling and other expenses for children between the ages of thirteen and twenty-one, of non commissioned officers and men. In the case of a chili having to reside away from home, the amount can hi increased to  50. The attention of Local Committee has also been drawn to the fact that the Special Grant Committee have a special fund from which the childrei of deceased sailors and soldiers can be assisted to star in life.Treatment.Mr. Anderson asked the Pensions Minister whethe he is considering how to provide curative treatment oi scientific lines for all sailors and soldiers suffering frou rheumatism and tuberculosis; and whether he wi! consider the desirability of making grants, so that, i: addition to their pension, they might reside in healt: institutions under the care of specialists until ever effort toward cure is made, seeing that this would, eve: in the monetary sense, be cheaper than to grant then pensions whilst at the same time allowing them to laps into chronic invalids ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : Under the instructions . the Ministry, Local War Pension Committees have fu 1^0wer to make arrangements with any existing institi tions for the treatment of rheumatism, and tho; powers have been widely used. Should it be found tlia existing accommodation is insufficient, the Minister ; ready to give assistance towards meeting the neecTreatment for tuberculosis is provided by the Nation; Health Insurance Commissioners in conjunction wit the local health authorities. In order that the disable man may obtain the fullest advantage of their arrangt ments, grants have been made to assist the funds i Insurance Committees, and, in addition, the MinisU has undertaken to provide the whole cost of treatmei for advanced cases of this disease. Moreover, t Ministry are at present considering the question providing after-care colonies where treatment a training may be given in cases of this disease in its eai stages. The hon. Member may rest assured that evei means possible will be adopted to bring about , effective cure wherever cure is possible.Major D. Davies asked the Pensions Minister wli provision has been made for the medical treatment ai training of discharged soldiers in Wales and Monmout shire ; how many institutions have been establisheu and whether it is proposed to open new centres of fere; ment and training of disabled men ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen: Some 176 institutioi including military, auxiliary, and civil hospitals ai convalescent homes are in use and open to the treatme of discharged disabled men in Wales and Monmouti shire, and the Joint (Disablement) Committees set i by Local War Pensions Committees, and the Minist have been invited to submit proposals for meeting ai deficiencies in this respect. Schemes for establishii an after-care colony with training for tuberculosis, an for at least one centre for orthopedic treatment are in
HidSTconsideration. With regard to training, schemes iave been sanctioned for cinema operating at Cardiff, abitist-making and toy-making at Trefnant, and Horticulture and market gardening at Wrexham Garden Tillage. Diamond-cutting and polishing will, it is ioped, be shortly established at Wrexham, and it is imposed to start a number of courses in various subjects t Cardiff.Mr. King asked the Pensions Minister whether in-tructions have been given to Local Committees to irovide appropriate convalescent homes for ex-soldiers uffering from nerve strain who have been discharged inrecovered to their homes ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen: Local War Pensions Joramittees are empowered to provide convalescent reatment for discharged disabled men whatever the Kiture of their disablement. The policy of providing ipecial institutions for the class referred to, except in so ar as they are suffering from neurasthenia in a severe orm and are in need of special medical treatment is, n the opinion of my advisers, open to ser&apos;ous question, flic provision of convalescent homes generally&apos; is, iowever, stated to be inadequate in certain districts, 11 id 1 am instituting inquiry into the matter w th a dew to remedying the deficiency where it exists.Forfeiture.Commander Wedgwood asked whether any wives ire deprived of their separation allowances on the ikength of secret police reports without their husbands leing consulted ?,Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : A wife&apos;s separation illowance is never forfeited on the police report without ;oiToboration, which is obtained in all cases from the Local Committee, except in cases of admitted immorality x of conviction for neglect of children. The husband s informed when it is decided that forfeiture of separa-liun allowance must be made. The hon. Member will appreciate that it woidd be impossible to wait for consultation with the husband without a delay which uuuld certainly be long and might be indefinite.Commander Wedgewood : May we take it that the husband is always informed before the separation illowance is actually stopped ?Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen : The husband is informed, jut we cannot wait until we get a reply in many cases.The Joint Disablement Committee for the South-Eastern District of Scotland has been authorised to erect an orthopaedic centre in Edinburgh, near the school board technical workshops at Tynecastle. The building will be of a temporary character, and is de-signed for the benefit of disabled soldiers and sailors who, having been discharged from the Army, come under the care of the Pensions Ministry while still needing further treatment and training. The building, it is estimated, will cost between  2,500 and  3,000. -o-j^Mr. T. L.

Artificial Teeth or Dental Treatment, a recommendation to this effect will be included in the report of the Board, and the case will be&quot; dealt with by the Ministry of Pensions, Eoyal Hospital, Chelsea.Cases arising after discharge or found to require such treat-ment will be dealt with by Local Committees. It has been decided that Artificial Teeth or Dental Treatment may be provided at the public expense in the following cases : (1) Where the dental defect requires the provision of artificial teeth and such defect can be attributed to conditions arising from or aggravated by service in the present War. These conditions may be assumed in any case where a man&apos;s teeth have been extracted during service, otherwise the certificate of the Medical Referee must be obtained.(2) Where a man is undergoing a course of treatment and the supply of teeth or dental treatment is certified to be necessary for the efficacy of that treatment. This may occur, for example, in cases of dyspepsia, gastritis or tuberculosis.In any case in which these conditions are fulfilled, the Local Committee should take steps to secure that dental treatment is given. For this purpose arrangements have been made for the time being with the Ivory Cross Society, which has carried out similar work on behalf of the War Office, and has a panel of dentists in all parts of the Kingdom with whom terms of treat-ment have been arranged. Under the arrangements now proposed, the Local Committee should send one of the forms enclosed with this instruction to the Secretary, The Ivory Cross Society, 10, Conduit Street, London, W. 1, who will arrange for the required treatment to be provided in the locality. It should be clearly understood that the cost of this treatment will be paid by the Ministry and not by the Society, but allowances during treatment will be paid by the Local Committee in all cases in which treatment allowances are admissible under Instructions 34 40.   Such cases need not be submitted for sanction.Bishop Frodsham, speaking at a meeting in connection with the National Association of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, held at Gloucester on Saturday, said if any employers were mean-spirited enough to exploit a wounded man&apos;s pension for his own disadvantage or to the disadvantage of industry generally, then let the Trades Unions deal with such employers. He desired earnestly a partnership between employers and em-ployed for the good of the Nation, but he would rather have strikes than injustice to the men who had given their lives for the welfare of the world. On the other hand, it would be a bad day for Trades Unionism if any union, through a desire to safeguard the welfare of the men who were whole, should condemn disabled men who had suffered for then- country to a life of idleness. In this matter the whole community would rally round the Minister of Pensions, who was deter-mined to equip the individual so as to restore him as nearly as possible to his pre-war physical efficiency. -o--In response to the appeal of the National&apos;Association for the Prevention of Consumption, 20, Hanover Square, W. 1, to found a farm colony for discharged sailors and soldiers suffering from tuberculosis, which appeared in our columns some weeks ago, Lord Glenconner, the honorary treasurer, has received to date over  12,000 in donations, which includes  100 from His Majesty the King,  50 from Her Majesty the Queen, and  50 from Queen Alexandra.
Questions and Answers.Q. 59. It is known that under the Royal Warrant of March, 1917, the maximum pension which may be received by the parent or parents of a deceased soldier or soldiers is 15s. To what extent, if at all, is the amount of the pension for a deceased son affected by the parent&apos;s being in receipt of separation allowance in respect of another son; and vice versa, is the separation allowance for a son joining after his brother has been killed (and his parent is in receipt of a pension) affected by the payment of such a pension, i.e., is the maximum separation allowance which a family may otherwise properly receive reduced by reason of the payment of a pension in respect of a deceased son 1A. If the combined amount of pension issued in respect of a deceased son and separation allowance in respect of a serving son exceed the maximum amount of separation allowance payable in respect of two sons for the number of dependants concerned, separation allow-ance is correspondingly reduced or ceases altogether.Similarly, where a son joins after the death of a brother in respect of whom pension has been granted, separation allowance will only be paid of such an amount as together with the pension will not exceed the above maximum. For instance, in the case of one dependant where provision is granted of los. separation allowance in respect of a serving son would cease altogether, his allotment only being paid. If, however, the amount of pension was only 7s. 6d., separation allowance of 6s. 9d. would be payable, which with excess allotment of Is. 9d. (assuming the second son to have allotted the full 3s. 6d.), brings the total payment to 16s.Q. 60. Will an allowance tender Regulation 7 (2) be sanctioned where there is only a very small margin (say Is. Gd.) between the pre-war and present income, but in the special circumstances of the case, even a trifling reduc-tion in income is severely felt, and in the Local Committee&apos;s opinion has resulted in hardship 1A. This case hardly falls within the original intention of Regulation 7 (2), which was framed principally for the purpose of meeting cases where the pre-war standard of living was exceptionally high and the present income is much below the net pre-war income. The Special Grants Committee are prepared, however, to consider sympathetically a case where the circumstances are as above described, but their decision to grant an allowance in such a case would be based on the special facts adduced and would not be admitted as a precedent for the grant of an allowance under 7 (2) to make good small reductions in income in all cases.Q. 61. Should a case be recommended to the Special Grants Committee for a supplementary separation cdlow-ance under Regulation 7 (2) of Part II., if there is con-siderable disproportion between pre-war and present income, but no ground of hardship other than reduction in income 1A. Allowances under Regulation 7 (2) can b^ive only where there is disproportion between pre-war and present income and need for assistance is shown, but is possible that in some cases the reduction in income below the net pre-war income will be found to justify an allowance without evidence of chronic illness or othe: exceptional cause of expense.   If the Local Committee are satisfied that the present income is insufficient t enable a reasonable standard of comfort to be maintained having regard to the pre-war standard, they would certainly be justified in recommending the case to the Special Grants Committee under Regulation 7 (2 putting forward the disproportion between pre-war an present income and the applicants consequent inability to maintain a reasonable standard of comfort, as th sole ground of their recommendation.Q. 62. A soldier is discharged disabled. His &amp; pendant, who has been receiving Is. id. separation allov: ance, can now have nothing from him as he can bard support himself.   What steps can be taken on her behalj &apos;.A. If the man is in receipt of pension, and his presci income is considerably less than his pre-war earning an application should be put forward for an alternath pension.Q. 63. Should National Hcalih Insurance contrih lions be paid in respect of a discharged disabled soldi who is undergoing a six or twelve months&apos; course i training on behalf of the Local War Pensions Committee The man only receives his pension as a disabled soldo and the firm with whom he is being trained are paid I the Committee. If the answer is &quot; Yes,&quot; who is responsth for the payment of the coniribidions ? If the answer &quot; No,&quot; luhat is the man&apos;s position as to arrears ?A. The Local Committee have no authority to pa the firm in question. The man&apos;s Ring Paper shou! be withdrawn and allowances paid by the Local Con mittee. If the allowances are at the full rate authorise by Instruction 34, and the man is receiving no wage no contributions are payable under the Insurance Act and no arrears accrue.Q. 64. Are the dependants of Russian subjects calk up to serve in the British Army wider A.C.I. 1407 1917  eligible for assistance under Part II. of il\ Regulations ?A. Yes. These men are paid from Imperial fum and are treated in every respect as British soldin therefore their wives and dependants are eligible f grants and allowances under Part II.Q. 65. 2/ a battery sergeant-major in receipt of fi disability pension of lowest grade, together with a lo\ service pension, is admitted into hospital for tredtmei may his wife draw 18s. 9d. as a battery sergeant-majm ivife, or may she draw 13s. 9d. only 1A.

This is nA&quot; cc &quot;B&quot; referred in Appendix VII of Report XLV.
18&quot;A&quot;Sir,At the Meeting of the Joint Committee on Institutional Treatment held on Thursday 8th November, I was asked, in co-operation with Sir Harry Kaward, to furnish a Report with my views on the question of allowances to Paraplegics.I find it rather difficult to write more than I said at the meeting, but in my opinion the definition between a temporary and permanent Patient, and the conditions attached thereto, as drawn up by the Treasury are too drastic.In the question of Disablement one would have to differentiate (a3 Sir Frederick Trevis has pointed out in his Report on the proposals made as to the Star &amp; Garter) between permanent total disablement and permanent partial disablement.I feel quite sure in my own mind that when a man is once labelled as permanently unfit,and his allowances are materially reduced, he will, if he has any home at all, leave the Institution, as although his wife would not get the separa-tion allowance, he would draw the full 27/6 per week, and his wife, if she were appointed as his attendant, would draw another 15/- whereas if he remained in the Institution he would only receive 5/- for himself, and his wife the 13/9.A further difficulty for the Medical Officer of the Institution would be when he could definitely say (which he would not like to do) that the man was hopelessly ill and quite incurable.If the Treasury intends to abide by these Regulations, I certainly think that a clear statement should be sent to any man before he is admitted to an Institution, when the opinion is at present, that he will only have l/- per day deducted for his maintenance. Wa
184We are of opinion that the period for classifying a Patient as &quot;temporary&quot; should be extended from three months to one yearj for if the man is so had that he will have to he classified as hopelessly incurable at the termination of three months, and could not b&apos;e moved home owing to his condition, he would probably die within three or four months, and, in our opinion, it seems hard that his allowance should be stopped for the short time that he might live.The total cost to the State for cases of Paralysisdue to Gun-shot Wounds in the present Vsrar, is as follows:-1.     In an Institution maintained by the Ministry of Pensions.Temporary cases (cases which may improve and eventually go home).Allowances are *-  1.7.6 per week.less 7.0 for maintenance -  1.0.6.If married, separation allowance to wife 13.9. 1. 14.3.Maintenance cost to Ministry for Institutionper week.                                                          2. 2.0 5. 16,5.2.    Permanent cases (cases regarded as hopeless)Allowance to patient. 5.0Separation allowance to wife or dependant 13.918.9Maintenance cost to Ministry &apos; 2,    2.0 3,    0.9.3.   If paralysed patient goes home hereceives full pension per week of 1.   7.6If his wife is appointed to look afterhim she receives 15.0 21    2 o 6.We beg to remain, Sir.,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd) H.Haward,R. Fox-Symons.
&quot;B&quot;November 16th 1917.As requested, I visited the South wales Sanatorium (on  Tuesday, November 13th) and the North Viales Sanatorium (on Wednesday, November 14th).The South   wales Sanatorium is situated at Pontiwal, about a mile from  Talgarth station^ in Broconshire.   The build-ings are quito finished, but the water supply and drainage are not yet completed, brat it is oxpeoted that by January 1918 the Institution will be open for the reception of patients.   At prosont about 60 male patients are being treated in tho mansion on the site and in shelters in the grounds.The Institution is designed to contain 304 bods, 125 males, 115 females and 50 children, with certain beds for use as a Hospital block.   It is so arranged that the women and ohildren will be entirely separated from the men, and will also have separate dining accommodation.Attached to the Institution is a good garden of l^ acres, 6 aores of potatoes, and a farm of 373 acres, with gwe-d farm buildings.     Of tho 373 acres, 92 are arable land, and the rest pasture and wood.   The farm is at present leased to a farmer, who would, however, liko to terminate his leaso, so that tho farm is available at any timo.Mr.   Evans of the welsh Memorial, assures me that after communicating with the Insurance Commissioners for Vuales, there will be no difficulty in setting aside 25 - 50 bods for tho pur-poses of a training colony, as, whon tho Institution is opened, the   Memorial will have more beds at their disposal than they will require for some considerable time to come.The surroundings of the Sanatorium are in every way satisfactory, and the farm could be used for training in agrioul-ture. market gardening, pig keeping, poultry, eto., for which an excellent market would be found in the Institution itself.   As regards instruction, I am informed that the head oontre of the Board of Agriculture in South wales is at Brecon, 8 miles away, so that some assistance could be obtained from this quarter,Connected with the Institution is an excellent power station, with steam and electricity available. Near this such workshops as are required could easily be erected.(b)   The North &quot;wales Sanatorium is situated at Llangyfan, in the Vale&apos; of   Clwyd, about 2 miles from Denbigh station. It is beautifully situated overlooking tho vale, and is in every way a first class sanatorium.It is designed to admit 155 patients: females 75, males 50, children 30, with a small Hospital block for 20 female beds, and a second for 14 male beds.   An additional block for Surgical Tuberculosis in children (50 beds) is also being erected,   Here also male patients are entirely separated from the female.At
At present there 13 no kltehen garden, but one will shortly be made.   Attached to the Institution is a farm of 220 acres, of which 30 acres are arable, 70 pasture, and 110 &quot; mountain pasture&quot;, on the hill behind the Sanatorium, on which sheep are reared.   An excellent eyre for 40 cows has Just been erected: also &amp; dairy.   A dairy-maid has been appointed, and she is at present taking a six weeks&apos; course of instruction in poultry work at a neighbouring Agricultural College.   The farm is managed by a praotioal farmer, acting under the supervision of a  Local Committee, who have knowledge of farming operations. I am informed that the Head centre in North o&apos;ales of the Board of Agriculture is at Bangor, 30 miles away, but that there are Local Centres necrer.At  Itlaagyfan (as at  ontiwal) there is an excellent power station, with steam and elootrioity, so that suitable workshops could be erected. he welsh Memorial, aftor consultation with the Insurance Gommissioners for Wales, will be prepared to place up to 50 beds at the disposal of the Minister, for draining Colony purposes.ConclusionBoth the Worth wales and South Jales Sanatoria are excellent Institutions, and at each, arrangement could be made for the admission of Colony patients.At the iilorth males Sanatorium patients could be ad-oitted at once for training on the land, (though the services of a trained instructor might be required to supplement the instruction given by the farmer), and later on workshops could be erected.   If a beginning were made in this way, it would be well to limit the numbers sent to 25 men, who would fill the ground floor of one of the blooks.

1 Q Q 100APPENDIX V. SPECIAL GRANTS COMMITTEE,-Minutes of meeting held at 22. Abingdon Street, S,W, November 20th, 1917,PRESENT,G.J* Mathew, Esq., (In the Chair)* Coles Child, Esq., B.B. Cubitt, Esq,, Miss Kelly, Corporal Dinard, W.L. Marshall, Esq., Mrs. McKenna, Mrs, Shakespear, Sir Frederick W, Stopford.1,    The Chair was taken by the Chairman,2,    The Minutes of the meeting held on 6th November, which had been circulated to members, were confirmed and signed by the Chairman,3,    In connection with Treasury replies to the Special GrantsCommittee^ proposals amending Regulations Part I and II etc, it was explained that the Treasury had at the last minute been unable to let the Special Grants Committee have their final reply to these proposals owing to a sudden urgent matter of National Importance which had had to take precedence.     It was, however, hoped that the Treasury reply would be received in the course of the next few days.4,    The question of supplementing the Motherless Rate for SeparationAllowances for children who are bearded out was duly considered and it was decided to recommend to the Minister of Pensions that Local Committees be authorised to grant up to 10/- per child boarded out in Institutions and for children boarded out otherwise than in institutions 10/- for the first and 7/6 for the seoond and other children.    In cases of special homes it was decided to recommend an additional allowance of not exceeding 2/6 per ohild where special treatment or
189maintenance had to be given.    Furthermore, that if children are actually boarded out in different places, the allowance of 10/- may be paid for each child,    It was resolved that the Chairman make the above suggestion to the Minister, i,    On a question of considering Regulation 15(b) in view of various resolutions submitted by Local Committees and in view of correspondence with the War Office, it was unanimously resolved to suggest to the Minister that the words &quot;where but for such grants the cost of funeral would fall upon the rates&quot; be omitted and substitute the words &quot;where the funeral cannot be paid for from any other source&quot;.    It was further decided to insert the word &quot;widow&quot; after the word &quot;wife&quot; in the second line and to raise the grant to  5 for an adult in lieu of  4. Furthermore, it was decided in view of the War Office correspondence to omit discharged disabled sailors and soldiers entirely from the new draft regulation, which will read accordingly.-&quot;In the event of the death of the wife, widow, child or dependant of a sailor or soldier, a grant to meet funeral expenses where such funeral is not provided for from any other source and provided that such grant shall not exceed  5 for an adult and  2 for a child.&quot;The following Instruction was approved and ordered to besubmitted to the Minister:-&quot;In view of the arrangement made by the Admiralty and War Office to grant Naval &amp; Military funerals in all cases. where the death of a discharged disabled sailor or soldier is attributed by the Admiralty or the War Offioe to War Service. Local Committees will in future apply to the Officer Commanding the looal Haval or Military Forces to obtain such funeral, but where no such funeral can be provided the Local Committee may pay the relatives on application the cost of the funeral up to a sum not exceeding  5.    Application will then be made to the Naval &amp; Military Authorities for a refund of the amount so paid.&quot;.    The case of Mrs. Simson (P.2082) was duly referred by theSection to the full Committee and after careful considerationit was decided tjiat Mrs Simson was not eligible for assistancefrom the Special Grants Committee funds.
