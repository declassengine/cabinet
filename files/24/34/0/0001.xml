Intelligence Bureau,GHW/003.WEEKLY   REPORT   ON , HOkHMS, III.(NOT.  8th, 1917)Department of Information.Peace Campaign in Holland.The military collapse of Russia, the successful enemy of-fensive on the Italian front and the increasing difficulties of Hollands economic position has recently brought about an almost universal demand for peace in the Dutch Press,     It is maintained that in all the belligerent countries there are signs of a growing war-weariness.     The Pacifist movement in Great Britain, the mutiny in the German navy and the alleged successes of the peace propaganda in the Italian armies are held to prove this contentior-The fact is that Holland is in an almost impossible position between the anvil of Germany and the hammer of Great Britain ani America, and everj .suppesed indication of a weakening in the belligerent countries is hailed as the dawn of peace.     It is probable that the peace campaign is largely the result of the intense propaganda on the part of Germany which finds fertile ground among a people accustomed to an ample food supply and to general prosperity,     Meanwhile the strained relations between Great Britain and Holland are rapidly undermining any success our propaganda may have had.     The Dutch no doubt discriminate between the sinking of their ships and the warder of Dutch sailors by the Germans and the economic pressure exercised by the Allies;   but the difference is easily forgotten by men whose trade is being ruined.The Dutch Press is also asking whether the good done to our cause by stopping the transit traffic in gravel through Dutch territory is worth the damage done to oui position in Holland by the stoppage of cable facilities.
m  2 Mfarmer Dutch Minister of War on the Military and Economic Situation,An article of a certain interest has appeared in the November number of the &quot;Stemmen des Tijds&quot; from the pen of General II.H. Colijn, formerly Minister of War.     It is not necessary to deal here with the views of the author on the military situation beyond stating that he believes that the military oollapse of Russia will not be compensated by the entrance of America into the war.    He doubts whether America can despatch and maintain in Prance more than 250,000 men in 1918 during whioh year at most the Allies may succeed in driving the Germans back to the Meuse-Namur-Antwerp line.As regards Holland her troubles increase with the duration of the war.    The fundamental oause of her difficulties with England has been the disproportion, during the first years of the war, between the exports from Holland to Germany and those sent to Great Britain. Holland was justified in pursuing this policy but therafry she has alienated the sympathies of the Entente.   During the last months the balanoe has been partially restored but it can never be perfect as the Netherlands are dependent on Germany for certain indispensa-ble products such as coal, iron and steel.As ragards the United States, General Colijn actually proposes to exert pressure on them by declining, if all other proosure fails, to allow food for the relief of Belgium to pass through Holland. Before having recourse to this measure he suggests that Holland should voluntarily cede a portion of the freight-space of the Netherlands ships now in U.X. harbours insisting in return on the products necessary for her existence.     General Colijn&apos;B proposal has been adversely criticised in the Press,&apos;    It is well t* remember that General Colijn defended the violation of Belgium as a &quot;military necessity&quot;.     At the same time he is considered in his own country to he an able military critic and is certainly a shrewd
man as he foresaw the collapse of Russia even when her advanced guards were in Hungarian territory.fhe Sand and Gravel Dispute.The Dutch Press continues to deal spasmodically with this question, but it would not appear that much progress has been made to a settles ment.     Meanwhile the greatest inconvenience is being acused to Dutch commerce by the refusal of cable facilities and the Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce have waited on the Minister of Foriegn Affairs in order to impress upon hltf the great importance of reestablishing telegraphic communication with foreign countries and especially with the Dutoh Colonies.Some of the provincial newspapers, especially those with pro-German leanings have published very acrimonious,comments on the action of H.M.Government.Attacks on Dutoh Pishing Craft.It is now certain that quite recently the Germans attacked and sank five luggers.     Of these three were probably outside the danger gone and therefore entitled under the German regulations to immunity. Some 48 men of the crews were taken into Wilhelmshaven by their cap-tors and subsequently released.     They have now returned home.     Accord-ing to their statements they were ill-used, starved and lodged in filthy quarters previously used by Russian prisoners.Among the torpedo-boats which sank the luggers was V.69.     This vessel was badly damaged last January in action with the British. She entered Ymuiden, was repaired and allowed to deoart.     Perhaps the treatment accorded by her to Dutch fisherman will, in future, make the f- Netherlands Authorities chary of extending hospitality to German war-vessels.The officer commanding the V.69 on being asked the reason for the
unprovoked attack on Dutch fishing boats replied that the Germans &quot;feared that the British would employ such craft to mislead the Germans.     The sea must therefore be cleared of them&quot;.   The obvious deduction is that in future all Dutch fishing craft whether within or without the danger zone is liable to be sunk at sight by the German Commanders.The further restriction of the &quot;safe zone&quot; reducing the passage of Dutoh shipping from twenty to six miles has, in conjunction with the luggers incident, caused intense indignation.Pitch View of American Blockade Policy.Mr. CJ.van Aalst, formerly Chairman of the Netherlands Overseas Trust, summari*e* the position of Holland in an open letter to President Wilson as follows:-   America is trying tc put &quot;pressure on Holland by cutting off supplies, holding up ships by the refusal of bunker coal and preventing her communicating with her oolonies.   The Dutch food held up in American ports is part of consignments to the Netherlands Government under the conditions of the N.O.T. and this action is in reality the application of &quot;frightfulness&quot; to a friendly nation,   flhat is the intention underlying that action?   To stop Holland sending supplies to Germany.     Mr. van Aalst points out that the total exports from Holland would only feed German^ for a few days. Holland depends on imports and must give foods in return for articles on which her economic existence depends.     The Dutch Government at-tempts to keep the balance of exchange with both belligerent groups and this is her vulnerable point.    America has taken advantage of Holland1s weakness and should have bean the last to do so as the Dutch were the first to aid America when 3ho was struggling for free-dom.     She should therefore deal fairly wish the Netherlands.
