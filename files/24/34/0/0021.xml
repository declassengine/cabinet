Intelligence Bureau,SECRET.Department ofmlnformation. FIW/020.XV,&apos;WEEKLY   REPORT   PIT   ITALY. .XX.(Nov. 39th, 1917)The Government.The Parliamentary intrigues predicted in our last report are already making their appearance.     The agitation for Commissions to control or, as some advocates put it, to co-operate with the Foreign Office, finds its chiet support in the &quot;Parliamentary Union&apos; and in the Socialist group, and apparently covers an attack upon the present Foreign Minister.     Baron&apos;   Sonnino&apos;s position in the new Ministry, which he is said   tc have joined very un-willingly and only from a sense of patriotic duty, is much less strong than it was in Signor Boselli&apos;s.    His relations with the Minister of Finance are at least not cordial, and the new Premier apoeers to he taking tMngs very much into his own hands.Certain Deputies are said on good authority to he working for the return of Giolitti to power; but this would almost certainly not be welcomed either by Orlando or Nitti, both of whom were muoh disappointed with Giolitti&apos;s speech in the Chamber 01S Nov. 14th. Orlando&apos;s telegram (see Report XVII p.3) was in effect an apoeal to Giolitti for whole hearted supnort.     Beither Giolitti&apos;s telegram, which, it now appears, was not a reply to but crossed Orlando&apos;s, nor his speech in the Chamber, the tone of which was distlmtstly reserved in regard to the Government, gave any specific pledge. Orlando is said to regret having made his overture and Uitti the part he took in bringing about the inclusion of Giolitti in the meeting of ex-prem*ers and thus facilitating his reappearance in the Chamber.     It does not however appear probablw that these
if92intrigues will succeed or even meet with encouragement from Giolitti, whc must be conscious that after what has  $$pened pacifism is an imoossible platform, while he had left it too late to come forward as a War Minister.The failure of the attack upon Sonnino is perhaps not so cerr tainly to be predicted.     His retention in the Cabinet was dictated rather by the necessity to conciliate the war-party and the Allies than by any cordial sympathy between him and the chiefs of the new Ministry - Signors Orlando and Nitti;   and if even they felt them-selves strong enough to stand alone they would probably oppose no very firm resistance to Baron Sonnino&apos;s enemies in the Chamber.german Intrigues.Large numbers of Italians are reported to have appeared recently in Switzerland,     They are supposed to be prisoners of war, libera-ted by the Austro-Germans with a view to propaganda among Italians in Switzerland, and to be well supplied with funds.It has also been learned from a trustworthy Swiss Bank official that large quantities of German money have been passing through-Swiss Banks to Italy, destined, it is understood, for purposes of propaganda among Italian Catholics.Enemy subjects are being lodged under supervision in South Italian monasteries.The Vatican.The Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Gasparri, has issued (Nov. 27th) an official declaration to the effect (1) that the Pope is not preparing any new peace appeal; (2) that his first Peace Note contemplated only a just, Christian and durable peace; (3) that the Catholic Church Bas always regarded true patriotism as a Christian duty and that the responsibility for the propaganda which
had undermined the moral of part of the Italian army did not rest on the Vatican or on the Catholic clergy, who fcaa on the contrary laboured to counteract it;   (4) that the Pontifical appeal was addressed to the heads of the Governments for official consideration; that the Government authorities first gave it to the Press and the public, and that the Holy See published it and commented on it in the Osservatore Romano only when the false interpretations made by others necessitated such action.The War.Mr. Lloyd Gecrge&apos;s speech in Paris was very favourably received in the Italian psess and the advance made towards Unity of Front by the creation of a permanent Council is hailed with great satisfaction by practically all sections of Italian public opinion.General Corsi in the Tribuna thinks it essential that the inter-Ally Military Committee should possess executive powers, and this opinion finds supoort elsewhere.A plea for financial Unity of Front is put forward in the Corriere   *y Signor Luzzatti, who deplored the waste of energy within the alliance due to the absence of a concerted treatment of lo.;.ns, exch-.nge ;;nd currency,   nd advocates the establishment of o Central Commission at Paris, London or Rome to coordinate the action of the Allies in these questions.Resistance of the Country.A review cf the Italian press of tlje last few weeks leaves the impression that the country as a whole is now thoroughly roused to the pressing needs of the situation - external and internal.     A new and larger spirit with regard to the war seems to be spreading and a more realistic conception of Italy&apos;s position.     This shows itself in many ways - appeals by public bodies and individuals
j (Socialists included) for moral firmness and loyal support of the army, expositions of the extent to which Italy depends on her Allies and of the impossibility of a separate peace;   active interest in the question of food control and of reconstruction - a matter with, which the Government has so far only played.    Noteworthy in this connection is the favourable reception given in the press to a Bill to which 17 Deputies have appended their names, dealing in a comprehensive and drastic manner with the long neglected agrarian question.     The aim of the Bill is to investigate the hardships of tho peasant claSs in order to allay the discontent which is rife in the villages and to give the peasants who form so large a oro-portion of the army something to fight for and come home to. Certs in classes al3o promise benefits to the workmen of the towns.The adoption of such a measure would be a blow to Socialism which has found fertile ground for its propaganda fn the discontent or the peasantry.(The full text of the Bill is to be given in the Reconstruction Supplement for Boo. 4th to the&quot;Daily Review of the Foreign Press&quot;)The Occupied Regions.It is to be feared th&amp;t very l^rge supplies of fruit, vegetables nd ocrc- is will now become t-vailcble for the Central Powers owing to their occupation of North-Eastern Italy,    A Committee hso -.1* re;-.dy been sent up for their collection &amp;nd distribution.    A Wolff telegram, which appears in the Frankfurter Zeitung of Nov. 16th, gives figures for the resources of the occupied regions.   The Belluno district, it is strted, produces 125,000 tons of maize ranually, bc-.sidc3 wine rnd fruits :nd Alpine Cattle.    A few yeors ego there &quot;-ere 70.000 head of cattle and 30.000 goats in this region.     Udine is also     great cattle-raising centre (200.000 head of cattle, 60.000
swine and 50.000 sheep are the figures given for peace time).     The textile industries of these regions are also described - in the TJdine district 336.800 spindles and 3000 looms at work in the cotton in-dustry, at Belluno 2000 looms, at Pordanone one factory has 54,000 spindles - 19.400 of which are for the manufacture of thread, now unobtainable in Germany.   The writer of an article in the same issue states that the Italian war-industry is threatened at two of its most important centres;   that the great eleotrio power station at Cellina is in the region already-occupied, while the power stations in Valtellina and in the Val Camonioa,on which the industry of Milan largely depends, are 1 threatened1.German wireless messages shed crocidile1^ tears over the destruc-tion of the art treasures in Villas and Churches of the occupied regions wrought by the retreating mob of Italians and by the batteries of the Italians and Allies.
