SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department cf Information.WEEKLY REPORT Oil BULGARIA. XIX.(3 December, 1917).DBIi/019.The visit of the German Emperor, discussed in the last Report, was followed up by that of the Prussian Minister of War, General von Stein.   Beyond descriptions of the banquets and receptions to which he was invited the Bulgarian press vouchsafes no information as to the objects and results of his visit.     On November 1 a dozen German journalists were due to arrive in Sofia, representing various papers all over the German Empire.     The Germans are at present leaving no stone unturned to show the Bulgars how interested in Bulgaria the German people is.Socialist Peace Proposals.Apart from leading articles exulting over the Italian defewts, which are thought to bring peace nearer, Bulgarians have been paying most attention to the peace proposals emanating from Stockholm and Petrograd.    The manifesto of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, published on October 19. aroused great indignation in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian press of all parties - Government, Opposition, and Broad Socialists - united in condemning it.   They were.especially angry at its treatment of the Macedonian question, for the manifesto declared that Bulgaria should have territory only up to the left bank of the Vardar.     This naturally does not satisfy the Bulgarian press, which is unanimous in demanding the whole of Macedonia and also, as the Echo de Bulgarie in its comments on the manifesto once again points out, the Morava Valley and&apos; the whole of Dobrogea.     On this point there is no divergence of opinion.
The Mir is as strongly critical as the Government organs, and accuses the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee of acting as a mere agent of the Entente.     It also rudely accuses the Committee of an exclusive interest in the Jewish question to the detriment cf other national questions.     From a different point of view the Narrow Socialists criticise the manifesto as quite unworthy of real Internationalists, for it attempts to solve world questions on merely opportunist lines compromising between the war aims of the two opposing sides.     Nor is the Bulgarian press much better pleased with the peace manifesto issued by the Petrograd Sovyet in the form of instructions to Mr Skobelev.   It attacks it for placing Macedonia In the category of &quot;disputed territories in the Balkans&quot; and for not assigning Dobrogea to Bulgaria.     The Bulgarian Broad Socialist leader, Sakyzov, made a prompt reply defending Bulgaria&apos;s national claims, which was published in the Swedish press on October 27. Obviously Mr Sakyzov is disappointed that the Bulgarian Socialist Mission to Stockholm did not have mare effect in convincing the Dutch Scandinavian Committee of the &quot;justice&quot; of Bulgarian claims.The Extraordinary Session of the Sabraniye.The Extraordinary Session of the Sabraniye, referred to in last Report, lasted from October 15 to 27.     The two main questions dealt with were (1) Bulgarian war aims and Bulgaria&apos;s relations witn her Allies, and (2) the food question.   As to the first there is, unfortunately, little information to hand, as, though Radoslavov set aside a day to reply to interpellations on foreign affairs, this debate is not published in the Bulgarian press.     Our agents report that Radoslavov treated his interpellators in a very high-handed fashion.     Discussions on the food question lasted several days and representatives of all the Opposition parties made speeches.     All
of them except Dr Danev (who quoted an &quot;Austrian&quot; statement that Bulgaria was becoming Germany&apos;s &quot;vassal&quot;) and the Narrow Socialist &quot;representative Kolarov appear to have maintained quite a patriotic pro-war attitude (to the Broad Socialist Dr Sakyzov Radoslavov made the complimentary allusion &quot;Mr Sakyzov supports in full Bulgaria&apos;s programme.   That does him honour&quot;), but they criticised severely the Governments management of the food question.   Particularly, they claimed that the Food Bureau under the management of General Protogerov ought to submit regular reports to the Sabraniye as its predecessor, the Provident Committee (which consisted of representatives of all parties), had done.     Also they complained that quite inadequate arrangements were in force for transporting supplies from one part of the country to another.   In this connection it may be noticed, as an example of the lack of transport, that 15 wagon-loads of foodvwhich had been brought from Dobrogea had to be left at Ruse (Ruscik), as there was no means of transporting them to the parts of the country where they were needed.     Perhaps^ in order to free more rolling-stock for transport of supplies, the Government has now raised the railway fares throughout the country 20^.The other aspect of the food question on which Opposition speakers uttered bitter criticisms was the question of export and import.   On this point Bulgarian feeling is very tender, though everything goes to show that excellent prices have been obtaindd from Germany and Austria for the potatoes, vegetables, wool, skins and tobacco which have been exported thither.     To Mr Todorovls accusations in the Sabraniye that the German troops had taken off vast amounts of food (18 million kilos) from Bulgaria, Radoslavov replied that Bulgaria had got far more than she had given - over a milliard as against only 48 millions.      While she had exported -
copper, lead, zinc, and hides to the value of Fr. 25 million, she had received in exchange military equipment from Germany to the amount of Fr..760,839,000. She had received clothing andmedical stores from Germany and Austria to the value of Fr. 220 million, military equipment to the value of Fr. 760 million, and engineering implements to the value of Fr. 1,130 million, against which she had given Fr. 46 million in raw materials and Fr. 2 million In money.The Economic Situation.A satirical article in the fortnightbly review Vseobsht Pregled (&quot;The General Review&quot;) speaks of the extortionate prices demanded by retailers of articles of food.   Though the maximum price for butter is 12 leva the kilo, customers are forced to pay 20 leva.   Meat is sold, in such quantities as the shopkeepers think fit, at quite absurd prices.   The bread ration, again, is quite a liberal one (800 grams of cereals or 650 of flour for manual labourers, and 500 grams of cereals or 420 of flour per day for others);   but none the less the town population has great difficulty in getting it.     A special Food Commission has been set up to look after the needs of the population of Sofia. Precautionary measures are taken against visitors encroaching on the supplies reserved for the regular inhabitants.   The press hints that the presence of so many strangers in the capital is most undesirable, and complains of the way in which they pay liberally for food and lodging and so send up the prices for other people.Party Politics.The Ordinary Session of the Sabraniye, following the Extra-ordinary one, began on October 29.     On October 31 Radoslavov made
a long and effective defence of the Governments foreign and internal policy.     The Opposition deputies - Lyapchev (Democrat) and Kirkov (Narrow Socialist) proposed two rival Orders of the Day to the Government one hut failed to carry them, 120 voting for the Government and 111 for the Opposition.    (Among these 111 voted Apostolov and the dissident Genadiyevists).     These are more or less the regular numbers of the two parties, for at the last election (the beginning of March, 1914) the Government secured 128 and the Opposition 116 supporters.   In fact, however, for all practical purposes and, above all, as regards foreign affairs, the Government have not merely this small majority of 9, but practically the whole of the House with them, with the exception of insignificant factions such as a few but determined Narrov/ Internationalist Socialists, some of the Agrarians, the Radicals who number 5, and the small clique of half-a-dozen Genadiyevists, followers of the ex-Minister of Railways, Apostolov, who bear Radoslavov a lively personal grudge.   Recently there has been a split in the Agrarian Party of 50.   It appears to have arisen from personal motives and mutual recriminations over certain shady financial transactions.   The Agrarian leaders Dragiyev and Radolov, together with some 13 deputies who support them, have declared the other Agrarians who follow Bakalov and Omarchevski excluded from the party.   The latter replied by reviving the old Agrarian paper Zemledelsko Sname (&quot;The Agricultural Standard&quot;).     It Is impossible yet to say how far this schism may influence the course of general politics in Bulgaria, but It may assume an important character in view of the fact that it is the Agrarians (representing the Peasants) and the International Socialists (who have conducted a lively propaganda among the Bulgarian troops) who, in the event of defeat or continued prolongation of the war, can alone be trusted
to take a strong line against tfce Government and .possible to conduct a Revolution.Bulgaria&apos;s Relations with her Allies.There is no reliable information as to further developments of the German-Bulgarian controversy.     There seems no reason as yet to modify what was said in last Report as to the agreement that was probably reached between the German and Bulgarian jGovernments on the occasion of the German Emperor1 s visit.      Prom Radoslavov&apos;s speech on October 31 it is clear that at least Kavalla has been promised Bulgaria by Germany.     Everything goes to show, however, that both the German and Bulgarian Governments will use every possible lever to extort from its Ally the maximum of what it can get and will seek to give the minimum possible.     Recent press rumours as to the movement in the United States in favour of a declaration of war on Germany&apos;s Allies will have a very direct bearing on Bulgarian opinion, for to judge from the tone of the Bulgarian press nothing would more depress the Bulgarian nation as a whole and weaken the war spirit than such a positive assurance of full American co-operation with the Entente Powers inrJaer Balkan policy.   The Mir at present continues to lay great stress on American &quot;disagreement&quot; with the Entente Powers:   the leading article *jf October 18 (referred to in last report) is backed up by a stronger one on October 31?.3.12.17
