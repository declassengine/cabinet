446S EC R S T.Operation;.s .From:   G .H.QV British Forces, Italy. -To:-&apos;    C .I.G.S. W,ar Office,Despatched 6.12.1917. Received 7.45 a.m. 7,12.1917.0,94.&apos; December 6th.Yesterday&apos;s fighting was undoubtedly severe. Alpine and Bersaglieri troops fought hard for M. Badenecche, Mt.Tondarecar, Mt.Castelgomberto, Mt.Fior, Mt..Miela and Mt.Spil.   When the enemy broke through the troops of 22nd Corps withdrew from Mt. Zomo and held the line Le Portecche to II Buso to close the access to Val Frenzela.   20th Corps were ordered to hold the Foa (Foza?) Sasso Rossa position, but whether owing to lateness of orders or without them they subsequently withdrew to the Valstagna Defences.   Line now appears to be Mt. Sisemol - Le Portecche - Sasso ** Col Del Vento - Valstagna - Costa Alto.
