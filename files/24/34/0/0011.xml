Colonel Jones   ,co 2X)31B ?IT IS THE  RQPERTY OF-HIS BRIMNIG MAJES TY1S GO vERNMglTTT. 2811.WAR CABINET.THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS TfBllPORARY&quot;CONTROL], BILL.(Joint Memorandum by Lord Rhondda and Sir Alfred Mond, Bt., IvL?. dated 28th November^ 1917).To the War Cabinet,This Billy introduced by tho Board of Trade, proposes to continue the present restrictions on Exports and Imports for a period of three years after the termination of the war. While the commercial community has accepted, with great self-sacrifice, restrictions imposed during tho war, and has recognised their necessity, there is a very strong feeling among the business community that such restrictions should end at the earliest opportune-. The commerce of the country has been built up by the energy and knowledge of its traders, and by the freedom in which they have been able to conduct their business.   All regulations&apos; interfering with the   trader carrying on his affairs in the freest possible manner creates a serious difficulty in the organisation of his business and in his power of competition in the export markets with traders of other countries, wh-j will not be similarly handicapped .To anyone who has experience with the difficulties that have been created by the-necessity of obtaining licenses and : permits for exports and imports during the war, a difficulty which better organisation may diminish but cannot do away with, the prospect of such restrictions continuing for so lengthy a period as three years, gives rise to the gravest apprehension in regard to the continuance and recovery of British trade.     Great portions of the British export trade has necessarily been stopped or diverted owing to the exigencies of the war, and many firms.have practically either ceased to do business, or have seen thoir businesses very much diminished *    It would; therefore, seem of the first importance that as soon as possible manufacturers and merchants should be enabled to resume their operations that have been interrupted.The protest from representative bodies of traders against the time stipulated in this Bill is strong and likely to become, even more violent.     It will be generally recognised that it may be impossible to immediately revert to pre-war conditions, and that some intervening period must elapse before all restrictions can be withdrawn.   But the period of three years is. generally held, and in this we concur, to be. unnecessarily long.   A period of twelve months, we think, would be generally acceptable and in our opinion would be long enough to enable the Government .ahd the country to see whether or not a. further pro-longation of the restrictions would be required.(Signed)     REONPDA. 8th November, 1917. (Signed)     ALFRED MOND.
