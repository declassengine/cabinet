department op information intelligence bureau..g)] wekkly     report     on     germany7Tw$r 5 th Decmiber, 1917,1, The Reichstag has agein met and adjourned, afterlistening to speeches from the new Chancellor, Count Hertling, and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Herr von KttMmann, and vot-ing a new credit of  750,000,000 (nominal value).Count Hertling on his first appearance as Chancellor had to do his best to reassure the Reichstag and the German public on two main points:- (l) the military situation in its bearings upcn the prospects of peaoo and (z) the question of internal roform.     He was able to draw a picture of the military situation in which he dwelt upon the impregnability of &quot;the iron wall&quot; in the Wost, the conquest of Riga and Jacobstadt and the capture of the Islands of Oesel, Bago and Moon on the Eastern front, and the great Austro-German victory and advance in the Italian theatre of war.     The Bolshevik Government1s proposals on November 28 - the day before Hertling spoke - to enter into negotiations for peace, formed, he said, &quot;a discussable basis....for the opening of nego-tiations&quot;, and he &quot;was ready to enter into suoh as soon as the Russian Government sends plenipotentiaries for this purpose.    He made in this connection the first more or less explicit official statement about the future of Poland, Lithuania and Oourland in the fallowing terms:&quot;As regards the countries formerly subjected to the soeptre of the Tsar, Poland^Lithuania and Couxland, we respect their peoples&apos; right of self-determination      We expect that they shall give&quot; themselves a constituent form corresponding with their conditions and the tendenoy of their Kultur.   In these matters, however, things are still entirely in the air.    2?ho reports published in the press some time ago to the e feot&quot;^n*at a d^rcinite agreement had been reached on one point, are in advance of the&quot; facts.&quot;The last sentence was obviously intended to dispose of the rep*rteii
-2-agreement with Austria-Hungary ahout the union of Poland with Galicia, a scheme v/hich was violently attacked as being contrary to the Reichstag Resolution of July 19th and the Gorman and Austrian reply to the Pope.     It would also have boon diametrically in opposition to the non-annexationist principles of tho Bolsho-viks.        Regarding the internal situation of Germany, he took the view that nthe great interest now showing everywhere in State institutions&quot; -others would call it the deep political unrest and discontent - was due to the &quot;tremendous experience of the war&quot;. Its lessons had, in his opinion brought home to the humblest the reality of the conceptions of State, Fatherland and Hation.   There must therefore be reform, but not in the lines of slavish imitation of foreign institutions.     Nothing must be changed in the founda-tions ef the Imperial Constitutionalthough the Imperial Govern-ment would &quot;always readily listen to wishes and suggestions whioh might reaoh it from the Reichstag, and would properly examine them&quot; This, it may be remarked, is the true attitude of German Govern-ments which consider themselves above the people and the parlia-ments and are willing to &quot;consider&quot; their wishes but not to carry -out thoir will.    The representatives of the masses, the Socialists of both Sections, do not accept Count HertlingTs view that the people have earned the right to real representation and political influence by their attitude during the war and in consequence of its experience.    As the Socialist Vorwflrts puts it, the peoples1 right which has been urged for a century and withheld by successive Prussian and German Governments, and by the Crown, is an inherent one and was as well-founded before the war as it is during the war or will be after the war.&apos;(!)&quot;Note: If it be asked what is meant by the &quot;foundations of the Imperial Constitution&quot;, the answer weuld be, from Hertling!s point of view, that they aro monarchy and federalism.
KtLhlmann&apos;a speech was eztraerdjjaariljr impudent inits patronising tone towards the Allies and its oool assumption ofGerman superiority.     He endorsed HertlingTs reference to the Bol-shevik overtures by the significant deolaration:&quot;The principles hitherto announced to the world by the present rulers of Petrograd,(a noteworthy characterisation) appear to be entirely acceptable as a basis for the reorganisation of affairs in the East - a reorganisation which, fully taking into account the right of nations to determine their own destinies, is quali-fied permanently to safeguard the essential and permanent inter-ests of the two great neighbouring nations, Germany and Russia.&quot;It must be admitted that, barring tho British victoryat Cambrai, which the Germans are now trying, with very limitedsuooess, to reverse, there is much in the general military situationwhioh supplied useful material to German statesmen anxious to makea good figure before their countrymen.    What the chief militaryauthorities, Hindanburg and ludendorff, really think on this sub-joot is a different matter and, although thoy grant newspaper inter-vbws, cannot be known to the tfidas German public    What that publiceoes is Lenin1s Government of perpetual revolution and anarohy inRussia suing for poaoe, and armistices being arranged at differentpoints of the Russian front;   the Italian armies driven back to thePiave;   a military situation on the Wostern front which oan borepresented as a permanent cheokmate of the Western Allies, whosooffensives are represented as costing them sanguinary sacrificesout of all proportion to the ground they gain or the losses theyinflict upon the Germans.     The U-boats, the German people are told,are slowly but surely doing their work and arc helping to &quot;shakethe economic position of Great Britain to its foundations&quot;.    Thefinancial problems of tho Western Allies, except America, are dos-cribed as boing out of all comparison more serious than those ofGermany, and the aid rendered by America as likely to reduce GreatBritain and Iraaoe to complete dependence upon her.2. A question of considerable importance is how far thoseGerman offioial representations of the situation are accepted by
the mass of the German people, how far they&apos;&quot;bring comfort or eonfi-dence to the hulk of the working-classes.     There can he no manner of doubt that those responsible for the Government and the policy of Germany have been in a state of deep concern about the trend of working-class feeling.     The hardships endured by the people are admitted to be very severe.     A consensus of testimony shows them to be suffering from the effeots of insufficiency and an inferior quality of food.    The Western front is regarded as an inferno from the portals of which few of their sons return.    Tho prospects of peaco with the Russian Government are, doubtless, welcomed; but it excites strange questionings among the Gorman working classes.    A very competent witness has stated that &quot;the only offoot produced by the Maximalist revolution was to make the German working-classes more intolerant of the ruling classes, and to strengthen the conviction of the former that the upper classes are not necessary as a governing factor&quot;.      The firmer establish-raent of these classes in the Upper Rouse of the Prussian Diet and the curtailment of the Budget rights of the lower House, as pro-posed in the Government Bill accompanying the measure for the reform of the Prussian franchise, will, in these circumstances, compromise any favourable impression which may be made by the proposed democratisation of that franchise.    Any prolonged oppo-sition to the Franchise Bill by tho present very reactionary majority in the Prussian Chamber would probably cause an outbreak of indignation which would further alarm the Emperor and the German Governments.      On the other hand, it is denied by one very competent witness &quot;that the fraternisation on the Eastern Front had had any effect upon the military spirit of the German soldiers drawn from the working classes.&quot;    The Socialists who form the great majority of those classes &quot;reported when they re-turned from the front that they had exchanged bread and cigarettes with the Russian soldiers, but had not adopted the ideas of the
latter&quot;.    The German troops on the Eastern front looked upon the Russian revolution as a welcome event which has made life in the trenches easier, and it is doubtless in the same spirit that they greet the opening of peaoe negotiations with the Bolshevik Govern-ment.3. Various other misgivings find utterance with regardto the negotiations with the present Petrograd Government, which arc now in actual progress.     The tendency of anarchic Russia to break up into separate States, suggests the necessity of conclud-ing a separate peace with each one of these - Ei&amp;cainia, Pinland, tb  sew Crimean Tatar Republic, the projected Georgian Republio in tho Caucasus, not to speak of the reported Siberian Republio with its temporary seat of Government at Tomsk.     It is assumed with some degree of plausibility that all those inchoate Governments are as willing to conclude peace as the Petrograd &amp;&amp;b, and, according to German reports, there is evidence that at Kieff the Ukrainian representatives, while assorting their independence of Petrogrsd, declared thoir solidarity with the Bolshoviks in the matter of peace.    But the first thing that Germany will want ao the fruit of a Russian peace, if she can get it, is the speedy economic restoration of Russia, in order to roeume the corumsree which the almost complete blockade of tho Gorman Empire by land as well as by water, had imposed.    None of the new State Governments, that of the Bolsheviks least of all, seem to be facing the economic problem In anything like a practical spirit.    The seizure of the Imperial Bankxs gold reserve at Pctrograd is an instance of the way in which the men in power aae sotting about their economic task.    The abolition of house-rent for half the year is another. So are the scales of wages which are being demanded with tho Governments approval in the factories.     It is easy to conceive the ruthlessness and the rapidity with which Germany woultf put an end to this appalling -disorganisation^ift she. could for a trims
ostablish control of Russia1^ internal affairs.Another concern of the correct GermanIrureaaicrats must be the premature contempt &quot;with which the Bolsheviks speak of the Kaiser and his Government.     They openly &quot;boast that they have, compelled the German autocracy to agree to the Bolshevik terms of peaoe - no annexations and no compensations.     It remains to be seen whether Austro-German designs upon Russian-Poland and the German ambition to attach Lithuania and Courland as personal appenages to the Prussian Crown will contribute to a pacific de-velepment of Eusso-German relations.    Further armed resistance en the part of Russia, or any section of it, seems for the mcment highly improbable.     And the Germans are taking care that it shall become more and more improbable as the days go by.     The object ci-the fraternisation between the German and Russian troops at the front has been confessed to be the complete disorganisation of. tho Russian Armies.     Prince Leopold of Bavaria has been sent to the Eastern front expressly to superintend this process.    But even without this superintendence tho dissolution of the Russian Armies as a fighting force seems to be proceeding apace.     Constant desertions and the scenes of orgy in the villages behind the lines testify to the state of the troops.4. As regards the internal state of Germany, too muchis, perhaps, made of the disappointment which is expressed in Socialist and Radical circles with the Prussian Reform Bills. The Franchise Bill gives what it promised - equal, secret and direct suffrage on the basis of the already existing universal franchise.    The blemishes of this particular bill, such as the raising of the franchise age from 24 to 25, and the residential qualifications can easily be removed by the Chamber and were,     ,; perhaps, intended to give something for the Radicals and Social-Ists to criticise&quot; and, if the reactionary majority will allow them, to amend.     More serious is the absolute exclusion of all
men serving with the active army and the probably exclusion of many of them after they come home, owing to the provision roquir-ing ono year&apos;s residence in the same commune (itemejjidQ) as a qualification.     As for the projooted Reform of the Upper House on an extended basis of economic and class representation, all that can be said of it is that it represents a slight improvement (from the Socialist and Radical points of view) upon the House as it now is.     Tho Socialists, as advocates of the single Chamber system, want tho Upper House swept away altogether, but, if we may judge from their newspapers, they will accept the perpetuation of this &quot;evil&quot; with resignation.     The Bill of the triad which exciteo tho gravest objections and* indeed, arouses Socialist and Radical indignation, is the measure for curtailing the Budget rights of the Chamber of Deputies and for slightly extending thoso of the Upper House.     Those provisions have not yet been anywhore accurate,-: ly reported in England.     What the Bill proposes is this:(l)     When the Chamber of Deputies rejects or reduces any item in tho Estimates, without the Government1s acquiescence, the Upper House, when the Budget goes up to it, must vote on this item before voting on the budget as a wholo.     If the upper House differs on the item in question from the Chamber of Depu-tios, a joint committee of both Houses will be appointed to consider the matter.     If no agreement is achieved, the item&apos; goes beck to the Chambor of Deputies whose vote is then final. Only then does the whole Budget come before the Upper House, which then, as heretofore, can only accept or reject it as a whole.    It will be seen that the Bill only gives the Upper House the power of delaying the final decision on the point in dispute between the Chamber of Deputies and the Government.(2)     The Chamber of Deputies may not,without the Government&apos;s assent, increase the amount of any item in the estimates or introduce any new item.
(3)     In the event of the rejection of the estimates,or any section of them, hy the Chamber of Deputies, the Government has the right to incur the denied expenditure for all those purposes fe.g. Army, Navy, Civil Service, etc.) for which expenditure had been approved in the previous year.     This right also applies to votes for buildings and purchases on the scale of the approved estimates of the previous year. The last two proposals excite great apposition.    They quite definitely curtail tho Chamber&apos;s power over the purse.
