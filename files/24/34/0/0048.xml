&apos; tn AS-1-.^(This Document Is the Property of ^Hf^nnic fv&apos;iajesty&apos;s Government.)JOSecret.AIR B0AKDa Eg. port to tho, Cabinet.A.B. 1.53/44, * 1st Becember, 1917,le The President of the Air Board has had underconsideration the .question of accommodation for the new Air Ministry.    Unless it is adequately housed it will not be possible to organise it in a manner cal-culated to secure efficiency.    The Hotel Cecil, where the various Departments connected with the Air Services are at present lodged is ill^designed for xhe purposes of a Government office and although perhaps large enough to accommodate, with the help of a few outlying buildings, the Air Ministry by itself, will be quite insufficient to provide in addition the space necessary for the Department of the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies^ The experience of the last twelve months has shewn the vital importance of keeping this Department under one and tho same rooiS with the Department administering the Elying Services, and it v/ould be a retrograde and disastrous step now to separate them*The President has suggested to the Committee on Office Accommodation the advisability of making use of tho British Museum for this purpose.    It is in many ways extremely suitable, while its utilisation would involve an important economy.    At present, with the exception of the Reading Room and certain other small portions of the building, no use whatever is being mado of it, although a large sum it is understood, is being expended for its upkeep.    On the other hand, a very large rental is being paid&quot; for the Hotel Cecil, which might be saved,26 In this connection, the Pre3ide2it has drawn theattention of the Committee to the serious risk which is being incurred by leaving the valuable national col-&quot; lections of the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in their original unprotected positionsc There is good reason to suppose that enemy air raids on London are contemplated next spring of far larger dimensions than those we have experienced in the past, while It is clearly established that a single well-directed bomb might blow to fragments collections of the greatest value.3. The Board have, during this week, discussedwith General Trenchard a letter from the Field-Marshal Commanding in France questioning the advisability of ordering the large number of D.H.9 machines &quot;-hich are intended for tho bombing programme of next year and suggesting that the number should bo reduced.
General Trenchard explained to the Board that the D* He 9 with the B.H.P.  engine in its present form is not a sufficiently efficient machine, in his opinion, to prove an effective day bomber, after the element of surprise which will exist in the earlier attacks has disappeared.After prolonged discussion the Board have come to the conclusion that it would be inexpedient to reduce the orders for this machine0    Its efficiency is entirely a question of the engine with which it is equipped: no suggestion has been made that the aeroplane itself is unsatisfactory.    There is good reason to hope that by next July an engine of substantially greater power will be available with which the D*R.9 would become a satisfactory long-distance bomberc    It would be unfortunate if owing to the lack of a sufficiently powerful engine at this moment orders for the aeroplane were to ba reduced and as a result supply were subsequently found to be deficient when a more powerful engine became available.4. The Board have also had under considerationa letter from Sir Douglas Haig putting forward increased requirements for aircraft for the Expeditionary Force in Fra,nce both in point of numbers and quality.    He estimates the needs of the Expeditionary Force at -Squadrons.Single-seater fighters forfighting at high altitudes 40Single-seater fighters do-signed for attacking ground targets 15Two-seater fighters recon-naiscanco 15Long distance two-oeater reconnaissance machines suitable for photography 1Short distance day bombers 10Short distance night bombers 10Long distance machines carry-ing moderately heavy Q0Fegun 1Corps Squadrons 21Total 113Lo na;. distance bombers * (a)   Long distance day bombers 25t.
