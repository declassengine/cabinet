Colonel JonesThe following Report of the Third Meetingof the Munitions Council Siib-coiamittee cppointed toconsider the question of the lahour available for the 1918 Programme is circulated for the information of the Departments interested.(l)    The Suh-committee on Labour Supply for the 1918 Programme have considered the Minister^ request for the submission of definite proposals as to the utilisation of the man-power in the Home Defence Force for civil work fit national importance, and also the letter of 6th November from him to Lord Derby and Sir Auckland Ge&amp;des.(2)   They understand that Sir A. Geddes intends to make available for war work a large number of i;he men now in khaki in this country who are not required for essentially military duties.    The Committee hope that the opportunity will be taken to draft to munitions work men who possess qualifications of the kind required.labour demands for munitions v/ork is the demand for constructional labour.     There is every prospect that this demand could be met within a reasonable times in so far as urgent constructional work for aircraft is concerned, if the competition of the large programme of aerodrome construction which the V:&apos;ar Office are now carrying out could be eliminated and/(Sgd. ) ;vinston27.11-17,Churchill.The largest and most pressing item, in the
and provided that the Admiralty programme of airship shed construction does not interfere.(3)   The attached table gives particulars of the constructional demands to which the degree of Priority 1. has &quot;been assigned by the Ministry.    It will be seen that the War Office demand for aerodrqme construction is considerably in ezc^ss of the combined demands put forward as matters of extreme urgency by the Ministry of Munitions.(4)   The first suggestion which the Committee wish to make is that it is essential, unless other important constructional work for which, military labour is not available is to suffer, that the TTar Office aerodrome programme should be carried out by military labour.     It is clear that this will mean reshuffling of some of the labour at present employed in order to av^id the obvious disadvantages of employing military and civil labour on the same site; but this would not seem to effer any insuperable difficulties.If this principle is adopted the effect will immediately be that the drain upon the common pool of civil labour for the construction of aerodromes will cease, and at the same time it should be possible to release into the common pool considerable quantities of civil labour at present employed en the construction of aerodromes.    This proposal is in accordance with suggestions made by Sir Auckland Geddes himself, and the Committee understand/
understand that the &quot;Jar Office themselves are making considerable efforts to increase the quantity of military labour available for aerodrome construction. The Committee suggest that this number should be larger and should be immediately increased in the direction proposed above.(5)   This proposal is put forward as a matter of urgency to meet an immediate need.   It does not, of course, carry out the MinisterTs request for a scheme for utilising on work of national importance the surplus energy of the Home Defence Force.   To secure this end, three methods have been suggested:-(a) The return to the system of Military WorkingParties.(b) The release of individual men from theColours for short periods for employment on work of national importance.(c) The formation of distinct battalions formingpart of the Home Defence Force, in which a certain proportion of the strength would be at any time available for loan to the Minister of National Service for work of national importance.(6)   The advantage of (a), the old system of Military Working Parties, is that the system is well known and can be easily worked without any alteration in the existing military organisation, and enables use to be made of units scattered all over the country for emergency work within the area of the Command.   The Committee recommend the retention of this scheme, and see no reason why the Military Working Party system should not be retained, even if the Other suggestions are/
are adopted.    It must be understood that application for Military Working Parties will only be made when civilian labour is certified to be unavailable, and it will be open to the Minister of national Service through whom such applications have to pass, to investigate independently the possibilities of supplying labour from civilian sources.   Numerous examples of their great utility can be given if desired.(7)   The second method, the release of individual men, is the most open to objection by Trades Unions from the point of view of industrial compulsion&quot; and the mixed employment of civil aad military labour. The scheme would be that a number of men throughout the various units of the Home Defence Forces would he earmarked &amp;a available for work of national importance. They would be transferred to such work for a definite period, say six weeks or two months, at the end of which time they would resume military duties for a period.   They would be released as soldiers and wo^ld be liable to military discipline while not in the T.Torks.   Fhile in the Works they would wear mufti and would not be subject to military discipline.     They would receive civilian pay, and Army Separation Allowances, if away from home.    They w/^uld be liable to immediate recall by the Officer Commanding their Battalion in the event of invasion.The Committee understand that some such scheme as this for dealing with about 7,500 men, is under consideration by Homo Forces,It/
It would be essential before it is adopted that the scheme should be discussed in detail with Trade Union representatives in order to forestall charges of introducing industrial conscription by insidious means.    It would have to be made perfectly plain that the number of men in the Army was not being increased in any way for the purpose of this scheme, and the scheme would have far greater chance of adoption by the Trades Unions if it were accompanied by the transfer to civil work of a large number of men who are obviously not performing work of military importance in the Army of to-day.While the Committees do not regard this scheme with enthusiasm they feel no doubt that a considerable amount of useful labour could be obtained in this way. The chief objection to it is that unless the men released were employed o&amp; purely unskilled work, they would be withdrawn just when they had received sufficient training to make them useful,(8)   The third method, the formati-on of distinct battalions forming part of the Home Defence Force, frpm each of which a proportion of the personnel would be available at any moment for civil works, appears to the Committee to offer the best permanent means of utilising the surplus energy of the Home Defence Force.    The Committee feel that they have no sufficient knowledge of the organisation of the Force to eiirpress an opinion on the best means of attaining this end without further consultation with the Military Authorities.   They have not/
not attempted such consultation because they regard it as a matter of urgent importance that the proposal put forward in the beginning of this memorandum as to the utilisation of military labour for the construction ef aerodromes should be pressed on at once, and they feared that the attainment of this immediate result might be hampered if it were made dependent upon a solution which would necessitate extensive reorganisation of the Home Defence Force.(l)   The demand for constructional labour forthe W.ar Office Aerodrome Programme should be met by military labour^   This is a matter of isnediate urgency.(2) The system of military working parties should be resumed, with suitable safeguards, to meet temporary emergencies.(3)   If the Home Defence Forces are prepared to release individual men on some rotation system for War work, this offer should be accepted, provided that it does not(4)   A scheme should be prepared for the establish-ment as part of the Home Defence Force of battalions in which up to two thirds of the personnel should be available on a rotation system at any moment for War work, subject to immediate recall in case of invasion.The Committeers recommendations thereforeare: -(Sgd.)
