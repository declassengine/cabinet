(Assistant Secretary)O  4  4 a  m  t   *  e  (.  3  s   ma   t  c  9 OIn addition to the Papers before them at the last Meeting, the Committee had under consideration, the following Papers - A-.P0G0 3 and A.P.C. 4.nation in lo   THE CHAIRMAN after welcoming the presence ofAir on the Lord Rothermere as Air Minister, ashed General Tr one hard tern Front. to inform the Committee as to the situation in the air on the Western Front.G3KS3AI TRKBCEARL in reply said that-the situation was not so good as it had been,and that our machines vie re operating further h-clc than they had been, which fact might be expressed by saying that they had lost some 8 miles of. land.   ?or this he gave the following - reasons:-That we had not enough machines to carry out a good aerial offensive in the early part of the year.   The change of the type of machine during the heaviest partofothe fighting instead of in the Autumn accounted for this, whereas the Germans changed their types early in the year.   That although we had. some good machines, such as the 8there were such a variety of types ofengines for this one machine that the pilots never got to know the machine find engine sufficiently to do full justice to- it.   That four-fifths of the&quot;German fighting
machines were employed on the Western Front chiefly opposed to the British jjrmy.     We had.49 squadrons in service in Frence and 5 in Italy, &amp; total of 54.     It w&amp;s not possible to use all the machines because it was not possible to heep up all the squadrons.     General Trenchard did not consider that the wastage was higher than he had stated it would be to the Air Board, and the casualties of the squadrons varied from month to month according to the fighting.     The total squadrons at his disposal at the end of the fighting were 54.   He had put forward in June 1916 that it was necessary to have 66 squadrons;    and in JJovember 1916 this number had been increased to 86, and yet by the end of the year he. had only 54 squadrons, several of which had come out at the end of the year.In regard to the programme jproposed for 1918 - 1919 viz. 113 squadrons for the British Expeditionary Force in France and 66 bombing squadrons, it had been framed in proportion to the size of our Forces in France and had been cut down  3 far as possible.In regard to the types of machines sent out, it seem-ed that specifications sent home from General Headquarters, France, were not discussed by the technical authorities at home responsible for supply.     For instance, in regard to fighting machines, France had asked for machines having^from 2f to 3 hours&apos; petrol range,- whereas machines with if- hours1 petrol range had been furnished.     Tho &quot;Dolphin&quot; machine had been fitted with 4 guns instead of 3 and was, as a result, short in petrol power.     The seme epplied to artillery observing machines:    the requirements had boon laid down by the Koyal Flying Corps authorities in France, but no attention had been paid to their specifications.C0I-1I0D0BS PaIHE stated that this was incorrect and that the specifications sent home were discussed in detail and complied with as far as it was possible to do so.     In some cases our army in France ashed for some things vhich it wts impossible to supply, such as machines that would fly 13G to 140 miles an hour.G3JIEEAL TPvElICEaEI), eon tinning, gave as a res son for the fact that cur position had not improved,that although the German forces had increased, our losses had increased more,than they should have owing to the reasons already given by him and also to the fact that each side has a larger number of aeroplanes.     He said that we do not go so far over the line in large numbers as wo used to &amp;nd that is iorces on each side increased so it became herder for large numbers to oross the line. He explained to illustrate this that 100 men on the ground on 100 miles front on either side could cross the line anywhere, whereas a million men on either side in the same distance would have difficulty in crossing the line anywhere.2.     THE CIl lH!IAJJ stated that certain questions had been put to the Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Hsig and eacpairod if he was satisfied.G3H3RiiL TRSHCHABD   replied that the Field-marshal was satisfied that aerodromes would be ready in the Ilancy area for 25 squadrons by the time the squadrons, wer.e ready to come out, and that accommodation for 40/ squaaTons would be available in the British zone if necessary.
G3KSBAL HSHDBRSOIT explained that in making their recommendations as to the aerodromes for bombing souadrons the Air Board did not know where the line would he, and thought that the aerodromes could he some distance behind the front, mainly.,behind the British line, with a few jumping off bases close to the line, but tho rheld-hiarshal Commanding-in-Chief had not agreed to this and had arrmged that those aero&amp;romea should be near Nancy;GhNIhh-L TPd&amp;CEaiiD said that aerodromes for 25 scuadrons&apos; were being nreparcd near Nancy, as well as accommodation for 40 squadrons, which was being prp^ pared in the British zone,     At first the French/refused definitely to sive us any more aerodromes which were made slrea&amp;y, next rear, although at present they had lent us two which they would want again to take over for themselves in the Spring of 1918.     They had, however; agreed to give him ground on.vhich he could make aerodromes.&apos;     It was very bed country for the purpose, consisting of ridgo end furrow;   but with the aid of 2,500 labourers the preparation of two aerodromes for 10 squadrons would be ready by irpril.     Some of this ground had been allotted to the Americans who had not rot started work upon them and therefore it had been re-allotted to the British.     The idea of the French authorities had been to disperse the British and American squadrons amongst thoir own. squadrons,&apos;&apos; but had .given way on this pointu     with the exception, of General Castclncu, they. seemed adverse to bombing operations, especially the General Officer Commanding tho 8th jixriaj (the correspondence contained&apos;in Paper G.2*2426 illustrates this), but on agreement had been reached as&apos; to the desirability of carrying cut a joint concerted attack on the German aerodromes.     &quot;&quot;-hat had deterred the French from favouring such bombing opera-tions was the fact that they would draw similar attacks from the enemy.GEiOiRaL ThENCihikl) outlined a scheme In vhich it was suggested that squadrons of Handley Page machines, whether naval or military, should finish their training under Captain Lambc in Franco.     He had talked the matter over of a second-in-command with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haigwho agreed that In war a second-in-command was impossible.     The Commander-in-Chief1s view was that one brain and one mind must direct all the bombing operations, and that there must be no doubt in any pilot&apos;&apos; s mind as to f.rcm whom his. orders emanate. The fact of the existence of   a   second-in-command would mean a divided opinion.THE CHAIRliAN asked what the French were doing, bear-ing in mind the fact that the Drench- authorities stated that their programme exceeded ours.GENEih-1 TKuNCEuHD replied that by April or Niay the French would have 2 night-bombing groups and 2 day-bombing groups ready.     Their programme of construction was larger than ours, but they wero not.so active in the air as we wore.     They seemed to be chiefly keen on what they called &quot;their plan&quot; jUe. the bombing of the steel producing area in Lorraine.     Operations elsewhere they regarded in the nature of reprisals only occasion-ally to be resorted to,.     They were constructing - long-range machines of the Bre-guet type.-3-.-&apos; * -i-... .. -     .... ... - .-.  . ,   .,. j. ^.n--^,,-__&apos;     v ^---.... . ____.......-----vi---. ., ...
COMMODORE Pi:JUS end SIR WH. WEIR pointed out that the French Government had asked us to supply Handley P&amp;ge machines for night bombing&quot;purposes&quot;.GE1IBRAL TREJ3IJHARD produced some large maps showing suitable targets on the western Front and their dis-tancos from certain centres of the allied territory. Eg .also referred to the backwardness of the AmericanBible inter-        3. SIR EH.V.EIR said that it was highly important thatonce by the it should be impressed upon the American Governmentrican Pro- that they should assist us in the fulfilment of ourmine in their programme, and that the execution of their own contem-put to the - plated programme should not interfere with the deliverytish, of what they had promised us,     It was doing so atpresent, while.their own programme was hanging fire.tare Organic-      4. GSHERAL TRE1I0HARD read out details of the proposed ion of the        scheme for the bombing. organisation which amounted to Ming Force.     a total of 25 bombing squadrons (17 day and 8 night) inthe near future, and 30 bombing squadrons (20 day and 10 night) later on.In reply to a question by Lord Derby, he stated that it was not Intended to have a medical establishment separate from the R.a.H.0.     Ho further explained that it was not intended to Install a new supply depot, but that the bombing squadrons would be supplied from Candas and Rouen, and that there should be no diffi-culty about the necessary traffic arrangements.     If a new depot wore commenced now it could not be in working order until August 1918.In reply to a question by the Chairman he stated that the. supplies for the 5 squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps on the Italian Front wore furnished from Candas.     Practically ell the staff on the necessary establishments, except a few minor items, had been sanctioned by the War Office,     In regard to bombs, an ample supply had been ordered.He slluded to the speed with which he had been supplied with 2 Rolls Royoe Eagle machines for photographing, which he had asked for and received at oceo, and said that nest year he required for photo-graphic purposes six of these machines which would climb to.  3,000 feet,TEE CHAIRMAH alluded to a letter IJo*O.B,2097 dated 14th Hovember (A,P,Co2) tnd pointed out that certain recommendations were made in paragraph 7, i.e.(a) &quot;Reduce the D.H.9 machines on order to the number required to produce and maintain 15 squadrons&quot;and to train the necessary personnel? as Sir William &quot;ieir had stated that no machines with 3.K.P. engines would come out in the B.H,2Ts after -June.GLllEEAl Thhl-CEh-RD said that that recommendation went by the board.
In regard to - &apos;(b) &quot;Try the B.H.-P. engine in the Bristol fighter with a view to the rapid production of a good fighting machine with&apos;sufficient petrol for fairly long distance ?/ork, should it be requir-ed.     Extra tank capacity would probably be necessary.&quot;SIR WM.WEIE stated that he would be in a position by June 1918 to supply improved two-seater reconnaissance fighter machines, and enquired if that would meet G-enersl Treiichard1 s views.GENERAL TRSNCHARB stated that it would. In regard to -.(c) &quot;Press on with the design of a machine to supersede the D.H.9 when necessary.&quot;THE CHAIRMAN enquired what was being done, and if such n&amp;oainos would be Inelu&amp;od in the construction ^rosnranraofor 1919,SIR m WEIR replied that such machines would not be available before July 1919 and they would be only slightly better than D-H.9-GENERAL TRENCEARD explained that D.E*9 machines were not designed as bombers though they had&apos; to be used for such purposes.     What was required was a better bombing machine.COMMODORE PAINE stated that the iioyal Plying Corps-had been offered a single-seater bomber Sopwith, but the Army had refused the offer.SIR V/M.WEIR stated that the D.-H.10 which was the next advance to the D.H.9 was only slightly better than the former and what they really required was something much better than anything available.GENERAL HENDERSON concurred, adding that design was not to blame for the lack of good bombing machines and that designers were at the end of their tether with the existing engines.SIR M.WEIR explained that he had asked the American Government in July 1917 to supply 500 Libertymotors per month and that the future bombing machine wae something of a gamble after July 191-8.     If the Liberty engines proved as good as had been reported, much better machines than those existing, could be produced. A certain number of D.E.9 machines also would be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines.- At the suggestion of the CHillRliAIT &quot;it was decided that :-The programme for the following year should be brought, by General Trenchard, before the Air Board, where it could be discussed. It would then be placed before the Y/ar Priorities Committee and YJar Cabinet for final decision.SIR WM.WEIR referred to the programme for the Spring 1S19, and said that so far as manufacture and supply were concerned the number of squadrons included therein could be supplied earlier.
THE CHAIRMAN pointed ofit that there are other difficulties besides those of manufacture, such as labour, materials and other competitive demands!GENERAL TRSBCEAPJ) added that in framing the programme Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Eaig had been aware of these facto and had cut down the programme as much as possible.GENERAL HENDERSON pointed out that the expansion of the Flying Corps to- 00 squadrons, approved by the War Cabinet, would have to be increased to 219 squadrons.GENERAL SaLMOND stated that this would amount to 240 squadrons for ell fronts. .   In regard to the operations in Palestine, he stated that we had over-run most of the German aerodromes and burnt the machines and therefore had it all our own way in the air.   An enemy machine was now very rarely seen in the air on that front.5. GENERAL THENCHARD said that he had information of the future programme of the Germans. The forecast up to July 1917 was 2,700 machines. During this year the training schools were being increased in size and the Air Service personnel expanded by 24,000. There was also to be an improvement in materiel - Benz, Maibaeh and Mercedes engines being chiefly used.GENERAL TRSNCHaRD gave details as to the new all-metal Junker machine, the Halberstadt two-seater and the multiple engine machines.     In organisation, the tendency was to have 8 machines in a flight and to attach one of the two Junker fighters to a squadron for protection.     A liberal   estimate would be that the Germans would have, in 1918, 4,000 machines on the Front, whilst we have now on the Western Front 1,000 machines and the French have 2,270, and in 1918 we would have over 2,000 and the French over 3,000 machines.COLONEL NEWaLL added that the French, in spite of the number of their machines, were doing very little.GENERAL TR3NCKABD continued that the estimated present strength of the Germans on the Western Front was 5,000 machines.     As to reports, there was a tendency on the part of pilots on either side to exaggerate the strength of their opponents.     The Germans had under 1,000 bombing&apos; machines.     For train-ing purposes the Germans used re-constructed.machines.GENERAL HENDERSON reported that Sir Guy Gra.net had asked what addition to rolling stock in France would be necessary to meet the requirements of the Royal Flying Corps.GENERAL TEEMCHARB undertook to look into the matter and said that for 30 squadrons, two trains per week
each of 45 trucks, were sufficient.COIOITEL KEWALL stated that the Germans had large numbers of anti-aircraft guns round every objective. They also made use of balloon barrages, composed of captive balloons alone.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.  9th November, 1917.
