(  f ilia. ?..&apos;U^y usbuOperat^nev- JE C RET,      276Prom       General Barter, Russian G.Q.G. to :-       C.I.G.S., War Office.Handed in 30th Nov. 1917. Received 7.3 a.m. 5th Dec.1917,No.1397. November 30th. Secret.Krilenko announced yesterday to army and nation that Germans parlementaires accompanied by Ludorff would arrive at Petrograd December 3rd.   Whether this be true or not matters little.    Army is determined for some peace, although a proportion still desire that armistice should be discussed with proper regard for Allies.    A great wave of Bolshevism due to promise of immediate peace, has swept over army and it may safely be said that Bolshevists will continue theruling party in Russia for a considerable time.There is also little doubt that the power of Lenin-Trotski party (extreme left Bolshevists) acquired hy terrorism and strengthened by successful action for armistice is luckily doomed to extinction though it may last weeks longerperhaps months.General Staff cannot maintain present attitude much       /longer as if they do not conform to wish of the.army theywill be replaced.   It is clearly to advantage of the alliesto have General Dukhonin to deal with instead of Lenin&quot;Government&quot;; it is also doubtful in view of sudden revulsionof party feeling in the Russian army whether foreign landingwould have now a favourable effect even if it could be donein time which is Improbable,    Time is now valuable and it ismy duty to express opinion, for what it is worth, that thereis no longer any further advantage in the allies now refusingto
1&quot;.77to release Russia from her treaty engagements.It is better to have a Russia friendly than a&quot; Russia hostile and there is always chance that German terms ofpeace may be such as Russia could not accept, in which case Russian army disillusioned and embittered against Germans would again become a useful asset for allies.There is also the fact to be considered, that, the assent of the allies to armistice or peace would lessen chances of civil war which would, I believe, lead to armed intervention of Germans at Lenin&apos;s invitation. It is ny doubt unnecessary for me to point out how much less unfavourable would be Roumanian position if the allies accepted Russia as a friendly neutral.It is just possible that Russia, left to herself and brought face to face with realities may become sobered and frightened at being left alone against Germans and become more disposed, to look upon us as their real friends-.Army and. masses do not really know the true reasons and objects of the war.    They think they are fighting for reasons which have been kept secret from them, and consequently believe that they are fighting for benefit of the Allies only.    Such being the case it would be better to allow Russia to learn by actual experience and direct negotiation with Germans exactly where they stand, and what German real aims are.
