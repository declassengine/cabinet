(Mine-laying.)on november 18th the enemy shore batteries shelled our drifters off the belgian Flanders coast and prevented the laying of nets, and on the same day 3 enemy destroyers from area-ostend exchanged shots with our patrol and then withdrew.on november 22nd an attack with an electrically controlled motor boat was attempted on the belgian coast patrol, but 2 minutes after being first seen the boat&apos;was lost sight of and was not seen again. doubtless the control was interfered with as our ships and the w/t station at st. pol immediately jammed their wireless.owing to unfavourable weather, flying has been much restricted, but numerous (R.N.A.S.) patrols have been carried out, and one enemy machine is known and two others are believed to have been destroyed.   in addition one was driven down completely out of control.a deep minefield has been laid in the straits of dover. (Mine-laying.)the monitor &quot; earl of peterborough,&quot; has shelled enemy troops attempting to cross Mediter-the river piave, and has bombarded and set on fire a bridge over that river. ranean.r.n.a.s. machines have bombed the enemy seaplane base at nagara (dardanelles); (R.N.A.S.) the enemy retaliated with 10 bombs and 6 shells on tenedos town.the submarine &quot; K.1 &quot; has been sunk as the result of a collision, but. there were no Casualties, casualties.The sloop &quot; Candytuft,&quot; was torpedoed by an enemy submarine off the coast of Algeria on november 18th, and subsequently drifted ashore, being severely damaged in bow and stern.   four officers and 6 men were killed.the u.s. destroyer &quot; chauncey &quot; has been sunk by collision with a transport.   three officers and 18 men were lost.the armed trawler &quot; newbridge &quot; has been sunk by collision with a steamer, 14 survivors being picked up.the armed trawler &quot; morococala &quot; has been sunk by mine off queenstown, and there were no survivors.(C 790)   55   11/17   H&amp;S
ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines       During the week under review 11 large enemy submarines have been located, 4 of operating,   these in the Channel, and 2 in the south part of the Irish sea, where great activity has been experienced.   The bad weather has resulted in the efforts of the enemy being almost entirely confined to more sheltered waters.   The &quot; submarine cruiser &quot; was in the vicinity of the Azores on the 24th instant.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and submarines.

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of Losses of losses by submarine and mine, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant Bntlsn steamships of over 500 tons gross register. ... fn trades.8The percentage of loss in the United Kingdom trade is much higher than last week, there being an increase from three to seven vessels lost. &quot; Losses on other Routes &quot; show a reduction from seven vessels to one vessel.The table in Appendix II shows by trades as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last four weeks.The percentage of losses to sailings of British steamships (1&apos;34) does not compare favourably with the figures for the three preceding weeks, but it is less than in the weeks ended the 13th and 20th October, when the figures were 1.84 and 1.60 respectively.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the w*&quot;ch last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine classified according to areas. vessels lost.It will be observed that the submarine operations of the enemy have this week been largely concentrated in the English Channel and the Irish Sea, the figures as regards the Mediterranean indicating a considerable reduction of activity.ENEMY MINES.There has been very little enemy minelaying activity during the week, at most only Minelaying. two U.C. boats having been operating.   The Lowestoft, Harwich and Nore areas were affected, the last mentioned for the first time for two months.The following table shows the number of enemy mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

Of Convoy, the 821 ships convoyed, 424 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and 173 on the Scandi-navia-Lerwick Humber route, the remaining 224 being engaged on overseas trade, 119 inward and 105 outward. There are 6 losses in convoy this week, 2 in the homeward convoy from Gibraltar (one of these having been sunk after leaving the main convoy, but while still under escort), one in the outward convoy from Devonport to Sierra Leone,&apos; one in the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber convoy, which was torpedoed and abandoned on fire, and 2 in the French Coal Trade.During the week 29 Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take Defensive Armament.     Defensive The number of Guns available is 3,160. armament., The number of Howitzers and Bomb-throwers delivered during the week is 33, making Offensive the total delivered to date 314. &apos; armament.During the week 45 Merchant Ships have been fitted with Otter equipment, bringing Mine pro-the total number so fitted up to 851. fcectiongear.The number of Warships now fitted with Paravanes is 325.An additional 43 vessels have been dazzle painted, bringing the total up to 328, with Dazzle L253 complete voyages. Painting.A further 2, making a total of 6 of these vessels, have now been sunk by enemy submarine.(C 790^ A 2

Italy.The mobile naval defences of Venice have been assured by two flotillas of monitors and floating batteries operating in conjunction with two British monitors in the lagoons and canals to the north east of the city, which extend almost to the River Piave.These flotillas consist of self propelled pontoons and lighters carrying heavy guns with a range of 18,000 to 21,000 yards, and the fire of these batteries has been directed on the Piave line. An Italian Naval Brigade is holding this line from the sea to Grisolera. Three Battleships of the,St. Bon Class lie inside the lagoon at Malamocco for the defence of that place. The two Italian monitors which ran aground after the retreat from Grado, have been re-floated and are again in action.The Italian Ministry of Marine has asked for eight 4-inch guns to mount on two new armoured trains destined for the defence of the Adriatic Coast.Russia.The Revolutionary Committee has so far not interfered with the Russian Admiralty as it is supposed that such action would be resented by the sailors ; it has, however, dismissed the &quot; Controflot &quot; the Council nominally at the head of the Baltic and Black Sea Fleet Committee as being too moderate in its attitude, and this action has passed without comment. Feeling in the Fleet is most difficult to ascertain owing to its instability, but more light is expected to be thrown on the situation when the meeting of sailors from both Fleets takes place this week at Petrograd. Admiral Verderevsky and his staff remain at the Admiralty, and propose to do so unless interfered with, in which case they will all resign ; he does not recognise the Revolutionary Committee.Admiral Stanley is of opinion that there is little chance of the Russians treacherously handing over the Fleet to the Germans, though he thinks it quite possible that the delivery to the latter of the four Russian &quot; Dreadnoughts &quot; may be made a condition of peace. The British submarines are reported to be the only effective arm left. No operations are reported to have taken place either by the Baltic or Black Sea Fleets for some time.Naval Staff,29th November, 1917.[Appendices.
