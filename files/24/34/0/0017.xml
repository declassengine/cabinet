This Document It Is the Property ofHiss Britannic fvlajesty&apos;s Government.)fojfft^General Barter, Russia.H.I.   12.5 a,m. 27.11.17.SECRET.86To:-     C.I.G.S., War Office.R.12.40 p.m. 29.11.17.No. 1391. Nov. 27th.   Most secret.I have been interviewed by the Commissary who may be called the High Commissioner appointed by the late Provisional Government at General Headquarters;    the purpose of the interview was to elicit from the Allied Powers what their terms of peace would be.     I replied that I was not in a position to state these terms but that I would transmit his requests      He wanted my sanction to authorise the C-in-C. to open negotiations with the Germans for an armistice, to be followed by a declaration by the Allied Powers of their peace terms;   he considered that this would be preferable to an arrangement between the Germans and the Bolshevists and that it ?;ould help to preserve order on the front and to maintain the present line. I of course replied with emphasis that it was out of the question that the Powers would recognise a separate armistice, but I gave him to understand in a non-compromising way that the Powers would do everything possible to help the Russians to maintain the fight.Allied military assistance.       Since the Commissary&apos;s visit I have heen approached unofficially by the Q.H.G. on behalf of the C.-in-C. with a view to obtaining the active military assistance of the Allies- in Russia.    It is the opinion of both these officers that this affords the only means of saving the situation and of preserving Russia for the Allied cause.     I believe personally that the mere announcement of the landing of foreign troops would have an immediate and far-reaching effect favourable to the Allied cause and that this would bring about the total collapse of the Bolshevists.     If such assistance is rendered, however, I think it should be distinctly stated that the troops are Intended to supportthe
the Russian and Roumanian Armies at the front and. that, far from wishing to influence internal politics in any way, the Powers desire only to protect liberty against Autocracy.    It&apos; is, of course, open to the Powers to declare at the same time that they cannot allow their ally Russia to fall a prey to an enemy who would not hesitate to make ruthless use of her vassal resources arid that it was not (groups apparently omitted) compel Russian troops to fight against the Allies.    It is the opinion of the General Staff that the despatch of troops to Russia should be kept secret until the actual landing has been actually accomplished.      I think that troops from the United States of America should also be Included as representative of an entirely democratic country, and a most favourable effect would also be produced by the move of Japanese troops to Russia as the Russians are very much in awe of the Japanese.Another telegram will follow this giving a summary of the views expressed by the Q.K.G. when judging this matter. The other- representatives have not been approached on the question.
