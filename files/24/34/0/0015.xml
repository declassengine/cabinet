(&quot;--Victoria 82ACL.This Docume^Stannic Msjesty&apos;s Government)Telegrams:-Growmore, Sowest, London.BOARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.49fflcffl Oita^address all communications to . r^ewirector General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)28th November, 1917.itSir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 27th November:-The Weather.The reports received from the District Commissioners indicate, generally speaking, that the weather last week throughout England and Wales was favourable for seasonable farm work.     In many districts rain fell during the nights, and in some parts-there was rain almost every day.     This has impeded tractorwork but the prevalence of drying winds helped to make, at anyrate,the lighter land, fit for working.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Agricultural Executive Committees. Devon.   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 41 acres of grass land upon a farm near Chudleigh which they will themselves &amp;reak up and cultivate, the tenant being unable to do so,Hampshire. The Committee have served an order upon a farmer near Fordingbridge to thatch immediately 20 ricks of corn which had been left unthatched.Leicestershire. The Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of a neglected farm of 48 acres near Ragdale, and to cultivate it with land already in their possession. Suffolk, East. The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 557 acres, which includes 120 acres of
marsh and heath land, the property of Sir Ralph Blois.     The farm has been vacant since Michaelmas and had previously been much neglected;   the Committee consider that there is no other way in which the cultivation of this large farm can be secured. Suffolk, West,   The Committee have issued orders for the ploughing up of 450 acres Of Eusbnn Park and 100 acres of Livermere Park, These orders have been issued with the full concurrence of the respective owners and their agents,Offences against the Regulations^    In Norfolk a landlord has been fined  25 and costs for negligently failing to comply with an order to cultivate three fields on his Home Farm near Reepham. The order, which prescribed the manner of cultivation of each field, was issued on 12th March, 1917,     The Committee, in recommending the prosecution, were of opinion that the landlord&apos;s agent had deliberately refrained from complying with the direction, and the defendant stated in evidence that he had left the matter entirely in his sgent1s hands.     In Nottinghamshire the owner-occupier of a farm at Elton was fined  50 for wilfully failing to comply with an order to plough up for autumn sowing 55 acres of land in the autumn of 1917.     The order was the climax of a long series of directions given by the Committee in response to which no work had been done.Drainage of Land.     The Cumberland Committee have served notices under the Drainage of Lands Orders for cleansing the Jericho Beck and for opening the mill sluices on the Allonby Beck. Damage by Game. In Cornwall Lord Falmouth has given written authority to every tenant on the Tregothnan Estate to shoot pheasants, and also to go into the covers and shoot and trap rabbits.Determination of Tenancies.     During the week 10 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 566 acres, and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 37 acres.
Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports from 1,094 districts have now been received, showing that 201,828 applications were made for plots, and 182,874 plots have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).     The total area of the plots so provided Is 13,458 acres.With a view to increasing very largely the provision of land for allotments in urban areas, the Department are proposing to appoint a number of specially qualified Inspectors to confer with Borough Councils and other Authorities as to the acquisition of suitable land.     It is thought that by placing at the disposal of the Authorities mentioned the services of these Inspectors, not only will they be stimulated to acquire land so as to meet the verf large demand for additional allotments which already exists in practically all urban areas, but by selecting the most suitable land avoid in many cases the heavy claims for compensation which would otherwise be made,HORTICULTURAL DIVISON Small Canning Stations - The small canning stations referred to In previous reports are working satisfactorily.   During the past week, the Cheltenham Station prepared 3,700 3-lb. cans of fruit (apples), and the Bridgwater Station 4,600 3-lb. cans.Negotiations are proceeding with respect to the dis-posal of the produce which will either be distributed through normal trade channels or be disposed of to the Army Contracts Department for use in hospitals.The number of Home Canners sold is now 146, and the number of cans Is 92,376,Fruit Pulp.- Pulping of apples is being continued at Maidstone, Totnes, Bridgwater, Bewdley, and Cheltenham.     The station pro-ducing most satisfactory results is Bridgwater, where it is expected that 1,000 tons of apple pulp will have been put down by the time the station closes in December.The stations at Marden, Sittingbourne, Pershore, Newport, and Cambridge, have been closed owing to lack of fruit.Apple Jelly making is proceeding at Marston Magna,
Long Ashton and Wedmore, and it is anticipated that the quan-tlty manufactured will amount to 250,000 lbs.The addition to food supplies already made by the Departments pulping stations Is proving of considerable value owing to the fact that certain important centres would be, were it not for the work of these stations, without jam. The absence of jam would be the more serious in .view of the present scarcity of butter and margarine.TECHNICAL DIVISION Inspection of Grass Land - Twelve grass holdings in Cornwall were inspected on the 22nd and 23rd   instant as being typical of a class that were giving the Executive Committee some trouble, f/ith a single exception all were under 50 aores and several were under 25 acres.     In most cases the grass was of good quality, and the occupiers objected to plough it up because of the trouble, or pecuniary loss, which they anticipated.-     In a few instances occupiers were willing to have the land- broken* but said that they were quite unable to get the work done themselves.     Although the fields visited were in different parts of the country, and as far apart as Launceston and the Helford River, the soils were remarkably similar.     All were red loams, well adapted for ploughing, and where too rich for corn they were suited for potato cultivation.     A report is being sent to the Chairman of the Executive Committee, and in ten cases it is suggested that fields should be ploughed. In the other two cases a qualified recommendation to plough some land is being sent.Position of County Programme.   In the course of the above inspection, information as to the general position in Cornwall was obtained.     It is very satisfactory- and is creditable to everyone concerned in the Food Production Campaign in the County.     Cornwall was asked to provide 204,000 acres of corn, that is 80,000 acres more than in 1916, and up to 31st October
had secured promises of 176,000 acres, including an increase of about 28,000 acres in wheat.     It is believed that the whole area of corn asked for will be obtained.     A separate report on the position of the programme is being submitted.Examination of flue dusts. -   Further examination has been made of samples of flue dust, from which it appears that much of the potash is probably present in the form of silicate and not of sulphate.     In the lower grade samples examined only about half the stated amount of potash was extracted by water, though the full stated amount was obtained by the use of dilute acid according to the official method.The flue dust richest in potash (the highest grade on the official list) also contained appreciable quantities of cyanides and sulphocyanides,     An investigation has been put in hand to discover the limits beyond which the cyanides should not be allowed to go.Potash from Cement Works. -   A sample of dust has been received from a Cement Works:    it contains about 4^$ of potash, and is produced in the rotary kiln.     Its fertilising value is being examined.Inoculation of Leguminous Crops.   From a copy of a recent German publication, received through the Home Office, it appears that German agricultural experts have recently given considerable attention to the inoculation of leguminous crops, and German farmers are being urged to employ this process.     Small-scale experiments carried out at the Rothamsted Experimental Station some years ago showed that an increased yield of about 20$ (probably only 10$ on a field scale) was obtainable through inoculation, but at the time this increase was not considered sufficient to justify the adoption of the method in practice.     Now, however, such an Increase would be valuable, and the Technical Committee have appointed a Sub-Committee to go into the subject with a view to action in 1918 and 1919.
Seed Testing Station,   One hundred and twenty-six samples, including 27 from wholesale merchants, 81 from retail merchants, and 8 from farmers, have been received during the week.   Seven wholesale houses have already opened deposit accounts with the Department, and there are indications that the Station will be utilised by seedsmen to a much larger extent than was originally anticipated.A conference of County Agricultural Organisers and College Lecturers has been arranged to consider the best means of making the facilities offered by the Station widely known amongst farmers,&apos; and also matters connected with the administration of the Testing of Sesds Order.LABOUR DIVISION Soldier Labour.   Information has been received from the War Office that a first draft of about 500 skilled ploughmen has arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural leave to assist with the cultivation work for the 1918 Programme.   These men have been sent to their regimental depots and will be instructed to report for duty at the Distribution Centre serving their county of origin.     The Departments Commissioners have been instructed that these men should be immediately utilised on arrival under the Department&apos;s Korse Scheme, preferably in connection with the gang system.A further 1,390 men for the 1918 Programme arrived at the,Distribution Centres during the week, making a total to date of 28,462 men out of the. 43,000 soldiers to be made available. Some of the men have been re-classified during the week and accepted as skilled, making a total of 16,655 so-called skilled men supplied to date, and 11,807 unskilled.    A number of the unskilled men are returning from farmers on completion of harvest work, leaving 14,386 skilled and 9,414 unskilled men cut on the land.
A further 101 men have been supplied for tractor train-ing, making a total of 1,498 men sent out for this purpose to date. Horses *   Instructions for the issue of 118 horses have been sent out during the week, making a total of 3,752 horses to date.Prisoners of War,   At the Department&apos;s request the far Office have made enquiries as to the number of ploughmen who are in the agricultural prisoner camps in the Eastern Command, with the result that it has been ascertained that 529 of the prisoners in these camps are skilled ploughmen.     Only a small minority of these men are at present engaged on ploughing work, and steps are being taken with a view to arrangements being made to utilise the services of all these men for ploughing.Five additional schemes for the establishment of agricultural prisoner camps have been sent to the tar Office during the week, making a total of 17 schemes now under consideration by the War Office, the number of extra prisoners asked for being 1,525.     Prisoners to the number of 101 have been added to the existing camps during the week, bringing the total number of prisoners now employed, including interned aliens released, up to 5,234.Women&apos;s Branch.The following statement shows -the numbers of the Women&apos;s Land Army who are, at the present time, at work on the land or undergoing training:-In training Centres......................298On Farm Work..........................6,057Employed by.the Forage Department........364Employed by Timber Supply Department ....139 Waiting for references to be placedIn Training Centres.............30Waiting for employment in Depots.........63Waiting in their own homes............. .1557,104
Arrangements for training women for motor tractor work are being developed. A new training centre has been started in Lancashire. The numbers taken at Aston Grange in Cheshire have been increased to 12, and at the Harper Adams Collage in Shropshire the number is about to be increased to 3C. In Kent, as soon as th necessary tractors are received there, the number of women under training will be increased to 20.The second Course for farmers&apos; daughters has just commenced at the Madryn Farm School in Carnarvon.   Although the first course was only intended for non-National Service TTomen, three out of the eight who were in training have since seen the importance of National Service and have joined up..    These courses appear to have a stimulating effect amongst the North w&amp;lea farmersMECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors purchased or ordered by the Department:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees up to and including 20th November............     1,755Consigning instructions given during the week     ......... 12On offer to counties......... 17Consigned to Scotland 106&quot; &quot;    Ireland     70    ...... 1761,960SUPPLIES DIVISION. Superphosphate.   The apparent lack of demand for superphosphate is giving rise to some anxiety.     The danger is that, owing to the comparatively slow demand, the works will be congested and compelled to reduce their output, while the railway position next spring is likely to make it very difficult to secure delivery of large quantities just at the time when farmers want it.     Farmers have, accordingly, been urged to order at once and take delivery as soon as possible, and a strong &quot;whip.&apos;&apos; is also being circulated to Approved Agents.
Potash.    The work in connection with H.M. Potash Factory is reported, to be proceeding satisfactorily and there is some hope that production may begin shortly after Christmas.     A certain quantity of Potash is produced from blast furnace dust at other places and a proposal has been made to the Ministry of1 Munitions with a view to fixing the price of this potash and of high grade flue dust from this source.     If this can be done, the only potash which will be uncontrolled as regards price will be such supplies of imported potash as may still remain on the market, and the small quantities produced from kelp.Rapid progress is now being made with the arrangements for the sale of flue dust, and a large number of Agents have applied for licences for its sale.Basic Slag.   The demand for basic slag continues to be very large and although deliveries are being well maintained, there are three works which have some stocks for which trucks cannot be provided.     Special efforts are being made in conjunction with the Ministry of Munitions and the Railway Executive Committee, to secure transport so as to clear these works within the next few weeks.Stable Manure.   The arrangements for the disposal of the manure from the Eelmoor dump appear to be proceeding satisfactorily. Orders are being received for delivery in Surrey and it is hoped that removal by barge will begin next week. Sulphate of Copper.     A conference wag held with makers of sulphate of copper with a view to fixing the price of this material for next season.     The makers agreed to a price on a sliding scale from  48 to  52 per ton, and agreed to build up. a reserve for home use, either delivered or in their works, which would amount by the end. of May to not less than 12,000 tons, such further quantities as might be required after that
date being supplied from current production.     Retailers are being consulted as to the price to be charged for small quantities. Lime.   The returns received from manufacturers of lime show that the quantities delivered for agricultural use in October were about 21,000 tons, as compared with 14,000 tons in the same month in 1916. The position revealed by these figures is not unsatisfactory and up to the present no very serious complaints have been received of a shortage of supplies.     Steps are being taken to meet the requirements of firms in regard to labour as far as possible.     The question of obtaining skilled lime burners has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of National Service who are endeavouring to secure a few men who were formerly engaged in this occupation. Cereal Seed.   Enquiries which have been made regarding the available supplies of seed oats in one or two of the oat growing counties Indicate that there is likely to be a considerable scarcity. Samples of Manx oats have been received through the Wheat Commission.     It is probable that 2,000 tons could be shipped from the Isle of Man by the middle of February.     Some enquiries are being made as to the possibility of securing seed from the North of Ireland.     The question of the price of seed oats will be considered by the Advisory Committee this week.Seeds (other than Cereals.)     The Advisory Committee qn Seeds met on Friday last and considered the total applications for licence, for a period of two months, which had beem submitted through the War Trade Department.     The figures relating to grasses and clover were not available.     It has been decided to follow the lines indicated by the Committee in regard to recommendations for the issue of licences.Seed Potatoes.   Purchases of both immune and other varieties of potatoes are bSing made in Scotland.     The Department are
endeavouring to secure potatoes on advantageous terms and in view of the necessity for large supplies of early varieties several hundred tons of &quot;Epicure&quot; have been purchased in addition to the varieties enumerated in the Scheme.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Dire c tor-Gener al.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.11
