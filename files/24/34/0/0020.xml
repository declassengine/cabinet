^ /5   sii(TbH T^)tumem is the property bfHe        ^Vic Majesty&apos;s Government)90CENSORSHIP OF LEAFLETI enclose far the information of the War Cabinet a sopy ttf a letter which I have received from Mr. Herbert Samuel, and upon which I will submit a memoran-dum very shortly.Dear Kpme Secretary,The neinbern of the late Cabinet have been considering the new Defence of the Realm Regulation 27 C, and desire mo to write to you      express the grave concern we feel as to its terms.     We are quite at one with ycur desire to impese an effective check on the circulation of leaflets which infringe the provisions, properly drawn in wide terms, of Regulation 87.    We have n* ebjection to raise to the requirement that the name and address ^f the author and the printer should appear on every copy, and that the Defence of the Realm Act penalties should apply ho any breach of that requirement.    We recognise the necessity of a provision -subject to one exception to be mentioned later - that the leaflets should be communicated to the Press Bureau prior to publication, in order to present surreptitious circulation, which might become widespread before the authorities had knowledge of it.     The part of the new Regulation to which we take exception are the words in paragraph (b) &quot;submitted to and passed by&quot;.   Those words oust the jurisdiction of the Courts, and for the first time confer upon the Executive powers of censorship in political matters which cannot be questioned at law.They appear indeed to carry the matter further than the Government really intend, for in explaining the Regulation to the House of Commons on November 15th you gave as the reasons for its enactment that &quot;M-sst of the leaflets do not come under the notice of the authorities until after they have been partly distributed, and there is often a difficulty in ascertaining the authorship.     Further, the penalty imposed by Statute upon the printing of these leaflets without disclosing the printer&apos;s name is inadequate in time of war, and some of them are distributed without the imprint required by law.     In these circumstances the Government con-sider that additional powers are required.&quot;     These purposes we suggest,. would be fully served without the inclusion of the words to which I have referred.      You added, in answer to supplementary questions &quot;I am dealing with pamphlets which infringe the law and must be dealt with under the law&quot;&quot;, and again &quot;This Regulation deals with leaflets that infringe the Regulations.&quot;     As now drafted, however, the words of the Regulation create a new offence, if a leaflet is circulatedOffice.-Ucl7.G. OAVE.HOUSE OF COMMONS.  . November 27th, 1917.
which has not been approved by the censor; although there might be nothing in its contents that infringed the law.Great difficulties can hardly fail to arise in practice, also, if a different standard is applied to natter which is printed in a leaflet from that which is applied to matter printed in a newspaper or spoken from a plat-form.     Under Regulation 27 as it stands, one. rule is enforced equally.   Under the addition now proposed, the same propaganda is legal in one form and illegal in another.There are two further points to which we would desire tc draw your attention. Y/e think that it is both undesirable and impracticable that leaflets to be issued at a general election or at a bye-election should have to be sent up to London and passed by a Government Office.     Under the Regulation as drafted this appears to be compulsory, though we are glad to know that you have stated in Parliament that the Government do not desire to use their powers so as to impose restrictions in such cases.     We would suggest that leaflets circulated at elections should be exempted specifically from the scope of the Regulation.     And the Discretion retained by the Government under the words at the end of the Regulation, to exempt any leaflet from its provisions by authorising its issue, seems open to objection.There are come other points of drafting which would nn doubt be considered if the Regulation is being revised.We have reason to believe that large sections of opinion, quite distinct from the pacifist group, are greatly disturbed by the Provisions of this Regu-lation in its present form.     It is in the hope of avoiding the necessity for a controversial debate that we suggest the amendments to the Regulation proposed in this letter, and we do so with the lees hesitation as we believe that these amendments would not be inconsistent with your public statements on the subject.Yours sincerely,HERBERT SAMUEL.The Right Hon. Sir George Cave, K.C., M.P.ip
