IMPOSTS AND EXPORTS (TSMPOMRY CONTROL) BILL.With reference to the joint Memorandum circulated by Lord Ehondds and Sir Alfred Mond on the subject of the Imports and Exports (Temporary Control) Bill, with regard to the length of the peribd for which the . provisions of that Bill are to remain in force after the termination of the War,.I have been pressed on the one hand to provide for a longer period of control than the three years now provided for in clause Z of the Bill, andj on the other hand, to make the period shorter as Lord Ehondda and Sir Alfred Mond suggest.I propose during the debate on the Second Heading of the Bill to indicate that sympathetic, consideration will be given to suggestions for the substitution of a shorter period when the Bill is in Committee.A,H. STANLEY./5th Dceember, 1917.
