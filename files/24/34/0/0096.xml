^TlViSjDocumeiitjs the Property -of *His Britannic Majesty-^ Government!        ^BIPORT relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland *&quot;or the week ending 5th December, 1917.W    &apos;,     ,......-.       &apos; - 448Jgffqd Production.In sj[.ite of the sharp frost that occurred during the week and checked ploughing for two days operations are very far advanced for the season of the year.   The work of harvesting potatoes and storing turnips is practically complete.1, l-Iilk Collecting Depots.The Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk recently recommended the establishment of a number of depots at which milk could be collected, treated and distributed, and in which apparatus would be provided for the conversion of surplus milk into cheese.The recommendation of the Milk Committee was accompanied by the suggestion that loans might be made from publio funds in order to further the establishment of the depots and the Board aocord-ingly approached the Treasury on the subject.   The Treasury have now sanctioned the making of loans up to a total sum of  8750 for 5 depots in Scotland.   The   amount to be advanced to each Society rill be a sum equal to one half of the total cost of buildings and machinery,   tfith a view to avoiding relatively heavy repay-ments in the earlier years of the undertaking it has been arranged that the loans will be repaid in equal half-yearly instalments of principal and interest over a period of 5 years - and bear interest at 6 per cent per annum - the annuity to commence to run two years after the Depot begins working.It has also been arranged that these local depots should be worked under the supervision of the Scottish Agricultural Organi- -sation Society, and the Board are accordingly asking that Society-to undertake the preliminary negotiations with the local Societies.2. Guarantee to Implement takers.The Treasury have also approved the Board1e proposals (reported on 21st November last) regarding ft guarantee to Manu-faoturers of Agricultural Implements against loss of capital invested in the manufacture of   implements which may be unsold after the harvest of 1918 and   may require to be carried over for sale in the Spring of 1919.3* Oorn Production Act 1917.District Images Committees.The Board have received an application by a newly formed Committee of employers&apos; and workmen1a representatives for recog-nition as the District F&amp;ges Committee for the Forfar and Perth DiotrjLot and have given notloe in the Press that they propose to certify this Committee subject to consideration of any represen-tation whioh may be made to them within one month.Collection of Statistics and returns relating to Agrioulture.1.

Returns under the Potatoes (Growers* Returns) Order 1917.The tabulation of these Returns has now &quot;been completed, and full particulars have been communicated to the Pood Controller.     summary table is appended showing the total quantities of each variety for Scotland as a vhole.   It will be observed that the tfotal quantity accounted for is less than half the estimated total produce of the crop.   The differenceis accounted for by (l) the exclusion of certain districts from the soope of the inquiry; (2) the exolusion of growers of less than 5 acres of potatoes; (3) the disposal of early and second early potatoes before the end of September.III.

The total produce of Potatoes is estimated at 1,110,000 tons, which is considerably more than double that of last year, and has been exceeded only once since the Returns of Produce were first collected in 1885, viz., in 1889, when the total produce was 2,500 tons more. The area under the crop shows an increase of 17,600 acres, while the yield, 1\ tons per acre, is 3-4 tons over that of last year, and 1-2 tons over the average for the preceding ten years. The yield this year is the highest on record, the next best year being 1908^ when the yield was 7-3 tons. Turnips and Swedes also show a large increase, the total produce, 8,053,000 tons, exceeding that of last year by 2,156,000 tons, or 36*6 per cent. As in the case of Potatoes, this has been exceeded only once, viz., in 1908, when the produce was greater by 266,000 tons. The area under the crop is practically unaltered, but the yield, nearly 19^ tons per acre, exceeds last year&apos;s by 5*2 tons and the decennial average by 3 tons. This again is the highest on record, the next best year being 1908? when the yield was nearly 19 tons. Mangolds, with a total produce of 53,000 tons, show an increase of 9,000 tons; the area is greater by 70 acres, while the yield, 21-8 tons per acre, is 3 tons over that of last year and 2-6 tons over the decennial average.Board op Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, 5th December 1917.(3254)-Wt. 5308/156.   4000.   12/1917.
