At the instance cf Lord Rothermere the:. Directors of the National (a-allery, the British Museum, the Victoria arid Albert Museum and the Wallace Collection of Pictures met us at the Office of Works to-day.   Lord Hother-mere explained the serious nature of the preparations which the enemy is now making for his Air Offensive next Spring, and it was generally felt that the precautions which had hitherto been taken by cur Public Museums and Galleries to safeguard their treasures will be inadequate to meet the ne^ conditions. Accordingly it was agreed, subject to the consent of the War Cabinet:-(1) That the principal treasures in the Museums and Galleries of London and its neighbourhood should be removed and, if.possible, stored in some safe subterranean refuge within the area of London itself.(2) That a Report should be made as to the subterranean accommodation available and as to the space required.(3) That the Directors wf Museums and Art (Hlleries should be invited to classify their objects *f value in two or more categories according to their importance, placing in the first category only those objects which were irreplaceable and of.great intrinsic interest and beauty. (4) That in considering-, the order of removal (a matter of some difficulty in viow of       scarcity of labour and of T-ood) priority should b* given not to one Museum over
another but to articles in the first category of importance.(5) That it was desirable that the educational work inartistic and industrial design now being carried on at the Victoria and Albert Museum should not be suspended.(6)That a Committee should be formed tc carry out the arrange-merits consequential upon the decision to ensure the , safety of the principal treasures in cur Public Museums.(7) That notice shoulu be confidentially sent to BodleyfsLibrarian at Oxford and to the Keeper of the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge intimating the desirability ef additional precautions.(8) That --vord should be sent round to the newspapers in order to prevent public attention b*ing drawn to thssr rr-movals in a way which i.d/rht be calculated to alarm the publicmind,H.
