Involving stoppage. The only strikes of serious importance are that of the sheet metal workers at Birmingham, Coventry, and Wolverhampton, and that of the shopmen in the workshops of the Furness Railway. &quot;   -(b.) Not involving stoppage. The subject of increase in wages in railway shops at Swindon, Wolverton, Harwich, and Crewe is causing unrest in these centres. The rivetters on the Clyde are restlessly expecting the award of the Com-mittee on Production on the question of their price list.I. General Remarks.The Labour Position.The critical conditions at Coventry have been alleviated by the arrangement of a joint conference of employers and employed to discuss the question of the formal recognition of the shop stewards, and of the methods to be adopted, by which a system of shop stewards&apos; committees can be engrafted on the existing Trade Union organisation. This step was taken just in time, for sympathetic strikes appeared to be certain at Birmingham, Leicester, and Nottingham, but were stayed by the temporary settlement, George Peet of the Manchester shop stewards had taken drastic steps and had issued a circular letter to Sheffield, Barrow, and other centres, calling upon the Committees to support Coventry by immediate action.  There was indeed every sign of a national conflagration.The decision of the question now at issue is of first-rate importance, for it will affect the position and powers, not only of the employer, but primarily of the Trade Unions, in every engineering shop in the country. The question is in the clearest sense a national question. Its effects have spread from the narrow limits of Messrs. White and Poppe&apos;s works to the whole industrial world, and the gravity of the decision which must be taken is thus of obvious importance.[1100-7] B
It is mainly a question for the Trade Unions to settle themselves. They have avoided facing it hitherto, though quite aware of the encroachments made by the shop stewards on their constitution. If the Coventry strike produces a general and statesmanlike settlement of this question, which has been at the root of much of the industrial unrest of the- past two years, its occurence will not have been without good results.There were signs of acute unrest also in South Wales and Barrow. In the former area the members of the National Union of Railwaymen accepted the 65. award of the Committee on Production only with the utmost reluctance and after threatening a strike, while the men employed in the Taif Vale Railway workshops actually came out for an increase of wages, but have since returned, the matter having been referred to the Committee on Production.At Barrow the men employed in the Furness Railway workshops have come out to enforce a claim to the district rate paid in other factories, and are reported to have been promised the support of the shop stewards, even to the extent of a sympathetic strike at Messrs. Vickers. Similar action at certain other railway workshops was feared, but up to the present it has not been taken.The connection between high prices and scarcity of food on the one hand, and industrial unrest on the other has frequently been noticed. It cannot be questioned that the disturbed condition of industry at the present time is largely due. to the former causes. They led to a one day strike at Coventry before the general strike commenced, and a report has been received indicating that similar action is con-templated at Barrow. Every speaker at the frequent demonstrations in favour of increased wages, places the food argument in the forefront, and it is commonlv alleged that reduction of prices would be more welcome than increased wages or bonus. The food difficulties have increased materially, specially for those whose means compel them to live in the poor residential quarters, and further difficulties are anticipated. It is clear that these will react upon Labour, and that a period of acute unrest and anxiety is to be expected. It is very doubtful whether com-pulsory rationing would effect any mitigation, though it would probably remove the sense of injustice and, to a certain extent, that of inequality of sacrifice/of which so much is made in certain sections of the Labour press.II. Press Opinions,Censorship of Pamphlets.The censorship of leaflets continues to give rise to complaints in the Labour press on the subject of repression. Of these, some are purely abusive. In others, detailed complaints of repressive measures are made.Of the former class the following extracts from ;&apos; Forward &quot; furnish an example: &quot; Socrates, Milton, Mill . . . could have seen a nation spring to jrms against autocracy abroad, and, in the springing, provide autocracy at home with an opportunity of reverting to the Inquisition, the Blasphemy Laws, and the Censorship of Thought and Opinion. For that is what we have come to now. Carson reigns. . . . Spies and agents provocateur lay traps for the unwary in speech. Rowdies and alcohol victims are encouraged to invade even the Church sanctuaries and to brawl down preachers suspected or feared by the oligarchy of the day. Habeas Corpus suspended; men and women gaoled without trial or charge; letters privily opened . . . and a journalism that is prohibited from telling the truth, stirs the lowest human passions with the muckrake of falsehood.&quot;The &quot;Herald&quot; complains that verbal orders were conveyed by a chief inspector of the Metropolitan Police to the Secretary of the &quot; Herald &quot; League, to the effect that future meetings of the League in Finsbury Park were forbidden by the Secretary of State, and comments as follows: &quot; It is sheer insanity on the part of the authorities to attempt in this way and by these methods to prevent public discussion on Labour questions. It is quite true that occasion-ally lectures on peace by negotiation have been given in the park, but the main propaganda carried on has been propaganda on behalf of the Labour movement. All autocracies in the past and present have attempted to govern by methods of repression. In the long run these fail.   .   .   .   We are certain this spell of &apos; Prussianism &apos; will pass.&quot;Referring specially to the censorship of pamphlets the same paper writes: &quot; &quot;We are more than ever to be bound, gagged and blindfolded, at the chariot wheels of the few politicians who at any moment may happen to be, by the good graces of Lord Xorthcliffe, in power.&quot;
The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer&quot; welcomes the opposition to the censorship as-evidencing the existence of a great body of healthy opinion, and-comments:- .   &apos;&quot; The regulation creating thenew&apos; censorship; of -leaflets has/raised-ft storm;of protest which must have surprised even Milner,. Curzon, and Carson, who, living in a :tools&apos; paradise, out of touch with the people/fondly believe that the war can be used to Prussianise Britain.&quot; :r&apos;:mJj. ^v:^-^:^yM.:^S^P^MThe &quot;South Wales Pioneer &quot; anticipates that similar censorship, if effective opposition is not at once offered, will be extended to Labour propaganda, and calls upon organised labour to combine to defeat the order.  It says: &quot; The new censorship . . . ; w-ould close with deadly silencing power upon the handful of writers who happens to be &apos; agin the Government &apos; and all that the Government stands for. And this would extend to every department of real life; and in particular to every phase of industrial propaganda, for it is utterly impossible to isolate the consideration of any important present or future problem from the war.&quot;The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; in condemning the Order, expresses a doubt as to its legality, and calls upon the various organisations which will be affected to combine together and to carry a test case, if need be, as far as the House of Lords. This journal also takes the same line as the &quot; South Wales Pioneer,&quot; as to the effect of the Order on Labour propaganda: &quot; Under this regulation no trade unions can lawfully publish any matter dealing with industrial conditions arising out of the war. Protests against food profiteering, demands for the conscription of wealth, matters of industrial reconstruction, protests against the treatment of soldiers and sailors, are all illegal unless the permission of the Censor has first been obtained.&quot;&quot; Justice&quot; deems it to be little-short of an outrage that everything should be submitted to the Press Bureau, in the main, apparently, because of the quality of the Bureau staff. The &quot; New Witness &quot; has criticism of a similar nature, while the &quot; New Statesman &quot; points out that pacifist literature, even if censored in pamphlet-form, can subsequently be printed bodily in the columns of a newspaper without legal objection. This paper, however, anticipates that the regulation will be so modified as to become innocuous.Police Raids.The anti-pacifist raids and action afford &quot; Forward&quot; material for sarcasm. It heads one article, &quot;Looking for Bolo below the Piano ... . Hunting for Bolo. The Rascal has some Narrow Escapes,&quot; and proceeds to describe from Hansard and the public press a series of raids made during the past fortnight, and the adventure of two Scotland Yard detectives below a piano at a meeting of the Southampton Trades Council.   It also prints the following paragraph: England has taken about three years to transform herself into the likeness of a Prusso-Russian State. In Southampton detectives conceal themselves under a grand piano to listen to business transacted at a private meeting of trade unionists; in Finsbury Park gangs of ruffians, organised after the manner of the Black Hundred, smash up meetings it matters not what&apos; the purpose of the platforms is and the authorities look on and do nothing. The Government has taken anarchy and hooliganism under its wing as Czardom did, and proved that anarchy and oppression are dangerous tools for Governments to employ.&quot;Disfranchisement of the Conscientious Objector.The question of the C.O.&apos;s vote has led to a considerable amount of writing on the part of the Labour press, which, as was to be anticipated, is hostile to the resolution. The &quot;Herald&quot; contains an article on the sanctity of conscience by Bertrand Russell, whose general tenour may be judged from the concluding paragraph: If our legislators had any conception of what makes the greatness of human society, they would, even though the C.Os. were as mistaken as Lord Derby believes them to be, cherish them as custodians of the power of faith, and as quite specially worthy of the privi-leges of citizenship. It has seemed otherwise to the powers that be for the moment, but not long.&quot;At another place this paper has an article on the subject from which the following is extracted: If it does represent the national attitude, then that same responsibility is transferred to the nation at large, and we must all bear the shame of having cast mockery and oppro-brium on the faith in liberty in which our brothers have died. The disenfranchisement clause is both futile and base.&quot; .:\ ^:        i-v^v^V.;;^:&apos;;-.^---^^^-- :A-.\ *
The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; writes:  . -  -? ...-* -&apos; - - &quot; The-conscientious objectors -.   . , .   will-probably not mind.the deprivation very ,;     much.&apos;  It will certainly increase rather than diminish then political influence.    Neverthe-less, the action of Parliament must not be quietly accepted.   At the best, it is a mean and contemptible action, and one against which everybody who values the right to have an individual opinion must vigorously and persistently protest.&quot;The &quot; Clarion&quot; on the other hand takes the view that the decision is logical and correct, and that the conscientious objector cannot morally claim a right to share in making the laws of a State, the very existence of which depends on acts which he refuses to perform.Food.The press agitation on the subject of food becomes more intensje.&quot; Common Sense &quot; quotes a housewife&apos;s letter giving a weekly budget of expenditure, which shows a rise from 13s. 9^d. in 1913 to 34s. $\d. in 1917. The paper points out that though the &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; records an increase of 106 per cent, in prices of food, the housewife&apos;s figures prove that increase to have been actually 150 per cent.The &quot; Herald &quot; appears to be concentrating on the question of food, and publishes several columns dealing with different aspects of the problem. The chief point argued by this paper is inequality of sacrifice under existing arrangements, and the necessity for compulsory rationing of all supplies. Only thus can the poor obtain their full share of every kind of food.&quot; We want to see a system of rationing which will cover every sort and class of food. . . . All food is essential. The poor can eat hors d&apos;oeuvres and caviare just as well and with as good appetite as the rich. They can. eat poultry with as much relish as any of the clients of the Ritz, the Carlton, or the Savoy. The cream and the fruit, the sherry and other wines Mould all be equally acceptable to the people in East London.&quot;At another place the paper writes: &quot; We are told there is much more cheap than expensive tea. Who is getting it? No one appears to have any knowledge on the subject, but the poor cannot get it, and conse-quently they go without. They also know that the rich and well-to-do are not compelled to wait in queues for hours on end. No; their supplies arrive regularly like manna from on high.   There is no equality, Jmt gross inequality, of sacrifice in all this.&quot;In another article the &quot; Herald&quot; suggests complete standardisation of living in every direction; clothes, boots, and incomes to be the same for each one; all supplies to be commandeered and distributed to the co-operativie societies, with whose help national and local stores might be -opened in every locality. The article concludes with an appreciation of the spirit of Coventry, which gave a demonstra-tion strike in order to draw attention to the subject, and ends as follows: &quot; We are told to look out for a serious shortage between now and next April. If there is to l)e a shortage it must be shared equally by all.&quot;The trouble over the sugar card affords the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; an opportunity for an attack upon the chaos of the Food Controller^ Department. It asks what confidence ca,n be placed in the ability of that Department to deal with rationing generally, if mistakes of this kind are inevitable when only one item is affected. This matter is also the subject of adverse comment in &quot; Justice &quot; and elsewhere.The luxury of the rich in the consumption of food, as evidenced by the &quot; Herald&apos;s &quot; Ritz article is further exploited in the &quot; Clarion,&quot; &quot; Common Sense,&quot; &quot; Forward,&quot; the &quot;South Wales Pioneer,&quot; and the &quot;Nation.&quot; The last named paper considers that &quot; so far as the quality of nutritious food goes, the Ritz banquet may be a little less wasteful than it seems,&quot; but urges that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer had done his duty, few people would have had the money to buy such meals.Comrades of the Great War.The &quot;Herald &quot; prints an article by Mr. Hogge, deprecating this new organisa-tion for ex-soldiers, and contrasting it unfavourably with his own Federation, the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers:  &apos;&quot; The object of the Comrades is obvious. The National Federation had become a political menace. Its demands were awkward to the Power that Be, and the * Comrades &apos; were encouraged to &apos; gas &apos; the discharged man. He was not to be&apos; allowed to become a power. He was, instead, to be taught what was due from him to his superiors. He was to be drilled into blessing the squire and his relations.&quot;
The &quot;Cotton Factory Times&quot; urges  r   - -,&apos;&quot; all discharged and disabled soldiers to keep from any contact with the Beresfords and that class. They had better be associated with those who understand workihg-clags. life than with those who do not.&quot; &apos; : &apos; -Peace Discussions.Lord Lansdowne&apos;s letter appeared too late to permit of its discussion in the purely Labour journals. It is, of course, welcomed with enthusiasm and with appreciative comment by &quot; Common Sense &quot; and the &quot;Nation.&quot;Internment of Russian subjects.The detention of George Tchitcherine and the Petroffs is dealt with in a number of papers, and their release is demanded. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; publishes a letter on the subject signed by L. Shammes, secretary, and John Maclean, Chairman of the Russian Political Refugees Defence Committee the latter being apparently the Clyde deportee.The &quot; Call&quot; described the meeting held at Glasgow Green to demand therelease &quot; When Maclean referred to Russia and the supreme efforts of Lenin and Trotzky in the cause of Socialism the thundering applause which followed showed that an audience of Glasgow Socialists can put their own interpretation on the deep-rooted upheavals in Russia. The faint and damning praise of contemporary Labour papers for the Social Democrats of Russia has happily found no echo in the Glasgow rank and file.&quot;The &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; accepts M. Trotzky&apos;s statement that the persons interned are &quot; stainless, self-sacrificing men of high ideal,&quot; and considers that even were their characters less unimpeachable, there could now be no logical reason for keeping them in durance, whatever sort of indictment it has hitherto been possible to frame against them.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; quotes on this subject M. Trotzky&apos;s declaration that the public opinion of the democracy cannot accept the position that worthy heroes of the Russian Revolution should languish in concentration camps in England, while counter-revolutionary British citizens suffer no hardships in the territory of the Rusian Revolution.Stockholm again.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; announces that M. Camille Huysmans has despatched a telegram to Mr. Arthur Henderson, suggesting an immediate International Peace Conference at Stockholm, and that Mr. Henderson was to place the telegram before the National Executive of the Labour Party.   The paper adds;. It is impossible to overestimate the responsibility that will rest upon them if they fail to answer this call.&quot;&quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, dealing with the same incident, considers it highly desirable that the Socialist and Labour organisations should go warily as regards this new proposal.III. District Reports.London.As the result of the recent strike at Coventry there is decided unrest amongst the Engineers of this district.In addition to this, Woolwich workers are anxious about the result of the Committee now sitting to decide to whom the 12f per cent, advance shall apply. At Messrs. Cubitts, oilers, beltmen, setters, fitters, &amp;c, consider that as they are working on machinery they are semi-skilled men, and are therefore entitled to the 12-1 Per cent- increase. Serious trouble is anticipated if they do not obtain their demands.West Midlands.Dissatisfaction in this area is subsiding, and although the Birmingham sheet metal workers are still on strike, the settlement of the Coventry trouble is likely to bring about a speedy termination.The food shortage is serious in this district and unnecessary congestion is alleged to exist in the various goods yards in Birmingham; Railway, goods porters n 100-71 1    - &apos; &quot; &quot;     C
and brakemen, employed at the London and North Western and Midland Depots state that owing to what they term&quot; short-sighted policy of the management&quot; food is being held up. The men are willing to turn in and work on Sunday to minimise congestion, but the management decline to alter the peace time regime, which means the suspension of work from Saturday mid-day until Monday morning. This is greatly criticised by all classes of workers in Birmingham.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The food shortage in the Sheffield district is causing serious unrest among the workers. Women are frankly in favour of raiding those shops which sell tea and sugar. The whole question of high prices and shortage in this area requires urgent . attention. This also applies to the West Riding of Yorkshire, and the pacifists and Socialists have seized the opportunity to spread broadcast reports that the wealthier sections of the community have accumulated large stocks, and have thus brought about the shortage.North-Western.In this area there is a good deal of unrest which is being aggravated by the high cost of food. It is stated that a one-day strike may take place at Barrow as a protest.   The Furness Railway strike is described in Section IV.The Engineers have been greatly excited over the Coventry strike, and at numerous meetings resolutions have been passed supporting the Shop Stewards.Liverpool dockers show a marked dislike for working with men of the Dockers Battalion and recently made this an excuse to go on strike.Northern-.Apart from the agitation amongst craftsmen on the North-Eastern Railway to receive the same rates of pay as the men employed in other trades, this district is quiet.The award of 11. 5s. a week advance for foremen employed in the engineering shops and shipyards on the north-east coast has given great satisfaction.Pacifism is making no headway in the North, and in the Newcastle area it is reported that the work done by the War Aims Committee is making an excellent impression.Wales.The position in South Wales is not satisfactory. Shopmen on the Taff Vale and Cardiff Railway are on strike in support of their.claim for an extra shilling war bonus, which would place them on an equal footing with the traffic men. One hopeful feature of the situation is that attempts made by the Shopmen to influence other railwaymen in the district have failed.In the coal districts pacifism is still rife, and it has been noted that con-scientious objectors from Penderyn Camp are in the habit of attending secret meet-ings of the I.L.P. at Merthyr.Scotland.On the Clyde there are signs of general unrest. It is believed that matters will become very serious unless all workers receive the 12^ per cent, increase. Trouble is not, however, anticipated until after the Christmas holidays.Pacifism here, is spreading, and if, as is probable, the I.W.G.B. and the C.W.C. join forces, there will be a very powerful organisation with which to deal. It is again suggested that a strong counter-propaganda should be instituted by the War Aims Committee.IV. Disputes.(a.) Involving a storage of work.The serious strike at Coventry, which involved some 50,000 workers, was settled on Sunday, and a resumption of work occurred on Tuesday.The affair received a considerable amount of attention from the press, in which accounts of a more or less alarmist nature appeared. There is accordingly no need for any length)&apos; description, though it should be noted that the settlement is in the nature of an armistice
pending the general settlement on the shop stewards&apos; question. Some of the men&apos;s leaders are claiming that the temporary settlement &quot;actually, acknowledges the position pi the shop stewards, and leaves.only matters- of detail to be,decided;: it may. he noted that the shop stewards signed the agreement. It is obvious that a further outbreak of trouble, is; likely to occur unless some definite ruling is shortly obtained. &apos;&quot;&quot;  &apos;   &apos;&apos;The men appear to have been indignant at the reflections cast ontheir -patriotism in certain papers, and the hints that their leaders had, been: seduced by German gold which appeared in others. Much discussion occurred as to the nationality of Mr. Poppe, of Messrs. White and Poppe, where &quot;the strike originated, and it was also feared that an alleged enemy alien named Krool, working at the Triumph Works, might suffer personal violence.A considerable amount of sympathy with the men at Coventry was evidenced in other parts of the country. At the Austin and Woiseley Works, Birmingham, a proposal to strike immediately was narrowdy defeated on the 29th, and on Sunday last the men at Birmingham held a mass meeting, at which they decided to give the Government two days, to meet their demands on the shop steward question, failing which they would come out. In view of the fact that Coventry has returned, it is thought improbable that the threat will mature.Partly as a result of the excitement caused by the Coventry affair, a serious strike of sheet metal workers at Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton, and less important areas has occurred.The dispute arose out of a settlement of the wages question effected on the 30th October. The men have gone behind the undertaking of their leaders in demanding that the agreement shall apply to &quot; prices fixed since outbreak.&quot; Failing to obtain their point, a number of men downed tools on the 29th; on the succeeding day the sheet metal workers at Wolverhampton came out, and the numbers of men idle at Birmingham and Coventry-increased considerably. About 6,000 men are affected, but now that the larger strike at Coventry has come to an end it will probably not be long before&apos; this matter also is settled.No settlement seems to have been reached in the wages dispute, which involved a strike of boatmen and others working on the Manchester Ship Canal. Some of the men have returned to work.At Liverpool a significant strike of several hundred dockers occurred, owing to the employment of one of the battalions of &quot; khaki dockers &quot; on work on which they were engaged. The men eventually resumed on the understanding that the khaki dockers should be withdrawn from that particular work.The Shipyard Labour Department has nine new cases of strike to report.Perhaps the most important of these is that involving between 200 and 300 boiler-makers employed by the liumber Graving Dock Co. at Grimsby. The trouble arises partly out of a wages dispute and partly out of the penalising of certain men for bad timekeeping. At the end of three days a settlement was affected. There was also a serious strike of electricians at Messrs. Harland and Wolff, Liverpool, over a question of demarcation.Only one of the five cases of stoppage reported by the Coal Controller has occurred during the week, and of the total four have now been settled.The protracted strike at the Sutton Colliery (Nottingham) came to an end on Monday last, on the understanding that none but union labour shall be employed during the war.A short strike, involving about 1,000 men, occurred at Pontypridd over a question arising out of the minimum wage.The War Office Contracts Department has. six cases of stoppage to report.The strike of juvenile workers at Dundee against the age discrimination made in a recent award has come to an end. The strike was badly organised and never became general, though work at six factories was stopped.The strike of some 500 textile mechanics over the question of their inclusion in&apos;the 12  per cent, award has now come to an end, their application having been granted.In addition to the two strikes in the Midlands already described the Ministry of Munitions reports three other cases of stoppage, all of which have been settled.The&apos; most important of these is that at Messrs. Beard-more&apos;.?, East Hope Street, Glasgoiv, which was referred to in last week&apos;s Report. The women returned to work on the 28th November, and thus an affair which at one time threatened to bring about a general stoppage on the Clyde was, for the present, closed. The various points in dispute have been referred by the Ministry of Munitions for arbitration.The craftsmen on the Furness Railway, who had threatened to down tools on Friday last, did not as a matter of fact come out until Monday.The dispute arose over the question of district rates, and the&apos;men assert that they are striking as engineers, and not as railwaymen. They hope in this way to bring out the men at Messrs. Vickers in sympathy.A strike of some 2,000 shopmen occurred on the Tali Vale and Cardiff Railways on Monday. The men complained that they had been excluded from the extra Is. granted to railwaymen by the War Cabinet. It is reported that the case has been referred to the Committee on Production, and that the men have now returned to work.
(b.)&quot;Notinvolving a stoppage of work.The advance of 6s. to railwaymen offered by the War Cabinet has been generally accepted with satisfaction, though there have been protests in some parts of the country.There is, however, a great deal of unrest among the men employed in the railway workshops. In addition to the strikes already referred to, the probability of further stop-pages at Swindon, Wolverton, and Norwich is reported, while there is also considerable unrest at Crewe.   The Eastleigh dispute has not yet been settled.The number of controversial cases reported by the Shipyard Labour Department has increased by 14 to 205.The Clyde, as- usual, is responsible for roughly half the total number. The Mersey area, where there are 80 cases, appears also to be restless. Settlements have been effected in 54 cases out of the total number.The dispute over the rivetters&apos; price-list on the Clyde has not yet been settled, but the Committee on Production is dealing with the whole question this week, and it is hoped that no strike will occur before their decision is made known. The dispute over Sir Bichard Lodge&apos;s award to the plumbers in the Clyde area has not yet been settled, but negotiations are still in progress.Two new cases of dispute are reported by the Coal Controller, making 14 in all. No settlements in outstanding cases have occurred.Craftsmen employed in two large colliery workshops in Scotland are endeavouring to obtain the advances granted to munition workers. Their demands are, however, being refused, lest an important precedent should be- established.No settlement appears as yet to have been effected in the dispute as to whether Scottish shale miners should receive the recent Is. 6d. advance to coal miners. The point is still under arbitration, and it is hoped that no stoppage will meanwhile occur.On the whole, and probably owing to the recent substantial increase of wages, the mining industry is in a more settled condition than it recently has been.The War Office Contracts Department, whose report refers to four cases of dispute, reveals a serious situation both in the cotton and the woollen industry.In the former industry no settlement has been reached in respect of the demands for increased wages which have been put forward by the spinners and the weavers. The Executive of the Operative Cotton Spinners&apos; Amalgamation, after an abortive conference held on the 30th November with the employers, have instructed their members to hand in a week&apos;s notice. A conference, comprising all sections of the industry on both sides, is io be held this week under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Cotton Control Board.In the Yorkshire clothing industry a strike of members of the United Garment Workers&apos; Union was narrowly averted. The masters were refusing to pay according to the recent award of the Committee on Production until they had obtained an undertaking that they might be allowed to increase their contract prices. This case, which has now been settled, is a good illustration of the direct effect of increases in wages on contract prices.The Ministry of Munitions has twelve cases of dispute to report, two of which have been settled.The majority of these cases have arisen out of wages claims, but recognition of union, the 12  per cent, advance, Sunday labour, and dilution also appear as causes.The case of recognition which arose at Messrs. Walter Evans and Co., Derby, is an excellent example of reactionary policy. The Workers&apos; Union handed in notices for certain of their members employed by the firm, whereupon the firm gave notice to all members of the union in their employ, and intimated that all men in their employ &quot; must sever with nil trade unions &quot; on pain of dismissal.The Committee on Production during the past week heard 16 arbitration cases  11 in London and 5 at Newcastle. Most of the Newcastle cases were in connection with rates on standard ships in the North Eastern district, where the subject has been causing a considerable amount of friction. &apos;D. J.
