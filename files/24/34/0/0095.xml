(This Document is 11iColonel Jonesx        His Britannic rV?aiesty&apos;s Gove?t;** Circulated to V-ar Cabinet in connection with TT.C. 292/7.0PRRAT10HSSECRET.From:--F.K.C-in-C., G.IU0,., France. To:-     C.I.G.S., Rar Office.Handed in 8.20 p,m. 6,12.17. Received 11.30 o.m. 6.12.17.O.A.D. 724.   -Reference your 47259 of 5th.I am not yet in a position to render a complete report as it is inadvisable to distract the attention of army and other II.Q. still urgently engaged in dealing with the situation by calling for full reports,The main incidents are however fairly clear. Fnemy&apos;s main attack was on Bourlon front with. seven-Divisions.   This failed completely with very heavy loss. The attack on liarcoing area was made with three Divisions.     This also failed with heavy loss.   Attack on Oonnelieu area was made with two divisions plus one regiment.     On this&apos; front our positions were fortified and wired and as the possibility of attack here had been foreseen ample artillery was in position to deal with it if made.     Although this front was thinly held by infantry the garrison was in view of the above considered sufficient.     Special precautions had been taken by Corps and Divisional Commanders during personal inspection on previous day to strengthen strong points in rear of front line and to ensure vigilance of troops owing to symptoms of- attack having been observed.   In spite of these precautions enemy succeeded in over-running our outposts which failed to give warning to the artillery and other troops in rear with the result that these were surprised. Cause of the-failure of the outposts to give warning will be investigated.    On the front of the hostile main attacks which had been repulsed the defences were necessarily only such as could be constructed in a short time on an active battle front.   While therefore remarks of both correspondents mentioned by you are substantially correct, it must be clearly understood that censorship does not imply responsibility for correctness of correspondentcv statements.     As regards morale, the success of the Germans at one point on the battlefield, due apparently to an unexpected, fad lure of our outposts, does not, in my opinion, establish a marked improvement in their morale. But however that may be, it must be remembered that morale and fighting efficiency of an army in the field are much affected by the strength of the units, and recent events in Russia and Italy resulting in a revival of German hopes and in reinforcements In drafts and fresh units to the enemy on the western front cannot fail to have a bene-  . ficial effect upon his morale.Estimated missing to date including casualties unrecorded nine to ten thousand.   Guns missing and unrecovered about 150.
