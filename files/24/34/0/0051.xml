(This Document is the Property of 9mM*His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government;OBSERVATIONS BY THE MINIS^H * SIR ALFRED MONDT 3 MEM0RA1DUM G-.T. 2609&apos;,of November 13th.&quot;WAGES AND PRICES&quot; .Ministry of Lob our 3.12.17.
I should like to offer the following obervations on Sir Alfred ? memorandum G.T. ? of November 13th.

1. The objection raised in paragraph (1) of his memorandum is not relevant to the general run of cases contemplated in my memorandum on Wages and Prices. It is only valid with reference to the special case of businesses which were not making normal profits for some time before the War because they were in process of development. It is generally admitted that these are hard cases, but hard cases make notoriously bad law, and it would be fallacious to base on them any general conclusions to whether it is good or bad policy to increase the excess profits tax. The right method would appear to be to devise some special treatment for businesses in this exceptional position rather than to condemn the excess profits tax altogether because its incidence is more severe in some cases than in others.

2. Sir Alfred ? objects to an increase in the rate of excess profits duty on the ground that it would cause a relaxation in the productive efforts of businessmen. I cannot believe that he would seriously maintain that business men are not prepared to do their best in the interests of the country at this crisis unless they have

the inducement of profits 20% in excess of what they ? before the War. I would point out however, that a very considerable proportion of the profits which would be further reduced are really profits which would be further reduced are really profits accruing to the shareholders in joint stock companies and not to private enterprises, and that in so far as this is the case the objection has no relevance, since the shareholders are not required to exert any productive efforts.

3. Sir Alfred Mon? further objects that the exaction of the higher excess profits duty now will handicap business men after the War as compared with their rivals in other countries, because they will not have security to offer for loans - security which would have been available for them if they had retained their profits and invested them in war loans. In effect, he suggests that the Government should borrow excess profits instead of taking them, and his argument implies that it is to the interest of the community as a whole to give war loan stock to business men, because otherwise, as it is alleged, they will not be able to carry on business. In this connection he refers to Sir Algerton Firth&apos;s letter in "The Times" of the 12th instant, but I notice that Sir Algernon suggests an alternative which was put forward in my memorandum on Wages and Prices. He says "It would be impossible for a British manufacturer to compete with them (business men in the United States and Germany) if his working capital is taken either in the form of excess profits or of conscription of wealth. If the State takes the capital now, it will have to provide other capital later on, or our industries will be compelled to limit their operations very largely, and the business and employment will go to the foreigner." &apos;It is evident that the same result would be achieved at a smaller cost to the community, if instead of excess profits being invested in war loan (and at present there is no guarantee whatever that they shall be used in this way) arrangements were made to ensure that after the War businesses which can show that they are in a position, to make good use of capital shall be able to borrow it, if necessary, on terms guaranteed by the State without the deposit of full collateral security.

If Sir Alfred Mond is recommending more borrowing and less taxing, the above seems a sufficient answer to his contention, and it is obvious that any such proposal should be rejected not merely for the reasons given above, but in wider grounds. If, however, he is recommending more taxation in other ways to make up for the / borrowings.
