tp   n  t.1  &quot;H1  rn \j   li   ^   1 *Italy of 15th November, 1917.No. 1524.96TO THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF.WAR OFFICE.I forward herewith a report with diary from Brig-General P.D. Hamilton., C.M.G.., R.A., Commanding the British Artillery in Italy, on the subject of the retirement with the Italian Illrd Army of the batteries under his command.I would add that I consider General Hamilton1s report to be very moderate and to represent the situation very well.I w$uld also add that I consider the bringing away in safety of all the British howitzers and of almost all the personnel to be very creditable indeed to General Hamilton and to the officers and men under his command.The loss of the stores, machinery and ammunition belonging to the British artillery was, under the circumstances, quite inevitable.I have had occasion to note that the cheerful and Steady behaviour of our men has made a considerable impression on the Italians and the example certainly has been beneficial.I am forwarding a further report dealing with the retirement.(Signed) C Delme Radcliffe.Brigadier-General.
secret.:jo.c/80*From:-General Officer Commanding, British Artillery, Italy.To    :-The Secretary,War Office,Londono    S.W.Sir,I have the honour to express my deep regret that owing to the very sudden withdrawal of the 3rd Italian Army on the night October 27th - 28th, a large quantity of stores, machinery and ammunition belonging to British Artillery Italy were lost.The following were brought away safely, 20 6&quot; Howitzers with batteries, 9.2M Experimental Howitzer, 2   Spare howitzers. NOTE.-     One howitzer is damaged and will probably have to be sent to the base in France,Actual orders as to the move were received on the 27th.(Diary attached).The position generally was, (l)   The 3rd Army had to retire owing to the danger of being cut off, but the gravity of the situation was not really-appreciated by the Italians.(2)    A sudden retreat of such magnitude had not been anticipated, in, any way, and no arrangements had been made to meet it.(3)    There was a great paucity of information generally, and an extreme lack of orders,Italy. 12th November 1917.
(4)     Transport was very scarce - a good deal was away transporting guns and assisting 2nd Army.It has been reported since that 112 tractors were lent to 2nd Army, and onry four have returned * (5)     No definite orders of any sort regarding retirement were given, and any orders issued afterwards were constantly changed.(6)      Promises of lorries and trains were made but the confusion was so great that nothing was arranged. (See diary). (7)     The sole idea seems to have been to get away as quickly as possible and no regard paid to stores, material etc. - If everybody had kept cool a good deal could have been done, but under the circumstances as they were it was impossible to do anything as regards transport.A sudden move of this sort and for such a distance must naturally be most demoralizing to the troops concerned.In regard to this the dumps began to go up at 6-30 p.m. and houses in various directions were burning at 7 p.m. -as far as I could judge this was a great mistake, (1) Austrians knew at once some move was on.    (2) It did not tend to help discipline in any way,(8)     No order was kept on the roads of any sort, and it was not until 30th that things began to mend in that direction.Everything was much retarded by number of refugees, most of them in carts drawn by oxen.The order in 3rd Army was much better than that in2nd.A bad panic occurred at Latisana on morning of 30th owing to a report of Austrian Cavalry, and order was not restored for some time.A number of aeroplanes bombed the road at intervals, and did a certain amount of damage but they always caused extreme confusion,The
9itish tillery.3.The cartridges at dumps and batteries were blown up and at 3 batteries shell were thrown into a river.Stores at Palmanova and workshop were destroyed(and burnt.Workshop for motor-bicycles and 27 motor-bicycles were saved.     This shop was light and was considered important to get away.I have made careful enquiries and consider it was impossible under the circumstances to save stores and ammunition.Casualties were as follows 3 died, 6 wounded. 1 missing.Five other men who frere evacuated in Italian hospitals have not yet been traced, but they can be taken as safe.The officers and men behaved very well and considering the very smaHamount of transport and the difficult positions the batteries were occupying, deserve great credit for getting all guns away safely.The British batteries were the last of the heavy batteries to go in their part of the line, and field guns were in action behind them before they left.I would drav/ special attention to the services of Lieut,-Colonel Charles Norman Buzzard, R.G.A., Major Cuthbert Frederick Page, t).S.O., R.G.A., and ah Italian officer Colonel Salvatore Gatto who commands 49th Raggruppamcnto Artiglieria Pesante Campale to which the British batteries are attached.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)    P.D. Hamilton.Brigadier-General, G.O.C, British Artillery, Italy.
R E T..24th.     Success of Austrian and German attack. (Tolmino region) 25th.     Warned by Brigadier General Delme-Radcliffe that an advance by the German-Austrian forces to Cividale would necessitate the withdrawal of 3rd Army.Headquarters 11th Corps were asked accordingly if it would not be better to shift back some ammunition, but an answer -was received that it was not necessary at the time, and full arrangements would be made later.I was informed that the 3rd Army would have 3 days notice of a withdrawal, and that nothing regarding this was to be circulated, as it might create a feeling of unrest.The Italian line was a good one and consideredsafe.26th.     Reports of fresh German Divisions.11th Corps and 3rd Army Headquarters again asked about transport, and the question of stores and ammunition at Palmanova.The necessity of trains pointed out and stress was laid upon the fact of our having inadequate provision of lorries for a retreat.     No definite answers were obtained but I  vas assured that everything would be arranged at Palmanova if the situation required it. 27th.and later.I was informed by Brigadier General Delme-Radcliffe that the situation was serious.About noon batteries were warned by 11th Corps to start to pull out as soon as tractors arrived, but were to continue to fire up to the last moment with any guns available,An officer was sent to 3rd Army Headquarters to get &apos; some definite instructions and returned about 1-15 p.m.wi thDIARY.
with a message asking If our Headquarters could be readyto move off by train the next evening 28th.   An answer In theaffirmative sent.At 3 p.m. again an officer was sent to 3rd Army Headquarters and returned with the order for our Headquarters to move that night to Treviso.Batteries started to pull out at 4 p.m. at which time transport commenced to arrive, (some of the guns were firing at 7-30 p.m.) and all had passed the Isonzo and were through Gradisca by 2 a.m, 28th.The Batteries had orders to park at Villa Viola outside Gradisca so that transport could be used again, buttas that would certainly have meant the loss of some of the guns, I got the order cancelled, and batteries wereordered to go straight to Palrnanova.Batteries proceeded to Palmanova and there received orders to proceed to Latisana - all the guns were across the Tagliamento river at that place by 3 p.m. on the 30th.At Latisana orders were received to proceed to Porto Guaro and then Treviso.At Porto Guaro 11 6&quot; Howitzers proceeded by train reaching Treviso 2 a.m. November 1st having been delayed on the line.9 6&quot; Howitzers and one 9.2 Howitzer proceeded by road,6&quot; Howitzers reaching Treviso morning of 31st.9,2 Howitzer reaching Treviso midnight 31st.Prom the night of 27th it rained constantly and very little food was obtainable, and the personnel had to march (with occasional lifts) under very trying circumstances.. The men wore unable to carry their kits the whole distance and much was lost.   Room had to be made in the few lorries available for those who were sick or absolutely exhausted.It might also be noted that batteries had been in action before this for 4 days and nights running.Transport
Transport available:-7 tractors.Up to 8 p.m. 27th., 15 lorries; three of these were commandeered or got lost so that only 12 were available for the rest of retirement.(This does not include 5 lorries used by hospitalfrom Versa to Palmanova).Two lorries were lost, one burnt at Palmanova through a petrol store getting on fire, and another was ditched badly and had to be abandoned.The 2 spare 6&quot; B.L. Howitzers were first taken to Strasoldo by order to entrain, but on reaching there no trucks were found to be available; two lorries were fortunately commandeered and the howitzers reached Treviso via Latisana on October 31st at 9 p.m.Personnel belonging to Headquarters, A.S.C, A.O.C., and general details were ordered to proceed to Strasoldo to entrain.     They reached there at 11 p,m, -no train was ready, but finally one was procured and the party left for Treviso at 7 a.m. 28th, reaching the destination at 9-30 a.m. on November 1st.The R,A.M.C, personnel and sick left Versa at 9-30 p,m. in 8 ambulances and 5 lorries and proceeded to Palmanova by arrangement to meet a train.   On arriving at Palmanova at 1 a.m. the men were put in sheds, as it was found that no train had been arranged for.     A delayed message then arrived to say party was to go to St C-iorgio -the 8 ambulances were still available but the Italian lorries had disappeared.     Accordingly 63 sick in ambulances were sent to St Giorgio, and attempts were made to obtain transport for the remainder - 23 convalescents and R.A.M.C. detail.At
At St Giorgio everything was in confusion and no hospital trains were running.It was decided to go on to Latisana - on reaching this place the same state of affairs existed, so the ambulances proceeded to Porto Guaro arriving there 10-30 p.m,A hospital train was luckily found ready to depart and the sick arrived safely at Turin on November 5th,The reason of the long journey was that the sick had to go into an Italian Hospital at Ravenna for 3 days quarantine before proceeding out of the War Zone,Nurses were sent away by train from St Giorgio on afternoon of 27th and arrived Turin on October 31sttThe party R.A.M.C. and 23 convalescents at Palmanova not being able to procure transport marched via Goidroipo and eventually got a train to San Vito arriving Treviso 5 p.m. November 1st,
