His Britannic Maje?ty&apos;s Government.)(This Document is the Property of451SECRET.Intelligence Bureau.Department of Information. DRW/018.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. XVIII.During the past month the situation in Rumania has become more critical even than could have been anticipated.     It is clear to the whole world that at present Rumania is in an almost isolated position, cut off from her Western Allies by the territories under the control of the various Governments of.the moment in Russia.    As to the attitude of these, there is a consensus of opinion, Rumanian and otherwise, that General Kaledin&apos;e Cossack administration is friendly to co-operation with Rumania. But this in itself is not enough, as .t* the North of Rumania and Bessarabia stretches the Ukraine, and the attitude of the temporary administration there is ambigutus, though certainly not unfriendly.   Obviously, both the Cossack and Ukrainian provisional administrations will determine their subsequent attitude after observation of the results of the policy pursued by the Maximalist (government in Petrograd.     Rumania&apos;s fate must be Intimately connected with that of her two neighbours, the Cossacks and Ukrainians.    This fact is realised by every Rumanian, and the view is put forward that even in the event of the improbable happening, that is to say, a real peace concluded between Petrograd and Berlin, it would be possible for Rumania to continue in the war in alliance with Southern Russia.     General Iliescu goes so far as to put forward the perhaps fantastic idea that contact might be established with the British troops In Mesopotamia through the medium of the Black Sea Fleet.   Unfortunately the attitude of the Black Sea Fleet is more than doubtful.   There is no recent
information to hand as to the attitude of the Russian troops in Rumania, and this might undoubtedly be a difficulty in the event of a peace with Germany being concluded by Petrograd.     According to telegraphic reports fraternisation has not been successful on the Rumanian front, but it is doubtful if the many hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers in Rumania can be relied on, indefinitely.The Food Question.The food question remains a very serious one, though recently a certain amount has been imported from Russia.   Fortunately, the Ukrainian and Cossack country is better supplied than the rest of Russia, and it may be possible for Rumania to rely on regular supplies from there.   One of the difficulties is, of course, transport.     The Rumanian press continues to urge that transport arrangements in Southern Russia should be Improved.     The papers are full of discussions of the food question.   Every day a certain amount of fresh and salted fish arrives in Iasi.     The American Mission to Rumania has also made great efforts to secure supplies, for which Rumanian newspapers express their cordial thanks. Large stores of grain and other necessary commodities have been asked for from America,  and the Rumanian population is encouraged to hope    for their speedy arrival.German and Bulgarian Atrocities.Rumanian papers have been moved to great Indignation by the amount of Bulgarian propaganda literature sent out as to alleged atrocities committed by the Rumanian troops before their withdrawal-from Dobrogea in the autumn of 1916,     They declare In reply that the boot is on the other foot, that it is the Bulgarians who have
53perpetrated the most Infamous atrocities on the Rumanian population. Such a question is, of course, difficult to determine impartially without very full documents carefully investigated;   hut in view of the now proved atrocities, deportations, massacres, confiscations of property, and policy of starvation conducted by the Bulgarians in their occupied provinces of Serbia and Greek Macedonia;   in view also of the fact that the Bulgarians for a year pa st have been interesting themselves in proving the &quot;purely Bulgarian&quot; character of Dobrogea and, as in the case of the Morava Valley, removing such elements of the population as would be a standing disproof of this plea, the Rumanian contention has probably a great deal of justification.   Further, the well-known Rumanian novelist Mihail Sadoveanu points out that the Germans, when exercising pressure on the Rumanians, use the formula:    &quot;If Rumania does not agree to this, civilian prisoners will be put under the Bulgarians&quot;. And yet it is no secret to the Rumanians that both civil and military Rumanian prisoners in Germany have been abominably treated, and some vtimo ago, as was pointed out In a previous Report, at least 20,000 of them were reported to have died in German prison camps.The same system of confiscation of all property and goods in occupied Rumania goes on under German rule, and the Rumanians found ocular proof of this in the small corner of Moldavian territory vhich they re-occupied after their July offensive, where the whole live-stock of the country had been removed and the population left to fend for itself.   According to reports of escaped Rumanian officers the German administration in Wallachia is exceedingly severe.   While a regular though small amount of food, 250 grams of bread per day, is allowed to the town population, practically no consideration is paid to the agricultural population except in so far as their labour is required.     According
454to the reports of the German press nearly all the oil wells have been restarted and practically the normal output has been reached. Grain has been exported to Germany aid Austria-Hungary on a large scale.Rumanians in Russia.Early in October another detachment of Transilvanian prisoners in Russia, numbering about 1,000 men, arrived in Iasi to join the Rumanian army.   Repeated representations were made to the Russian Provisional Government to allow all those Rumanian prisoners who desired to do so to return to Rumania to fight in the Rumanian army.    On account of the scarcity of labour the Russian authorities were unwilling to do this, but they allowed the Rumanian authorities, through the medium of specially constituted societies, to work among these prisoners and look after their welfare.In striking contrast to the attitude of these Transilvanian . volunteers is that of the group of extreme International Socialists led by Rakovski, Bujor and Primu, who carry on the newspaper Lupta in Odessa,     These people are frankly Maximalist and spend most of their time in demanding an immediate peace in order to begin the struggle nearest to their hearts, the overthrow of the Rumanian Government, whose reforms they denounce as quite insincere and whose policy they declare is chauvinistic.   Their close co-operation with Maximalist circles in Petrograd will naturally make the present Leninite administration still more opposed to the Rumanian Government and Rumanian national aspirations.Rumania&apos;s International -position.The publication by the Maximalists in Petrograd of the Rumanian Treaty (the rough outline of which was given in the Dyen of May 14/27 last and discussed in Report No. X of this series) will before long
455again bring up Rumanian national aspirations as a subjeet of discussion for the European public.   The old Russian Governments complicity in the defeat of Rumania is once again suggested by the publication of the message of General Polivanov,  then Minister of far, on November 7, declaring that &quot;the collapse of Greater Rumania is an idea not against the interests of Russia&quot;, and &quot;the present condition of Rumania must be used to strengthen those ties by which she is ccmpulsorily bound to us&quot; (Manchester Guardian, November 28).In the Rech (October 7/20) Professor Bazilescu frankly exposes Rumania1s grievances against the Sturmer Government and the Allies for allowing it a free hand0     On the other hand, there seems no ground whatsoever for the rumours once again being put about by the German press, as they were some months ago, that the Rumanian Government has made overtures for a separate peace. It is unfortunate that these rumours appear to be credited by a section of the English press.   They were recently emphatically denied in public by the French Minister, the Comte de St. Aulaire. The American Minister Mr Vopicka has also made several announcements applauding Rumanian endurance and assuring Rumanians of America1a belief that she will come out of this war freer and stronger than before and in possession of a liberated Transilvania.       The Rumanian press is full of gratitude for the work done and the sympathy shown to Rumania by the American Mission, which has been there during the past few months.   President Wilson1 s recent message to the King of Rumania will, of course, be viewed in the same light.   The importance of such expressions of sympathy need not be minimised.     The Rumanian press showed great satisfaction with the sympathetic articles written in the British press about Rumania on the occasion of the anniversary of her intervention
456k:, &apos;i .  6.in the war, a very great number of which have recently been quoted in the Rumanian papers. The same satisfaction will undoubtedly be expressed with the announcement of the public-^Inauguration of the Anglo-Rumanian Society at the Mansion House to-day (December 7), and that a member of the War Cabinet, Sir Edward Carson, will be present and will speak.7.12.17.
