^This Document is the- Property^ ESP-??&apos; &quot;j^sTIian^^ Government)MIHI3TRY OP MinOIU&amp;:p3Z7IQ.l *lVi) CONTROL O^J^OUB.Joint Ilemorandum by the Minis tor of &quot;-ttnitions anil the Ilinister of national vierviee.;7e have carefully considered the Memoranda &amp;.1*2627 and. Cr.i&apos;,2697, the first submitted by Sir Lynden Liaeassey, and the second by the bhipbuilding Employers1 Federation, the Shipyard. Trades Unions standing Joint Committee, and the toiler &quot;xiers1 oooiety.The latter propose that on all matters connected with the doi^and and supply of labour in shipyards, the Ministry of National Service should have full and sole control. It is justly pointed out later in this memorandum that such a proposal cannot be confined to the shipyard industry, but would necessarily have to bo extended to other industries under the control of Government departments.The general principles underlying this memorandum arc the sane as those upon which the ..&apos;ar Cabinet based the functions of the &quot;inistry oi -National Servioe, It is -the function of that lanistry to review the man power of the country; to advise the War Cabinet&apos; on questions of man power; and, subject to the directions of the V7ar Cabinet, to allocate nan power to meet the needs of the Armed Forces, and the industrial demands of Government Departments; to ensure that such Departments are using their labour to the best advantage; and to secure the economical apportionment of labour, both such as can be made available by internal adjustments within the Departments themselves, and such as oan be obtained from external sources, in such a way as to maintain the output of the most essential industries and the efficiency of essential public services.There is no difference as to the object which all parties are seeking to attain, the question is how this object can be attained most expeditiously, without unnecessary duplication of machinery, and in such a way as to secure the most cordial
co-operation of employers and workmen.

It is suggested in the Shipbuilders&apos; memorandum that in order to vest in the Ministry of National Service the necessary power of review and general supervision and co-ordination, it will be necessary to transfer to the Ministry of National Service complete control of labour supply and demand. Such a transfer would we think necessarily involve the transfer of responsibility for dilution from the Government Departments concerned to the Ministry of national Service. i.e., the actual arrangement of dilution in each particular case. ? do not think  ? is possible to separate dilution from supply. The most effective, way of securing dilution is to say to a firm : "Unless you diluto, you shall not have contracts". Only the supply branches can do that. Only the supply branches can estimate the effect of dilution upon output. Further, such a transfer would lead to duplication of machinery because it would be necessary to attach something in the nature of a Labour Branch to the supply branches of Government Departments.

We are satisfied that the general purpose can be attained without so drastic and hazardous a change by strengthening the Labour Supply Department of the Ministry of National Service and the National Labour Priority Committee in the following manner:-

(a) Duplicat? of all Dilution Reports should be sent direct to the Ministry of national Service.

(b) A small skilled staff should be attached to the Ministry of National Service, selected from the existing dilution staffs of other Government Departments. Such a Staff would be in a Position, by reason of their expert knowledge and previous experience, to review the Dilution Reports and, in special cases where necessary, to make independent investigations and inspections.

This proposal would we think give the Ministry of National Service the necessary power of review and control without loading it with a mass of detailed administration, which would necessitate a very large increase of staff, and a duplication of staff in the Supply Branches of other Departments.

Whenever a demand was put forward in respect of a particular firm, the expert staff would review the Dilution Report, if one
existed; or if the firm had not been diluted, would immediately make investigations as to why dilution had not been undertaken, and how far dilution was possible. The Ministry of National Service would thus be able to satisfy itself that Government Departments are carrying out all possible internal adjustments, and the fullest extent of dilution practically possible; and the Ministry would be able to review the activities of Government Departments not only when they are applicants for further reinforcements of labour, but also generally, so as to see whether a Department is failing to bring into the common pool labour which should be made available if the necessary internal adjustments and dilution were carried out.

The Ministry of Munitions are prepared to assist the Ministry of National Service by supplying part of the expert staff; and we have no doubt that the Admiralty will be willing in the general interest to adopt a similar course.

We think that the foregoing considerations dispose of the proposal that the administration of War Munitions Volunteers should be transferred to the Ministry of National Service. So far as such Volunteers are employed on Ministry of Munitions work, no useful purpose would be served by a transfer. The Ministry of Munitions are able to arrange a large amount of internal adjustment by shifting War Munitions Volunteers from firms with less urgent contracts to firms with more urgent contracts, and they alone have sufficient detailed knowledge of each particular firm to do this effectively. The Minister of National Service is satisfied that the Ministry of Munitions are carrying out those adjustments in a satisfactory manner, as is proved by the large number of transfers which have been made internally to aircraft construction.

It would be difficult, if not impossible, to transfer the administration of the minority of War Munitions Volunteers employed on Admiralty work and even if it were possible, we do not think that it would be expedient. The internal adjustments can best be Performed by the Admiralty; and so far as War Munitions Volunteers
become available for the common pool of labour they are disposed of under the instructions issued by the National Labour Priority Committee, upon which all the Departments interested in labour are represented, whether they come from the Ministry of Munitions or the Admiralty.

Further, when the Ministry of National Service has been strengthened by the addition of an export staff to review the Dilution Reports, and to make independent investigations, that Ministry will be in a position to decide whether larger numbers of War Munitions Volunteers now employed on Ministry of Munitions or Admiralty work can be brought into the common pool, and will thus be able effectively to exercise that measure of control which Sir Lynden Macassey and the other writers desire.  Disputed cases would be referred to the National Labour Priority Committee as provided for in the agreements between the Ministry of National Service and other Government Departments.

The fact that War Work Volunteers are enrolled and administered by the Minister of National Service does not afford either a logical or a direct reason for transferring the administration of War Munitions Volunteers.    War Work Volunteers are enrolled for work of national importance for any Government Department; they are a new creation enrolled to meet specific demands as and when the need arises, and it is obviously convenient that their administration should be under the control of a single Department, and that that Department should be the Ministry of National Service, which has enrolled and allocated them to specific demands, and which will, on the conclusion of such work, again endeavour to secure the allocation of their services.
