5 9.2898.STIPPLY OF MILK FOB YOm^Mn^ JgLia^M-Notes by the Chairman of tho Committee on tho Production &apos; and Distribution of Milk, on the Memcremdum of one Food Controller. -of children, the views expressed at their meetings, ana tne^con-elusions arrived at, may Do of assistance to tho War Cabmou m considering the proposals now put forward.1.    Although local shortages, especially of a romodiablo (i.o. of a temporary) character are probable,, nothing in tho nature of a ne/oional milk famine is likely to occur this (1917-18) winter provided : (a) tho Ministry of Food exorcises its powers and prevents Local Food Control Committees lowering tho retail price of milk to an treasonable extent&quot; (b) concentrated feeding stuffs are properly distributed; and (c) no now circumstances arise to projudico the supply,-2.    Children have never had enough milk, but there are obvious risks in attempting to increase largely their consumption of this article during the stringency of War, except in&apos;selected cases of &quot;necessity&quot;, whether financial or medical.If, as is apparently suggested, an amount of milk wore llocatod throughout the country to mothers, infants and children n excess of the present and pa.s&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;  &apos; &quot;Largely in excess of the present and past consumption, a total change in the distribution of milk, involving its complete conunnecessary until&quot; tno^following autumn.locally cossery- - ___________ ... j_____________    - he situationin selected areas during the next few weeks when tho trouble, if there is to be any,will arise by other means then the sotting up of a complicated system of tickets and rationing in these areas only.4.    Tho existing&apos;shortago, such as it is. is largely due to the uncertainty of farmers during the past (1916-17) winter as to their future prospects end the prices they would obtain. Tho total present- (1917-18) winter milk yield is likely to increase in February next (possibly oven in January), and the shortage should disappear by April.   Tho rationing of milk with its elaborate machinery ana irritation would bo difficult to justify during the 1918 spring and summer flush,5. A serious
5.   A serious shortage of milk may he anticipated for the winter 1918-19, unless dairy farmers are,,at an early date, assured a fair profit for that period.   If this were done^ it would be practicable to lower materially the price of milk for next summer to the whole community.6.   It is possible that the whole distribution of milk may have to be controlled during next autumn and the winter 1918-19.   The Committee are considering what machinery is necessary to effect this.7.   The supply of milk in the past has not kept pace with the growth cf the population.   It is in the national interest that our total milk production should be largely increased after the war,    In order to obtain this,  farmers must get a fair profit on dairying to compensate them for the greater trouble connected with milk production as compared with meat and cereal production.   Unless the public are prepared &quot;to pay a fair price after the war,  the milk will not be produced. In the past,  the idea was all too prevalent that milk was a white liquid which must be sold at 4d. and never at a higher price, however much the prices of other articles might fluc-tuate.    If the consumers are now confirmed in this opinion by the action of &quot;he Pood Controller in reducing the price to 4d., particularly if this is done during a period cf high wages,  it will be difficult to make the public pay such a price for milk after the war,  as its nutritive value compared to other foods warrants,  and such as will encourage its increased production,8.    The Committee would, however, unanimously support any proposal to supply cheap,   or if need be,  free milk to necessitous children.   They believe that this could be done by la) empowering the Sanitary Authorities to give or srell at reduced prices milk to necessitous children under school age,  the necessary grants being made partly&quot;out of Exchequer grants, and partly out of local rates, and (b) by the more general feeding of children of school age under the Provision of Meal3 Act if - and where, this- was&apos; -necessary.   It may become necessary to make the applfcation of this Act compulsory.9.    They have urged that nothing should be done to dis-courage breast feeding,  which is more beneficial to infants than cheap milk,.  They had before them on this point not only the views of the Royal Society, but ?;ere already aware of the fact that,  in order to maintain the flow of human milk, generally speaking,  other foods .than milk were more useful for pregnant and nursing women.    In their opinion,  it is consequently inadvisable to increase such shortage of milk as exists by earmarking;   except by doctors&apos;, orders,  any quantity for maternity cases.    They would welcome the pro-vision of other foods than milk to expectant and nursing women who are necessitous.(Signed)    WALDORF ASTOR.r 7th, 1917.
