Colonel Jones     / J &apos; ,^DOCOME]^ HIS BRIMtHIG.)12SJBQREIG.T.-2803 Hote by 3ir Edward Carson covering aMemorandum forwarded by the Director of Information, comparing conditions of living in Franco and England,   _I think it right to circulate for the information of my colleagues, the following letter and memorandum which has been received by the Director of Information from Mr,W,A.Gill - a Fellow of Oriel and a man of considerable intellectual ability and sound judgment.   He has a wide knowledge of the French people.- (Sgd.) EDV/AKD CAESOil.2,Whitehall Gardens, 8.W./1 29th Hov.,1917My dear Chief,I have been travelling about a little on my v&amp;y down to Cornwall and comparing our conditions with what I saw in France, and when I read of further vexations and restrictions being imposed on our people for the sake of the French - in part -facit indignatio memorandum.    We know the sex of France, and as the American philosopher said:   &quot;Every woman is a bluff.     The question is, can you call her?&quot;Yours sincerely,(3gd,) Y7.A.GILL.French &quot;Facons de parler&quot;The weak politicians who suoceed one.another in the French Government all adopt the: scheme of trying to avoid unpopularity by sparing their own people tfte burdens of the War at the expense of our people.Any estimate of JPreneh sufferings through the War presentedto us by French politicians is unreliable,(1) Finance, ..... r^&quot;hile v/g have been taxing our people heavily and lending largely to France, - facts almost unknown over there - the JFrench have had very little taxation imposed .pn- them*&apos; : :Oii the&apos; contrary, they have heardod vast sums,(s) Man-power._travelling in the French provinces this year, I was struck by the large number of men - very large compared with what one sees in England - who had been in the Army for short periods and then left it.     Some of these had been invalided out, but many had never seen a shot fired.     In some towns one was tempted to say;   &quot;Truly, many are called to the colours, but few kept there,&quot;The number of men still wearing uniform, but engaged in work done in England by civilians. was also remarkable.Truthful statistics of the French Army is-these two respects might be interesting.
-2-(3) good,If we are to &quot;pool&quot; food with the French on a fair basis, we &quot;ought, it might seem to a traveller, to receive large quantities from the South and South West of France.     The peDple of those parts are vastly better off than our own.     Just as this rural population is alibied to hoard money, so it is allowed to eat and drink in abundance by keeping its produce to its own cupboardsa     There need be no Shortage, ^compared with our own situation, in Paris and the Earth, if the   French Government compels the South to curtail itself a little, - in spite of the talk about nhad crops&quot;, etccAnother fact vcvy evident to the traveller is that even where the Trench Government exacts restrictions it docs not venture on anything so unpopular as the enforcing ox them.     This should be remembered when, for the sake of &quot;pooling&quot; - i0ea drawing supplies from us, the French Government undertakes to exact certain restrictionsQ     They will be a dead, letter compared with our own0. Scepticism and a brutal publication of facts and figures seem to be the only way of kicking the French politicians straight.The French are now inclined to sit back under a halo of &quot;sacrifice&quot;, which some of us encourage them to assume, and watch us bear the burdens,     A distinction might perhaps be drawn between &quot;losses&quot; and &quot;sacrifioosn*     At all events, itseems.allowable to ask how far past losses constitute present sacrifices.
