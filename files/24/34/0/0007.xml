Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.^/IWEEKLY REPORT ON SHIM. XIV. ^       (Nov. 29th, 1917)PSW/014.The situation in Spain remains obscure and unsatisfactory.     The little that is clear goes to confirm the view taken in the Report of Nov. 7th that the King&apos;s action in dismissing Benor Datcf wassuits are more likely to serve the interests of Germany than either those of Spain or the Allies.     Senor Dato is an honest man and a loyal servant of the King who responded to his call to take office at a very difficult moment.     Without showing any great qualities of statesmanship, or aopearing to have ready any permanent solution of his country&apos;s political problems, he had at least steered the ship through the very dangerous rocks of the Junta agitation, the Unofficial Parliament and the revolutionary strike, without actually running it on any of them;   and he may have shared the view, which is oommon in politics and by no means always proves mistaken, that a crisis adjourned is a crisis solved.     Unfortunately his method of dealing with his Various difficulties brought him into confliot with various important bodies:   the Germans hated him for his friendly attitude to the Allies:   the Extreme IT eft hated him for his firm repression of their strike, although in fact, it is to him that the Deputy Domingo owes his life;   the Regionalists beoause he would not permit their Unofficial Parliament to meet:   ahd^the Array Committees because, though very complacent to them, he would notcomply Xk all their demands.   The result was that the King thoughthe had no support anywhere and brought about the crisis which resultedin the formation of the present Government,possibUy brought about by German Influences at Court and that its re-with
Nobody thinks the new Cabinet will be long lived.     If real Con-stitutional reform is to be accomplished in Spain it is probably true that it can only be achieved by a Cabinet composed, as this is, of raen of various parties.     And that was the principle on which Senor Sanchez Toca and Senor Maura, who failed in their efforts to form Ministries, proceeded as well as the actual Prime Minister,    But the difficulty is that most of the leaders of the different parties are at present too much divided from each other, too content with the existing political system and too unaware of the need, to put aside their quarrels and co-operate heartily in the formation of a National Government.     Only Count Romanones was willing to serve under any Prime Minister if he could be of use.     Perhaps only actual war or revolution can provide the pressure needed to bring these oombina-tions into being.    Anyhow the present Cabinet, though it contains representatives of several different parties, neither contains re-presentatives of all, nor the leading personalities of any, except the Prime Minister.   No official Conservative is in it and no Re-formist or Republican, for Ventosa and Rodes, so far as they were connected with these parties, have been repudiated by them;   and the Maurists are not represented by Maura nor the Regionalists by Cambo; nor the moderate Liberals by Romanones.     The result is a Ministry which has the disadvantages of a combination of groups without the aufHority and prestige which belongs to the greatest political names of the country.   And the Prime Minister, (Alhuoemas), who is also Foreign Minister and has to hold the team together, has not the reputation of being a very strong man.The result of all this is that signs of disintegration are numerous . The Ministerial declaration declared that the Cabinet represented a temporary union and not a fusion:   it promised that the new Cortes should be elceted without any intervention on the part of the
Government, so that it should faithfully represent the will of the country and have an authority to deal with all the problems of social, economifc and political renovation.     But this vague language stops very far short of the demands for a Constituent Assembly made by the &apos;unofficial Parliament&apos; to which the Ministers Rodes and Ventosa belonged.     We have therefore the curious spectacle of their being allowed by the prime Minister to issue an additional declaration of their own, adhering to the Ministerial statement but declaring the t they still feel themselves free to support the drastic proposals of the unofficirl Parliament, and that they hope the new Cortes will exercise the functions of a QonstitufcirSMtai Cortes.    As these proposals included various limitations of the Monarchy, this is an extreme application of the liberty of Cabinet Ministers to ptoclairo unauthorised programmes.    Another sign of disintegration is the fact that Senor Alba, the most powerful member of the Prime Minister&apos;s party/ has definitely repudiated his leader-ship and is forming a group of his own, supported by Senor Burrell, who shares his pro-Germanism.     Another is the fact that in the Municipal elections which have just been held and in which the Government, true to the principles which it has proclaimed, abstained from intervention, the principal victories were won not by either of the official parties but by the Maurists of the Bight and still more by the Republicans of the Left.     The Monarchical parties retain a majority throughout the country but they have never been so threat-ened before.     Particularly at Madrid it is notable that the leaders in the late strike, who are now in prison, were electee1 by large majorities.     And very large meetings have since been held demanding an amnesty for these and others concerned in the strike.     Still more ominous, perhaps, because more surprising, is a threat of a meeting of merchants and shopkeepers to refuse to pay taxes as a protest
against the Government&apos;s failure to deal with the increasing diffi-culties about food.No wonder prophecies are freely mada of a fresh crisis, and one of a grave character.     Perhaps the gravity of the outlook may be responsible for the fact that the leaders of the official patties are closing up their   ranks.     Count Romanones has been reconciled to the prime Minister; this, but for the Alba-Burrell eeoession, would re-unite the whole of the old Liberal Party.     And there appear to be signs of a reconciliation between Maura And Dato which would do the same for the Conservative party.    And the official parties ahould gain Btrength from the open rupture between the Regionalists and the Reformists, who consider that Cambo sold them by allowing his two intimate followers, Rodes and Ventosa to enter the Cabinet.Meanwhile the German campaign continues, flushed by its success in getting rid of the pro-Ally Dato and Lema.     The negotiations for a oommorical agreement with England, which was praotically ooncluded when Dato fell, have been delayed, though it seems^robable that they will reach the stage of signature very soon in spite of German op-position.     Spain needs our coal almost, if not quite, as mush as we need her ore.     Nothing more is heard of Dato&apos;s vigorous policy in the matter of the escaped submarine.     It is believed that the Germans have succeeded in buying over one or possibly two members of the Cabinet:   and it is expected that they will use the new system of &apos;freef elections (that is elections in which an impartial judge, instead of a party Civil Governor, is the presiding authority and no Government influence is employed) for the purpose of bribing very lavishly and getting aa^nany a* their friends as possible into the new Cortes.     The Church certainly and probably the Army (in which thero is no sign of the men being able to act apart from their officers) are in the main on their side:   and few Spaniards seem to
be able to see that, in Spain as in Russia, though of course Russia is immeasureably more important, the German interest is disorder and that they will play all sections in turn, Churoh, Army, Carlists, Republicans, strikers, in order to bring it about.     The immediate object is to orevent ore being sent to England:   after that they will see.It may be worth noting, in view of the unfortunate attitude of the Church as a whole, that the Archbishop of Tarragona, who lately visited the French front, has returned full of enthusiasm for the piety of the French troop3 and of indignation at such barbarities as the destruction of ^heims Cathedral.     And he goes so far as to ex-, press the same confidence in the victory of the Allies as Count Romanones has just publicly repeated.     The Archbishop has naturally provoked the wrath of the German Ambassador&apos;s paper.On the whole the Spanish situation is a very anxious one, more so perhaps than at moments like that of the strike, which looked more immediately dangerous.     All evidence goes to show that the cuuntry, or at least the large towns, are seething with discontent, chiefly due to the differences about food but also political.     Few expect any immediate attack on the Monarchy but no one thinks the King&apos;s popularity is what it was:   and there is evidence that in Radical a and pro-Ally circles it is further diminished by his attitude in dismissing Dato as he dismissed Romanones, both of which acts are regarded as inspired by German and anti-Liberal influences.     The number of Republicans and Socialists has admittedly increased. Sops have been thrown to. the Army and the Regionalists:   but they are only sops:   neither are satisfied: and the Army, however loyal, is in the unhealthy state which is the inevitable sequel of a successfuk defiance of the Government.     The official parties have so far failed either to form a united front against revolution or th realise the necessity of bold reform.     In the midst of this chaos a General
- 6 -Election seems inevitable and imminent, though no definite announce-ment has yet been made.     Probably the sooaer it comes the better, for the more it is delayed the more prices will rise and the more time thn Germans will have to organise a campaign.     But nobody can say what will result from a &apos;freeT election in Spain.     Perhaps the indifference and tradtionalism of the rural masses may provide a necessary counterbalance to the advanced Liberalism of the towns. Without the latter Spain would have no political life at all: without the former, perhaps, it would run through its life danger-ously fast and lose it before it had had time to reap any fruit from it.
