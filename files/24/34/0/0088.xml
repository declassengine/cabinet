ADDISON.------------.------.... 5th December 1917.Appendix.28th November 1917.Dear Lord Salisbury,I am writing to you as Chairman of the Committee appointed to consider and advise upon the disposal or alternative form of use of Government property not required .for war purposes, in the hope that it may be of assistance to the Committee if I mention at the outset of their work some of the considerations which led the Government to npuoxnt1-both ,1/his Committee, t-nd the Executive Board under Sir&apos; Howard
Vank&apos;s Chairmanship which, is to carry out r in accordance with the rinciples laid down by the QKTV^rninent on the advice of the ommittee, the adminlstrat/ive v/drk involved&apos;in the actual disposal of the property,.I am sure ..you re-cognise that it is most desirable that the best   , s.e should be made of the property which, the nation has acquired during the war, and that any of it which has to be disposed of should oo dealt with in on economical and businesslike manner,- &apos; In order to secure these objects,, the Departments concerned are-already at -vork preparing inventories of the stores under their control...Your Committee is charged&apos;with the responsibility of seeing that the inventories are made as complete as possible,, and.that suitable, arrangements are instituted for. keeping them up to date... By these means, it is proposed to compile a complete central register of all the property and stores in question,,,so that all may be-properly classified and dealt with through one agencyFrom the applications and representations&apos; which have been ma.de to me, .it is quite evident that Government Departments and public bodies; and a number of Local Authorities, will welcome the opportunity of acquiring, on suitable terms, certain of the property or stores v;hich may, in due&apos;time., become surplus to the requirements of the Departments now holding theirw..I hope that, as soon as the necessary-preparations are comp2.ote, your Committee will take steps to furnish them with such, details as can conveniently be made available, in order that the prospective purchasers for public purposes may have a full opportunity of examining them and representing their views to you, with the object-of securing the utilisation of surplus, stores, so far as is adviaablt and possible, in,., the public service.
To facilitate the work of the Committee, I have requested Mr..Vaughan Nash,. Joint Secretary to the Ministry of Reconstruction,, to keep the Committee informed of the various proposals bearing upon their work which are under consideration by this Department,, and to communicate to you any decisions of the Government upon these proposals..I am glad to be assured that you fully share my view that we should do everything we can,, in view of the&apos; colossal, expenditure entailed by the War, to make the fullest use and best use, in the national interest, of the property and stores which may have been acquired by the Government for war purposes, in order both to conserve our resources as much as possible,, and to assist in meeting the demands which will be made upon us during the period of Reconstruction.Yours sincerely,(S igned) C. /: ddis On...
