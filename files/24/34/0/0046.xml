(This Document Is the. Property of    ( His Britannic Majesty^ Government]BOARD OF TRADE,7, WHITEHALL GARDENS,LONDON, S.W.I circulate to the Wai* Cabinet a Minuteby the Timber Controller on the critical position ofthe Timber Supply.       In view of the urgency of thomatter I should be glad if it could be dealt- with..assoon as possible.Board cf Trade,3rd Be comber, 1917.
MINUTE BY THE&quot; TIMBER (X^iTEOIiER ON THE CPJTICAL POSITIONOF THE TIMBER SUPPLY.T.       Without sufficient timber vital industries like Ship-building, construction of aeroplanes and aerodromes, railways, munitions, collieries and iron ore mines cannot be carried on.      Before the War, supplies came mainly from abroad.     In 1913 the imported tonnage amounted to some 11,600,000 tons, while this year to the end of October, the tonnage is under E,400,000 tons, and for 1918 I am being pressed to save yet another million tons.   This striking reduction of imports is shown most clearly on the attached chart (Appendix 1.)It is obvious that not onlv the existing labour must be retained, but if this further drastic saving is to bs made additional labour will have to be found in large numbers.      It must not be overlooked that this year&apos;s ro-quirements have been in large measure satisfied out of stocks brought in during 1916, and that the measure of the consump-tion of timber cannot be gauged by the amount imported and produced during the oresent year.       Only a 4 months? supsly is now in sight to meet the country Ts needs and no further large imports can be expected until the next open-water.. It should also not be forgotten that we are entering on the worst season of the year, when transport difficulties, short days and rough weather seriously impede the rate of production in our own island woods.2.        The most urgent need is for an immediate recon-sideration of the decision of the Ministry of Natioi.al Ser-vice not to exempt 650 men called up frcm^th^J^oJJ:: sh Tim-ber Trade on December 8th.  .   These are skilled men comprising
foremen,, fellers,, and hauliers.     To withdraw one sktjled man is largely7 to disorganise the working&apos; of a mill, because in Scotland the mills are snail ami scattered, each employing about 20 men, everyone of whom has definite duties.     It is self-evident that to withdraw these men is to reduce pro-duct ion, and this at a time when we are assimulating seme 2,000 unskilled men in Scotland alone in order to increase the output by dilution.      To carry out dilution without every available skilled roan is to invite disorganisation and reduction of output.      I strongly urge that the decision to call up these 650 men may be reversed immediately, as if it is sustained the reduction of output may gravely interfere with supplies to our collieries, railways and war services. I cannot too strongly express the urgency of this matter.3o     Further protection for the Timber Industry is urgently required, not only in Scotland but also in England and Wales. The existing Army Council Instruction 730 of 1917 (copy attached; Appendix 2.) has proved quite insufficient, especially as it is administered by the Director of Recruiting, whose rulings tend to get men for the Army and not to pro-tect the Timber Industry.     It is most important that no fur-ther men engaged in the Timber Industry should   be called up, irrespective of age and medical classification, without the concurrence of the Timber Department; this to include not only foremen and skilled workmen, but managers, erpert assistants, calculators, measurers, -etc- who are vitally necessary to any scheme of dilution.     Specially skilled nurserymen should also be included as the cultivation of seedlings for re-afforestation operations is a pressing matter.
4.    It will be impossible to raise the production in 1918-te the necessary height for the present saving of tonnage to be continued, and for there to be any hope of saving the further million tons of imports, over 1917 unless another 13-17,000 men are provided as and when required(see attached oh: rt; Appendix 3,)   The demand for strong, unskilled labour at high wages for work such as aerodrome construction makes it impossible to obtain the men required from the labour market.     Foreign labour has been tried especially Portuguese of whom some 4,COO are now at work, but they are far from satisfactory and over 350 have had to be repatriated.    Many of them are townsmen without timber knowledge, some are diseased and they have to work in large gangs because of the need of interpreters, so that they cannot be supplied to private firms; morvt important, they car    only work, for climatic reasons, in the south of England.   It is suggested that more German prisoners should be allocated to timber work; nearly 2,400 are at present at work, and they oan be employed in conjunction with the Canadian Forestry Corps.      Home-Service men who have experience in timber work should also be released from the Colours, except senior N.C.0.S and members of special technical units engaged in their pre-war trades.   It is not, however, suggested that all the men needed can be got from these sources.5.     It is urgently requested that immediate action maybe tskm to exempt the 650 men called up from Scotland, andto protect the Tiraber Industry from further loss of men, andto provide for 1916 the minimum of 13,000 men as abovewithout which I consider it impossible to provide the supplyof tiroVr from this country sufficient to bring about thesaving of tonnage I ain being urged to make.(Sgd) J. .B. BALL.Controller of Timber Supplies.ecember, 1917.

ARMY COUNCIL INSTRUCTION. APPENDIX 2.No.730 of 1917.WAR OEPICS,4th May, 1917.30. Calling up of men- engaged   in the felling, sawing or hauling of timber.A.C.1.540 of 1917 is cancelled and the following substituted:-1. For the present, men of all medical categories who on.29th March, 17, had attained the age of 23, and were on that date engaged in the crations of felling, sawing (including engine hands), or hauling timber, were managers fr foremen in control of such men, will not be called up r service so long as they continue to be so engaged.2. This applies to all such men so employed, whether by the Director Timber Supplies or in private employment.3. Individual cases of skilled fellers, sawyers or haulers, or man-?,T5 or foremen, not within the terms of para.l of this instruction may dealt with by Special War Office instructions on the recommendation of e Director of Timber Supplies, but no special action will be taken un-ss definite instructions with respect to a particular man are received om the War Office;   that is to say their exemption will depend upon the cision of Tribunals in the ordinary way.4. If a claim is made by or on behalf of a man who has been called that he is protected by para.. 1 of this Instruction, the calling up II be cancelled if the claim is admitted.     In case of doubt reference 11 at.-once be made (by telegram if. necessary) to the Secretary (D.R.5) r Office, London, S.7.I..5. This Instruction gives special treatment for the time beinff to n within para. 1 but does not of course enable men not within para. 1 o are or have been badged or in possession of Tribunal exemptions, to called to the Colours before they are otherwise liable..2,7/Exemptions/3242 (D.R.5)By Command of the Army Council.
