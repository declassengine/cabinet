Pood Production.x^femorandum by the Secretary of State for war. -^w/    I circulate the following observations on the Memorandum pf-the Board of Agriculture G.T.2767The War Cabinet order&apos;of 27th June, 1917, (War Cabinet 170(1)) to supply 21,500 &quot;skilled&quot; men for England and Wales for the 1918 programme was received in July, &quot;but the nen were placed very slowly at first, owing to the Board of Agriculture not being able to take them.    It was not till after August that they began to be taktn up.     To avoid having men standing idle at Distrlbution Centres only a sufficient number were kept at each centre to meet the requirements of Local Agricultural Committees, and weekly returns were obtained from each centre as to the numbers disposed of.The orders were to send as skilled men either men with agricultural experience or men accustomed to handling horses. The latter class have often proved useless, and from the first thereOms ^een difficulty in placing men unless they were really expert ploughmen.    The available number of such men is, however, limited.     This difficulty has been overcome to a considerable extent by the training of men under the scheme worked by the Pood Production Department, and *y the Farmers being ntw more ready to take a useful man and try and make the best of him, which was not the case at first.Our weekly figures have been sent to the Pood Production Department and it wac understood, that they were accepted as correct, as no criticism was made.     On 7th November, 1917, however, that Department drew attention to the very large difference which existed between these figures, and those supplied by the Agricultural Committees.These differences were brought to the notice of the Commands at once, and they were instructed to try and come to an agreement as to figures at each Centre, se that the true position as regards skilled men should be known.This is being done and in most instances figures have been agreed to, but it has been pointed out that the Local Committees are in some cases inclined to refuse to class as &quot;skilled&quot; men those whom the Farmers accepted as such and who have a knowledge of farm work.Generally speaking, however, there is not very much difference in the. total figures as given by the Board of Agriculture.On 20th November our figures for the 1918 Programme are as followsSkilled men with Farmers.....................   13,600Skilled men at Centres available to go out...     2,200,15,000To complete................................     5,700&amp;L.500On
On 27th November the figures for the 1910 ProgrammeareSkilled meri with Farmers......................    15,456Skilled men at centres available to go out....    ,2,544&apos;&apos;   :&apos;   - 16,000To complete.i.i...i.;i........................     3,50021,500From this it will be seen that we have supplied 05$ of the men classed as skilled.2)000 men from France are now being distributed, who are all said to be expert ploughmen; others are coming in slowly and some special arrangement will evidently be necessary to ensure that the remaining 1,500 are made available^     This will probably adjust itself in the course of the next month, when the Trade Card Index for the Forces at Home will be completed.As regards &quot;unskilled&quot; men, of which 21.600 were to be supplied under the War Cabinet decision - this figure included the 17,000 then on loan for the hay and corn harvest - there never has been any difficulty in providing the number of men asked for, as they have been taken up very slowly by the Board of Agriculture.The figures of the Board of Agriculture; 13,000 may be accepted as correot.To avoid having a number of unskilled men standing idle, only a limited number are retained at each Centre to meet immediate demands.     In September 5,000 unskilled men were with the permission of the Board of Agriculture withdrawn from Depots, the Board having no immediate use for them.It appears probable that the full number of 21,500 unskilled men will not be required before the early Spring. These can be provided if the War Office is definitely&quot; told the numbers required on specified dates, and the Board of Agriculture adhere to their programme.In all discussions in regard to shortage of labour, especially skilled labour, in civil life, it seems to be generally accepted that the men required are in the Army.     It is suggested that the greatest number of men skilled in agriculture are at this moment actually in Munition factories, and without doubt a considerable number would be found in the IFavy.   Investigations in this direction would doubtloss supply the Board of Agriculture with the class of skilled men they require.4th December, 1917.DERBY.
