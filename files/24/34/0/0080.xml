CONFIDENTIAL.1,     The War Cabinet cn the 22nd June. 1917, had before thema memorandum of which a copy is attached dealing with therecruiting of alien labour from abroad and indicating thedifficulties caused by the unco-ordinated action of GovernmentDepartments in endeavouring to secure such labour.   The ;.7arCabinet decided that&quot; he Ministry cf Labour should become definitely responsible for dealing with the recruiting and importation of &apos;alien labour- for. employment in this country and that Government Departments should &apos; consult the Ministry of Lab Mir at an early stage as to their requirements; this decision in no way to. effect the recruiting of labour abroad for.services abroadrv2.     The reasons which led to this decision in the case ofalien workmen may be summarised briefly as follo7/s:-fi) The need for ascertaining the attitude of British workmen towards the proposed importation.(ii) the need for ascertaining, and if necessary for being able to demonstrate the shortage ox British workmen available for employment in the industries -in question-(iii) the need for  assuxn-npj   that tho wages, allowances and other conditions offered to workmen brought into - this country were not more favourable than those obtained by British workmen and alternatively(iv) the need for ensuring that British workmen were not in a position to complain that British rates were being undercut by alien- lab&apos;.ur*3*     The deoislon given in connection with alien labour doesnot cover the recruiting and importation of workmen of Britishnationality from the Dominions, Colonies or elsewhere abroad,and it is now suggested that a similar decision should be givenin respect of such recruiting and importation,4,     The.Ministry of Labour-has. been instrumental in securingfor work in the United, Kingdom,.a considerable number of werkmenfrom Canada and.a smaller&apos;number from South Africa. :vAll these workmen are under contract to remain upon,urgentwork in-the,United Kingdom for the duration ef the war.5,     At the present -time--labour, is, being , imported- from the ,
Dominions by at least two Department s viz, from Australia yj arrangements made by.&quot;the Ministry of Munitions with the Conn wealth Government and by the Timber Supply Department from Canada,- &apos; &apos;6,     In these circumstances It appears most desirable that, in the case of alien labour, thesye should be no possibility competition or duplication of machinery as betv/een Governmerj Departments regarding the recruiting and importation of labo from t e Dominions or Colonies.and no danger:that unnecessar recruiting will be undertaken, owing to ignorance in any qua of the pending availability for fresh work, of labour from t Dominions or Colonies which may have been imported already. 7,     I suggest, therefore., that the Ministry of Labour shoul now become definitely responsible; for dealing with the recru and importation, of.-workmen of&apos; British Nationality from the Dominions and Colonies or elsewhere abroad and that a minute should.be circulated to Government Departments instructing tl to consult the Ministry of Labour at an early stage in connec with any-proposals to-recruit such labour-and informing them that tho -actual work of obtaining it must be entrusted to the Ministry of Labour,
)NF IDE NT-IAD, 311- ME1I0RANDIM .on .tho /RECRUITING- of LABOUR from&apos;ABROAD.nA number of; proposals.1.-by various Government Departments to ecruit labour abroad&apos; have recently been brought to my notice&apos;,    -1 find ^at&apos;there are certain - questions which have to be. settled in&apos; relation Jo:each such propgsal..     To&apos;obtain the right answer to these questions s of first-class importance, not only to the success of the recruiting Proposals but also to British workmen.     Among these questions is the &apos;-&apos;ltude of the British,workmen In. the industry and locality concerned irds a proposal to introduce-&apos;labour from abroad.-    In.relation to ; -point it is,necessary to&quot; -ascertain whether there is a demonstrable Shortage&apos;&apos; of &quot;British workmen for employment in the industry in question.is&apos; further&apos;necessary to ascertain-the attitude of British labour . [enerally towards a proposal to bring &quot;In workmen&apos; of the particular &apos;tiona 11 ty. concerned in the proposal.      Strong&apos; objection might..for j-tance be,-;-felt with regard to the importation of Asiatic or other .cured labour, less objection to the- importation ofEgypt ion or hitese labour-and no objection at all to the -importation of purely aropean labour;&quot;. y - .  &apos; ;f&quot;-A. further question arises-as/to the rate of wages, and the..  -ther conditions of&apos;-. employment- which should be offered &quot;to alien labour..is sometimes--- proposed- to. offer,-, conditions - which are. substantially u-e attractive than thp-se obtained by &apos; British-.workmen.; engaged upon-. -.t imilar work-     Again,- proposals, are sometimes-made offering&apos; conditions 3ss favourable&apos; than.;those, obtained, by-British workmen similarly employedeither event, if v. such &quot;proposals are carried out, unnecessary iff iculties are caused.British workmen will complain that aliens are reated more considerately than themselves or, in the alternative, that Titish.rates are being undercut by&quot;alien labour.&apos;&quot; It is desirable also to consider the rates of wages paid for milar work in-different   parts of the. United Kingdom, and to ensure s.t the contracts entered into by workmen imported from abroad are o drawn up that the men will be bound, and will understand that they re bound, to work for the British rate of wages current in any district 1 vmich their services may be required.It is obvious that any labour recruited abroad should be vaiiable ii&apos; required for anyGovernment work in this country for which X is suitable and in which there is a dearth of British labour, and- only for the particular locality/Dr works re -uired by a single le.-&apos;artment recruiting independently for its own needs.It seems to me that the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry Labour alone is in a position to advise upon these matters.Further general questions arise with regard to the best tethod of transport to the United Kinrdoia, and with regard to the istributlon of the aliens upon their arrival.      I may mention that lie Employment Department of the Ministry have carried through uccessfully a number of schemes for recruiting labour outside the fated Kingdom, and in particular have arranged for the introduction of abour from Holland, Portugal and Denmark, as well as from Canada and cuth Africa.     The Employment Department have elaborate machinery in -ie Emploment Exchange system which is available for the receipt and fompt distribution of labour from abroad.In so far as the importation of aliens for non-munitions work 3 concerned, the-, permission of the Minister of Labour is, in accordance
with Article 22b of the.Aliens Restriction Order, required   before . such labour;is recruited.     In the aohuinistration of this Article ti Employment Department are constantly in touch with other Government Departments concerned in the . control of Aliens..In. view of all these considerations?,, it appears to me tha order to safeguard not only the interests of British labour, but al to avoid the creation in this country of duplicate machinery, it is highly desirable that - the &quot;work of- obtaining: labour- from abroad shou become the- responsibility of a single-Department.--   -1 am- -cpnf inmdd this opinion by. the danger., which has already occurred, - of competit. involving duplication: of-machinery abroad between Government Departi who may propose -to recruitflabbur&apos; ih the same country..    A further argument in favour of the constitution of this work being; under a s: Department is that, if separate Departments are independently, recruiting labour abroad) it may well happen that&apos;one Department is finishing with the labour it&apos;has recruited and is   re-patriating it. whilst the other Department is going to the expense, and trouble of recruiting fresh labour, in another or - the same-foreign country when It could be given the labour released by the first Department if a]* foreign recruitment were under one control.I suggest that the Ministry of Labour should now become definitely responsible for dealing, with the recruiting and importatil of alien labour;   and that a minute should&apos;be circulated&apos;to Governmel Departments instructing them to consult the Ministry of Labour at. ar, early stage in connection with-any proposal to recruit labour abroad and informing them that - the- actual work; of obtaining such labour mus be entrusted to the Ministry&quot; of Labour&apos;.:7.6.17.-&apos;
