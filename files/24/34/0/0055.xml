(This Document is the Property of    yfs&amp;(-Nig Britannic Msjesty&apos;s Government.)f^ \   From Viceroy, Foreign Department, orcl December 1917. yZ-Z^ )jgjf (Repeated to Teheran.)^^fSw (Received at India Office 6 p.m.).^r* Secret.. Persia. Your telegram of the 17th November, and Marling&apos;s telegram, No. 398 F., 22nd November. We find it difficult to advise in view of inability of His Majesty&apos;s Goverument to accept our proposal for general change of policy in Persia, a proposal to which we still adhere, and s \ - which appear^ to be strengthened by recent developments of Russian situation. On this understanding our views on Foreign Office telegram of 15th November are as follows : (1) We do not believe that a Persian Government purchased in manner proposed could be either genuinely friendly or be effective in our interests so long as Persia itself is left anti-British. (2) Such Government could not, and doubtless would not, guarantee security of Ispahan-Caspian line. Armoured motor-car] might be useful, but without an allied Russia it is not clear how they are to be supplied with petrol and other essential requirements, while on whatever pretext they were introduced their presence would give offence to Persia.But in any case there should be ungrudging expenditure on obtaining intelligence and securing support of Chiefs and notables.(3) We agree with Marling that without some concession to Persian sentiment any Persian Government would find it difficult to accord required recognition to South Persia Rifles.We trust that Minister is right in assuming that subventions to Kawam and Suulet will continue. It seems distinctly desirable to encourage unofficial use of Bushire-Shiraz road until such time as His Majesty&apos;s Government can come to a final decision on that question.Incidence of the cost of proposals if adopted would presumably depend on decision regarding so-called political expenditure in Persia, vide our Finance Department telegram dated 8th June.
