London, S.W. (1)&quot;it)5th December, 1917.3 5Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 4th December:-The feather.The weather last week varied greatly in different parts of the country.     In the majority of districts it was fairly favourable for farm operations, but in a few districts it was extremely bad.     In North Devon, for example, where no less than 26 days in November were wet, rain fell continuously all last week. In the North of England also the week opened with wind and rain storms and, in some parts, snow fell to a depth&quot;of several inches, but these adverse conditions were, to some extent, neutralized by drying winds later in the week.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION, Agricultural Executive Committees. Bedfordshire - The owner of the Odell Castle Estate, which has been much neglected, has now arranged at the suggestion of the Executive Committee, to let practically the whole of the 900 aores that require cultivation to a large local farmer.     The land remaining in the owner&apos;s hands will be kept under observation. Derbyshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a fox covert leased to Lord Harrington, and to clear it away as the surrounding land cannot Otherwise be cultivated, owing to the rabbits harboured.     This is being done with the consent of owner and tenant.
Kent - The Committee are arranging for the ploughing up of 100 acres of Eastwell Park, the owner, Lord Gerard, having signified his anxiety to help in the ploughing-up policy.Sussex,West - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a 160 acre farm at Wisborough Green which was used indifferently as a poultry farm by the female owner-occupier.     It is reported to be in a deplorable condition and overrun with rabbits.. Worcestershire - The Committee, at the instance of the owner) Lord Coventry, have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 388 acres of very valuable land near Pershore, of which the tenant, who has only been in occupation for twelve months, is regarded as incompetent.Special Crops.Mustard -   The Agricultural Executive Committees have been informed that it will not be justifiable to devote to mustard for seed a larger acreage than was grown in 1917, namely 10,575 acres. Within this limit they might reasonably sanction contracts for growing seed, especially, upon newly ploughed up grass land which is too rich in fertility for cereals as a first crop.     Messrs. J. and J. Colman Limited have arranged to supply particulars of the contracts they make to the Committee for the county concerned. Strawberries and Bush Fruit - In order to prevent any unfairness to fruit growers, arising from difference in treatment between one -county and another, the Committees have been informed of the lines upon which the Department consider that restrictions of the area devoted to strawberries and bush fruit might uniformly be imposed. No direction should be given to grub up strawberry plants or bush fruit, and where any part is grubbed up an equivalent area may be planted with fruit under certain conditions as to interplanting with a food crop.     An area of less than 1 acre planted with fruit may be increased to 1 acre..
Damage by Game. Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Cambridgeshire, Cumberland, Durham, Hampshire, Kesteven and Norfolk; and under the Pheasants Order from Leicestershire, Norfolk and Surrey.     In Worcestershire the Committee are arranging a scheme for the destruction of wood pigeons.Drkinage.The Kesteven Committee are taking action under the orders with regard to dykes and drains in Deeping and other fens, and the Cheshire Committee with regard to Marbury and Pickmere Meres;   the Cumberland Committee are taking action with regard to the Cross Canonby, Birkby and Great Orton Becks,, and the Norfolk Committee on Worstead Marshes..     In Somersetshire, the Executive Committee have urged the Commissioners under the Somerset Drainage Act to exercise their powers to the fullest extent in the flooded areas of the Gary, Parrett, Drue and Tone.Determination of Tenancies. The following statement gives&apos; particulars of the casesin which tenancies	have been determined		on account of bad fnaming:		By	the Board.	By Landlords authorised				by	the Board,		*        Area.

Cultivation of Lands Orders;    and it is stated that, since the outbreak of *ar, allotments in Monmouthshire have increased eight-fold, and 316 gardens belonging to soldiers.and .other absentees are being cultivated by schoolboys.On the application of Ml t chain Urban District Council, the Board have consented to the Council&apos;s entry on detached portions, containing 6-J acres, of Mitcham Common for the purpose of providing allotments, for which there is a pressing demand and no other land available.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION Fruit and Vegetable Preserving.   Since last report, 40 demonstra-tions in vegetable drying and fruit bottling have been given.   The small Canning Stations at Bridgwater, Cheltenham and Worcester are still in operation.   At Bridgwater during the past week 5,500 cans of apples were prepared and&apos; at Cheltenham 5,045.The fact that apples are not keeping,well and that the price of supplies has risen to the very high figure of  18 to  20 a ton will make it impossible to continue the Canning Stations for so long a period as has been expected.The Canning Stations are being used as Demonstration Centres and at Bridgwater the Mayor and other officials are taking interest in.; the work of canning.    Other Canning Demonstra-tions have been held in the Guildhall, Winchester.. Potato Spraying.   Treasury sanction for the continuation of last year&apos;s propaganda in connection with the spraying of potatoes has now been received, and arrangements are being made for establishing a staff of Organisers in different parts of the country. Allotment Section.   Mr. T-.H. Sutton, who was recently appointed to take charge of the work of increasing the number of allotments, particularly in Urban Districts, has visited Birmingham and urged
upon the Authorities the importance of adding very considerably to the 6,000 allotments already in existence. There is every indica-tion that as a result of his visit the difficulties experienced by Local Authorities in obtaining the necessary land will be overcome.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Corn Production in Wales.   A Conference with the members of the Welsh Agricultural Council was held at Shrewsbury on 1st December. The reasons for the policy of the Department were discussed, and the assistance of the Council was asked in educating Welsh public opinion on the importance of corn production.   To assist members of the Council figures were given showing the very large increase in human food that resulted from the ploughing of land suitable for tillage.The effect of the ploughing of grass on the milk supply was discussed, as the general opinion in Wales is that a reduction in the area&quot; of grass must curtail the milk supply.    One member of the Council, who sells milk from 30 cows, said that this opinion was quite unwarranted.    In confirmation of this statement he said that last season he sowed two acres with marrow-stem kale, and that from the middle of last September until the present time he was supplementing the ration of cows at pasture from the produce of these two acres. Further, that he expected the supply to last till mid-January, that the milk yield had increased instead of falling off as the autumn advanced, and that were it not for the produce of this - arable land there would have been a large reduction in his sales of milk.Cost of Producing Milk during the Summer^Months.   The Sub-Committee of the Technical Committee, who recently submitted a report on the cost of producing winter milk, are continuing their investigations, and a detailed enquiry is being addressed to dairy farmers on the
cost of producing milk during the summer.   Data will be obtained as far as possible from the same farmers who furnished information as regards winter production, but other farmers will also be addressed. Inspection of Land.   At the request of the Chairman of the Soke of Peterborough Executive Committee, a large number of farms in that county have been inspected, and a report submitted giving advice asto treatment.   The greater part of the grass examined was of poor quality, but if ploughing is not delayed too long, and if sufficient disintegration is effected so as to ensure a firm seed-bed, there is no reason why good crops of wheat, oats and potatoes should not be secured in most cases.Plant Diseases.   In view of the increase in work connected with insect pests and the urgent necessity for fuller information as regards diseases causing serious damage to cereal crops,-authority has been obtained for the appointment of an assistant entomologist. Por this post the services of Mr. J.E. Collin, a specialist on flies, have been secured.   Mr. Collin is at present engaged in the investigation of the cereal pests Frit Fly and Gout Fly.A number of cases of &quot;sprain&quot; in the wart disease -resisting variety of potatoes, &quot;Golden Wonder&quot;, have recently been reported, and as the disease appeared to be of an unusual type the matter is being investigated.
LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.     Reports received from the Department&apos;s District Commissioners shew that nearly 700 skilled ploughmen have already arrived from overseas on two months&apos; agricultural leave.       These men are being allocated solely for ploughing work, the majority being already out on farms.The number of men made available to date for the 1918 Programme out of the 43,000 soldiers allocated to agriculture is 29,344, of which 17,723 are so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 11,621 unskilled Of these men, 15,222 so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 8,966 unskilled are out on farms.     The majority of the men remaining at the Depots are either being trained or reserved for training, or are unsuitable for agricultural work.The number of men sent out for training as tractor drivers to date is 1,563 and, in addition, 210 men have been sent out for training with steam plough or threshing tackle. Horses.     Orders for the issue of 160 horses have been sent out during the week, making a total of 3,912 horses to date. Prisoners of War.   A return received from the War Office during the week shews that 1,008 men are now employed on agricultural work in the neighbourhood of parent camps, as against 553 at the date of the last return.     This number, added to the 3,327 prisoners who go out daily from working camps, brings the total number of combatant prisoners employed in agriculture up to 4,335.     In addition, 1,359 interned aliens have been released for agricultural work, making the total number cf prisoners now employed 5,694. Demands for the formation of 17 new agricultural camps have been sent to the tfar Office, which, together with additional men applied for to be added to some of the existing camps, will involve the employment in agriculture of an additional 1,525 prisoners.
*Women&apos;s Branch.A demonstration and test of efficiency for women farmworkers was held at Maidstone on November 29th,   The increasinginterest taken in this question was evidenced by the presenceof unusually large numbers of farmers, and the total number ofspectators exceeded 1,300.   The admirable way in which thedemonstration was organised reflects the greatest credit on thetwo Women&apos;s War Agricultural Committees in Kent, while the workcf the competitors and the standard achieved promises well forthe future cf women  n agriculture.   Out of a total of 238women who entered for the tests 165 gained over 80$, thus ob-taining efficiency certificates issued by the Board,   All thosecompeting In carting, ploughing, fruit spraying and thatchingreached this standard;   five of the six thatchers had beentrained in this work for five weeks only under Mr. Robb of WyeCollege.   The Secretary of one of the largest fruit growers&apos;associations in Kent wrote to the organisers of the meetingafterwards as follows:-&quot;I wish to congratulate you and your Committee on the success of the demonstration to-day.   I am sure it has proved to all how great a part the women of Kent are, taking towards winning the war.   The work of the women carting was more than excellent.   The general management of the horses was far better than I could have hoped to have seen.   The final test for championship was a most difficult job for the judges owing to the excellence of the work of all competitors.&quot;A letter signed by the Chairman of the Agricultural Executive Committee in Nottingham has been sent to the wc*ien who have been working on threshing gangs in that county expressing the Committee&apos;s appreciation of the work done and their admiration : for the way in which the women have persevered in this difficult work.   The letter states also that excellent reports of the women have been received both from the farmers and the owners of the tackle.There are at the present time 7,017 women accounted for as members of the Land Army as follows:-

During the month of November the tractors which form the Hereford Town unit have ploughed 629 acres, giving averages of, approximately, 126 acres per week for the 9 machines forming the unit, or over 14 acres per week per machine.Tractor No,1550 established a record during the week ending 30th.     This machine in the period stated ploughed 48 acres,, the area having been carefully checked,  and certified by a well known local farmer.     This result is the more gratifying because nearly 10 hours out of the working week of sixty were lost for ploughing in twice moving the tractor from farm to farm, and in adjusting and repairing the plough.The -consumption figures for the work done are equally creditable, namely 137 gallons paraffin, 4 gallons petrol,Consigned to Scotland   106 &quot; n Ireland      70
36512 gallons oil, and 4 lbs. grease, or an average per acre of 2*85 gallons paraffin and .084 gallons petrol.The work of this&apos;team for the four weeks preceding the one described woe. 2lk acres, 20^ acres, 18 acres and 2lf acresrespectively, or an average of 25t acres per week for 5 weeks.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.    The sales of sulphate of ammonia arranged through the Distribution Committee for the month of November amounted to over 7,000 tons.     The demand is slackening temporarily, but will no doubt be renewed after Christmas..     At the moment very few complaints are being received of difficulty in. obtaining supplies. Superphosphate,    Orders for substantial quantities of superphosphate have been placed through the Departments Distribution Committee with certain Works where the output was in excess of the demand and the situation is now easier.     The Press Notiee that was issued last week urging farmers to place orders at once in view of the railway difficulties next spring, has received a good deal of attention, but it is too early at present to have produced much effect. Potash.   Over 300 Agents have now applied to be licensed to sell Blast Furnace Flue Dust,     The quantity that has been disposed of in the past does not seem to have been very large, and the sales have probably not exceeded 1,500 tons a month,     The principal difficulty that seems likely to be met with in connection with the Flue Dust is the extreme variability of the product.     The arrangements made by the Wholesale Collecting Agents are being inspected, in order to see that the Agents are taking all possible steps to deal with the Dust Satisfactorily, and to test the Potash content.before it is delivered for sale.3inder Twine,    The question of the prices to be charged for the sale of small quantities of Binder Twine is being discussed with the Ministry of Munitions, and a sliding scale has been proposed which
316Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P., President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.allows a small additional charge to cover the cost in retailing small quantities.Lime.   An arrangement has now been completed for the sale of about 150 tons of Waste Carbonate of Lime per week from Messrs. Brunner Mond&apos;s Works in Cheshire.     An Agent has been appointed ?fho will push the sale to farmers and undertake the commercial operations involved.     The price at which it will be sold to farmers is 5/-per ton.Seed Oats. A request has been sent forward to the Wheat Commission that an effort be. made to secure for delivery at an English port before the 1st March at least 2,000 tons of Manx oats for seed purposes.Further enquiries are being made in Ireland) as the first samples of oats received were not considered suitable for seed purposes in England.Seed Potatoes.    Purchases of seed potatoes in Scotland up to the present amount to 6,655 tons.     About half of these are &quot;second earlies&quot;, immune and non-immune, but,&apos; when definite information is available as to the policy of the Government with regard to the increase desired in &quot;second earlies&quot; in 1918, it ?;ill be possible tc make adequate provision for seed.     To secure an increase of this crop, which may be of the highest national importance, it will be essential to fix and announce, without delay, both a maximum and minimum price, sufficient to induce growers to incur the additional risk and difficulty of cultivation as compared with the &quot;main crop&quot;.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,
