ocomsnt is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]       u 0Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   November 1917,CONFIDENTIAL.(Scotch Education Department.)EDUCATION (SCOTLAND) BILL, 1917.I.THE main object of this Bill is to effect a further improvement in. the provision of education for all classes of the population in Scotland, and to make that provision available to residents in remote and isolated districts.The measures proposed to that end are contained in the sections of the Bill headed &quot; Powers and Duties of Local Education Authori-ties&quot; and &quot;Extension of School Age,&quot; &amp;c. (clauses 7 to 19). In the main, these provisions follow the lines of the English. Education Bill, with modifications to adapt them to the circumstances of Scotland. It is proposed to raise the age for full-time school attendance to 15 (clause 16) ; to make attendance at continuation classes obligatory for pupils between the ages of 15 and 18, who are not in full-time attendance at school ^clause 17); to restrict, the employment, before and after school hours, of children attending school (clause 18) j and to further regulate the employment of children or young persons under the age of 15 in factories and mines (clause ly).Provision is made for ensuring that, so far as practicable, no child or young person who gives promise of ability shall be debarred from benefiting by attendance at Secondary Schools or Universities by reason of difficulty of access or want of means (clause 8). It is also proposed that local education authorities shall be empowered to make provision of books, especially in rural districts, not onlv for children and young persons attending school, but also for adult readers (clause 9).II.For the successful accomplishment of the objects aimed at in the preceding section certain subsidiary changes seem to be absolutely necessary.(a.) It has long been recognized that burgh and parochial school boards provide an inadequate basis for the satisfactory organization of secondary education. They form a still more inadequate basis for the organization of a system of continuation classes such as is pro-posed in the Bill. It is therefore proposed that the unit of educational organization should be a wider one, corresponding generally to the county, or in certain cases a combination of counties. This arrange-ment will go a long way to solve the difficulties in the way of educational development which arise from the inequality of rating as between neighbouring small districts. For such a measure I am satisfied that public opinion in Scotland is ripe.But it is still a moot point in Scotland as to what the nature of the education authority in these circumstances should&apos; be whether it should be a separate authority for education alone, or, as in England, the general local authority dealing with education as one of its functions through a specially constituted Education Committee. After much consideration, 1 incline to the latter alternative. I have, however, thought it right, in order to safeguard local interest, to
provide that, while maintaining uniformity of rating for the whole area, there should be a large devolution of power of management from the principal local authority, i.e., the county authority, to subordinate authorities for each district of the county, and ultimately to school committees for each individual school. The provisions to this end are contained under the heading &quot; Local Education Authorities&quot; (clauses 1 to 15).(&amp;.) Another point of great importance, though subordinate to the main object, is the determination of a principle on which State-aid should be given to the local authorities toward their expenditure upon education. This is a matter which will ultimately be determined by Minutes of the Department laid before Parliament. The general principle, however, which I have in view is that the aid given should be proportionate to the expenditure incurred, a higher proportion being given in those districts where the expense of making a reasonable provision of education imposes a disproportionately heavy burden upon the locality. The basis of grant will be the expenditure necessarily incurred in giving effect to the approved scheme qf education for the district submitted by the local authority under the provisions of clause 10.This step will involve the abolition of the present sj^stem of Code grants, which are obsoletp and unsatisfactory. I propose that an equivalent of these grants for the year 1914 should be placed in the Education (Scotland) Fund, which would be further augmented by eleven-eightieths of any increase of the votes for education in England and Wales beyond the expenditure incurred in the standard year 191 4. All grants will in future be marie from the Education Fund and the Education Fund alone, instead of from two Spurces as at present (clause 23). In this respect the Bill follows the lines of the Finance Bill of 1914.(c.) For a full realization of the objects referred to in section 1, consideration must be given to the case of denominational, and in particular of Bonian Catholic schools. There is no question that, because of the inadequate resources of managers, Catholic children, who constitute upwards of one-eighth of the school-population of Scotland, are being deprived of the opportunities of education which are afforded by the public schools. There are only two possible remedies for this state of matters : 1. That State-aid to denominational schools should be provided in much fuller measure than to public schools to an extent in fact which would compensate them for what they lose in rate-aid. This solution, having regard to the state of public opinion in Scotland, is clearly out of the question.2. There remains the other solution, namely, that the denomi-national schools providing elementary education should be compulsorily transferred to the local education authority and should be managed by them in all respects as public schools, provision, however, being made for religious instruction, according to the views of the former Managers, being given by qualified teachers who are acceptable to representatives of these Managers both as regards faith and character. This is the solution which I propose. The provisions to that end are contained in clause 20 of the Bill. 1 may add that this solution is not inconsistent with the existing law as to the provision of education in Scotland. There is in that country no equivalent of the Cowper-Temple clause. Each school board has power to give denominational instruction in its schools, and there are boards who in point of fact under the existing law provide denominational instruction in their schools of different types to suit the requirements of different sections of the population.
There has been a certain amount of opinion in Scotland in favour of a body representing the Universities, local authorities, teachers, and other classes of persons specially interested in education being set up as a forum for the discussion of educational questions relating to Scotland. On consideration I have thought it right to give effect to this view by providing for the constitution of an Advisory Council (clause 22). This proposal will not, I think, interfere with the responsibility of the Minister to Parliament, or prevent direct access to him with regard to educational questions by local authorities or indeed by any section of the community.ROBERT MUNRO.November 24, 1917.
