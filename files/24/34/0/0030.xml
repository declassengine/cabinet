This matter had been the subject of negotiia.tii)na...witb th-e-^ren-ch Authorities in Paris at which Mr* Churchill and General &apos;.T. Furse had been present.   The Italian demand was for 600 field guns in addition to heavy guns; no specific promise had been made by the British representatives, but an under-taking had been given to consider the proposal that half the Italian requirements should be met by France and half by this country.    The question before the Committee was, therefore, whether it was possible to provide immediately 244 field guns, 56 heavy guns and 56 howitzers.GBH3RAI MAURICE stated that it was the considered view of the General Staff that owing to our own shortage of 18 pdr. field guns, none could be spared for Italy.   The only guns which we could no-/ spare were -making a total of 196 equipments out of 356 asked for.     He stated that these guns could be spared from guns actually in this country without endangering Home Tefencs, or the progress of training troops.

fce met by denuding   essentials.   However, a Meeting was te be held on Mr^ay next with representatives of the Naral Staff to ret-v.aamine the requirements for Home Defence and^ after this Meeting it was conceivable that the matter mign be re-considered,LORD FRENCH stated that he had no objection to the despatch of the guns suggested by General Maurice.GENERAL PURSE stated that of the 17 - 4^7 guns only 9 had carriages and he regretted that we were quite unable to provide carriages for the remaining 8.   With regard to the&quot; 15 pdr. guns he was informed that there were sufficient stocks of ammunition of this type already in existence,outGESERAI SHAW intimated that as far as his information went the only 15 pdr. ammunition in this country was 1075 rounds per gun for 160 guns.G3HERAI PURSE undertook, at the request of the Committee, to look into the question of aranunition for 15 pdr. guns and to report.MR, CHURCHIII stated that th-e Italian Government had undertaken to replace v-hatever guns were sent by us to Italy for the Italian Army by next Spring, provided we could give them a certain amount of steel, but in view of the fact that during 1918 the present position as regards the fcatio of our Output between shell and guns would be reversed, i.e. our output of guns would be in advance of our output of shell, he recommended that the Italian Government should be asked to give us the value of the guns now proposed to be sent, in the form of Dollar Credits in America, instead of an undertaking to replace the guns in ^ind, he could then arrange for the transfer of those Dollar Credits to Canada, and by this means obtain a continuation of the output of shell in Canada which &quot;yould otherwise have to be stopped.G2MRAI FUR3S undertook to provide an assessment of the value of the guns proposed to be sent.MR. CHURCHIII further stated that he and General Furse were proceeding to Paris for the purpose of further negotiation with the French and Italian Authorities, and. he expressed the hope that in view of the large output of field guns in Prance,  it would be possible to arrange with the French Government to provide the whole of the remainder of the guns required. &apos;MRv CHURCHILL urged the desirability of more ^orn out and half worn out field guns being returned from France during the  inter months for repair or replacement by the 3 ping.QEHBRAI PURSE stated that there ^ere considerable difficulties in carrying this but, but he undertook to see what could bo done in the matter.GENERAL MAURICE, stated that Sir Douglas Haig -*as 60 guns below his proper establishment of field guns, and that heavy artillery fighting still continued at Passchendaele.THE COMMITS decided that:146     15 pdrs. 17 --4.7 guns (8 without carriages) 33 - 5&quot; howitzersshould be dispatched forthwith&apos; to Italy as transp ort became available.hitehall Gardens,S.w.1. 29th Kovember, 1917.
