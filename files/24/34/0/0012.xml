His Britannic ^esty&apos;s Governme-n s g g g g g .From:-(T5iis Document isjhe^ropertyS.MJ. War Office *B.M.A. Petrograd.Handed in 2.11 a.m,.Received   12.5 p..m.26.11*17c28.11.17.Colonel Jones1741tgfrSQ^^ 1526.     It seems probable that the Bolshiviki will remainin power some weeks if not months.     Even Russians who believe in miracles allow that the army is now destroyed as a fighting force and the Bolshiviki will see that no attempt is made to restore its discipline.     Agitation against England on the ground that she is forcing Russians to cSntinue the War for her own ends is increasing daily.     For one paragraph against Germany the press contains six directed against England.     This agitation, if not checked will destroy our relations with Russia after the War.     We have to consider what good we can get out of Russia during and after the War.     I submit that the policy we have so far followed will only lead to further disaster.      It is useless to try to holdv any Russian Governments to strict fulfilment of obliga-tions which nine tenths of the people repudiate, because no Government can collect the force to carry out a policy in opposition to a will of the vast majority of the people.     If the Allies had sent troops three months ago a comparatively small force might have restored order. At present, however, no Bolshiviki Government will consent to receive foreign troops.     There wculd be little actual armed opposition, but the rolling stock would be removed from the Hurman railway and the line would be destroyed rendering the march to Petrograd in winter a very difficult operation.     Japan could easily occupy Vladivostock with, its accumulation of 700,000 tons of stores but this would not affect Lenin and Trotsky.I
I submit for consideration the idea of addressing a letter to the Russian people giving them the option, if they wish, of being relieved of their obligations to tho Allies.     This probably would at all events prepare the way for friendly relations after the War, for it would very soon stop anti-British agitation and show people things in their true light: it: is suggested that such a course will cause little difference to us in the summer campaign of 1918 :-I.      Whether the Russians succeed in making a separate peace with Germany or not, the Eastern Theatre will in any case-absorb very little German man power in 1918. 2.       It would be a positive loss to German moral to be deprived as she would by a peace with Russia,of this ground for chear and spectacular offensives to tone up public opinion after hard knocks in the western theatre.5.     Germany will refuse abandonment of occupied territory.4.     Germany is unlikely to consent to giving back her 2,000,000 disciplined Russian prisoners in exchange for sone 120,000 of her own people who will wander back In any case,5.     Germany can hope for very little supplies the next harvest and the Russian Army in demobilization will destroy evory-thing in Western Russia. G.     If a separate peace were declared Russian Socialists propaganda will cause the German Government more anxiety than the Russian Army ever will. To sum up, I submit that it seems to be almost impossible for Russia and Germany to agree on terms and even if an agreement for a separate peace is reached, we will lose no more than y/o have lost already.If the negotiations break down, we will have shown theRussian
Russian people who their true friends are.     There are,, of course, great objections such as the question of Roumania^ but the position here is desperate and it is useless to wait for the better feelings of the Russian people to assert themselves,     Tho first thing is to prove to them that tne3r are not required as cannon fodder by Allied Imperialists. I have shown this telegram to Admiral Stanley who authorizes me to state that he agrees with every word of it.
