Colonel JonesFrcm :- Gene r a1 Flume r, Italy. To : -     C.I.G.S., War Office.Handed in 10 p.m. 5-12-17. Received 3 a.m. 6-12-17.0.86.The attacks yesterday on 20th Corps front were more serious than was at first apparent.     The Italians have had to withdraw from a number of positions and a further retire-ment in this locality is probable.     The lines of retirement were indicated in Radcliffe&apos;s telegram.     The losses in the fighting were heavy on both sides.     Italians seem to have fought well but to have been driven back by heavy artillery fire and superior numbers.      Even if a further retirement has to be carried out it should be only local and should not materially affect other sectors of the line. On the west of the plateau 22nd Corps repulsed all attacks successfully inflicting heavy losses and taking 100 prisoners all Austrians.     On Piave Italians carried out successful local enterprise near Zenson taking some prisoners.
