15 DOCTOffiHT IS THE., PROPERTY. 01 ,KISJERITAKg.IC HA^STYJ B^OWMOISTjMemorandum from Mr. E.S. Montagu at S&apos;,S. &quot;Kaiser-I-Hind81 itach,  daTed 4th&quot; ITcyember ,&quot;1917, to Sir Maurioe Hankey .I post this Memorandum from Aden in the belief that it may be of some interest to the War Oabinet.   Quite unexpectedly I found myself in Cairo, waiting for a P. &amp; 0. steamer which was a few days late.    I spent my tine enciep.YOur.ing to learn something jf the situation in Egypt,  and I have fumed some opinions, which must be accepted in the spirit in which I f oisnedthem, - that of a traveller keenly interested in all the aspects and concerned with some wf them.   Let me say that I formed a good opinion of Sir Reginald Wingate, I hope not prejudiced by the most considerate hospitality and patient discussion of the matters I asked him about.    He is not perhaps a very clever man,    His great knowledge of this part of the world and his character and manner have given him,  so far as 1 can judge,  a striking hold ovef the respect and affections,   so far as they have any,  of the Egyptians.     This is a tremendous asset,  and in these critical times of very great value. He differs from MacMahon in three particulars.    He speaks French excellently, whereas MacMahon could hardly speak it at all. Maciviahon brought with him, I think,  the attitude of the Indian Political Officer to the Indian, which is very different from,  and in many respects compares unfavourably with,  the attitude of the Egyptian administrator to the Egyptian.   liacMahon necessarily by his slight acquaintance with the country was much influenced,  and in fact is said to have been guided entirely by the advice and opinion of Lord Edward Cecil and Sir William Brunyate.    This has led to two results: one,  a certain amount of sensitiveness at the change of condition due to the replacement of EacMahon by Wingate on the part of those associated with Wingate generally:  and- twos an alteration between what I may call for want of a better word theCRET.WAR    GKBimT.. 2837.
Foreign Office element- oT^the AdminlstraUon arid -the Egyptian ciYil service element of the Administration..   There is no douht whatever that the Egyptian politician is,. In sympathy generally pro-Turk.    It appears that we owe a very great debt of gratitude &apos;3 the first and recently dead Sultan; who put about the belief now current that &quot;-ip-ypt, bexng unable to stand alone must rely upon a protectorate;  that the Turks were aoilO.   ant  that,   regrettable though it was that that should be so,  the Committee of Union and Progress having led the Turks to destruction the only possible protecting Power was Great Britain,  and her interests and Moslem interests were one-    So that although I do not mean to imply that Egypt is disloyal,   the solidarity    of the Mohammedan world is such that,  as in India,   the rupture with Turkey has proved a very serious strain.    It is notorious that the late Sultan accepted the Throne against      , wishes and in face of the criticism of all his relations.   It is still recorded hew the women of the ruling family are delighted at news of Allied reverses or the sinking of British ships.    The late Sultan&apos;s son, by far the most popular candidate for the Throne,  refused it mainly because hia tastes asu not those of office,   (He delights in country pursuits) - but largely also because of his Turkish sympathies *    *he present Sultan is,  I think,  an easily influenced man of not much moral character. He might very easily be led,  if friction occurred,  by stages into a condition of intrigue and disloyalty,  and therefore it is all the more important that Wingate, who is well seised of his charac--ter and who has a very great influence with h.hn;   should remain at his side.1 think that there is no doubt what our policy shouad be.. England;   the biggest Mohammedan Power In the world-  has been forced into hostility to Turkey by a  -accession of causes right from the very beginning of the new order of things in Turkey through the- Balkan war to the present condition cf affairs, yet -War having been     rade there must be Vav.  and T/ar only.
132It Is no use trying to conceal the fact that we are at War with Turkey.   We must hit at the Turl: where ever we find him.   Our policy,  in Egypt at any rate and in the Middle East generally, has &quot;been to &quot;back the Arab against the Turk,    Certain Moslems and (the Turks)have disappointed us and earned our punishment through German machinations.    We should go ahead pinning our faith to the rest of the Mohanmcdt-r. world and encouraging the Arab,  whilst we prove the falseness of the Turkish Mohammedan and do our best to crush him.   With the Arab, of course he is not popular,  except on religious grounds.    The Turkish govern-ment in its oppression and cruelty is hated not only by the &apos; Arab but by the Soudanese,  who also it is said dislike the Egyptians.    It is only on religious grounds in India,  where they have never met him,  and in Egypt among those classes which are really Turkish that he finds friends,  and the quarrel of the Arabs themselves is rather with the Turkish Government than with the Turks.    Whatever the result of the Arab movement may be,  it has been a good War move,  and the one thing that would destroy our influence in the Mohammedan world for ever would, it seems to me,  be now to swap horses.    We have made War on tho Turk; we must finish tho War with the      /Turk.   We must not desert the Arabs whom we have organised against the Turk.    The Turk in his Pan-Turanian movement has given us plenty of mater-ial for demonstrating how really opposed hir ambitions are to Moslem ambitions.    That movement must be used for all it is worth for propaganda purposes, both in Arabia and in India, where the Indian Government has,  i think, been regrettably slew to conduct anti-Turkioh propaganda.    That slowness is an examph of what I mean when I talk of an endeavour to conceal the fact that we are at War with Turkey.    We must play the Arab a*u the non-Turkish Mohammedan,  and flatly confess cur hostility to Turkey now; we cannot draw back.    The late Khedive was always intriguing, with considerable success,  among the Arabs.   His efforts have been really used by us,  but they were conducted
193by him because of &quot;his belief in.his -^m--Xiin.uenoe -^ivh .the Arabs, but were promising to be successful really and truly so far as I can discover, because of the British prestige among the Arabs.-  But there can be little doubt that his visit to Constantinople is likely to lead to a new attempt to rally the Arabs.   Ehat I think will probably occur will be that the Germans will instruct the Turks.to pretend to be ready tc negotiate a peace with us;  to try and get us to daily with the notion; then to proclaim what we are doing to the Arabs,  and  -;et the Khe.di.ue to try and see whether he could not raise the Arabs on his side against us, because     .of our willingness now suddenly to make friends with the Turk- and astute game which,  from all - hear,  is likely to be quite important and interesting.   The results of General Allenby&apos;s efforts will effect this more perhaps by giving our alleged readiness to conciliate the Turks an air of veracity     I am sure no one in England will forget the smallness of the fences with which we deal with the Middle East,  and the fact that a Mohammedan up-rising from the Sudan,  where the Turk is loathed,  through Egypt,  Syria, Arabia.  Mesopotamia&apos;; Afghan-is tan would be a very alarming prospect likely to upset all our calculations in this War.Another objection to a peace with the Turk would be the grave danger cf a d-ermanised Turkey on the flank cf Egypt.   And in this connection I would urge the Cabinet,  even at the risk of asking them to re-read a few sentences from the very full statements I have made cn the subject before^, to remember the dangers resultant from Zionism.    I am not now going to repeat the arguments of tie uusuitacility of Palestine;  of the fact that it would be serious for us to interfere with its existing inhabitants;  of the fact that,   in my opinion it is far more absurd to discuss Pan-Judaism than to consider cur old friend Pan-Islamism; but I want to repeat that Zionism had its origin,  and still is mainly recruited,  among the Central Powers
194and that a Zionist population of Palestine, means a Germanised Palestine.So much for the opinions I have formed, put as shortly as I can,  out here in Egypt.   And now I want to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention,  if I may,  to a reconstruction problem arising out of these matters.   We have now declared a Protect-orate over Egypt, and this is likely to be permanent.   It would perhaps be impertinent for me to say that I am perfectly con-vinced, from what I have heard and seen,  that we were right to choose a Protectorate rather than annexation, and that having started on a Protectorate our good faith is involved in sticking to a protectorate and dismissing ideas cf annexation altogether from our minds.    I believed it helped us, vis-a-vis Kahommedan opinion, very much that we did not interfere with the Kahommedan facade.    I believe it would have been fatal, having decided on a Protectorate, having thereby induced the family of Mahomet Ali and the public men of Egypt to take part in our new form of Government,  to have decided on annexation after the death of the first Sultan.    That is the first factor.The second factor is this.   Whatever is the.future of Arabia, and whatever is the future exactly of Mesopotamia,  and whatever is indeed the future of Persia we shall find ourselves with large Mahommedan interests of great Imperial importance stretching right from India to the Western boundaries of Egypt.   I myself am not of opinion that our relationship with the French in these areas will be- very, difficult; our negotiations have so far gone so smoothly that no difficulty need be anticipated there; but the Italians will present, in a growing degree, difficult problems of diplomacy.   They have been very troublesome; they are hardly on speaking terms with the French in many parts of Egypt; they are jealous of their rights; crooked in their methods; suspicious of motives. \7h*ther it is with the Senousi in Abyssinia, in. Somaliland or in the Yemen.the Italians are going to be very difficult,
and &quot;by their lack of administrative capacity and of a facility for dealing with tribal questions are likely to land us into ,dangcrs and difficulties.   This is partiularly the case with the Senousi, for there the Italians are the chief,  and indeed the only,   obstacle to a satisfactory settlement.-Sow the main problems of this   vast area of country are administrative or political,  and are hardly comparable with ordinary diplomatic activities; yet they will be under the charge *.f the Foreign Office,   the most suitable Office to take charge of them,  for they relate so closely to diplomatic considerations that they cannot be divorced from them.On the othel; hand,  it does seem to me that they ought not to be left to the ordinary staff of the Foreign Office,  chosen and recruited mainly from among people of diplomatic experience The difference of these problems connected with annexed or protected areas from ordinary diplomatic activities should be emphasised by the creation of a special Department of the Foreign Office, under,  I think,  a separate Permanent Under Secretary,  for it seems to me too large a question lo leave under the control of the permanent head of the Foreign Office. whoe\Ter he may be.Then,  too, I think we ought to consolidate the interests and co-ordinate the control of Mohammedan problems in the British Empire, and for that purpose I believe that there shouh be some union between the new Department of the Foreign Office and the India Office.   The situation in India as regards these problems is somewhat similar.    We have there a Foreign Depart-ment which strikes me as being too weak for its responsibility and I am going to discuss its organisation with Lord ChelmsforcL It,  like our Foreign Office, has its quasi-administrative or Protectorate responsibilities and its diplomatic responsibiliti Whilst leaving all these- in the Foreign Office as they are now, I would increase the reparation of the Native States nroblem
from the problems of the external relations of India.    Further I would separate the western problems of India&apos;s external relations from the eastern,  within the Department of course. I would tentatively suggest that negotiations and consideration of Chinese,  Japanese,  Tibetan, Mongolian questions should be separated from Persian, Afghan, Arabian questions.    Thus then the British Foreign Office would approach this great British protected Mohammedan world from its Eastern side,  while the Indian Foreign Office would approach it from the Western side. Is it not clear that these two Departments of the State,  the India Office and the Foreign Office,  with their common interest in the Mohammedan question,   ought to be associated so that their activities may be co-ordjnated and conform with one another?    I would therefore,   suggest that the new Deportment of the Foreign Office and the Western Department of the Indian Foreign Office which I contemplate should be brought under the Middle East Committee which has been devised forthe War,  and should be made permanent.    It is perhjvos too- si way 3much to hope   that there will/ bo a Minister without portfolio of the position and interests and knowledge of Lord Curson; but a Committee at which the Moslem problems of the India Office and the Moslem problems of the Foreign Office could be discussed together; a Committee at whose meetings such problems as were common to the whole area should bo considered; a Committee which would bring Indian experience and policy and Foreign Office experience and policy into harmony with one-another; a Committee which would go far tO ensure a common trend of policy in relation to other countries interested in the same matters; a Committee like the Middle East Committee should be a permanent   feature of British Imperial Organis-aticn.    This would be another step in the cure of Department-alism in the British organisation.    The Foreign Office has already arranged a sort of co-ordination between the Board of
Trade--and itself on. commercial que sdions^ J&amp;y-su^gestlon is for a not   incomparable,  although not closely analogous co-operation with the India-Office on moslem questions.    The Committee would consist of the head of the new Foreign Office Department and the Permanent Under Secretary of the Foreign Office,  together with the Secretary of the Political Department of the India Office as essential permanent officials; and the politicians there would be the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India as essential politicians.    (I use the word &quot;essential&quot; because I do not wish to exclude any others who may be suggested).    This is in rough outline,  as coherently dictated as I can on board ship, the scheme that I have in mind, and which I would dedicate to the- particular notice cf Lord Curzon; who has interested himself so valuably in these matters,  and to the CabinetPerhaps I may add, by way cf postcript,  that it is quite clear to me that there are national aspirations and desires for autonomy in Egypt as there are in India,  fomented by extremists but existing to a greater or less degree, nascent or vigorous, in the minds of many, many people in Egypt.   I am certain - and I think Sir Reginald Wingate woulu agree with me - that this problem will have to be Taced in Egypt in&apos; Che future.    That it will be as difficult as the Indian question is perhaps not probable.   Such education as exists is probably less isolated and fciore evenly distributed than it ,is in,India. The better social relationship - (I speak with no certainty on this subject) ** which seems to exist in Egypt leads to the absence of one of the complications of the Indian situation, for it has, always seemed to me that political pride in India has arisen largely from social conditions.   And, finally and mainly, the greater homogeneity of the Egyptian populs/tion
and the uniformity of its -Mohammedan cree^makes &quot;the problem far simpler.   But I must predict with confidence, neverthelessthat in the future, and in the no distant future, the spirit of nationalism, strengthened by the events of the War and based upon pride of country, will have to be considered in Egypt.   The very separation of Egypt from Turkey, the very acknowledgement of an Egyptian country and nation, will make this less remote than it would otherwise have been.(Signed)   E.S. Montagu.4/11/1917.
