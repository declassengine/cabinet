rr?fag Boesmeat is the Eroperfey of His Briteak M^attys to^gpigisL]j jco^Mntial.Foreign Office, December 4, 1917.I UNDERSTAND that during my absence in Paris a statement has been made about my supposed connection with Lord Lansdowne&apos;s now famous letter, which gives an entirely false impression of what really occurred.I have not yet had an opportunity of reading the letter in question, but from all I hear it must have gone quite outside the subject discussed hi the following correspondence.Of course, I have been aware ever since I read a Cabinet communication which Lord Lansdowne circulated to the members of the late Government, that he and I differed profoundly on the subject of the war. But 1 saw no reason to-differ from him in thinking that certain gross misrepresentations circulated by the Germans as to our peace terms might be contradicted with advantage. It never occurred to me that on this peg could, or would, be hung anything in the nature of a plea for immediate negotiations for a general peace.(Private.) a.My dear Arthur, Lansdowne House, November 16, 1917.You told me I might send you a sketch of the kind of question which I thought might be put to His Majesty&apos;s Government in either House.  Here it is.The wording could no doubt be improved, and I ami afraid you will think the moment inopportune.You will see that I have left No. 6 (territorial aims) quite vague. This because I realise the force of your objection to singling out the claims of any particular country as ranking in front of the rest.If a parliamentary question is inadmissible, could you not make an opportunity of saying something of the same sort in reply to pacifist misrepresentations of our war aims.You are, it seems to me, sure to receive another peace overture before long, and I should be greatly reassured if I knew that you would at any rate seize that opportunity for making clear your attitude as to the points with which I have dealt.Yours ever, .l.Printed for the War Cabinet. December 1917. -   2.(Draft.)To ask His Majesty&apos;s Government-Whether, in order to meet the misleading statements which are constantly made as to the objects with which this country is waging war, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared ^o state -1. That they do not -seek to bring about the destruction or dismemberment of. the Central Powers. ....2. That they do not desire to impose upon those Powers any form of Govern-ment other than that of their own choice.3. That they do not desire to destroy or paralyse those Powers as trading com-munities, but that they are determined to secure for this country, from sources upon which it can depend, an adequate supply of the essential commodities.4. That they are prepared to examine in concert with other nations the great group of international problems, some of them of recent origin, which are connected with the question of &quot; the freedom of the sea.&quot;
5. That they will insist upon the adhesion of our enemies to an international arrangement under which ample opportunities would be afforded for the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, and of such a nature as will make it hereafter impossible for any Power to provoke a sudden war until an attempt has been made to bring about a peaceful solution.6. That our general aims as to territorial questions have been stated in broad outline. That we recognise that no complete settlement of these questions can be reached without full discussion, but that such a discussion has been rendered impossible by the refusal of the Central. Powers to put forward a corresponding statement of the aims which they have in view.L.November 16, 1917.(Private.)My dear Lansdowne, Foreign Office, November 22, 1917.T do not know that this is a very suitable time for discussing peace matters. I rather think not. But I send you the following observations, for what they are worth, on the various. statements which you propose to elicit from His Majesty&apos;s $Government by question in the House of Lords or by some other method.1. That they do not seek to bring about the destruction or dismemberment of the Central Powers.1. I certainly do not desire the destruction or dismemberment of Germany, if by &quot; Germany &quot; is meant that part of Central Europe which properly belongs to the German people. I do not think, therefore, that the transference of Alsace-Lorraine to France, or the recreation of so much of the historic Poland as is really Polish, constitutes dismemberment. But the Germans think differently, and this intro-xluces the inevitable ambiguity into the proposed answer to your first question.2. That they do not desire to impose upon those Powers any form of Government other than - -      that of their own choice.2. A similar ambiguity attaches to the proposed answer to your second question. I certainly do not, for example, desire to compel Germany to adopt full-blown Parliamentary institutions; but I do want to see a form of Government established in, say (German) Poland, to which Germany would strongly object.These observations, which are true of Germany, mayssurely be applied,&quot; mutatis mutandis,&quot; to Austria also.3. That they do not desire to destroy or paralyse those Powers as trading communities, but that they are determined to. secure for this country, from sources upon&apos; which it can depend, an adequate supply of the essential commodities.3. I quite agree that we do not wish to destroy Austria and Germany as &quot; trading communities &apos;&apos;; but nothing ought to be said which hampers the attack on German commerce as a war measure, or (if it should prove necessary) the threat of post-war action in case Germany shows herself to be utterly unreasonable.4. That they are prepared to examine in concert with ether nations the great group of inter-national problems, some of them of recent origin, which are connected with the question of&quot; the freedom of the sea.&quot;4,.As regards sea power, it has to be observed: (a) that the phrase &quot;freedom of the sea &quot; is extremely vague, and is differently interpreted by different Powers; (6) that the abuse of sea power should not be distinguished, either in logic or in law, from. the abuse of land power; and (c) that it is a subject which concerns neutrals as much, or almost as much, as belligerents, and cannot, therefore, be decided at any conference where belligerents alone are represented.5. .That they will insist upon the adhesion of our enemies to an international arrangement under which ample opportunities would be afforded for the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, and of such a nature as will make it hereafter impossible for any Power to provoke a sudden war until an attempt has been made to bring about a peaceful solution.5. This last criticism applies also to this, but, of course, we are all in favour of if.
The above correspondence is all that has passed in writing between me and Lord Lansdowne before I left Paris, but we walked away from St. Margarets on Monday week (28th November), and he again raised the subject in conversation.He told me, if I remember rightly, that he had read the sentences relating to peace terms in my speech welcoming M. Venizelos (see extract below), that he thought my criticisms on his proposed questions in the House of Lords were sound, and that he had come to the conclusion that he had better proceed by way of public letter rather than by way of question, in either House of Parliament.I agreed to this procedure assuming, as I was surely entitled to assume, that the letter would contain those parts of his proposed question to which I had raised no objection and would contain nothing else of moment. It was, of course, only in reference to the subject, thus restricted, that I authorised any appeal to Lord Hardinge while I was absent in Paris.Lord Hardinge was quite qualified to represent my views on these points, and it was only with regard to them that I authorised his being consulted. I append a statement by Lord Hardinge as to what passed between him and Lord Lansdowne in this connection.A. J. B.Extract from Speech made by Mr. Balfour at the Mansion House in honour ofM. Venizelos.-Referring to the arguments by which the Germans pressed their point of view on Greece and the rest of the world, Mr. Balfour said they no longer contended that German domination was a blessing. Their new argument was that the Entente Powers desired the destruction of Germany and her trade and the imposition on her people of a form of government not chosen by themselves. &quot; The destruction of the German Empire,&quot; he continued, &quot;has never been a war aim of the Entente Powers. The destruction or injuring of German trade is not a war-end; it is a war measure, and a most legitimate war measure. We recognise fully that each nation should be allowed to make for itself the government which suits its history, its character, and its ideals. I only mention these German arguments for the purpose of saying that never for a moment did they cloud the clear vision of M. Venizelos,. From the beginning he has always felt that the interests of his country were bound up with the interests of the Allies.&apos;&apos;Minute by Lord Ho,rdinge.On Tuesday, the 27th November, I received a message from Lord Lansdowne asking me to call at his house on my way home. I thought that he probably wished to speak to me on some correspondence which I had had with him about a certain Mr/Pilling who had asked him for an interview. -On reaching Lansdowne House, I talked to Lord Lansdowne about Pilling, and he then said that there was another matter upon which he wished to speak to me.  He had written to Mr. Balfour, and had expressed a desire to raise, in the6. That our general aims as to territorial questions have been stated in broad outline. That we recognise that no complete settlement of these questions can be reached without full discussion, but that such a discussion has been rendered impossible by the refusal of the Central Powers to put forward a corresponding statement of the aims which they have in view.6. I am in general agreement with this, though., perhaps, I might be inclined to make some changes in the wording.Did you notice something that I said at the Mansion House last Friday in my speech on Venizelos, with regard to Germany and Peace terms? I am not sure whether it was reported, but in saying it I had our conversation in mind.Yours ever,A. J. B.    ,
House of Lords, a discussion on the war and war aims, and had submitted a certain number of questions. To this Mr. Balfour had replied that he deprecated any such discussion, as the points he had put to him were of a controversial nature. Un Monday, the 26th November, he had met Mr. Balfour coming away from the Memorial service to Neil Primrose, and had then told him that he had given up the idea of raising a debate in the House $f Lords, and had decided to write a letter to the press. He would have liked to submit the letter to Mr. Balfour but, in view of Mr. Balfour&apos;s departure for Paris on the following morning, he would be unable to get the letter ready in time, but he asked that he might show the letter to me in order that the letter should not contain any points of detail or inaccuracies that might conflict with the views of the Foreign Office. Mr. Balfour had agreed to this proposal, saying &quot; Hardinge knows my views.&quot; He, therefore, handed to me his letter, asking me to read it and to criticise any points contained in the letter that might occur to me.Lord Lansdowne made it clear to me that the decision to send the letter to the press was, as he has since expressed it, &quot; chose jugee,&quot; and that my assistance was invoked, with Mr. Balfour&apos;s approval, simply as a technical expert. In no other capacity would I have consented to express an opinion on the contents of the letter.I read the letter with care, and made a few technical criticisms, some of which were accepted.The only remark that I remember making was an expression of my personal opinion that the ]etter might be of some use in demolishing the theory of our desire for the complete destruction of Germany, and from that point of view it might do good.I have since seen Lord Lansdowne, and he confirmed the statement that I made to him in the above sense of what had passed between us. At the same time I told him ,that I thought he had made a great mistake in telling Lord Burnham that Mr. Balfour knew all about the letter, and that I had approved it. He admitted that it was so.  Both statements were incorrect.H.December 5th, 1917.
