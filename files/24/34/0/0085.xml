mimm ionj76th December 1317.32P3BN QIP toTfflAY,, Naval Staff Mosiorandum f6r. the Vay, p^ihnt...1.    Tho alteration of conditions due to the lapse of tiiae lias necessarily carriod with it variations of the A&amp;iriraliy &quot;views regarding tho advantages or othorwise of Norway entering tho war on tho sido of tho Allios.For tho information of tho Foreign Offioo and tho War Cabinet, therefore, it is desirable to stato tho case as it presents itself to tho Admiralty under existing conditions.2.    The entry of America into the war has extended the naval resources available, vvhile tho development or mining apnldxmpea and submarine detecting devices has at last made it possible&quot; to oonstruot a, barrier across the North Sea which it is hoped will in a substantial measure bo offoctivo against submarines.It is proposed to institute this barrier next Spring.i3.    The efficiency of the barrier would be greatly increased with a base in Norway, as an air patrol could then be carried out over the Eafrtorn portion.    Without a base in Norway, this is not possible.A baso at, say, Stavanger would enable tho support of the vessels patrolling the Eastern portion to bo carried out far more easily and efficiently, and with greater economy in light cruisers,   and at the same time it would be possible to employ on patrol work small craft of loss value in place of destroyers.      This would entail a total increase in the number of these less valuable small craft, but would result in considerable economy in destroyers.A strong f oroe based on Stavanger would protect not only the patrols on the Eastern side but also those on the Western^ and, in addition, this force would be in a favourable position for intercepting any forces operating against our coasts or attempting to break out into the Atlantio.4.    The objections to bases on tho Norwegian coasts Which previously weighed with the Admiralty are all altered in marked degree by the developments referred to above..The consequent increased efficiency of the North Sea Barrage would make our oversea communications safer, and less oraft would be required for the protection of commerce elsewhere.As regards the merchant tonnage required to serve the forces at tho Norwegian base:   the difficulties, so far as our forces are concerned, are little greater than at : -; Scapa;  while as regards any American forces, practically all their stores (other than a certain amount of coal) will have to cross the Atlantic, and after the barrage is madeeffective
9oeffectivo it is rtaas^torial  whether thoy proceed to Norway or to a British port.So far as the purely Naval arguments go , there is a substantial balance in the advantages which would arise if Norway, of her own free will or under compulsion from Germany entered fehe war on our side.As regards the necessity of supplying munitions and equipment to Norway, the ease as stated above premises that Sweden is kept out of the war, so that the only protection required by Norway (other than that against direct invasion from Germany, which could be given by the Navy), would be in the way of anti-aircraft guns and of aeroplanes to guard against an excessive number of air raids from Germany,    At present those guns and aircraft could only be found by taking thorn from other important services, and if this protection were given, tho probabilities of the factories supplying munitions to the Allies being destroyed are not great, Judging by past experience in England,NOTE.-     One of the Electro-Chemical Works which produces tho Carbide for the Germans is near Priodrikstad, South of Christiania, and close to the Swedish frontier.    Those which produce chemicals for the Allies are for the most part 100 miles or more from the frontier.6.    The British Military Staff, in a letter dated November 2nd 1916, and confirmed in June 11th 1917, urge that from the Allies1 point of view there are grave mjjjj&amp;gy. ohiections to Norway entering the war on our side.Those objections are:-(a) It would be impossible for us to take over tho defence of Norway, even for a short period, owing to the lack of men,(b) To send a large force of aircraft and of anti-aircraft guns with personnel would impose a great strain on our resources.(c) Norwegian electro-chemical factories, which supply the Allies with essential munitions, would be liable to bombardment from the air.(d) Germany would have a pretext for invading Denmark.Of these objections, the first three only hold good in tho event of, Sweden entering the war against Norway consequent on the latter joining the Allies, for a strong Naval Force based on Norway would prevent serious German landings on her coast.With regard to objection (d), it may be observed thftt Germany would never lack a pretext were it at any tine to heradvantage
.   .....advantage to invade Jutland. This objection^ thersftKre^ is.^--s^arcely valid.r7.   ji ffwefleii entered i&amp;^p&amp;ja^aaLJte^^e saair-p^rrequipped Norwegian Army could not hold put long a.nd it would only be a question of time before Norway was^osgjrrun by the powerful Swedish Army.   .Under these conditions,&quot;&quot;!:!^ Navy flfould not remain in occupation of Norwegian bases without considerable military assistance which cannot be provided.It is therefore essential that the attitude of Sweden in the event of Norway joining the Allies9 should be kfaown with certainty&apos;beforehand, 1 -The invasion of Jutland by Germany, wou^Ld tM matpriallj alter the&apos; naval situation.8.    Thi case mav be summarised as follows! It isy.pi,early to our advantage, from a Naval point of view, to persuade Norway to ajLlow us the use of Stavanger as a base (provided the anchorages are suitable). ,/&apos;1 It is quite clear that Norway will not/ato be persuaded into what is likely to be a tad bIt is also clear that we are not prepared to offer any considerable military assistance to Norway.If Norway asks guarantees greater than we are prepared to give, or if she considers it likely that Sweden would attack her, the possibility of obtaining a base in Norway falls through. 1The matter would appear to be one entirely for the decision of Norwayi   but as long as we can guarantee what Norway requires, we should do all in our power to bring her in on our side.The seizure of *t tese in Norway  without trie latter1 s eonsant4 should,not be attempted,, as we should than be in honour bound to give them unlimited assistance.llow herself -argain for hefchShould. Germany,take the initiative in violating Norwegian neutrality, we&quot; should at once Seize Stavanger and take steps to prevent ttyo use by the enemy of other bases in Norway for their submarines,NOTE.-       If Sweden takes hostile action against Norway the occupation of Stavanger or other bases by us would be dependent on Military assistance to hold them against land attack.

General Summary of certain Papers relating to Norway.a,per.inted Paper&apos;om Sir W. - .rtson,CIGS ted Nov.2/16The action of Norway in prohibiting the entry of submarines into Norwegian Territorial Waters has given great offence to Germany, and has opened uo the prospect of Norway being involved in the war.    The paper therefore discusses (amongst other things) the advantages and disadvantages to the Entente from the entry or Norway into the War.It points out that if Norway entered on the side of the Entente it is unsafe to put aside all thought of Swedish action against Norway, in which case the Swedish Army is so much bigger and better equipped that unless assisted the Norwegian Army could not offer much resistance.Germany would probably over-run Jutland, and would be in an advantageous position f r carrying out air raids against Kristiania, against Notodden (North of Larvik), where ammonium nitrate used by the Allies is produced, against the $in&amp; works in the Sarpsborg dis-trict, and against carbide factories at Odde.From a military point of view it would be disadvantageous to the Allies to have Norway join them.A similar conclusion is come to regarding the question from a Naval point of view.Note.-     The arguments from the naval standpoint appear to be less certain than thjjse on which the military conclusions were based, and in any event the naval aspect of the problam has been substantially altered by the subsequent adherence of the H.S.A. to the Allies.anslation of tter No.8663 oia General fm Joffre to ]r W,Robertson ted Dec. 11/16The letter, with attached memorandum, discusses the possibility of aggressive action by Germany against Norway, with the assistance more or less disguised of Sweden.    It points out that the two areas where Sweden would have the greatest interest and the greatest facility of establishing herself are at Narvik and at Trondheim.It urges that from a naval point of view arrangements should be made for the rapid execution of the following measures:-(a) The occupation of Christiansand and the establishment at this point of a considerable Naval force.(b) The closing of the entrance of the two Fiords of Narvik and Trondhjem.From a military point of view the Swedish Army can mobilise from 150,000 to 200,000 men, plus 150,000 Landsturm and 20,000 men of Garrison Troops, as compared with a Norwegian force of 725,000 men, plus 30,000 Landsturm.The paper argues that the Allies should con-sider and prepare for the landing^of English or Anglo-

If she does not the safety of Norway would depend upon whether Britain or Prance could spare sufficient troops for its defence.This is a letter written by the Admiralty to the Commander in Chief, Grand Fleet, saying that in the event of Norway being forced by Germany to declare war against her we would propose to base a detached squadron at Christiansand.The papers begin with two long wires from Sir M,Findlay, H.M. Minister at Christiania, discussing the possible effect of the American participation in the war. The commodoties chiefly imported by Norway from America are oil, cereals, meat and copper.    The principal Norwegian exports to Germany are nickel (from K.N.R.)* carbide and ferro silicon from Hafsland, and such fish as.can be exported.    Norway urges that Germany will attack her if she cuts off further supplies of nickel, carbide or fish.    Sir H. Findlay suggests that America should refuse to allow her to have oil. copper, or food, unless she stops supplying Germany with nickel and carbide, but that if this were done America should guarantee Norway against attack from sea or air.Sir M* Find lay&apos;s wires were seint roundnby the Foreign Office to the Admiralty and comments invited thereon.    The Admiralty reply dated May 7/17 points out that the suggested policy of the United States would carry with it certain disadvantages:-(a)   They could not guarantee the safety of Norway(b) Any naval commitment undertaken by the United States to Norway might reduce the assistance given in anti-submarine work in the Atlantic, and also reduce the amount of merchant tonnage they can put at the disposal of the Allies.(c) Might gravely interfere with the supply of ammonium nitrate and alramiiiium to France through the Germans bombing the Norwegian Electro-Chemical plants.In spite of the above the Admiralty&quot; consider the advantages of stopping the supplies to Germanyagainst air attack.
0 0 QcJ U 0outwBiidi the counter disadvantages so long always as the United States are prepared to Undertake the liability that in the event of Germany declaring war they (the U.S.A.) will send a sufficient naval force and other equipment to Southern Norway.     They suggest, however, thait the French Government should take part in any discussion on the subject.There appears up to July 1st to have been no complete reply from the Foreign Office to this letter, but they have evidently been an touch also with the       ^ War Office on the subjects- as they send to the Admiralty a paper F,0. 116212 dated June 17th/17, having attached a letter to the Foreign Office from the-Director of Military Intelligence dated June 11/1917 adhering to the views expressed by the General Staff in their paper1 on the situation in Norway dated Nov. 2/16&apos;&apos; (and summarised above) &quot;unless it can be certain that there is no possibility of Sweden taking hostile action against Norway&quot;.The Director of Military Intelligence summarises the military objections to Norway1 s inter-vention (though he states that these may be outweighed by the naval advantages of such intervention.)The military objections are :-(1)   It would be impossible for us to take over the defence of Norway, even for a short period, owing to the lack of men. .;.(2)   To send a large force of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns, with personnel, v/ould imposed &apos; great strain on our resources, which are still inadequate to our needs, ...

Apparently the Admiralty wrote agiin to the Foreign Office on July 5th asking for a reply to Jheir letter of May 7th.On July 10th the Foreign Office wrote to the Admiralty referring to a letter from the Admiralty dated July 5 (no copy in file) enclosing copy of the letter from the Director of Military Intelligence (summarised above) and&apos;saying, that, as the views of the Director of Military Intelligence conflicts so materially with thsse expressed by the Admiralty in their letter of May 7th Mr. Balfour does not feel&apos;he can take : &quot;any -further action with the      .* United States until a definite policy has been agreed, upon by the War Cabinet,   He suggests, therefore, that the Admiralty should submit the matter1 once more *&quot;or the consideration of the War Cabinet.On July l^ih/17 the Admiralty wrote to the Foreign Office saying that there appeared to be some misapprehension as regards the question of co-operation of the United States in naval operations off the coast of Norway, as what the Admiralty desired to secure was that any economic action recommended to the United States should have as its correlative a scheme of preparedness for naval assistance and that the Admiralty is now doubtful whether the economic policy has not since been adopted without the other side of the matter having been adequately considered*  Whether or not^ however, the economic action of the united   .   &apos; States is likely to lead to rupture bet?/een Germany and Norway, the probability of such rupture has had since - :i to be considered in connection with the incident of the bomb carrying courier.    The Admiralty are not .-now proposing that any steps should be taken to      &apos; encourage Norway to enter the war, but are concerned &quot;; that all naval preparations should be made in view of that possible contingency, and that they, therefore want to know whether the United States are prepared to supply substantial Naval assistance if Norway does enter The war. .On Sept, 3/17 a telegram was sent to Sir C, Spring Rice at Washington stating the information, required by the Admiralty  and suggesting that the presence in London of Admiral Mayo afforded an opportunity of arranging extent and nature of American Naval assistance as regards Norway.   The telegram also stated that the British Naval Staff recognise disadvantages which may follow from Norway having to enter the war, but had made plans to meet that eventuality and desired to know to v/hat extent the United States would co-operate.   A copy of the wire was sent to Sir M, Findlay (Christiania),08624
Wda (2nd Sir M. Findlay replied- &quot;fcgr telegram dated Sept.I) dated 4th that, he ^did^nD^-um^stand the statement thatt, 7/17 &quot;the &quot;British Naval Staff recognise the disadvantagesIraqis frali&quot; of Norway entering the way&quot; in view of a previous&apos;litfs of; war  Admiralty opinion contained m Telegram No .2781, daS Mating which stated that they &quot;no longer view with anxiety SfiSt 7th.     or even disfavour11 the entrance of Norway into the . &quot; &apos; war on the Allies side.   This was discussed at aWar Cabinet meeting, when the 1st Sea Lord explained that the apparent discrepancy between the two opinions of the Naval Staff referred to was caused by the altered conditions duo to the lapse of time i.e. the progress of the enemy submarine warfare and the increased demands on our naval resources due to the necessity of convoying.   If Norway entered the War on tM Allies side it would be necessary to appropriate tonnage to maintain the British forces at the overseas bases, it would divert a number of small craft to Norwegian waters, and if the United States cruisers and battleships were stationed at Norwegian base it would require a further withdrawal of tonnage and more allied lines of communication requiring protection from us.   The First Sea Lord admitted, however, that we should be in a better position to help Norway in the Spring and that there might be then an advantage in her joining ur.*.It was therefore decided -by the War Cabinet that Sir M. ffindlay should be&quot; advised &quot;of the change in circumstances which for the time being made Norway*&apos;s entry in the war undesirable from the&quot;naval Doint of view  but to instruct him without actively encouraging the Norwegian Government to g) to war not to discourage them if any question arose or their standing firm against German pressure&apos;.&quot; &apos;NAVAL STAFF 6/12/17.
