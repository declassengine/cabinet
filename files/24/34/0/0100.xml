3rd December, 1917.

General Manikovski and Marushevski were arrested at 5 a.m. and reason unknown. I have pressed view at General Staff there should not be a strike as in Ministry of Marine. Foreign representatives left the Stavka last night.

From British Intelligence Mission.

To D.M.I.

Petrograd,

4th December, 1917.

N.R.1544.

1.p.m. General Manikovski and Manikovski and Marushevski have not been released yet. They were cross examined up to 3 a.m. Former was arrested because in order to counteract general nervousness he sent round a circular assuring officers that no one could be removed from his position without his concurrence. Charge against latter is that he asked to be removed from his post rather than partake in the signing of armistice. The President of Russian peace delegation is Yuffe, a Jew and there are nine members. They are accompanied by two naval and six military officers as advisers. It is stated that no communication has yet been received from the ? (group omitted) by the Government. I was warned yesterday that Trotski wished to arrest the Ambassador and me but hear to-day that other members of Government opposed it. I cannot help fooling that if Allies had sent instructions more quickly we might have saved Dukhonins life. It is unfair to expect anything from Russian officers. They are quite powerless.
462Tiflis.5,12.17,Prom:General - Shore.To:* 119In their declaration of Policy the IS candidates of Transcaucasus temporary Government after detailing a distinctly socalistic programme, said, guided by reports of conditions obtaining on Russian western front and in agreement with wishes of inhabitant of Caucasus they would talce most energetic steps towards immediate conclusion of peace.President explained privately to allied Agents that this ostensibly BOLSHEVIST programme did not represent real feeling of government or people who were -anti ? Bolshevist, but if not supported they night be forced to conform to Bolshevist tnotice as they possessed no resources of their own.
4 inprom:-  Brig,General Shore.. Tiflis.6.12,17.To;-     D*M*XtT.Lt 503 December 5th,* Chief of Staff Caucasus front has given me the following information only when a favourable reply is received from Turkish Command to/ Prjevalski&apos;a proposal will the actual conditions of an armistice be considered by a meeting of representatives.   At present no cessation of hostilities has taken place and probably orders have been given that no fraternization is to occur.   Two regiments have already, however, left their positions! others have declared their intention of leaving by January 1st,   In reply to my query as to why we had only been told of the proposed armistice today when it was received on the 30th November, Chief of Staff assured me it had been kept absolutely secret and that General Prejevalski wished to refuse it absolutely but was over ridden by War Minister Donskoi and president of Temporary Government Gegeohkhori,On December 10th a special meeting is to take place here with lead of Kuban, Don and Terek Cossacks with a view to settling if possible! a united Caucasus and military and political questions.   Chief of Staff is of opinion that these Cossacks will be absolutely against armistice,   A regiment is to be sent here from the Southern froni for maintenance of order; the town is quiet,*   Gen. Lebedinski, /   C.-in-C, Caucasus.
