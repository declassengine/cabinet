pDEPARTMENT. OF AGRICULTURE AND TECHNICAL     , , INSTRUCTION FOR IRELAND.j]Sf0TES- ONTHE.TILLAGE (IRELAND) GENERAL ORDER--1918.A-GENERAL OBLIGATION OF OCCUPIERS. OF ARABLE LAND TO CULTIVATE &quot;MINIMUM TILLAGE PORTION.&quot; &apos;1. The Third Schedule to the Corn Production Act; 1917, makes it the duty of every occupier of arable land in Ireland to cultivate and maintain in cultivation a portion of the arable land held by him (re-ferred to in the Schedule as his &quot;holding&quot;) not less in extent than the &quot; minimum tillage portion&quot; as prescribed by an Order Of the Depart-meht.For the purposes of the Order an occupiers &quot; holding&quot; is therefore the total area of arable land in his occupation in Ireland.    If he holds two or more farms the   minimurn^tiUage portion&quot; of bis &quot;holding&quot; will he based on the total area of arable land comprised in all the farms but the selection of the farm or farms on which the requisite cultiva-ticn will be, carried out is, under the Act, left to his discretion.2. Arable land.--The expression &quot;arable&quot; means capable of being tilled.    Building lands, if arable, come, therefore, under the Order as do also demesnes save parts thereof on which timber would in-terfere with the cultivation or harvesting of crops.3. Non-arable land.--Thc following are regarded as non^arable and do not therefore come within the scope of the Order:--Rough mountain grazing,; unreclaimed bog ; sand dunes ; land. regularly subject to flooding; land under timber or land newly planted, for forestry purposes ; and land on. jvhich the. cultivation and harvesting of crops would be interfered with by timber..    &quot; ,       .,4. Explanation of &quot; minimum tillage pprtion&quot; of foldings in 1918.  The Order (kno\yn as the Tillage (Ireland) General Order. 1918) jnade by the Department prescribihg the minimum tillage portion of holdings for the year 1918 requires, subject to certain exceptions, occupiers to cultivate 5 per cent of their arable land in.addition to.an area.equal, to that which was required to ,be cultivated in I917 by the Regulation then in force.    In 1917 occupiers were required to cultivate 10 -per cent of their arable land in addition to an .area equivalent to that. cultivated in 191.6. The additional 5 per cent for 1918 means, therefore, that occupiers are required to cultivate in that year a.total of 15 per cent of their arable land in addition to an area equivalent to that cultivated in 1.916..... ....    ;.        : .The Order does not, however, require any occupier to cultivate or maintain in cultivation more than 50 per. cent of his holding,5. Holdings on which a greater area was under cultivation in 1917 . than was required by the Defence of the Realm Regulation. If ah oc-cupier had under cultivation in 1917 more of his holding than was re-quired by the Regulation ior that year he is not obliged in ,1918 to increase the area under cultivation by 5.per cent, of his arable land.In such a case it is sufficient to mabtain in cultivation ^,1918 the same acreage as in 1917 and to cultivate in addition only such an area as may be necessary in order to have in cultivation, in 1918-(1) 15 per cent of the arable land, &quot;and(2) an area equivalent to that, if any, cultivated.in 1916.-- \
The following table sets out three cases of-the increased area re-quired by-the Order (i) of an occupier who complied exactly with the. 1917 Regulation and. (2) and (3) of occupiers-who cultivated in 1917 more than was required by the-Regulation :-Case : number.	Total ,area of land held by occupier	1 otal arable land	Area, cultivated in 1916	. Area required to be cul-tivated in 1917	Area . actually cultivated in 1.917	Area required to be cultivated in 1918	Increase in area re-quired to be under cultivation in 1918 as compared with 1917.(1) .    (2) (3)	acres &apos; 130 130 130	acres .100 100 100	acres 5 5 5	acres 15 15 15	acres -15 18 20	acres 20 20 20	acres 5 2 nil6. total area of arable land the basis for calculation of the additional area to be cultivated-As in 1917 the additional area to be cultivated is to be calculated upon the total area of arable land, not upon the total area less the acreage cultivated in 1916. Thus a person holding say 100 acres of arable land of which 20 acres were cultivated in 1916 is required, in 1918, to cultivate 35 acres, (i.e. 20 acres plus 15 per cent of 106 acres) and not merely 32 acres (i.e. 20 acres&apos;plus 15 per cent of the area not under cultivation, in-1916; namely 80 acres).1.--meaning of term &quot; cultivation &quot;--the definition of the term &quot; cultivation&quot; is as follows: - &apos; &quot; Cultivation&quot; means tillage, and the expression &quot;cultivate&apos;&quot; has a corresponding meaning.     Provided that land used for- grazing or meadow or pasture in any year shall be deemed to be cultivated in that year if it was tilled in either of the two years last preceding that year.z-meaning of the term &quot; tillage.&quot;-the term &quot; tillage&quot; comprises ploughing together with the subsequent operations necessary for the production of a crop.9. land under temporary grass (1st and 2nd crop hay, 1st and 2nd year&apos;s seeds, rotation grasses). The proviso in the definition of the term &quot; cultivation&quot; means that land.sown down in, 1914 or 1915 with grass and clover seeds or grass seeds and either cut for hay or grazed, in 1916 will be deemed, to have been cultivated in 1916. Similarly in arriving at the requisite area of cultivation, in 1918, land sown down in 1916 or in 1917 with grass and clover seeds orgrass seeds, and either to be cut for hay or grazed in 1918 will be deemed to be cultivated in 1918.&quot;\q.-^-2nd year&apos;s grass in 1917.-From the previous paragraph it will be observed that land under 2nd year&apos;s grass in 1917 will not rank as cultivated in 1918 if left in grass m that year. It must, therefore,, be borne in mind that on holdings where there was in 1917 an area, under 2nd year&apos;s grass, whether mown or grazed in that year, such, grass must be ploughed up or an equivalent area broken&apos; out of older grass in order merely to keep the same area of land in cultivation in 1918 as was cultivated in 1917, and that the increased area to be cultivated in 1918 under the Order must be broken out of grass sown down prior to 1915.
53This may perhaps be illustrated by reference to the procedure ofarmers who prior to 1916 were cultivating part of their holdings on ,ne or other of the general rotations under, which all their tillage fields vere in due course laid down temporarily to grass. These farmers ndntained approximately the same proportion of their land under :om, roots, 1st crop hay, etc., from year to year by breaking up innually about the same acreage out of grass. Under the compulsory tillage regulations these fanners are required to continue that practice ind also to plough up out of grass such further area as suffices to meet (he requirements of the Tillage Order.Thus, for example, in the case of a holding of 100 acres of arable and on which there was in 1916 a cultivated area of 15 acres and on uhich as required by Regulation 2P of the Defence of the Realm Regulations 25 acres were under^ cultivation in 1917. the Order requires Ihe cultivation in 1918 of 30 acres. If, however, the area ranking ascuHivatediin 1917 comprised 3 acres of 2nd year&apos;s seeds (i.e. 3 acres cf grass sewn down in 1915) the occupier-must to comply with the Crcer either plough up these 3 acres and also 5 per cent of the arable land (he. 5 acres) out of older grass or plough up 8 acres out of grass ;cwn down prior to 1915. The latter will of course be the more general procedure because it is the usual practice to take a hay crop [cr one or two years after land is sown down, with grass and clovers ind then to.graze such land for at least two of the following years.11- Winter Cereals. Land sown in the winter of 1917-18 with ivinter wheat, winter oats, or rye, will be regarded as cultivated in 1918, even though the crops were sown prior to 1st January, 1918.12. Orchards. Orchards will for the purposes of the Order be re-garded as cultivated.13- Conacre tiilqge. If an occupier arranges for the cultivation of his holding in 1918 by another person &quot;or persons under a conacre agreement such cultivation will, as in 1917, be regarded by the De-ff.rtment as cultivation by the occupier.Where, however, a. person other than the occupier is on the 1st September, 1918, entitled under a conacre agreement to the use of. the land on which wheat or oats are produced in 1918 that person shall be substituted for the occupier for the purpose of any payments in respect of the wheat or oats under Part I of the Corn Production. Act, 1917.,&apos; ;      .      .      ,,&apos;    , B.-EXEMPTIONS.14.-Certain lands are excepted from the requirements to the 1918 Order. The following is an extract from the Schedule of the Order ivhich sets put such lands : &quot; (1) Any holding of less than ten statute acres in extent. (2) Any holding or any portion of a holding in regard to which . the Department are satisfied that the land comprised therein (a) has been required and regularly used in the year 1917, and is required in the year 1918, for the grazing of milch cows, the milk of which is used, as whole milk, for human con-sumption ; or for the production of hay as food for such. V      cowS;; or for both these purposes ; or
(b) is required in the year 1918 for the carrying on .of - - .&apos;. &quot;industry other than agriculture and that its, use. for the &quot;aforesaid purpose would be of greater service in national interests than its cultivation ; or-(c) has been required and regularly used in the year 1917, and is required in the year 1918 for the accommodation, for periods not exceeding ten days at a time, of stock intended for disposal at auctions, fairs or markets, or for shipment, or for the accommodation, as aforesaid, of stock held over from... . auctions, fairs or markets ; or:[d) has been required and regularly used in the year 1917, and is required in the year 1918, for the accommmbdation of cattle or sheep intended for slaughter within fifteen&apos;days of their being accommodated on the holding ; Vir &quot;ic) has been required and regularly used in the year 1917, and is &quot;required in the year 1918, for the maintenance of a stud Of high-class thoroughbred horses ; orif) has been regularly used in the year 1917 as the track of , race-course or as a paddock, ring or other enclosure ad-jacent to the stand or stands of a racecourse, and is so required in the year 1918 ; or-(g) has been regularly used by an agricultural or industrial Society as their Show grounds, and is &quot;required for this pur pose in the year rgr8 ; or &apos;(h) is required in the year 1918 for naval or military purposes.15. -Special provisions for the maintenance of the milk supply.-Trom the foregoing extract from the Schedule it will be seen that the -exceptions from&apos; the 1918 Order correspond, broadly speaking, with the exemptions from the-1917 Regulation, but are/somewhat wider&quot; in their scope, particularly as regards lands required for the main-1 tenarice of the milk supply.-In this connection, the Department desire it to be knojvn that they are prepared to consider applications for exemption of lands to be used in 1918 for the production of milk destined forhuman consumption -as whole milk, although the lands were not used for that purpose in 1917.16. Complete Exemption. In the following cases an occupier is relieved from any obligation under the Order to cultivate any-part of his holding in 1918 :- -,(a)  If the whole of the arable land in his occupation is less than ten statute acres.   (The fact, however, that any particular farm . . cpmprises less than .10 acres of arable land does not relieve the occupier of his liability to cultivate the requisite proportion in ; respect of the farm if he holds elsewhere in Ireland another farm, C*r farms, and the total area of arable land held by himlsat least ten statute acres).ip) Tf the whole of the arable land in his occupation, comes within one or more of the other exceptions set forth in the Schedule.
.....   7: ., :    &apos;   317. Partial Exemption.-kn occupier is relieved in part from the re--quirements of the Order in the &quot;following cases;: \a) More than 45 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the holding cultivated in 1917. If in 1917 more.than 45 per centj but,less:than 50 pei cent, of the holding was in cultivation, the occupier is required in 1918, in addition to maintaining in cultivation the same area as in 1917, to increase the area under cultivation only by what-ever percentage is necessary in order to bring the total area under cultivation in 1918 up to 50 per cent of his arable land. (If 50 per cent or more of the holding was under cultivation in 1917, the cultivation of 50 per cent in 1918 meets the require-ments of the Order).(J) Exemption of part of a holding. If portion of a &quot;holding comes within one or more of the exceptions set out above in the extract from the Schedule to the Order, the acreage to which the Order applies is the arable land comprised in the residue of the holding. Thus, for example, a person occupying 100 acres of arable land, of which 40 acres are excepted as town dairymen&apos;s grass lands, would, for the purposes of the Order, be regarded as occupying not more than 60 acres or arable land. If, after allowing for the excepted portion, the residue of arable land does not amount to at least 10 statute acres, no part of the holding, need be culti-vated.(c) Special Tillage Order. If a holding comes within a class of hold-ings as to which a special Order has been made by the Depart-ment, the provisions of the Tillage (Ireland) General Order do not apply to it except in so far as the special Order may provide. The classes of holdings in respect of which such Special Order has been made are enclosed racecourses and golf links, and on these the retirements are the cultivation in 1918 of 10 per cent of the arable land in addition to ah area equivalent to that, if any, under cultivation in 1916. If, however, portion only of a holding is used as an enclosed racecourse or golf links, and. the residue of the holding comprises 10 statute acres or more of arable land the provisions of the General Order will apply to this residue..1.8.-Application for Declaration of Exception from. Requirements of. the Order. Procedure in respect of lands exempted from provisions of 1917 Regulation.-Any occupier whose holding was wholly or partially exempted in 1917 from the requirements of the Tillage Regulation then in force, by reason of the lands coming within one or more of the classes of holding exempted under that- Regulation, or who received from the Department a declaration that all or part of his lands was exempted&apos;, may, if the lands in question were used- in 1917 for the purpose for which they were exempted and are^ to be used in 1918 for the same purpose, regard them as excepted from the 1918 Order also, unless;he has already received, a-notification:.torthe contrary from the Department, or is so notified prior to 31st January, 1918&apos;.19. Procedure in other cases. Clause 2 of the Order provides that if. an occupier desires to satisfy himself that his holding or. portion thereof is excepted from the requirements of the Order, he may apply to the Department for a declaration to that effect. Such, application must, however, be: made, on the&apos; prescribed form, prior to 15-th&apos; Deecenfc-ber, 1917, and before the applicant is supplied with the necessary: foHn -
lie must, to jrfstify the Department in inquiring into the case, furnish sufficient evidence that his holding or portion thereof is required in 1918 for one or more of the purposes set forth in Clause 2 of the Schedule to the Orcer.Intending applicants accordingly- when asking for a Form of Appli-cation should set out: (1) the manner in which the holding in respect of which a declaration.- is desired, was used in 1917 ; (2). the manner in which it is proposed to use the holding in 1918 ; (3). the full name and address of the occupier of the holding ; (4). :the location and area of the holding.20.-lodgment of. application does not relieve the occupier of the obligation to cultivate. The onus of proof that land should be excepted from the provisions of the Orderlies on the occupier, and he will not be relieved of the obligation to cultivate simply by the fact that he has made an application for exception.C-PENALTY FOR NON-COMPLIANCE &quot;WITH THE ORDER. 21.-The&apos;Third Schedule to the Com Production Act, 1917, under which the Department have made the Tillage (Ireland) General Order, 1918, provides (i) that an occupier who dees not comply with the Order is liable to pay, to the Department, a penalty of  5 for each acre of the minimum tillage portion of his holding which he fails to cultivate in 1918, arid (2) that such penalties collected by the Department shall be applied by them for the purposes bf agriculture and other rural industries within, or in connection with, the county or counties in which the holding is situated. Where there has been a change of occupiers during the year, the amount of the penalty shall be payable by the person who was occupier at the end of the year.- 22. lands not used for the purpose for which they were exempted.  A declaration of exception is of course only valid in case the lands, are used for the purpose for which the declaration is granted. An occupier who obtains a declaration of exception in respect of his lands, but who dees not use them for the purpose for which they were ex-cepted, must, therefore, cultivate them to the extent prescribed by the Order in regard to non-excepted lands.D. POWER TO REQUIRE AGRICULTURAL RETURNS.23.-Under Section 15 of the Corn Production Act, 1917, the occupier of any agricultural land, or the person having the management of same, is required, if so notified by the Department, to furnish the Department with particulars respecting the cultivation of the land, the crops-and live stock, thereon, and the owner thereof.Refusal or neglect to furnish such particulars, or the making of a false return, is punishable by a fine not exceeding tvyenty pounds, or if the Court is of opinion that the offence was committed wilfully, by imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a period of three months.Moreover, under Sub-section 9 of Regulation 2p of the Defence of the Realm Regulations it is the duty of an occupier of a holding to furnish&apos; to the Department, if and when so required by them, such particulars with respect to the holding and user thereof as may be required by the Department for the purpose of that Regulation, and. an occupier who fails or neglects to comply with such requirement is guilty of a summary offence against the Regulations.November, 1917.&apos;
