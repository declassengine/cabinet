409APPENDIXto theFINAL BEPORT OF THE COMMITTEE.i.POST-BELLUM TARIFF POLICY AND BRITISH COMMERCIAL TREATIES. (Memorandum furnished by the Board of Trade.)1. A number of proposals are now current for (1) the penalising of enemy trade after the war by the imposition of heavy duties on goods of enemy origin imported into the United Kingdom, and (2) the promotion of trade with our present Allies by, inter alia, some amount of preferential customs treatment. The purpose of the present memorandum is to examine, in a preliminary manner, the practicability of these proposals, having regard to the provisions of our existing commercial treaties.2. No commercial treaty existed between the United Kingdom and Germany prior to the war the United Kingdom received &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treatment in Germany in customs matters by virtue of a biennial law; the commercial treaties between the United Kingdom and Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria were, of course, terminated by the war. If, therefore, H.M. Government should be in a position, on the termination of the war, to refuse to enter into any arrangement, whether in separate commercial treaties or in the treaties of peace, giving the three at present enemy States named above the right to &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment in this country, there would be no obstacle to the imposition of differential duties on goods imported into the United Kingdom from those States.3. Such a differentiation, between Allies and neutrals on the one hand, and present enemies on the other, would be practicable without any disturbance of the existing commercial treaties of a general character to which the United Kingdom is a party; the proposal to go further and to give preferential treatment to the Allies, involving possibly a four-fold import tariff  (a) Imperial, (6) Allied, (c) Neutral, (d) Enemy, might necessitate the denunciation of some or all of our commercial treaties, other than those with Allies, which give the contracting parties reciprocal &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; rights in respect of customs treatment.4. The following statement indicates the present treaty position:  I. The Allied States.In France British goods are entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment by virtue of a legislative enactment, and not by treaty right (customs duties are expressly exempted from the scope of the Anglo-French Commercial Convention of 1882, which guarantees reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment &quot;in all other matters&quot;). With Belgium our commercial relations were regulated by a provisional modus vivendi dating from 1898, and terminable by three months&apos; notice on either side. There are commercial treaties, providing for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment, in force between the United Kingdom and Russia* (1859), Italy (1883), Serbia (1907), Montenegro (1910), and Japan (1911). The commercial treaty concluded after very prolonged negotiations with Portugal^ which would establish reciprocal right to most-favoured-nation treatment, has not yet been ratified.II. The Neutral States.(a) In Europe there are modern commercial treaties, with provision for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of customs duties, in force between the United Kingdom and Switzerland (1855), Greece (1886), Roumania (1905), and Portugal (1916). In the case of Denmark, the United Kingdom is entitled by the Treaty of 1670, confirmed in 1814, to receive the treatment accorded to the most-favoured-nation other than Sweden. As regards the two other Scandinavian kingdoms, the Commercial Treaty of 1826 between the United Kingdom and the kingdom of Sweden and Norivay provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in the matter of customs duties; the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905 was claimed by H.M. Government as undoubtedly affording them &quot; the right to examine, de novo, the &quot;treaty engagements by which Great Britain was bound to the Dual Monarchy; &quot; but the Swedish and Norwegian Governments both intimated their desire to continue those engagements in. force &quot; pending a further study of the subject.&quot;The Treaty of 1661 between the United Kingdom and Sweden, which is presumed to be still operative, appears to provide, in Article IV., for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of all that relates to trade and commerce.In the case of the Treaty of 1837 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, there is an important limitation to the general principle of most favoured-nation treatment. Article I. of that treaty provides that the contracting parties shall not &quot; grant any favour, privilege, or &quot; immunity in matters of commerce and navigation to the subjects of any other State which &quot; shall not be also, and at the same time, extended to the subjects of the other high contracting &quot; party, gratuitously, if the concession in favour of that other State shall have been gratuitous; &quot; and on giving as nearly as possible the same compensation or equivalent, in case the concession &quot; shall have been conditional.&quot;* This treaty was denounced by Russia in October, 1917. . t This treaty was ratified in May, 1916, and came into operation in the following September.(14132-40.)

As regards Spain, our commercial relations are at present governed by the exchange of notes of 1894, which, provide for a continuance of the pre-existing most-favoured-nation regime, which is, however, terminable at six.months&apos; notice on either side.(6) Outside Europe, there are commercial treaties, providing for reciprocal and uncondi-tional most-favoured-nation treatment, between the United Kingdom and the United States (1815) the Argentine Republic .(1825), Bolivia (1911), Colombia (1866), Honduras (1910), Mexico (1888), Nicaragua (1905), Paraguay (1884), and Venezuela (1825-34).In the Treaty with Costa Rica (1849), it is provided that any &quot;favour, privilege, or &quot;immunity whatever, in matters of commerce and navigation&quot; which either contracting party may grant to a third party, shall be forthwith extended to the other contracting party &quot; gratuitously, if the concession in favour of that other nation shall have been gratuitous, or &quot; in return tor a compensation as nearly as possible of proportionate value and effect, to be adjusted by mutual agreement, if the concession shall have been conditionaL&quot; The same provision appears in the Treaty with Liberia (1848).There are at present no commercial treaties between the United Kingdom and the following countries:-Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, San Domingo, Cuba, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile and Uruguay (the treaty with the last-named country came to an end in December, 1915). With a number of other countries Abyssina, Persia, Siam, China we have treaties which do not confer on the other contracting party any commercial rights in the United Kingdom.5. There appear to be two methods by which special treatment in respect of customs matters could be accorded by the United Kingdom to the Allies: (1) It would be possible, after the establishment of a general tariff, to maintain all our existing commercial treaties in force, but to grant to each of the Allies reductions of the general tariff rates of duty in respect of classes of goods in which they are particularly interested, those classes of goods being so selected that the reductions would be of no practical use to the other States to which they would be nominally extended by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clause in their treaties. (2) Alter-natively it would be possible to denounce the commercial treaties with neutrals, or such of them as are important from this, point of view, and to give to the Allies an all-round reduction, not necessarily uniform, of the general tariff rates, thus establishing maximum and minimum tariffs somewhat on the Erench model, except that presumably there would be for British Possessions a still lower scale than the minimum tariff, and for enemy goods a surtax on the maximum tariff. The first of these methods would follow the German practice; the second is that which France has adopted.6. The obvious advantage of the first method is that it does not involve any denunciation of any of our existing treaties, or any departure from the interpretation of the most-favoured-nation principle which the United Kingdom has generally maintained (some treaty exceptions have been noted above). Its defects are that, as Continental experience in the last three decades has conclusively shown, it requires for its effective application to a wride range of commodities great tariff specialisation. There are no doubt an appreciable number of commodities in respect of which deductions from the general tariff rates could be accorded to the Allies without requiring the construction of a very detailed general tariff and without such reductions substantially benefiting such neutrals as might be entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment; a list containing a number of examples of such commodities (other than wines and spirits) is given in Appendix I. It will be observed that in this list, which represents a sub-stantial volume of trade, Russia has only a limited share; and in view of the predominance in her export trade of agricultural and forestal products which are exposed to the competition of the United States, the Argentine Republic, Sweden, Norway, and Iioumania, it is not easy to see how any very substantial preference can be given to her under the system now being con-sidered. For the rest, the list in Appendix I., which could no doubt be extended, appears to afford a basis for preference negotiations with the Allies, though the potentialities of United States and Swiss competition must be taken into account.7. The second alternative that of maximum and minimum tariffs involves the abandon-ment of that interpretation of the most-favoured-nation principle which the United Kingdom has frenerally maintained (though we departed from it for a time, as noted above, between 1837 and 1850), namely, that the treaty right of one contracting party to most-favoured-nation treat-ment entitles it to the gratuitous benefit of any tariff concession which the other contracting party may make to a third party, even though that concession may, in fact, have been purchased. It is this European interpretation of the principle, as contrasted with that of the United States, which has resulted in that increasing specialisation of tariffs, wherever the doctrine was recognised, to which reference has been made above; we have protested so far as we could against the adoption by South American States of the United States doctrine, though we have been forced to recognise it in the case of that country itself; and the policy of a minimum tariff for Allies and a maximum tariff for neutrals is not compatible with the recognised prin-ciples on which the great majority of our existing commercial treaties have been negotiated.8. If, however, the policy of preferential treatment for the Allies be decided upon, it would apparently not be necessary to denounce all existing British commercial treaties. Those with the Netherlands, Costa Rica, and Liberia are not inconsistent with the suggested new policy, and continuance of most-favoured-nation treatment to a number of other states. i.e., allowing the entry of their products at minimum rates, would not affect the trade of the Allies: the trade interests of Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico. Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela do not compete with those of the Allies, and are not likely to do so, and our treaties with those countries might therefore stand. The same observation applies to the treatv w.i&apos;th Greece. A brief statement of the imports from the countries named is given in Appendix II.9. The treaties which nresumably it would be necessary to denounce would conseouentlv be those between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, the Argentine Republic,
tteninark, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Eonmania, and tlie arrangement established by the exchange of notes with Spain.The period of notice required for the termination of these arrangements is, in the cases of the treaties with the United States, Switzerland, and Eoumania, twelve months. In the case; of the treaty with the Argentine Republic, there is no provision for termination; the same remark applies to the Danish Treaty of 1670. The exchange of notes in respect of Sweden and Norway seem to contemplate changes in- the existing regime at the will of either party, whilst the exchange of notes with Spain provides for the termination of the most-favoured-nation regime at six months&apos; notice on either side.10. Appendix III. shows the imports into the United Kingdom from, and the exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures to, (1) the Allied countries, and (2), the States having with the United Kingdom Treaty or other arrangements which, as suggested in the pre-ceding paragraphs, it might be necessary for BT.M. Government to denounce in order to make preferential customs arrangements with the Allies. The adoption of that policy would no doubt also affect our trade relations with the Netherlands, in spite of the provision above quoted of the Treaty of 1837. The average value of our imports from the Netherlands and Dutch -Possessions for the four years 1910-13 was 25&apos;9 million  , and of the exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures thereto 19&apos;7 million  ; adding these to the totals shown for Group II. in Appendix III., the final result is:  Average annual value of trade, 1910-13, with Allies :Imports, 127&apos;1 million  .   Exports of produce and manufactures of the United Kingdom, 85&quot;4 million  . Average annual value of trade, 1910-13, with countries having treaties which it is suggested would have to be denounced :Imports, 262&apos;9 million  .   Exports of produce and manufactures of the United Kingdom, 102-8 million  .11. Certain important considerations are suggested by this list of countries and the summary trade figures :- (a) The economic development of the Argentine Republic has been mainly due to British capital and enterprise; any preferential treatment to Eussia in respect of grain might therefore affect adversely some important British interests. There may be good grounds for giving the Dominions preferential customs treatment over the Argentine in respect of grain; there is no very obvious reason why that preference should be extended to Eussian grain; and in view of the trade ambitions and efforts of the United States in South America, it is important that nothing avoid-able should be done to weaken our trade relations with the Argentine.(b) Discrimination against Norway will penalise a country which has on the whole been markedly less difficult than the other Scandinavian neutrals during the war, and with which it is probably advisable that the most friendly relations possible should be maintained.(c) The cessation of &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; relations with, and discrimination against, the Netherlands, Siveden, Denmark, and Switzerland might have the effect of making those countries more ready than they have hitherto been to listen to German proposals for closer commercial relations proposals which are certain to be made and pushed after the war.(d) The possible effect on our trade with the United States of the denunciation of the Treaty of 1815 will need careful examination; it is, of course, possible that the cessation of our grant of most-favoured-nation treatment to that country might be followed by retaliation. Certainly the German-American trade interests there would make every effort to bring about retaliatory measures.(e) Connected with this question of trade relations between the United Kingdom and the United States is the problem of Central and South Americail trade. There our position is already not entirely satisfactory, as we have no treaties with the important States of Brazil, Chile,, and / ruguay, and there is constant pressure on these and other Central and South American States to enter into closer trade relations with the United States. The denunciation of our treaties with the United States and the Argentine Republic, and the abandonment of our interpretation of the most-favoured-nation doctrine in favour of something closely akin to the U.S.A. principle, might tend to deprive us of such influence as we have hitherto been able to exert to prevent such rapprochement to our disadvantage. It is, of course, possible that, so far as concerns Central America and the northern portion of the South American continent, nothing that could be done would prevent the ultimate predominance of United States trade interests; but in the Argentine Ptepublic and Chile it may be that our present position could at least be maintained.(/) If the suggestion in the preceding paragraph as to the certainty of the increase of United States commercial interests in Central and South America be sound, it is probably advisable that every effort should be made to consolidate and strengthen our positions elsewhere, and to take advantage of the present political conjuncture for that purpose. Whatever arrangements may be come to with the Allies, however, it is very desirable that they should not be such as to exclude the possibility of similar, though perhaps less extensive, arrangements with such neutral States as Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Argentine, and Chile with which our present political and/or commercial relations are close and satisfactory.(g) The balance of advantage as between the two policies of tariff preference and maintenance of existing commercial treaties on the one hand, and preference with denunciation of some of our treaties on the other, must necessarily be determined largely by the weight attached to the considerations to which attention is drawn in naragraphs (3)-&apos;C5^ above, and the extent of the concessions which the Allies are prepared to make to the United Kingdom.Board of Trade,1st August, 1916.

NAVIGATION CLAUSES IN COMMERCIAL TREATIES. (Memorandum furnished by the Board of Trade.)The commercial treaties which govern onr maritime relations with foreign countries cover a period of more than 250 years. Most of them are relatively modern, hut some, especially those with the old maritime Powers, such as Sweden, Denmark, and Spain, and even France, Holland, and the United States of America go far back. In the interval the mercantilist system, with its rigid enforcement of the navigation laws, has gradually given place to a policy of laissez faire. An important breach was made in the navigation laws in the last decade of the eighteenth century, with the recognition of American independence and the admission of United States vessels to British ports; and from this time forward the laws were relaxed more and more, until their final repeal in 1849. This gradual transition has left its mark on the treaties, which were indeed largely the instruments by which, on the plea of reciprocity with other countries, our policy was modified, and it is in consequence generally unsafe to draw any conclusion from a given treaty without reference to its date.The present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as regards navigation is indicated in the provisions of the Model Draft Treaty which we now seek to incorporate in any new treaty negotiated with a foreign country. It will be convenient to take these provisions as a basis for comparison with those which actually occur in the extant treaties with other Powers. It has been assumed that treaties with enemy countries have lapsed, though the privileges afforded by the capitulations (such as coasting trade) will no doubt be maintained for all the Allied countries in respect of such portions of the Turkish Empire as may pass to any one of them as a result of the war.We have no treaty with Belgium, our relations being governed, so far as commerce is con-cerned, by a modus vivendi which accords most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment to each party; it is not clear, however, that the modus vivendi extends to navigation, though doubtless most-. favoured-nation treatment is in practice accorded by each country to the other without question.Certain Latin American countries have refused to enter into treaty relations with us. In most cases our vessels have nevertheless been treated on a national basis and have even been admitted to the coasting trade. There is, however, in some cases a &quot; Pan-American tendency which will need careful watching. The countries with which we have no treaty are:   Guatemala, Salvador, Panama, Brazil, Uruguay (treaty has just expired), Chile, and Ecuador.The following are the dates of the treaties which in the main govern our maritime relations with various Powers :  (a) Allied Countries : Russia, 1859. Portugal, 1916.France, .1826 and 1882. Serbia, 1907..Italy, 1883. Montenegro, 1910.Roumania, 1905. Japan, 1911.(b) Neutral Countries in Europe: Sweden, \ 1R9r Netherlands, 1837 and 1851.Norway, fX0M&apos; Spain, 1713. !Denmark, 1670 and 1824. Greece, 1886.(c) Other Neutral Countries : -U.S.A., 1815. Peru, 1850.Mexico, 1888. Colombia, 1866.Costa Rica, 1849. Argentine, 1825.Honduras, 1910. Venezuela, 1825.Nicaragua, 1905. Liberia, 1848.Paraguay, 1884.The navigation provisions of the treaties may be conveniently summarised under the following heads:  (1) General Freedom, of Navigation, i.e., liberty to come with ships and cargoes to places in the territories of the contracting parties. The Model Draft stipulates for full national treatment in respect of privileges, favours, &amp;c, when the subjects and vessels of either country are already in the territory of the other.The clause is important, as on it depends the opening and closing of ports to foreign shipping.(2) The Stationing, Loading, and Unloading of Vessels in Ports, Docks, Roadsteads, and Harbours. The Model Draft gives National Treatment.(3) Duties of Tonnage, Harbour, Pilotage, Lighthouse, Quarantine, $c. The Model Draft gives National treatment.(4) Discrimination by Vessels (e.g., differential flag duties). The object of a clause to this effect is especially to prevent the goods, &amp;c, of a particular country being subject to differential treatment according as they are carried in vessels of one country and not in vessels of another. The meting out of different treatment to goods imported in British vessels from that given to goods imported in foreign vessels (unless in some cases those of the country of origin of the goods) was one of the principles underlying the policy of the navigation laws. The Model Draft prohibits such differentiation absolutely and further stipulates for National treat-ment under this head.
(5) General Most-favoured-Nation- Treatment in all Matters relating to Navigation.  There is generally a provision to this effect in the treaties, the object being to /secure to the countries negotiating a treaty any privileges which may be accorded to third countries, either now or in the future, not covered by the provisions of the treaty in question.(6) Reservation of the Coasting Trade (and Fisheries). The fisheries of a country are always understood to be reserved in the absence of an express stipulation to the contrary, and the coasting trade is now generally reserved, though the Model Draft stipulates for most-favoured-nation treatment. --(7) The Position of British Possessions under the Treaties. An indication is given below of the general position of the self-governing Dominions, India, and other Colonies, with regard to the treaties; a more detailed account would involve a considerable amount of labour, but it could no doubt be prepared, if necessary.;(8) Definition of National Vessels. -This may become important if we penalise German shipping after the war and the Germans decide to run their vessels under neutral flags.Provisions as to wrecks and seamen deserters are hardly of importance for the present purpose, and have accordingly been omitted.(1) General Freedom of Navigation.The Model Draft (Article 1) provides that &quot; there shall be between the territories of the &quot; two contracting parties&apos;reciprocal freedom of commerce and navigation,&quot; and further that (1) the subjects or citizens of the two contracting parties shall have liberty freely to oome, with &quot; their ships and cargoes, to all places and ports in the territories of the other to which subjects &quot;of that State are or may be permitted to come, and (2) shall enjoy the same rights, privileges, &quot; liberties, favours, immunities, and exemptions in matters of commerce and navigation as are &quot; or may be enjoyed by subjects of that State (absolute national treatment in both respects).&quot;There are similar provisions in our treaties with Italy, Roumania, Serbia, Greece, Honduras, and Nicaragua.In the case of Russia, Japan, and Colombia, as regards (1) there is liberty to come only to places or ports to which other foreigners are permitted to come, though subject to this reserva-tion national treatment* is accorded as regards (2).The treaty with Portugal, on the other hand, affords national treatment as regards (1), but omits. (2) the reason being that Portugal ha? deliberately reserved the right to differentiate in favour of her own shipping as regards certain dues.The treaties with Norway, Denmark, and Spain, do not contain these provisions. An old treaty with Sioeden allows &quot; the people and subjects of the respective conntries to trade arid have &quot; commerce in all places where commerce has hitherto been exercised in what goods and rrier-&apos;&quot; chandise they please, and may freely import and export the same,&quot; and gives most-favoured-nation treatment as regards (2); but it mnst be considered doubtful whether the provision really covers navigation at all. As regards Holland, there appears to be only a stipulation for general freedom of navigation in respect of (1), and most-favoured-nation treatment :\n respect of (2).The treaties with the United States of America, Costa Rica, Peru (&quot;other nations&quot;) Argentina, Venezuela, give most-favoured-nation treatment as regard (1), but contain no pro-vision similar to (2).There are no provisions under either head in the treaties with France, Montenegro, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Mexico, Paraguay, and (?) Liberia._ *(2) Stationing, Loading, and Unloading of Vessels.Article 13 of the Model Draft (which gives full national treatment in the above respect) xeads as follows :  Article 13.-In all that regards the stationing, loading, aud unloading of vessels in . the ports, docks, roadsteads, and harbours of the territories of the contracting parties, no privilege or facility shall be granted by either party to national vessels which are not equally granted to vessels of the other country; the intention of the contracting parties being that in this respect also, the vessels of the two countries shall be treated on the footing of perfect equality.The treaties with the following countries provide for national treatment in respect of the above facilities: France, Russia, Italy, Roumania, Japan, Greece, Nicaragua, Honduras,! Colombia, Paraguay, Argentina,! Venezuela.%National treatment could probably be claimed under other articles of the treaties with Serbia (second part of General Freedom of Commerce and Navigation clause above referred to) and Costa Rica (Article IX.).: Most-favoured-nation treatment only is accorded by the treaties with Portugal and Mexico, whilst similar treatment could no doubt be claimed indirectly under the general most-favoured-aiatiori clauses of the treaties with Serbia, Montenegro, Holland, g Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain, Liberia,! Costa Rica.&apos;g* In the case of Russia &quot; subject to regulations generally applicable to foreigner .&quot;f But &quot; the two Governments reserve the right to grant special privileges to their national vessels &quot; when engaged in rendering mail or other Government service.&quot; a% Loading and unloading of vessels only.5 Conditional most-favoured-nation treatment only (see below).
Unless the United States of America and Peru can claim rights under the General Freedom of Navigation clauses of their treaties, it is difficult to see how they can claim at all.(3) Duties or Tonnage, Harbour, &amp;c.Article 14 of the Model Draft (which gives full national treatment in the above respect) reads as follows :  Article 14. No duties of tonnage, harbour, pilotage, lighthouse, quarantine, or other analogous duties or charges of whatever nature, or under whatever denomination, levied in the name of or for the profit of the Government, public functionaries, private indi-viduals, corporations, or establishments of any kind, shall be imposed in the ports of the territories of either of the Contracting Parties upon the vessels of the other country which shall not equally, and under the same conditions, be imposed in the like cases on national vessels in general.   Such equality of treatment shall apply to the respective vessels from whatever port or place they may arrive and whatever may be their destination. The treaties with the following countries provide for national treatment in the above respects:-France, Russia,* Italy, Roumania, Japan (also most-favoured-nation treatment). Denmark j  Norway,   Sweden,  Holland,!   Greece,   Siberia,  U.S.A.,  Nicaragua,  Honduras. Paraguay, Colombia, Argentina (for vessels of above 120 tons only), Venezuela.National treatment would probably be claimed under other articles of the treaties with Serbia (second part of General Freedom of Commerce and Navigation clause above referred to) and Costa Rica (Article IX.).Most-favoured-nation treatment only is recorded by the treaties with Portugal and Mexico, whilst similar treatment could no doubt, if necessary, be obtained under the general most-favoured-nation clauses of the treaties with Montenegro, Spain; and Costa Rica.iThere appears to be no provision in the Peru treaty which would cover this point.(4) Discrimination by Vessels (Differential Flag Duties, &amp;c).Article II. of the Model&apos;Draft reads as follows: -Article II. Each of the contracting parties shall permit the importation or exporta-tion of all merchandise which may be legally imported or exported, and also the carriage-of passengers from or to their respective territories, upon the vessels of the other; and such vessels, their cargoes and passengers, shall enjoy the same privileges as, and shall not be subjected to any other or higher duties or charges than, national vessels and their cargoes and passengers.The article prohibits the differential treatment of the shipping of the other country by discriminating against the goods or passengers carried in vessels of that country, whether by prohibition or differential duties on the vessels, or the goods, or passengers carried in them. It in fact enjoins full national treatment in this respect. For instance, Article II. of the treaty with the United States is in direct conflict with the proposals in a recent United States Tariff Act to give a rebate of 5 per cent, to goods imported into the United States in vessels of the United States, and the representations of His Majesty&apos;s Government caused the proposal to be dropped.It should be noted that the provision with regard to &quot; passengers &quot; has recently been in-serted in the Model Draft to secure to British vessels equality of treatment with vessels of other countries in the carriage of emigrants to various parts of the world. Thus, Russia sought to give privileges, to Russian vessels in this respect partly, no doubt, to stimulate Russian shipping and partly to restrict the emigrant traffic.As it could not be maintained that the word &quot;cargoes&quot; coArered passengers, it was found that the privilege in question could not be claimed under the Anglo-Russian Treaty. Attempts to negotiate a supplementary agreement with Russia on this and other points have not so far met with success. Actually the provisions of the Model Draft with regard to passengers occur only in our treaties with Japan and Portugal. It should be clearly understood that the point is not covered in the treaties mentioned below.Subject to this reservation, the treaties with the following countries prohibit discrimination of the kind above referred to, and (except where otherwise stated) give national treatment to vessels and cargoes: France, Russia, Italy, Roumania, Japan, Portugal (most-favoured-nation. not national, treatment), Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Greece, Liberia, U.S.A., Mexico (most-favoured-nation treatment only), Nicaragua, Honduras, Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela. Colombia, Serbia, Montenegro, Spain, and Costa RicaJ could probably claim and be obliged to give most-favoured-nation treatment under the general most-favoured-nation article of their treaties, so long as other countries enjoyed the privileges in question. No provision in the .Peruvian treaty appears to have any bearing on the point.It may be observed that there are two principal variants to the ordinary form of the provisions as given in the Model Draft. Sometimes there is only a general provision providin.tr that vessels and their cargoes shall receive national or most-favoured-nation treatment, as the case* Tesse^ built in Russia and belonging to Russian subjects are exempt from navigation dues in their firyt three years. &apos; -  &apos; - :t By the Treaty of 1851 all reservations were withdrawn, but it is interesting to note that by the 1837 Treaty national treatment was only to vessels on voyages between the two countries, if laden, or to any voyage if in ballast:t Conditional most-favoured nation, treatment only (see below),..
1js-13may be, without any specific reference to the duties levied on, &quot;or drawbacks given in respect of, goods imported in the vessels, though no doubt national or most-favoured-nation treatment is implied (cf. France, Mexico, and Paraguay). Some of the older treaties tend to emphasise the goods rather than the vessels&apos; (cf. the treaties with the U.S.A., Holland, Liberia, Argentina, and Venezuela). Certain provisions indicate a state of things no longer existing. Thus the United Kingdom and the&apos;U.S.A. reserve the right to discriminate, as regards drawbacks, in the case of goods of their respective production when re-exported in vessels of the other to third (foreign) countries.(5) General Most-fa voured-Nation Treatment.Article 2 of the Model Draft reads as follows :  Article 2. The contracting parties agree that, in all matters relating to commerce, navigation, and industry, any privilege, favour, or immunity which either contracting party has actually granted, or may hereafter grant to the ships and subjects or citizens of any other foreign State, shall be extended immediately and unconditionally to the ships and subjects of the other, it being their intention that the commerce, navigation&apos;and industry of each country shall be placed in all respects on the footing of the most favoured nation.The treaties with the following countries contain general most-favoured-nation clauses:   France, Eussia, .Italy, Japan, Serbia, Montenegro, Portugal, Boumania, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras, Paraguay. r        *.......;The treaties with Holland, Liberia,* and Costa Eica provide, only lov conditional most-favoured-nation treatment.   In the case of Liberia and Costa Eica the wording is as follows :  &quot; Any favour, privilege, or immunity whatever in matters of commerce or navigation, which either party has actually granted or may hereafter grant to the subjects or citizens of any other State, shall be extended to the subjects, or citizens of the other contracting party, gratuitously if the concession in favour of that other State shall have been gratuitous; or in return for a Compensation as nearly as possible of proportionate value and effect, to be adjusted by mutual agreement, if the concession shall have been conditional.&quot;There is no provision for general most-favoured-nation treatment in matters of. navigation in the treaties with the U.S.A., Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru.(6) Coasting Trade.The practice at present is to reserve the coasting trade, but to give most-favoured-nation treatment with regard to it, i.e., to open it to all countries enjoying most-favoured-nation treat-ment, if it is opened to any one foreign country. The provisions of the Model Draft (Article 12) are as follows :  &quot; The provisions of this treaty relating to the mutual concession of national treat-ment in matters of navigation do not apply to the coasting trade, in respect of which the subjects and vessels of the contracting parties shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment.British and vessels may, nevertheless, proceed from one port to another, eitherfor the purpose of landing the whole or part of their cargoes or passengers brought from abroad, or of taking on board the whole or part of their cargoes or passengers for a foreign destination.It is also understood that, in the event of the coasting trade of either country being exclusively reserved to national vessels, the vessels of the other country, if engaged in trade to or from places not within the limits of the coasting trade so reserved, shall not be prohibited from the carriage between two ports of the former country of passengers holding through tickets or merchandise consigned on through bills of lading to or from places not within the above-mentioned limits, and while engaged in such carriage these vessels and their cargoes shall enjoy the full privilege of this treaty.&quot;The last two paragraphs of the above article do not occur in all the treaties, or occur in different form, but they are really corollaries of paragraph 1, and the privileges indicated In them would, perhaps, generally be conceded as a matter of course.Analogous provisions to those of the Model Draft are contained in the treates with Japan, Eoumania, Nicaragua, Honduras.There is no reference to the coasting trade in the Treaties with the following countries, and any right so to participate, if it exists at all, is dependent on other provisions, such as those giving general most-favoured-nation treatment: Montenegro, Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Liberia, U.S.A., Mexico, Argentina,! Venezuela.!Treaties with the following countries reserve the coasting trade absolutely : France, Eussia, Portugal,% Costa Eica, Peru, and Colombia.Treaties, &amp;c, with the following countries give national treatment in the coasting trade:   Italy (Declaration of 1904), Serbia (probably under Article 1, according to Foreign Office), Greece.   In the Protocol to the Paraguayan Treaty it is provided that &quot; the stipulation of* A clause similar (as regards future favours) to that in the Liberian and Costa Rican treaties occurs in para. 2 of Article 1 of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1837, though para. 1 of the same.article appears to give unconditional most-favoured nation treatment. , ,...f It is probable thawthe treaties with these countries give most favoured-nation treatment.% Notwithstanding anything in this treaty either of the contracting parties reserves the right to confine to national vessels the trade between any ports within its territories. In the event of this right being exercised by either country, nothing in this treaty shall be construed as entitling vessels of that country to participate in the correspond-ing trade between ports of the other country.14432 .      B2
&quot;Articles II. and IV. of the treaty now.concluded shall be understood to open the free naviga-&quot; tion of the Rivers Paraguay and Parana, including the coasting trade, to British vessels,&quot; but that owners of lines between&apos;British and Paraguayan ports shall not in consequence be entitled to claim special privileges or subventions granted to other lines for specific purposes.Note. The Anglo-French. Convention of 1904 allows British vessels to participate in the Moroccan coasting trade, and French vessels to participate in the Egyptian coasting trade.(7) The Position of British Oversea Possessions under the Treaties.In view of the changes which have come over British Colonial policy during the last century, the position of the Dominions in regard to the treaties is not always easy to define. In most cases, however, the British self-governing Dominions are either not bound by the treaties or can withdraw from them, but there is a good deal of variation with regard to the other Colonies and India.Allied Countries,Russia: Colonies are bound by the 1859 Treaty, and so far we have not succeeded in con-cluding any arrangement to permit of their withdrawal. France: The Convention of 1882 applies only to the United Kingdom, and the self-governingDominions can withdraw from the 1826* Convention. Italy: The treaty does not apply to the self-governing Dominions and India, but NewZealand, the Australian Colonies (except South Australia), Newfoundland; and Natal havesince acceded.   Apparently the Declaration of 1904 does not give Italian vessels the rightto participate in the coasting trade of these Dominions. Japan:Portugal: The Treaty applies to none of the Dominions and Colonies beyond the seaSerbia: !-     unless they shall have acceded in the specified period.   Separate with-Montenegro: drawal after 12 months&apos; notice is provided for,Ronmania:Neutral Countries in Europe.Greece: New Zealand, Newfoundland, and Natal have acceded to the treaty, but all theColonies can withdraw. Spain: The general most-favoured-nation provisions apparently apply to the Colonies. Holland : The 1837 Treaty applies only to the United Kingdom.Denmark: The Convention of 1824 does not apply to the Colonies and the self-governing Dominions can withdraw from the older treaties.Norway and Sweden: Apparently vessels of these countries may not engage in the inter-Imperial trade.   In the case of Sweden the self-governing Dominions can withdraw.Other Neutral Countries.Liberia: The self-governing Dominions and India may withdraw.United States of America: The Treaty of 1815 applies only to. the British territories inEurope and specifically excludes British Possessions in North America and the WestIndies, though the United States received most-favoured-nation treatment in certain &apos; respects as regards British Possessions in Asia.     The Treaty of 1871 gave reciprocalfreedom of navigation on North American rivers and lakes. Mexico : Treaty does not apply to the self-governing Dominions (except Natal and New-foundland, which have adhered) or to India. Nicaragua:  The Treaty applies to New Zealand and certain Colonies not possessingresponsible Governments which have acceded within the specified period; they may with-draw separately. Honduras: Not applicable to any Colonies(unless they accede. Costa Rica: Most-favoured-nation treatment in British Dominions outside Europe. Paraguay: Same as Mexico, but, in addition, an arrangement has been concluded enablingany Colonies to withdraw. Peru: Applies to all the British Dominions and Colonies. Colombia: The self-governing Dominions may withdraw.Argentina, Venezuela: These treaties apply to British territories in Europe, but iu all the dominions out of Europe the inhabitants of Argentina and Venezuela are to &quot; have the like liberty of commerce and navigation stipulated for in the preceding article to the full extent in which the same is permitted at present, or shall be permitted hereafter to any other nation.&quot;(8) Definition of National Vessels.In the Model Draft Treaty the definition of National vessels is as follows:  &quot; All vessels which according to British law are to be deemed British vessels, and all vessels which according to    - law are to be deemedvessels, shall, for the purpose of this treaty, be deemed British or vessels respectively.&quot;In other words, we seek now to leave it to the country owning the vessels to determine what ahall constitute a national vessel, and by reciprocity we expect them to recognise as British vessels vessels deemed to be British by British law. This policy has been consistently followed since the repeal of the Navigation Acts.   Accordingly the provisions cf the Model Draft appear
in our treaties with. Russia, Italy, Roumania, Portugal, Japan, Greece, Mexico, Nicaragua,, Honduras, Paraguay, and Colombia. &apos; .In the case of Holland the Convention of 1851 deliberately substituted the modern definition for the old definition which had appeared in the Treaty of 1837.In our treaties with the following countries national vessels are not defined at all:   France, Norway, and Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Liberia, U.S.A., Costa Rica, and Peru. To these may be added Serbia and Montenegro, where presumably questions of navigation were not felt to be sufficiently important to warrant elaborate clauses in the treaties.Finally, attention should be called to the curious definitions which occur in our treaties with Argentina and Venezuela, both of 1825, and covered by the Mercantilist Policy which was still in force.Article 8 of the Argentine Treaty reads as follows :  &quot; In order to avoid any misunderstanding with respect to the regulation which may respectively constitute a British vessel or a vessel of the said United Provinces-, it is hereby agreed that all vessels built in the Dominions of His Britannic Majesty, and owned, navigated, and registered according to the laws of Great Britain, shall be con-sidered as British vessels, and that all vessels built in the territories of the said United ProAances, properly registered by the citizens thereof, or any of them, and whereof the master and three-fourths of the mariners at least are citizens of the said United Provinces, shall be considered as vessels of the said United Provinces.&quot;Article 7 of the Venezuela Treaty is analogous, but the wording is slightly different. British vessels are defined as &quot; Vessels built in the Dominions of His Britannic Majesty, and &quot; owned by British subjects or by any of them, and whereof the master and three-fourths of the &quot; mariners at least are British subjects, except where the laws provide for any extreme cases.&quot; Conversely, Venezuelan vessels are similarly defined.In the additional article to the Treaty it was stipulated that, for seven years from the date of the ratification of the Treaty, ships, for the purpose of being considered Colombian ships, need not necessarily have been built in Colombia. It was also provided in Declarations appended to the treaty that vessels captured from the enemy and condemned as prizes and also vessels regularly condemned for breaches of the laws relating to the Slave Trade should be considered as national vessels.(Note that the treaty was made with Colombia, of which Venezuela was then a part, and now applies to Venezuela only.)Conclusions.It appears from the foregoing that most foreign countries are entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment in matters of navigation so far as regards the United Kingdom. In addition, national treatment is enjoyed by a number of countries in the following matters:  -(1) General freedom of access to our ports, harbours, &amp;c, by at least 7 countries, including 4 Allied. Further national treatment in respect of privileges relating to naviga-tion, subject to the above freedom of access, by 8 countries, including 5 Allied.(2) General facilities with regard to the use of ports, harbours, roadsteads, &amp;c. (Stationing, loading, unloading, &amp;c), 13 (? 15) countries enjoy national treatment, including 5 Allies.(3) Duties of tonnage, &amp;c, 18 (?20) countries, including 5 (?6) Allies enjoy national - treatment.(4) Discrimination by vessels (flag duties, &amp;c), at least 18 treaties, including 6 with Allied countries, directly prohibit such discrimination and require that in this respect vessels of the contracting party shall enjoy national treatment.Unfortunately none of the treaties, except those with Japan and Portugal (the latter only provides for most-favoured-nation treatment), can apparently be stretched to prohibit similar discrimination in respect of the passenger (including emigrant) traffic.(5) Coasting Trade. Only 3 (?4) treaties give national treatment in the coasting trade, viz., those with Italy, (?) Serbia, Greece, and Paraguay. All the Colonies with-out exception can withdraw. (The Treaty of 1868 with Austria-Hungary gave national treatment in the coasting trade of all Colonies in which the coasting trade was open to foreign shipping.)Four countries appear to enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in our coasting trade Roumania, Japan, Nicaragua, and Honduras. In no case was it necessary for the Colonies to accede, and they can always withdraw.(6) The position of the Dominion and Colonies would appear to be roughly as follows:  (a) Self-Governing Dominions are bound only by the treaty with Russia (where we have tried to negotiate an agreement to allow them to withdraw) and Peru, and possibly by those with Spain and (?) Norway.Costa Rica, Argentina, and Venezuela are entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment in the British Dominions outside Europe.(b) India. In addition to the treaties by which the self-governing Dominions are still bound, India appears to be bound also by the treaty with Colombia, by the. Anglo-French Convention ,of 1826, apparently dry. some.of the.older Danish Treaties, and to some extent by that with the United States of America.
(c) Other Colonies. All the treaties referred.to under heads (a) and (b).apply, and also the treaties with Liberia and Mexico.Perhaps the general position may be summarised as follows:  (1) As our treaties with enemy countries are deemed to have terminated with - the out-break of war, and as enemy countries are accordingly not even entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, we can, so far as treaties are concerned, discriminate against them in any way we choose.(2) But so long as the present definition of &quot; national vessels &quot; obtains in the treaties, it might be very difficult to guard ourselves against the running by the.Germans of what are really German lines under neutral flags. The&quot; enemy might wish to do this, in the event of our. discriminating at all severely against German shipping.(3.) Very few (if any) of the treaties would prevent preferential treatment of British shipping in the British overseas Dominions and Colonies; so that, by the enforce-ment of regulations against foreign shipping in the Colonies, it might even be possible without infringement of treaties, e..q,,.to close the inter-Imperial trade.(4) Differential treatment of foreign shipping could not be brought about in the United Kingdom (where many countries enjoy national treatment) without a wholesale denunciation of treaties.(5) We could not differentiate in the Colonies in favour of Allied (as against neutral) shipping without denouncing a certain number of treaties.(6) The coasting trade even of the United Kingdom could undoubtedly be closed without, much difficulty by denouncing or modifying a few treaties. But it should be remem-bered that any such effort on our part would result in our being excluded from the coasting trade of Italy and tbe Balkans, and it would probably react on the general freedom of navigation which we enjoy in Latin America.SUPPLEMENTARY  NOTE.The following points, which have not been covered in the main part of the memorandum, are of some interest:  I. Colonial Provisions in the Treaty with the Netherlands oe 1824 and in the Conventions wjth the United States oe 1815.- The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which made certain territorial readjustments in the Eastern possessions of the two countries, contains the following provisions: (a) The contracting parties were to accord one another most-favoured-nation treat-ment in their Asiatic possessions.(b) No duty was to be levied on the subjects and vessels of one State in the Asiatic ports of the other at a rate beyond tbe double of that-imposed on subjects of the territorial state (i.e., differential flag duties might presumably be imposed by one country on tbe other to that extent); where nationals were subject to no- duty, the duty on subjects of the other country should not exceed 6 per cent.(c) Neither party were to enter into any treaty with a Native State so as- to exclude the other party.It has already been indicated that the 1815 Convention with the United States gave most-favoured-nation-treatment, subject to certain qualifications, to United States vessels, which were, however, excluded from the Eastern coasting trade. It is interesting to note that Article 3 further provided that United States vessels might vouch for refreshment, but not for commerce, in the course of their voyage to or from the British territories in India, or to or from the Dominions of the Emperor of China at the Island of St. Helena (though not so long as Napoleon was there) or such other places as should be in the possession of Great Britain in the African or Indian seas. .II. Treatment of Mail Packets.A few treaties make special provision for the treatment of mail packets, namely, those with Japan, China, Costa Rica, and Peru, which in substance provide for most-favoured-nation treatment. The Treaty of 1856 with Morocco stipulates that mail packets, so long as they do not embark or disembark merchandise, shall in Morocco have the same privileges as vessels of war.III. Treaty Relations with China, Persia, Siam, and Morocco.The treaties with Persia and Siam appear to contain no provisions covering navigation, whilst those with China are essentially unilateral. . .The Convention of 1856 with Morocco does not appear to&apos; cover navigation to any wide extent. It provides for equality of treatment in Morocco with native subjects in respect of duties (tonnage, &amp;c.) levied on British vessels, but makes certain special provisions with regard to loading and unloading, resulting from the &quot;special character of Moroccan ports.. The Conven-tion binds all British Dominions.   &apos; ;.  ;  - -Y -
IV. Egypt and Muskat.It is not quite clear what will be the position of Egypt arid Muskat after the war, assuming that both are definitely incorporated in the Empire,;but it may,&quot;nevertheless, Be of interest to state the provisions, so far as they apply to navigation, of the Anglo-Egyptian Convention of 1889 and the treaty with Muskat of 1891.    &apos; &apos; *&apos;Egypt. The treaty with Egypt contains substantially all the provisions of the Model Draft, but it reserves the coasting trade absolutely.* The treaty appears to bind all the British Possessions excepting the self-governing Dominions, but any Colony can withdraw on 12 months&apos; notice being given.Muskat. The treaty with Muskat allows subjects of either State to come freely with their vessels and cargoes to the ports, creeks, and rivers of the other; the treaty also stipulates for general most-favoured-nation treatment, and provides that British vessels,shall not be exempt from harbour tonnage and lighthouse dues, though it limits their amount. The treaty applies-to all the Colonies&apos; except the self-governing Dominions, but it may be noted that Canada, Natal, Newfoundland, and Queensland have adhered.Board of Trade, 29th September 1916.- -m     - : III. ;:; .       .   &apos;   &apos;NOTE ON THE-TARIFF SYSTEMS OF THE BRITISH OVERSEAS POSSESSIONS AND THE MORE IMPORTANT FOREIGN COUNTRIES.(Furnished by the Board of Trade.)1. Customs duties are either specific or ad valorem. A specific duty is an amount (so many francs, lire, dollars, &amp;c.) assigned to a unit of weight or measurement. Examples: 5 francs per 100 kilogs.; 6 pesetas per square metre; 3 dollars each (for such goods as hats and watches); 2 lire per pair (as in the case of boots and shoes). An ad valorem, duty is a duty fixed at so much per cent.&apos;of the value of the goods.2, An examination of the Customs Tariffs in force in the British Overseas Possessions and Foreign Countries shows, however, that duties may be fixed in five different ways, that is to say, by assigning to any particular class of goods :   (a) A specific duty.(6) An ad valorem duty proper, i.e., a percentage duty assessed on the actual value of the goods as declared by the importer and verified by the Customs officials..(c) A combined specific and ad valorem duty.   For instance, in the United States alcoholicperfumery is dutiable at 40 cents per pound plus 60 per cent.(d) A specific duty with a proviso that the duty actually levied on any consignment shallnot be less than so much per cent, ad valorem.   For instance, in the United States,&apos; lead pencils are dutiable at 36 cents per gross, with a proviso that these goods shall not pay less than 25 per cent, ad valorem.   Here, then, the Customs officials charge either 36 cents per gross or 25 per cent, ad valorem, according to which rate yields the highest amount of duty.(e) A duty which is nominally ad valorem, but which is, in effect, specific, owing to the&apos;,fact that the percentage duty is calculated on a valuation fixed by the Government of the country concerned.3. As regards the British.Overseas Possessions, it may be said that the ad valorem system of, customs duties has been generally adopted throughout the self-governing Dominions,&apos;: the Crown-Colonies and Protectorates, and India. There are in all the tariffs some departures from this general rule: in some cases duties are specific; in others there are specific duties with ad valorem additions; in others goods are subjected to either specific or ad valorem rates, whichever yield the higher amounts; and in the case of India official valuations are published annually for a number of articles which are subject to ad valorem rates, and the duties are levied on the basis of these valuations, so that they are practically converted into specific duties. These variations, however, are not numerous enough to modify appreciably the general rule.4. The practice of Foreign Countries shows a very marked divergence from that of the British Empire in this respect. On the basis of the various systems of fixing customs duties, as indicated above, the tariffs of the principal foreign countries may be classified as follows:  (a) Specific Tariffs (tariffs consisting entirely (or with few exceptions) of specific duties.) This system includes the tariffs of most of the countries of Europe-Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Portugal, Spain,t Italy, Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, Greece, Bulgaria, Roumania, Serbia. Further, some -countries of America have taken the same course: Mexico, Guatemala, Salvador, &apos; Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Brazil,t Colombia, Venezuela,g Ecuador, Chile, and Peru; in Africa, Algeria and Tunis (French),* &quot;H.B.M. Government, for their part, will respect the right -which France, in virtue of treaties, conventions, &quot;and usage enjoys tn Egypt, including the right of coasting trade between Egyptian ports accorded to/French &quot;vessels.&quot;   (Anglo-French Declaration of 1904, Act 111.) ,      ;^A Spanish, law of 1906 determines the ad valorem limits of the custom duties to. be imposed, and makes provision for the revision of the tariff every five years on the basis of the alterations in the values of goods which may have taken place within that period.   For practical purposes, however, the tariff may be regarded as a specific tariff.    .% Ad valorem rates, figure to some extent in the tariff of Brazil, but specific duties greatly predominate, and the&apos; tariff may be described as a specific tariff, :  &apos;   &quot;       &apos;. .g In Venezuela, some few articles are subject to ad valorem surtaxes in addition to the specific duty.
(b) Ad valorem Tariffs. The outstanding instance of an ad valorem tariff is (or wasbefore the war) that of Turkey, where duties were levied at the uniform rate of 11 per cent, ad valorem (except in the case only of gold and silver wares, for which the duties were specified.)* The tariffs of Oorea and Siam are both almost exclusively ad valorem tariffs. The .Dutch tariff may be described as mainly ad valorem.(c) Tariffs partly Ad Valorem and partly Specific. Under this head we have, in Europe,Belgiumt; in &quot;Asia, Japan, China, Persia; and in America, the United States. Of the United States tariff it may be said that the ad valorem duties outnumber the specific duties. It is in this tariff that the systems of fixing duty indicated in paragraph 2 (c) and 2 (d) of this memorandum have been adopted to some extent. In the Venezuelan tariff, too, there are several instances of goods being subject to a combined specific and ad valorem duty.(d) Finally, there is the Valuation Tariff System, under which the actual rates of dutyare fixed by the Tariff Law on an ad valorem basis, but the duties are assessed on a fixed schedule of values drawn np by the Government of the country concerned, generally approved by the legislature, and therefore not subject to change except in virtue of a legislative enactment. Under this system the nominally ad valorem duties are, in effect, specific. The system is in force in the Argentine, Uruguay, . * Paraguay, and Bolivia.% The reason for adopting fixed values instead of calcu-lating duty on actual values is presumably the difficulty in determining accurately the real values of imported goods, and the expenses incident to maintaining a body of expert Customs appraisers, as is done in the United States. Goods not specified in the respective valuation tariffs are either assimilated to the specified class of goods to which they bear the greatest analogy, or, if assimilation is not possible, duty is . levied at the appropriate ad valorem rate on the appraised value of the goods. Morocco also has a somewhat similar system, but in this case the general ad valorem duty is assessed on the basis of values specified in the &quot; Price Lists &quot; issued every six months by- a special Commission. The values contained in these lists have a fairly wide range. If the value declared by the importer appears to be correct, and is within the limits of value given in the list, it is accepted as the basis of assessment, otherwise the Customs officials estimate the value themselves, always, however, remaining within the limits of the current list. Morocco is, therefore, a special case, evidently differing from that of the above-mentioned South American countries, where fixed values are established and, once adopted, remain in force for long periods.IV.MEMORANDUM ON &quot;ANTI-DUMPING&quot; LEGISLATION.(Furnished by the Board of Trade.)Legislation intended to prevent the importation of goods at so-called &quot;dumping&quot; prices is in force, so far as relates to the British Dominions, in Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the Commonwealth of Australia; in the first two of these Dominions the provisions. in question are part of the general Customs Tariff law, whilst in the case of Australia they are embodied in the &quot; Australian Industries Preservation Act, 1906,&quot; as subsequently amended. The Board of Trade are not aware of any corresponding legislative enactments in any foreign countries, but there are certain provisions relating to valuation for duty purposes in the United States Customs Law which are of interest, and provisions against dumping are contained in a bill which is at present before Congress.(A) Canada.Dominion of Canada,.Section 6 of the &quot; Customs Tariff Act, 1907,&quot; provides as follows:  &quot; 6. In the case of articles exported to Canada of a class or kind made or produced in Canada, if the export or actual selling price to an importer in Canada is less than the fair market value of the same article when sold for home consumption in the usual and ordinary course in the country whence exported to Canada at the time of its exportation to Canada, there shall, in addition to the duties otherwise established, be levied, collected, and paid on such article, on its importation into Canada, a special duty (or dumping :&apos; duty) equal to the difference between fhe said selling price of the article for export and the said fair market value thereof for home consumption; and such special duty (or dumping duty) shall be levied, collected, and paid on such article, although it is not otherwise dutiable:* By a law of March 1916, a new Turkish -Customs tariff was established, to come into operation on the 14th September 1916, which substituted specific for ad valorem rates of duty.t It may be noted that in the years 1907-13, the Belgian Government largely exercised the legal powers which they possessed of converting the ad valorem duties into equivalent specific rates, particularly in respectof textile goods.I Nevertheless, a certain number of articles are in these countries subject to specific rates of duty determined by the respective Customs tariff laws.
v        &quot;Provided that the said special duty shall not exceed 15 per cent.- ad valorem in anycase: &apos;        ; &apos; rr - . ,Provided also that the following goods shall be exempt from such special duty, :^    viz.:  / .-; &apos; -(a) goods whereon the duties otherwise established are equal tq 50 per cent, ad valorem;(b) goods of a class subject to excise duty in Canada;(c) sugar refined in the United Kingdom;..&apos; (d) binder,twine or twine for harvest binders manufactured from New Zealandhemp, istle or tampico fibre,.sisal grass or sunn&quot;, or a mixture, of any two or more of them, of single ply.and measuring, not&apos;exceeding. 600 feet to the pound: - - &quot;Provided further that excise duties shall be disregarded in estimating the market value of goods for the purposes of special duty when the goods are entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff.&quot; ^The Minister of Customs may make regulations to provide for the temporary exemption from special duty of any article or class of article, when it is established to his satisfaction that such articles are not made or sold in Canada in substantial quantities, and are offered for sale to all purchasers on equal terms, under like conditions, having regard to the custom and nsuage of the trade.Under regulations which have been issued under this section of the Tariff Act, have been operative from the 1st September 1914, the &quot; dumping duty&quot; is not to apply in the following cases, viz. :  (a) When the difference between the fair market value and the selling price of goods to the importer in Canada does not exceed 5 per cent, of their &quot; fair market value.&quot; The whole difference, however, is to be taken into account for duty purposes when exceeding 5 per cent.It is further provided that the &quot; dumping duty &quot; shall, without exemption allowance, apply to articles of a class or kind made in Canada, when admitted free of ordinary duty.In computing the difference for special duty purposes between the u fair market value &quot; in the country of export and the &quot; selling price to the importer in Canada/&apos; the &quot; fair market value &quot; of the goods is to be estimated on the usual credit basis, except when the article is universally sold in the country of export for cash only, in which case the &quot; fair market value&quot; is to be estimated on a cash basis!&quot; Export price &quot; or &quot; selling price &quot; means the exporter&apos;s price of the goods, exclusive of all charges thereon after their shipment from the place whence exported directly to Canada.A bond fide discount for cash not exceeding 1\ per cent., when allowed and deducted by thfe exporter on his invoice, may be allowed in estimating the &quot; fair market value.&quot;The amount of any advance in the &quot; market value &quot; of the goods between the time of their purchase by the importer and the date of their exportation to Canada, shall not be subject to special duty, provided the goods have been exported in the usual conrse and the actual date of: purchase, established to the satisfaction of the collector by contracts or other sufficient documents.The following examples will show the operation of the above regulations:  (a) Hats sold for home consumption at flOO on credit, subject to 7 per cent, cash discount, would be liable to the &quot; dumping duty &quot; if sold to a purchaser in Canada on usual credit at f 93, but would not be liable to special duty if sold to a purchaser in Canada for $93 cash.(b) Machinery sold for home consumption at $100 on credit, subject to 2\ per cent, cash discount, would not be liable to special duty if sold to a purchaser in Canada for $93 cash, as the difference does not exceed 5 per cent, after raising the cash price of $93 to its credit equivalent.The following statement shows the amount of &quot;special or dumping duty&quot; collected on various articles on importation into Canada for a series of years, viz.:  	Years ended 31st March.

selling price of the goods for export and the true current value thereof for home Consump^ tion, provided that the special customs duty (or dumping duty) shall not in any case exceed 15 per cent, ad valorem.No particulars are available as to the extent to which such &quot; dumping duty &quot; has been applied to the imports into the Union of South Africa.(C) Commonwealth of Australia.In the Commonwealth of Australia, no provision is made in the Customs Tariff against dumping, but under the &quot;Australian Industries&apos; Preservation Act, 1906&quot; (No. 9 of 1906), as subsequently amended, it is provided that the. importation of, goods may be prohibited or restricted if they enter into unfair competition with Australian industries, the preservation of which in the opinion of the Comptroller-General of Customs or a Justice of the High Court, as the case may be, is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers.No particulars are available as to the operation of this particular provision.(D) The United States of America.In reply to a recent official inquiry from H.M. Government, the United States Treasury Department stated that: -&quot; There is nothing in the law, regulations, or instructions issued by Customs officers restricting the freedom of contract nor affecting the right of a foreign merchant to charge for his merchandise any price that may be mutually agreed upon between him and the purchaser in the United States.&quot;1Ad valorem duties on goods imported into the United States are assessed upon the actual market value in the principal markets of the country from which the goods are exported. The general rules as to the declaration of value for Customs purposes are(1) When merchandise has been purchased or agreed to be purchased by a person or firm in the United States from a foreign manufacturer or merchant, the juice paid or agreed to be paid must be stated in the invoice,^ and if any drawback or bounty is received or is to be received, the amount thereof must be stated.The actual price paid should be stated, whether it is more or less than the home market value. The amount of drawback is required to be stated only for. the information of the appraising officers, and is not necessarily an element of value. If the foreign merchant reduces the price to the American purchaser by the amount of the drawback or bounty received, it is obvious that the price paid or agreed to be paid does not represent market value in the country of exportation, and that an amount equal to the deduction on account of drawback must be added to make market value. If, however, the goods are sold to the American purchaser at the same price they are sold to the home trade, and no deduction is made by reason of the drawbacks received, the draw-back does not constitute a part of the market value and is not a dutiable element.(2) When merchandise is shipped to the United States otherwise than in pursuance of a purchase or agreement to purchase, the market value in the principal markets of the country at the time of exportation must be stated in the invoice, and, if approved by the appraiser, is the1 value on which duty is assessed.(3) In either of the above cases the importer (in the United States) may at the time he makes his entry add to, or deduct from, the value stated in his invoice such an amount as will, in his opinion, make the correct market value in the country of exportation at the time of exportation.(4) The appraiser is required by law to ascertain and appraise the market value in ^ country of exportation at the time of exportation, independent of a&apos;ny statement of cost or valx the invoice. The duty is assessed on the appraised value, but in no case on less than the entered value, and if the appraised value exceeds the value declared, in the entry, an additional duty of 1 per&apos;cent. for each 1 per cent, that the appraised value exceeds the entered value is assessed.These provisions are clearly directed against under-valuation for duty purposes, not against -selling to United States importers at prices lower than those prevailing in the home market of the country of manufacture. In all countries having ad valorem customs duties some machinery is of course necessary for settling disputes as to the valuation of goods for duty purposes and penalties for declaring goods at less than their real value.An Act recently passed by Congress, entitled &quot; An Act to increase the Revenue and for other purposes &quot; (H.E. 16763), contains the following provisions against &quot; Unfair Competition &quot; :   Sec. 600.   That when used in this title the term &quot;person&quot; includes partnerships, corporations, and associations.Sec. 601. That it shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United States, to&apos; commonly and systematically sell or cause to be sold such articles within the United States at a price substantially less . than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the United States, in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are commonly exported, after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided that such act of acts be done with the intent of destroying or injuring any industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the United States^ or of restraining or monopolising any part of trade and commerce in smch articles in the United. States.   Anythe
417person who violates or combines or conspires with any other person to violate this section: is guilty of a misdemeanour, and, on conviction, thereof, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $5,00.0, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, in the discretion of the court. Any person injured in his business Or property by reason of any violation of, or combination or conspiracy to violate, this section, may. sue therefor in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages sustained, and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney&apos;s fee.Sec. 602. That if any article produced in.a foreign country is imported into the United States under an agreement, understanding,.or condition that the importer thereof or any other person in the United States shall not;use, purchase, or deal in, or shall be restricted in his using, purchasing, or dealing in, the articles of any other person, there shall be levied, collected, and paid thereon, in addition to the duty otherwise imposed by law, a special duty equal to double the amount of such duty.Sec. 603. That the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such rules and regulations as are necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of section 602.MEMORANDUM ON RETALIATORY PROVISIONS IN CERTAINFOREIGN  CUSTOMS  LAWS.(Furnished by the Board of Trade.)Statement as to the Powers possessed by the Government of Neutral Countries, under existing laws, to penalise Goods imported from Countries which discriminate against their Products.The Customs Tariff laws of Neutral Countries have been examined with a view to ascer-taining the extent to which the various Governments possess powers under existing laws to penalise goods the produce or manufacture of countries which discriminate in any manner against goods the produce or manufacture of the countries in question. The laws of a few insignificant countries, such as the colonies of the smaller European Powers, have not been examined.From this investigation it appears that the Governments of the following countries already possess such powers:  Norway. Greece. Ecuador.Denmark. Argentine Republic. Haiti.Spain. Chile. Venezuela.Switzerland.The relevant provisions of law are set out in Appendix I. In the case of Sweden, the Customs Ordinance of June, 1911, vested the Government with certain retaliatory powers until the end of the year 1912 (vide Appendix II.).The special case of the United States is dealt with in Appendix III. Whilst the retaliatory provision^ contained in the Payne Tariff Law of 1909 were dropped by the Underwood Tariff Law of 1913, a provision as to retaliatory powers has recently been adopted by Congress, in the *&apos; Act to Increase Revenue and for other purposes,&quot; approved 8th September, 1916.It must be borne in mind that retaliatory powers, if not provided by the ordinary tariff laws, can generally be obtained by a Government with little difficulty, should occasion arise.Board of Trade,September, 1916.APPENDIX I.Statement showing the Powers possessed by the Governments of certain Neutral Countries to penalise Goods imported from Countries which discriminate against their Products.Norway.The maximum tariff shall be applicable to any foreign country not having concluded a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Norway in which Norwegian goods and vessels are less favourably . treated than the goods and vessels of any other country. The maximum rates shall likewise apply to goods specified in tariffs annexed to treaties concluded with other countries which have ceased to be&quot; in force. The King of Norway may, however, if he deems fit, order that the foregoing dispositions are not to be applicable, either in whole or in regard to cer-tain goods, pending the question being submitted to the Storthing for final decision. The King may also decide under what conditions, and for what goods^ -14432special certificates of origin shall be required to secure the application of the tariff.(From the preliminary dispositions to the tariff.)Note. The Norwegian &quot;maximum&quot; tariff is not in the nature of a general tariff, but a penal tariff.Denmark.Goods imported from countries which treat Danish vessels or goods from the Kingdom of Denmark less favourably than vessels or goods of other countries may, so far as treaty stipulations permit, be charged by Royal Decree with .a surtax on the tariff rates of duty up to 40 per cent, thereof, for a period not ex-ceeding 40 weeks, or, in case the goods are free of duty, with duty not exceeding 10 per cent, ad valorem or 1 ore per kilogramme. A Royal Decree of this kind may be issued once in the course of three years as regards the same country and the same goods (tariff headings).(Article 5 of Danish Customs Tariff Law of 5th May, 1908.)c&quot;2

The Spanish tariff corisists in practice Of three tariffs: (1) the &quot; first tariff &quot; (the highest), (2) the &quot; secdhd. tariff,&quot; arid (3) the tariff resulting from the reduction of the second tariff by conventions (except that with Portugal).Switzerland.Article 4. It shall be lawful for the Federal Council to increase at any time, to such an extent as they may deem fit, the rates of the general tariff applicable to. products of States levying excessive rates of duty 6ri Swiss goods, or treating them less favourably than the goods of other countries. In cases where the present law provides for exemption from duty the Federal Council may establish duties.In caseS&apos; where any measured adopted in a foreign country are likely to interfere With the trade of Switzerland . . . the Federal Council are em-poWered, in a general way, to fake measures deemed fit.to meet the circumstances. ;i&apos;Article 5. The Federal Council shall submit to the Federal Assembly at its first, ensuing session any measures taken by them in pursuance of Articles 3 and 4; The Federal Assembly shall decide as to the maintenance or rejection of the measures in question.(From the Customs Tariff Law of 10th October,. 1902.) Greece.A Royal Decree, issued on the proposition of the Ministerial Council, shall permit the imposition of supplementary duties higher by 30 per cent, than the ordinary duties, on commodities and produce proceed-ing from States which tax Greek shipping or com-modities or produce proceeding from Greece more heavily than those proceeding from other States. And upon those articles upon which, according to the tariff in force, no import duty is leviable, the said Royal Decree shall permit the imposition of &amp; duty not exceeding 16 per- Cent, upon the market price.(Article 9 of the Customs Tariff Law of the 30th December&apos;^ 1892, llth January, 1893.)Argentine Republic.The import duties established by the present law shall be deemed to be the minimum tariff, and shall be applicable to products and goods of all countries which apply their minimum tariff to exports from the Argentine Republic, which do not increase the present duties on such exports, which do not establish a duty on exempted articles, which do not exceptionally re-duce their present tariff for similar goods of any other origin, &apos; and which do not impede by restrictive measures the importation of Argentine products.For any country not coming within these conditions, the Executive is authorised to levy on goods and pro-ducts proceeding from such countries a maximum tariff, equivalent to a surtax of 50 per cent.

The Decree imposing such duty shall be submitted to the Riksdag at its next session, within 10 days after its opening; and in case the Riksdag does not approve it without alteration, shall not remain in force for more than 10 days&apos; after the Riksdag has arrived at a decision iri the matter.APPENDIX III,Note respecting the &quot; Retaliatory Clauses of the1 United States Tariff Act of 1909, and- the Revenue Act of 8th September, 1916.(1) The Payne Tariff of 1909.The schedule of duties contained in the Tariff Act of 5th August, 1909,. was designed- to constitute the&apos; &quot; minimum &quot; tariff. The &quot; maximum &quot; tariff was to be the rates of duty according to the dutiable list of the Act with the addition of 25 per cent, ad valorem. In virtue of section 2 of the Act, the &quot; maximum &quot; tariff was to be applied from the 31st March, 1910, to imports into the United States from any foreign country, except in cases where the President, by pro-clamaticn, accorded the benefit of the &quot; minimum &quot; tariff to any country. He was to issue such proclama-tion in cases where he was satisfied &quot; in view of th0

These systems are known as &quot;drawback,&quot; &quot;temporary importation^&quot; &quot; improvement trade &quot; facilities.Drawback is a refund on the exportation of manufactured or partly manufactured articles from a country of the sum actually paid (or a proportion of it) by way of duty on the imported raw or semi-manufactured materials used in the production of the goods exported.(Notc^-In some countries, such as, for instance, the United States, drawback of the duty paid is allowed in respect of merchandise exported in the same condition as imported, but only, of course, if the goods remain in bonded warehouse dr in the uninterrupted custody of Customs officers.   This, however, is a special case, and hardly within the scope of this memorandum).Temporary Importation.-^-\n. principle this system exempts from duty foreign goods destined to undergo in the country of importation some industrial treatment, or to be worked up into manufactures, on condition that the finished products be exported or warehoused for exportation within a fixed period-. What is known as &quot; identical exportation&quot; may be required^ that is to say, the actual materials imported must be re-exported in a worked-up or in a finished condition; or, alternatively, what is known as &quot; equivalent exportation &quot; may be allowed-that is to say, the materials imported may be written off or &quot; compensated &quot; by the exportation of manufactured articles produced from materials of the same kind as, and in equal quantity to, those imported, without it being obligatory that the materials used in preparing the goods exported be actually the materials importedi(Note. There are special cases of temporary importation, apart from the foregoing, such as those relating to the temporary duty-free admission of receptacles to be used for packing goods destined for exportation, also the temporary admission of receptacles containing imported goods, where the receptacles are to be re-exported.)In different ways the temporary admission system and the drawback system attain the same object. The latter, however, has this disadvantage: that it necessitates the keeping of elaborate records of what are, in effect, fictitious receipts and disbursements, and further, unless the rules are carefully framed, the sum repaid on exportation may exceed the sum paid by way Of duty on the imported raw materials, as a result of which the exporter receives a bounty. The practical difficulties of the drawback system are t -(1) That in each case it is necessary .to determine exactly what quantity of imported material (making an allowance for wastage in the process of working up) is incor-porated in the finished product as exported; and(2) That it is necessary to frame regulations to prevent abuse of the facilities by the incorporation, in the exported goods, of raw materials of native production Ion which no duty has been paid), and the subsequent claim of drawback by the exporter as if these materials had actually been imported and duty paid thereon.It may be mentioned that the drawback system can be, and is, in a number of countries extended to the internal (excise or consumption)-duties leviable. Thus, for example, exporters of sugared products, such as confectionery and jam, are allowed a drawback of the internal duty
oil the sugar used in preparing the exported goods; exporters of alcoholic perfumery and other goods made with spirits are allowed a drawback of the internal duty on the amount of spirit contained in, or used for/the manufacture of the exported perfumery, &amp;c, and so on. Here, too, as is obvious, elaborate regulations are necessary to prevent abuse.&apos; What is known as the improvement trade system, which is adopted in certain countries, e.g., Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, is, in effect, the application of the temporary admission privilege to certain classes of goods imported to undergo various processes and to be subsequently re-exported. It is not easy to differentiate improvement trade from temporary admission, but it may be said that in general goods imported under improvement trade regulations do not undergo any essential change in their nature by the improvement or working up to which they are subjected in the country of import; whilst temporary admission facilities commonly cover the case of raw materials which undergo a complete transformation before being re-exported. Further, improvement trade facilities cover the case of goods which, being exported from a country to undergo a specific process in another country, are allowed to be re-imported free of diity into the country of origin (so-called &quot; passive&quot; improvement trade).*The drawback system in the United States, the temporary admission system in France, and &apos; the improvement trade system in Germany afford good examples of those various facilities, and it is now proposed to give, within the briefest possible compass, a quite general account of each of these.(1) United States System of Drawbacks.Under the Customs Laws of the United States, a drawback is allowable on the exportation of articles manufactured or produced in the United States wholly or in part from imported materials equal in amount to 99 per cent, of the duties paid on the imported materials used. Where a principal product and a by-product result from the manipulation of imported material, the proportion of the drawback distributed to such by-product shall not exceed the duty assess-able, under the tariff, on a similar by-product of foreign origin when imported into the United States from the country from which the imported material used was imported. Where a &apos;by-product results from the manipulation of imported material and no duty is assessable on a similar by-product of foreign origin, no drawback is allowable on the by-product produced from the imported material. In such a case, a drawback equal in amount to the duties paid on the imported material used in the production of both the principal product and the by-product, less the legal deduction of 1 per cent., is allowable on the principal product when exported. Appli-cations for the establishment of rates of drawbacks are made to the Secretary of the Treasury, and must contain a detailed statement, verified by oath or affirmation, showing the name of the manufacturer, place of manufacture, kinds of articles manufactured, the kinds and quantities of imported materials used in the production of each particular article, the wastage, if any, and its value, and the process of manufacture.As an illustrative example, acdecision of the United States Treasury Department, dated 26th July, 1916, which has been selected at random, is appended to this memorandum, showing how drawback on munition boxes has been accorded to a certain firm in respect of the partition pieces made of imported hardwood lumber. There are, of course, elaborate regulations of general application with a view to preventing fraud.As an instance of what is said above as to drawback of internal duties (as distinguished from customs duties), it may be mentioned that in the United States drawback is allowable on the exportation of flavouring extracts, and medicinal or toilet preparations manufactured in the United States with the use of domestic tax-paid alcohol, the drawback being equal in amount to the tax paid on the alcohol used.(2) Temporary Admission in France.Under the Tariff Law of 1892, temporary admission privileges may not be accorded except in virtue of a law. The Government is, however, empowered to allow the duty-free import of articles for repair or for experimental purposes, and to deal with individual and exceptional cases not capable of being generalised.The list of goods to which the privilege of temporary admission is now accorded in virtue of the law of 1892 and subsequent laws is a lengthy one, comprising a great variety of goods. The temporary admission of metals (pig iron, &amp;c), and corn (to be ground into flour) is subject to special regulations of an elaborate character which it is not possible to deal with briefly. The effect of these regulations is to admit to a certain extent &quot;equivalent&quot; exportation-of metal goods and for flour respectively as distinguished from &quot;identical&quot; re-exportation (see explanation above) in discharge of temporary importation permits..As a general principle, temporary admission is effected under a bond by which the importer engages to work or transform the imported material in the manner specified iu the bond, and to re-export, or warehouse for exportation, the resulting goods within a determined period, not exceeding six months. The bond is cancelled on the exportation of the goods. Except in one or two special cases, the importer is not allowed to deliver the imported material for consumption in France, nor to declare the manufactured product directly for consumption in France. After being warehoused under official supervision, however, the manufactured product may be declared for consumption in France, and, in this event, it pays only the duty applicable to the raw material imported.   (There are one or two exceptions to this rule.)  ..Detailed regulations respecting each class of goods admitted to temporary importation are laid down by decree.   To give a simple example : in the case of almonds imported for the manu-* In some countries, e.g., Italy, there are temporary exportation &quot; facilities which correspond to this branch of improvement trade.
faoture of oil, importation of the almonds and exportation of the oil must be effected through the same custom house. At present, only the Custom House at Marseilles is opened to these operations. The oil produced&apos;from the almonds has to be exported, within a period of six months, at the rate of 55 kilogs. of oil for each 100 kilogs. of imported almonds.(3) Improvement Trade in Germany.The following general account of the German improvement trade regulations is taken from the Consular Report on the Trade of Germany for 1906.The improvement traffic in Germany is regulated by the Order of the Federal Council issued, in April, 1906.   In accordance with this Order, the Ministry of Finance of the Federal State concerned decides generally as to the admission or suspension of an improvement traffic,, and also, grants the privileges of participation in the improvement traffic to each separate manufacturer. The free import of goods for the purposes of manufacture, of completion, or of repair, with the object of their re-exportation (the so-called active improvement traffic), is permitted if this promises material advantage to the industries concerned, and if it entails no injurious con-sequences to other home industries; further, it is permitted even when some small disadvantages exist, if these are outweighed by benefits so much greater as to conduce on the whole to the furtherance of German economic prosperity.   The free re-importation of goods exported fromi the country for improvement (the so-cailed passive improvement traffic) is only permitted in exceptional cases, and only when the &quot; improvement&quot; in question cannot at the time be under-, taken in Germany either at all, or only insufficiently, or in an inferior manner; further, when it applies to experiments made for the purpose of attaining new manufacturing methods or of new patterns.   Should the improvement traffic be granted on the ground that its execution in the country would incur great extra expense, it must be limited to those goods that are to be re-exported after re-importation.   Questions of the first establishment of a permanent improve-ment traffic not yet permitted within the German Customs system are decided by the. Federal Council, but the separate Federal States have the right of independent decision in individual or temporary cases of improvement traffic.By the Order of 1906 the difficult question of identification, a matter which had frequently given rise to complaint by German traders, was solved in a manner satisfactory to the German merchants by the removal of the former burdensome control regulations. Only in the passive improvement traffic the regulations still strictly demand the recognition of identity of the improved goods, while in the active improvement traffic the recognition is demanded only so far as the process of improvement allows it. The rules with regard to depositing security, time allowance, and payment of imposts are all formulated in the interests of the German export industry.The indispensable preliminary condition for duty-free improvement traffic is the re-export of goods imported for improvement. If the export does not take place at all, or in the period allowed, duty must be paid for the goods imported for improvement; no respite in the payment of such duty is granted. Loss of material, due to waste or similar causes during the process of improvement in the country, which material is proved to be valueless and exempt from duty according to tariff law, is not subject to duty; other loss of material is subject to duty. On the other hand, if goods have received dutiable additions in other countries, duty has to be paid for these additions upon re-importation. Over-weight caused by the working of textiles and paper by dressing, printing, colouring, and the like, is admitted free if the official control seals are still on the goods.It may be added that to some extent improvement trade conditions were resrulated and &quot; conventionalised &quot; by the commercial treaties which were concluded in 1904-1906 between Germany and the adjacent States. This refers more particularly to the improvement trade in the frontier districts.APPENDIX.Drawback on Ammunition Boxes.Drawback on ammunition boxes manufactured by the Horatio Hickok Co., of Burlington, Vt., with the use in part of partition pieces made of imported hard-wood lumber.Treasury Department,26th July, 1916.Sir,Drawback is hereby allowed under paragraph O of section 4 of the Tariff Act of 3rd October, 1913, and the drawback regulations (Chapter 18 of the Cus-toms Regulations of 1915) on ammunition boxes manufactured by the Horatio Hickok Co., of Burling-ton, Vt., in part with the use of partition pieces made of imported hardwood lumber.A manufacturing record shall be kept by the com-pany, in accordance with the sworn statement, dated17th June, 1916, which is transmitted herewith for filing in your office, which will show the number of sets of partition pieces used in, the manufacture of each box, and the total number of completed boxes, and also the identity of imported parts.

yii..-CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE BOARD OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE ON THE TREATMENT OF IMPORTS FROM ENEMY COUNTRIES AFTER THE WAR.(I.) Letter from Lord Balfour of Bxtrleigh to Sir Lawrence Guillemard.The Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the War have had under - consideration the question, what treatment should be applied to the commerce of Enemy Powers during the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities, regard being had to the recommendations of the Economic Conference of the Allies held at Paris in June last, which, as you are aware, have been accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government.A copy of the recommendations of the Conference (Cd. 8271) is enclosed, and you will observe that Resolution B. IV. provides that, for a period of time after the war, goods originating in enemy countries shall be subjected either to prohibitions or to a special regime of an effective character. The precise length of the period is to be fixed by agreement between the Allies, but it has been suggested tbat it might extend to two years.The Committee propose to consider at their next meeting on October 12th, the question whether, for a period of time immediately following the war, the prohibition of imports from enemy countries is expedient and practicable, and, if so, for what period of time it should be recommended; or, if total prohibition be deemed inexpedient and impracticable, what should be the nature of the treatment of enemy goods during the period in question.In order to assist us in arriving at a conclusion, the Committee would be glad if the Board of Customs and Excise could furnish them with a memorandum upon the practical questions which would arise in connection with the enforcement of whatever regime may be decided upon.Whether the regime be one of prohibition (subject, of course, to licences) or tariff, its enforcement would presumably depend, in the first place, upon a system of certificates of origin, and the Committee would like to be informed whether, and if so, in what way, such a system could, in the opinion of the Board of Customs, be made most effective.If a general tariff should be applied to all goods originating from the present enemy countries, I sbould like to know how far it would be necessary to increase the Customs staff at the ports and to establish an extended system of bonded warehouses and /or of drawbacks, and, supposing the tariff to be levied ad valorem, to employ a valuation staff. The Committee would be glad to learn the views of your Board upon these and other practical questions involved, and, in particular, to know whether the necessary arrangements for applying a tariff could be brought into operation immediately upon, or very shortly after, the conclusion of peace.The Committee would also be glad to be furnished with a separate memorandum on the question of drawbacks as hitherto applied in this country.I am afraid I am asking a great deal, but I and the Committee will be very grateful if you will do your best to help us.(II.) Memorandum by the Board of Customs and Excise.1. The Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the War have asked us for our observations on the practical questions arising in connection with the prohibition of imports from enemy oountries after the war, or alternatively (if prohibition is deemed inexpedient or impracticable), the enforcement of some other means of applying to such imports the &quot; special regime of an effective character &quot; which has been recommended by the Economic Conference of the Allies and accepted in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. It is necessary to state at the outset that, whatever the nature of the regime selected, it could not be enforced by the Customs against enemy goods &quot;(a term which throughout this memorandum is used to denote goods originating in any country which is now an enemy country), unless they are provided from some extraneous source with the means of distinguishing enemy from non-enemy goods. It is not as though the problem were merely to penalise goods imported direot from enemy countries. This criterion would at once go too far and not far enough; for non-enemy goods may well reach this country via an enemy country, while conversely the ports of Holland and Belgium (not to mention Scandinavia) may provide a convenient channel, if not the most convenient channel, for enemy goods consigned to the United Kingdom from enemy countries. And, unfortunately, our war experience is such as to negative any assumption that all British traders will, as a matter of course and on their own initiative, acquiesce at the bidding of the Government in restrictions on their trade with enemy countries.Certificates of Origin.3. From a Customs point of view a system of Certificates of Origin is the best form in which the extraneous assistance predicated in paragraph 2 could be given, whether the special regime adopted be prohibition or tariff; and we conceive that the certificates of origin should be British Consular certificates of origin. It is true that the procedure set up by the Inter-national Sugar Convention provides a precedent for another kind of certificate, i.e., a certificate given by the fiscal authorities of the country of exportation, with or without a British Consular visa. We assume that such certificates would not be regarded as sufficiently reliable for the purpose now in view, even if the foreign Governments concerned were willing to give their sanction to the system.  The Committee may wish to consult the Foreign Office on this point.4. On questions of origin, the verdict of a trade expert.in this country will always be exposed to the charges of fallibility and self-interest; while in a court of law an expert&apos;s opinion without reinforcement of evidence derived from the books and records of the foreign
420producer or consignor would be but a precarious support to proceedings for condemnation of goods alleged to be enemy goods.5. Another expedient which may be urged upon the Committee for the purpose of deter-&apos; mining origin is a wholesale extension of the system of the Merchandise Marks Act, by enacting that all imported goods should bear a definite indication of the country of origin. It is outside the scope of this memorandum and the functions of this department to discuss the pros and cons of such a plan in its bearings on trade in general; it is sufficient- to point out that for the particular purpose now in view a system of marks would not be effective. For example, it is obviously inapplicable to bulk cargoes of raw material and many kinds of manu-factured or semi-manufactured goods; and it would depend too much on the veracity of the producer or his middlemen and on the willingness of foreign Governments to enact and enforce legislation making it penal to apply false indications of origin. In fact, a system of marks without adequate guarantees that the marks will be reliable would still leave the Customs dependent on expert opinion in this country.6. We are thus driven back on a system of Consular certificates of origin, as the system best calculated to assist the Customs in stopping or taxing enemy imports. No one will assert that the system is an ideal one, and the Foreign Office would probably be the first to admit the possibility of consuls being deceived. It is, nevertheless, a system which has the three-fold merit of (1) providing for investigation of questions of origin in the country of origin where the books and records of the consignor are accessible; (2) imposing a check on the wholesale dumping of enemy goods into the United Kingdom, on the chance of their slipping through undetected (because goods arriving without a certificate would if so facto be subject to stoppage and seizure); and (3) removing from the sphere of the administration and the courts of the importing country troublesome disputes and vexed questions of origin.7. A system of British Consular certificates of origin has actually been in force since the early months of the war in the principal countries adjacent to the Central Empires, viz., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland. The same system was also in force in Italy before Italy joined the Entente Powers. Moreover, a system of British Consular certi-ficates of non-enemy interest* has recently been introduced in most other neutral countries throughout the world, with the notable exception, however, of the United States of America.8. There may be difficulties of which we are not cognisant in perpetuating the system of certificates of origin in the countries where it is now operative, in extending it to cover goods (eg., foodstuffs) which are now exempt from its operation,! or in extending the same system to other countries in Europe and elsewhere. It is for the Foreign Office, and not the Customs, to express an opinion on these points; we have not consulted them, and nothing in this memorandum must be read as committing them. The Committee will no doubt take an early opportunity of eliciting their views.9. It must not be forgotten, in this connection, that, as a counter-move to the avowed policy of the Allies, the Central Empires may adopt the plan of planting out their produce in neutral countries, with the intention of introducing them in the guise of neutral goods into the markets of the Allies. A subsidised German Mercantile Navy would enable the German merchant to plant out his wares with a minimum of expense, and it may be necessary to watch not only imports from, say Holland and Sweden, but also imports from such distant countries as the Argentine and Mexico, to say nothing of the U.S.A. The German merchant may be relied upon to select his dumping places with discretion; he will not be so foolish as to dump goods in a country which is itself incapable of producing them. On the other hand, if&apos;the Foreign Office foresee serious difficulties in setting up a practically universal system of Consular Certifi-cates of Origin, it may be considered that the cost of carrying enemy produce across the ocean and back will itself constitute, directly or indirectly, a sufficiently onerous burden on enemy exports to the United Kingdom after the war. In that event the difficulty might be solved by restricting the system of Certificates to European countries, and ignoring (or rather acquiescing in) the possibility of enemy goods reaching the United Kingdom by. expensive and circuitous routes.10. We proceed with our observations as to the points put to us By the Committee on the assumption that the British Consular Certificate of Origin is accepted as the basis of Customs action. We also assume that the Customs will fas indeed they must, if they are not to rely almost entirely on the advice of trade experts) accept a Certificate of Origin at its face value in the absence of any evidence, in the shape of positive indication of enemy origin, tending to show that a Certificate for a particular consignment has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, or that the goods themselves are not the goods which the.relative Certificate is intended to cover.Regime of Prohibition.   .11. If these assumptions are accepted, we may say at once that a system of prohibition, tempered by licences, is not only practicable, but is the simplest and most economical method of attaining the object in view, so far as concerns considerations which come within the purview of the Customs and Excise Department.   Viewed administratively, prohibition is simplicity* i.e.,.-a. certificate that no person has an interest in a prospective consignment of goods to the United Kingdom whose name is on the Statutory Black List, issued from time to time under the Trading with the Enemy (Extension of Powers) Act, 1915.t Exempt either because the goods are not produced in enemy countries, or because it is taken for granted that the Central Empires require all available supplies for themselves and will not, in any circumstances, allow exportation.um j)
itself as compared with a tariff, given a system of Certificates of Origin (which is equally necessary for a tariff); it has also the great advantage of not requiring a prolonged period of preparation, while vexed questions affecting trade interests, &amp;c, are discussed and settled, and later on while the necessarily elaborate and complicated instructions to the Customs are being drawn up.12. Speaking for ourselves, we see no reason why a system of prohibition should not be brought into operation, or at any rate into partial operation, immediately, or almost immedi-ately, after the conclusion of peace. There would be none of the delay resulting while valuers and additional staff were being engaged, or while bonded premises were acquired and approved; and the Customs war machinery in relation to Certificates of Origin and the import prohibitions already in force could readily be adapted to meet the new regime. It is only necessary that the Foreign Office should arrange to continue the system of Consular Certificates of Origin in those countries where.the system is already in operation, and extend it by degrees to other countries in which it is considered necessary to apply the same system. It is probable that even for pro-hibition some additional Customs staff would be required. The addition would, however, be a comparatively small one, such as could easily be absorbed on the lapse of prohibition; and we could carry on without it during the initial period, while the system is in process of development.13. One other merit of prohibition is that, if it be decided to temper the rigour of the special regime in favour of certain essential enemy goods (see paragraph 35), a system of import licences, administered by a body appointed ad hoc. (and of course quite independent of the Customs), would afford the Government a means of keeping a tighter, and at the same time more elastic, hold over the importation of these favoured imports than would be possible under a tariff system. For by means of a licence system quantity as well as quality could be controlled, while the policy of the Government in relation to such imports could be modified at will according to the changing needs of the moment without recourse to legislation or Orders in Council. Such a system is already in force under the war machinery for controlling imports; and our experience enables us to assure the Committee that its continuance after the war would present no serious difficulties so far as the Customs are concerned.14. If Government decide that the regime first adopted should be one of prohibition, it would, of course, be possible to convert it (after a shorter or longer period, according to the complexity of the tariff contemplated) into a regime of tariff.Regime of Tariff.-15.   We pass now to the consideration of the alternative of proceeding by way of tariff.16. The practical difficulties in working any such system are much greater than in a system of prohibition, and before dealing with possible varieties of tariff, and the difficulties inherent in each, a few general observations may be set down.17&apos;. Starting from the axiom that the difficulty of administering a tariff and the number of staff required vary directly with the complexity of the tariff, it follows that, if a tariff is to be imposed only for a limited period, it should be as simple as is consistent with the object at which it aims, if only to avoid the waste of public money on engaging staff whose raison d&apos;etre might shortly disappear.18. The difficulties of working a tariff will vary in scope and complexity according as Government decide to adopt:  (A) A tariff aimed at collecting revenue theoretically of universal application, whichcould be manipulated so as incidentally to penalise enemy goods (e.g., a heavy tariff exacted in full on enemy goods, reduced for neutrals, further reduced for Allies, and remitted for our Dominions and Colonies); or(B) A tariff having for its sole object the penalisation of enemy goods.19. Further, the difficulties of administration will vary according as the tariff, whether of the variety (A) or (B) as described in the preceding paragraph, covers all imported goods, or is confined to certain specified articles.20. Our experience of the new import duties imposed in 1915 shows, that the four factors in a tariff which present most difficulty at headquarters (to our Secretariat, our legal branch, and our Inspectorate), and to the officers who deal directly with the goods on the spot, are_(a) Questions oi-ancipitis usus where an article is taxable, not per se, but by relation toits future use, e.g., ball bearings taxable if to be put into a motor car, free if to be put into a pumping engine.;(b) Exemption of an article taxable per se (e.g., a motor car to be used in trade);(c) The ad valorem element; and(d) Drawbacks upon exportation.21. There are four systems on which a tariff could be drawn up and applied in each case, either to all imports or to selected imports :  System 1. A tax at a uniform rate based upon weights or quantities.System 2. A tax based on weights or quantities, not at one uniform rate, but at a limitednumber of rates, each applicable to a group of commodities. System 3.-An ad valorem tax.System 4. A specific tariff, containing a special rate for each article.
42122. In the following paragraphs, 23-28, we propose shortly to discuss the comparative merits and demerits of these four systems from a Customs point of view.We have assumed that in any system which may be adopted it will not be considered neces-sary (having regard to the main object, which is to penalise enemy imports) to provide at once for any large scheme of allowing drawback on exportation or for any extensive development of bonding privileges.If this assumption is incorrect, our difficulties in administration and the number of staff required will be, of course, largely increased. System 1.23. Would be from the Customs point of view, i.e., dealing with the goods on arrival, easy to work, and not expensive in staff. Possibly it would require not more than 300 or 400 more men. It would, however, operate in the highest degree unequally and inequitably between commodities of different values. This would probably prevent it ever being adopted for a revenue tariff. It might, however, have its uses as a penal instrument. System 2.24. Is an attempt to avoid the more glaring inequalities of System .1 by introducing the element of value. It has the faults of most compromises. The inequalities of System 1 could only be remedied by introducing the element of value (and consequently increasing the number of groups of commodities) to such an extent as largely to incur the difficulties of System 3.It would be.from the Customs point of view (i.e., dealing with the goods on arrival), com-paratively simpler and cheaper to work than System 3, but not to the same extent as System 1.25. For such a tariff historical parallel may be found in the &quot; Unit of Entry &quot; duty imposed by Mr. Gladstone in .1860 and repealed in 1863. The duty was then Id. per unit, the unit varying in accordance &quot;with the description and value of the article, e.g., for tea, the unit was 30 lb.; for hides, 1 cwt.; for cement/, 1 ton; for onions, 8 bushels; for olive oil, 8 gallons.System 3.26.   The difficulties, from an administrative point of view, of levying duties on an ad valorem tariff, apart from any additional complications if drawbacks have to be given, are too well known to need exposition.   They must be great, even when there has been plenty of time to elaborate a tariff after full consultation with the trades affected, and to prepare the machinery of administration.   They would obviously be enormously increased if a department with practically no tariff experience was called upon at short notice to work a hastily constructed scheme.   The first desideratum is a staff of valuers.   Questions of value, like questions of origin, cannot be satisfactorily determined by the Customs without expert advice, a fact which has already been recognised by the appointment of experts as technical advisers in the administration of the ad valorem duties imposed in 1915.   An ad valorem tariff, especially if of general or wide application, would need a very large staff of valuers representing a number of different trades, and stationed not only at headquarters, but at some of the principal outports of the United Kingdom with a central appeal board.   To collect a sufficient number of suitable men after the conclusion of hostilities to undertake valuation duties on behalf of the Government would be difficult, but it could probably be done in a rough and ready manner sufficient to start the system. The men would have to be very well paid.27. Side by side with the operations of the valuers, the levying of duties on an ad valorem tariff would impose an immense amount of work (administrative, clerical, and manipulative) upon the Customs staff at headquarters, and at the ports. It is not possible to make any exact forecast, but it is probable that some 1,200 additional officers with corresponding additions at headquarters would be the minimum number required to work a general ad valorem tariff, even if unaccompanied by any system of drawbacks. If it were decided to restrict an ad valorem tariff to selected imports, or to selected enemy imports, a smaller number would suffice. The Customs difficulties of a tariff, from the staff point of view, would of course be reduced, if con-currently with the imposition of a tariff means could be found for relieving the Customs and Excise Department of some of the multifarious work which it performs on behalf.of other depart-ments (e.g., the collection of income tax for the Inland Revenue Department), and of the Old Age Pension work which monopolises so large a share in the activities of our Excise staff.System 4.28. From the Customs point of view a specific tariff would at the start be easier to work and cheaper than an ad valorem, tariff, especially if it was confined to selected goods or to selected enemy goods.If the Government decide to adopt a specific tariff, its preparation should be set in hand forthwith (see paragraph 34).Drawback and Bonding. 29. Turning now to the question of drawback, we enclose a memorandum! which was recently drawn up for us on the drawback system in this country. The Committee will see from this memorandum that, until recently, one of the cardinal features of the British drawback system has been its limitation to dutiable goods which have undergone some process of manufacture in this country, and admit of chemical analysis; while, side by side with this system, there is in force a bonding system under which manufacturers are, in certain cases, allowed the option of conducting the manufacturing process in bond. The relative merits of the drawback and bonding systems from the two points of view of the manufacturer and the revenue arc sketched within the enclosed  memorandum,* which, though Originally drawn up withSee Memorandum VIII, on page 29. * See Memorandum IX, on page 33.l        HO   OS.22.
sole reference to the special case of perfumed spirits, will probably suffice to give the Com-mittee an idea of the principal factors affecting the general question. For dutiable goods exported in the state in which they were imported, the general rule has been to require deposit in bond as a condition of waiving payment of duty. This latter rule has, however, been abandoned in the case of the ad valorem duties imposed in 1915. The Act imposing those duties allowed drawback on all goods iiable to the new import duties which have paid the duty on importation into this country and have not been &quot; used.&apos;&apos;- While importers of wine or leaf tobacco, if they wish to re-export their commodities, must do so from bond, it was felt that it would be manifestly prejudicial to British trade to impose any. such conditions in the case of, e.g., watches or pianos, which require to be tested and adjusted, and also depend for their market upon inspection by the intending purchaser for export. This new departure has, even in the limited field for which it was sanctioned, resulted in a serious amount of work.30. If anything in the nature of a comprehensive tariff is contemplated, the chief difficulties will probably be in connection with the questions of bonding and drawback. The questions which arise are principally as follows :  (1) Shall bonding privileges be allowed at all?(2) If so, shall they be allowed for goods intended alike for home consumption andexportation; or (3) Shall they be restricted to the latter class alone ? (4) Shall manufacture in bond be permitted ?(5) If so, shall it be allowed for home consumption as well as for exportation; or (6) Shall it be restricted to the latter class alone ?(7) Shall drawback on exportation be allowed on goods delivered after payment of duty ? (8) If so, shall this be conceded alike to goods which have undergone some process of manufacture in this country, and to those re-exported in their original condition ;-or (9) Shall the privilege be restricted to either category of goods ?31. These questions are so complicated and entail so many issues affecting both the interests of British traders and the machinery of administration, that they cannot be satisfactorily dealt with in this memorandum without delaying its issue, but we hope to submit a further memo-randum dealing with the many difficulties which they involve from the point of view of this Department.For the present, in the absence of some indication as to the line which will be taken by the Committee on these questions, we have not attempted to do more than mention the existence of the problems, and to state that upon their satisfactory solution very largely depends the possibility of successfully working any comprehensive tariff.32. We have in the preceding paragraphs indicated to the Committee the principal Customs difficulties besetting the imposition of a tariff as the &quot; special regime of an effective character &quot; which the Government contemplate in relation to the importation of enemy goods after the war. We hope, however, that, despite its difficulties, the task of effectively administering a tariff would not be beyond the powers of our Department, given the three preliminary desiderata which we have indicated above, viz., a system of Consular Certificates of Origin, a staff of expert valuers, if an ad valorem tariff is selected, and an increase of Customs staff commensurate with the com-plexity of the problem. In this connection we would again refer to paragraph 22, in which we pointed out how much more difficult the problem will be if a system is adopted involving large developments of the systems of bond or drawback.33. The question how soon a tariff could be brought into operation after the conclusion, of peace depends upon the nature of the tariff selected. A simple tariff on selected goods or selected enemy goods could be brought into operation in a comparatively short time. A general tariff, especially if complicated in the matter of bonding or drawback facilities, must necessarily take considerably longer.34. We feel it necessary to state in this connection, firstly, that it would be useless to begin the preliminary Customs arrangements for administering a tariff unless we were first conversant with its details, and secondly, that we take it for granted that, if the Government decide upon a tariff, whatever its nature, its details will be settled in the interval between now and the con-clusion of peace by some body of persons conversant with tariffs and tariff questions appointed for this special purpose.Our staff are already so overburdened with the special work arising directly or indirectly out of the war, that, so long as the war lasts, the task of working out the details of a tariff would not be satisfactorily performed by this Department. ,Conclusion.35. From a Customs point of view we are of opinion (1) that the regime to be first adopted should be that of prohibition, conditioned byConsular certificates of origin and licences to import; (2) that, if it is desired to convert this regime into a tariff or to start with a tariff, abeginning should be made with the simplest possible tariff, deferring till a laterperiod;(3) the introduction, if desired, of a more elaborate tar:ff with provision/ if considered necessary, of extensive bonding&apos;and drawback arrangements.Custom House, E.C.,. ith October 1916.jsp&quot;-&quot;-&apos;.......-..........n.......................
MEMORANDUM ON THE PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE GRANT OF DRAWBACK ON ARTICLES SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS AND EXCISE DUTIES.(Furnished by the Board of Customs and Excise.)A.-General Principles.1. Customs and Excise duties on articles of consumption are intended to fall only on goods consumed in the United Kingdom, in other words, to be paid eventually by the consumer of the goods, and not by the importers or dealers. It follows that merchants who import dutiable goods and subsequently &quot;re-export&quot; them, or who manufacture here and export goods con-Lining dutiable ingredients, may claim to be entirely freed from any duty, To refuse this would not only be against the theory of indirect taxation, but would handicap the British exporter in foreign markets, whenever competition in the article existed, to an extent which might seriously restrict or even entirely prevent exports.2. The relief from duties levied in the United Kingdom is effected for each dutiable article either by the Bonded Warehouse system or by the Drawback system, but both systems are not (save in one or two cases) applied to the same goods. All goods (except Foreign Beer, and the articles on which new import duties were imposed in 1915, as to which see below) which can be re-exported without alteration, or after such operations only as can be performed in a warehouse under revenue supervision, must, in order to be free from duty on exportation, be kept in a bonded warehouse. It has always been held that the Drawback system is &quot;intended to apply only to those goods which, before exportation, are mixed with other goods, or are subjected to processes which cannot well take place in a bonded warehouse. Thus drawback is not allowed on Foreign Spirits, or Plain British Spirits (except when they have been re-manu-factured by a licensed rectifier) or on Wine or Tea (to mention the most important articles only), because all operations required to fit them for a foreign market such as blending, bottling, and repacking can be done in bond. But Tobacco manufactured from raw Tobacco on which duty has been paid, Spirits which are &quot; rectified &quot; or &quot;compounded&quot; (i.e., made into Gin, Liqueurs, &amp;c), and goods containing Sugar, such as Confectionery, Jams, and Biscuits, are allowed draw-back, because it is not convenient to have these manufacturing processes performed in bond under revenue supervision.3. This distinction between the two systems, therefore, is made more on practical than on theoretical grounds. There are, in fact, strong practical objections to allowing drawback in any case where it is not absolutely necessary, on account of the danger of fraud by the admixture of non-dutiable articles with the dutiable goods presented for drawback, and the difficulty, in many cases, of ascertaining the amount of draw-back payable. (In former times there was also the danger that smuggled goods, which had paid no duty, would be presented for drawback, hut now that systematic smuggling on a commercial scale has come to an end this need hardly be considered.)4. Thus the operation of the Tobacco drawback is very troublesome and expensive, because every consignment exported has to be carefully sampled and analysed, in order to ascertain&quot; the exact proportion of moisture (the rate of drawback being necessarily based on a standard percentage of moisture) and, especially in the case of refuse Tobacco (i.e., the stalks, fragments, &amp;c, which cannot be used by the manufacturer, but can be abandoned or used for making sheep-wash, &amp;c), to see that no extraneous matter has been added.5. The allowance of drawback on goods containing sugar would be quite impracticable if every consignment exported had to be examined, sampled, and analysed. No such examination is made, and fixed rates of drawback on each article are granted to each regular exporter, based on a preliminary x analysis of his goods and subject to periodical revision, but this is only possible because the duty is comparatively low and the amount of revenue involved small.6. It would obviously be impossible to. allow drawback on Wine, because the admixture of weaker wine or water could not, within certain limits, be detected; and the same would pro-bably be the case with Tea, on account of the difficulty of detecting extraneous substances, and the admixture of exhausted leaves, i.e., leaves which had already gone into consumption, especially as much Tea is exported in small packets.7. Hence it is a sound general rule that drawback should only be allowed if there is no other method by which exported goods can be freed from the incidence of import duties.8. In order to free the exporter as completely as possible from the effects of the duty, and to place him in the same position as if he were dealing with free goods, aUoicances are also granted on the exportation of spirits produced in the United Kingdom, to countervail the cost to the exporter of Customs and Excise restrictions, which are necessarily imposed to safeguard the revenue during their manufacture.9. A list of the articles on which drawback is allowed in this country, and of the principal articles on which it is not allowed, is annexed, and a list of the Allowances on various descrip-tions of home-made Spirits, and on Matches, and home-grown Tobacco.
B. Exceptions to General Principles.10. Foreign Beer.--Until 1915, this was the only article which received drawback on exportation in the state in which it had been imported. Drawback on the exportation of foreign beer was allowed under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, in the year following the substitution of the Beer duty for the Malt. duty.It is not clear why drawback was allowed on an article which had undergone no change in the United Kingdom, since this was contrary to the usual Customs practice, but the matter is quite unimportant, the amount of foreign beer exported being very small.11. Articles on which Duties were first imposed in 1915. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, imposed duties on Motor Cars (including motor bicycles and tricycles) with their component parts (except tyres), and accessories; Musical Instruments, their component parts and accessories; Clocks and Watches, and their component parts; and Cinematograph Films. Section 13 provided that: &quot; If it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise that a new import duty has been duly paid in respect of any article, and that the article has not been used in Great Britain or Ireland, a drawback equal to the amount of duty paid shall be allowed on that Article if exported as merchandise.&quot;12. This is an exception to the general principle hitherto observed;&apos; that drawback shall not be allowed on imported articles which have not been altered in character or used &quot;in manu-facture, &amp;c. The main reason was that, as the duties in question were originally imposed only for a period of 10 months (29th September, 1915 to 1st August, 1916), it would hardly have been equitable to put the various trades concerned to the expense of providing bonded accommo-dation as the sole means of obtaining remission of duty on exportation. As regards components and accessories, moreover, the principle is not violated, since they are usually exported as parts of a complete article made in the United Kingdom. The practical difRculties of identifying, in such circumstances, the article on which drawback is claimed with an article on which duty has been paid are considerable, but need not be discussed here.Custom House, E.C., October, 1916.APPENDIX.I.

IX.MEMORANDUM ON THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MANUFACTURE FOR EXPORT IN BOND, AND OF EXPORT UNDER DRAWBACK.(Furnished by- the Board of Customs and. Excise.) As regards the relative advantages or disadvantages (a) to the trader; and (6) to the Revenue; of the two alternative systems of manufacture for export in bond, and of export under drawback, the varying methods of manufacture adopted and the consequent differences in the length of the periods during which spirit is kept in stock render it very difficult to deal generally with these points.The advantages of the bonding system are undoubtedly very great to the trader if they can be enjoyed without involving additional expense in management. His capital outlay is lessened by the amount of the duty, and in the case of perfumes requiring a long time to mature this must be a very important consideration. There is less trouble with regard to the notices to pack goods for exportation, as the bulk quantity only is required to be given in the documents affected. No time is taken up with the ascertainment of the exact strengths at the time of exportation and the calculation of quantities at proof. Exporters do not require to calculate proof quantities for the ordinary purposes of their business, and those who work in bond do not keep accounts in proof gallons. An exporter working in bond is not required to take out a licence as a Compounder of Spirits, duty 15L 15s. annually.The disadvantages appear to be :  (1) The necessity for manufacturing separately for the home trade and for export and keeping in the bonded stock as well as in the duty-paid stock all the varieties of perfumes which may be needed; (2) the restriction of hours during which business may be carried on;(3) the separation of the business, home and export, much more widely than is necessary when it is all done in one set of premises; this disadvantage varies of course with the distance between the duty-paid and bonded stocks, but in no case can it be wholly eliminated.From a Revenue standpoint the bonding system has the advantage that it is possible to maintain control of the operations to such an extent as to make certain that the revenue is not endangered; there can be no risk, e.g., in the case of a maker whose operations occupy only a very short time, that sums paid as drawback may be in excess of the sums paid as duty. Where&apos; the operations are sufficiently large to occupy the close attention of an officer, or can be supervised by an officer with other duties, we think the cost of supervision may be regarded as reduced to a minimum. On the other hand disadvantages would arise if at any time the operations at a warehouse were reduced in volume, and in all warehouses where perfumery is made for exporta-tion it is necessary that the supervision be extremely close and attentive; e.g., there is no means of identifying the contents of iars and bottles with the records of articles received, the identity of original packages is lost as soon as they go to operations. It becomes necessary to control as closely as possible the receipt and delivery of every item, including; such matters as water for cleansing and drinking purposes and ice for cooling operations. Until stock is taken, once a year, the only real check on the operations is the strict control of everything brought into or sent out of the warehouse. The conditions are quite unlike those of a warehouse where the identity of every package can be traced in a register.As regards the advantages to the trader of the system of exporting perfumes on drawback, only one stock of goods need be kept from which home trade and export trade alike can be supplied, and apart from the question of capital outlay in spirit duty the balance of advantage, arising from the freedom from control in manufacturing operations, may perhaps be with the drawback system. Where goods are made quickly the loss in manufacture and interest on capital may we think be regarded as covered by the 3 per cent, allowance. The principal disadvantage arises when the operations are lengthy, causing greater wastage and loss of interest on capital. The necessity for being able to give a precise account of the proof quantity of spirit in every item packed imposes extra expense not incurred under bonding conditions, and the cost of the samples taken for analysis is a substantial item either when the goods are very expensive or very cheap  in the latter case the duty lost on the spirit in the sample may represent the profit on at least a dozen bottles.We think the advantages and disadvantages of the two systems may be summed up briefly as follows :  , Manufactured in Bond.Advantages to  the Trader. Disadvantages to the Trader.1. No outlay for duty and consequently a saving of capital. No question arises as to whether duty paid is recovered in full.2. Maturing process may be prolonged with-oot loss of interest on duty.o. Not required to be licensed as a oom-pounder of spirits.4. Clerical labour is saved as accounts are kept in bulk quantities only not proof.5. No samples are taken to check strength of nerfumes shipped.1. Hours of working restricted.2. Separation of business into two distinct branches, involving addition to cost of working which may be considerable when bonded premises are at a distance from duty-paid premises. &apos;
Advantages to the Revenue. Disadvantages to the Revenue.1. Complete control can be exercised over manufacturing operations.2. No risk of paying sums as drawback in excess of tbe sums paid as duty.3. Saving of labour in connection with tbe checking and payment of drawback, and the examination of samples.1. Eelative cost of control increases with diminution of business.2. To ensure protection against fraud obser-vation must be close and continuous.Exportation on Drawback.Disadvantages   to   the   Trader.1. Duty has to be paid before the operations can be commenced, involving the use of a larger capital and loss of interest during the period from the date when the duty is paid to the date of receipt of drawback.2. The licence duty must be paid to secure this privilege, although no other liability to the licence duty may be incurred.3. The notice to pack requires that the true alcoholic strength of the perfumes and the proof quantities be ascertained.4. On perfumes requiring time to mature the 3 per cent, allowance may not cover these losses. &apos;5. The loss entailed by the necessity for samples being taken for analysis may be appre-ciable.Disadvantages to the Revenue.1. The checking of the accounts, the pay-ment of drawback, and the examination of samples involves much labour.2. In other cases the drawback paid may be -more than the duty.Customs House, E.C. October 1916.X.MEMORANDUM BY THE BOARD OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANTI-DUMPING LAWS.1. The Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the War have sent us a copy of a memorandum which has been furnished to them on the &quot; anti-dumping &quot; legislation in force in Canada, South Africa and.the United States,* and have asked for our opinion as to any &quot; special administrative considerations &quot; arising in connection with a proposal to enact in this country provisions similar to those of the Canadian law.2. We shall make no. attempt to discuss the question of policy underlying this proposal either as respects the desirability of anti-dumping legislation in the United Kingdom or as respects its efficiency as a means of thwarting or penalising the transactions which it is intended to thwart or penalise. For the purpose of this memorandum we take the Canadian system as it stands, and consider what our own position would be if we were called upon to administer a similar system&apos;in this country. It is necessary, however, at the outset to explain the part that &quot; value &quot; plays to-day in the administration of the British Customs as applied to imports.3. The value of imported goods is one of the details which the importer or his agent is required to insert in the relative import entry as a matter of regular routine. For this purpose the term &quot; value&quot; is intended to mean the c.i.f. value of the goods, i.e., their cost to the parti-cular British importer concerned, including insurance and freight to the place of landing, or,* See Memorandum IV on page 16.Advantages to the Trader.1.

in the case of goods consigned for sale, the latest sale value (see Introduction to Vol. 1 of Annual Statement of Trade).   This value is hereinafter called, for the sake of brevity, &quot;value A.&quot;4. Before the imposition of the ad valorem import duties in 1915, the importers declara-tion of value had no interest for us in our capacity as Collectors of ReA^enue. We demanded his declaration of value for statistical purposes only; we looked at it to make sure that there was no apparent inconsistency between declared value and.declared quantity; and, being satisfied on this point, we recorded the declared value as an item to be swallowed up in our compilation of trade statistics for eventual publication by the Board of Trade in the Monthly and Annual Statements of Trade. It was only in cases of suspected error that we called for evidence of value in the shape of invoices, &amp;c, and, if necessary, required the entry to be amended. In short, the importer having no inducement to falsify his declaration, we were content to accept it unchallenged unless it were palpably wrong. No machinery existed for systematically checking declarations of value or reducing them to precision.5., The position summarised in paragraph 4 represents also the position at the present day except in that narrowly limited field of imports which are subject to ad valorem duties (i.e., motor cars, musical instruments and watches and clocks). Here we have for the first-time in recent years been brought into contact with questions of import value on the revenue side of Customs administration. The value to be taken for purposes of the ad, valorem duties is defined by Section 12 (2) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, as &quot;the price which an importer would give for the article if the article were delivered, freight and insurance paid, in bond at the port.of importation.&quot; This value (hereinafter called value B) differs in theory, though it may not differ in practice, from value A. The words &quot;an importer&quot; are significant in this connection. Value A is the cost (c.i.f.) of an article to the particular importer concerned; value B is the standard (c.i.f.) value of the article in the home (wholesale) market.6. Turning now to the Canadian law, we find that the two values which serve as factors in determining liability to dumping duty are neither value A nor value B, but two different values, which we will call value C and value D. Value C is the selling price of the goods to the particular importer in Canada, i.e., it corresponds to our value A but is f.o.b. instead of c.i.f. Value D is the fair market value (presumably wholesale) in the country of export; it is thus the foreign value corresponding to our British Value B. Liability to dumping duty depends on the difference between value D and value C.7. We summarise beloV the information we have been able to glean as to the Canadian method of ascertaining values C and D and checking the importers declaration of value.Import declarations. With every import entry an invoice in duplicate must be produced-. The invoice must show in parallel columns the actual selling price (C) and the fair market price in the country whence the goods were consigned (D). The consignor is required to give a certificate to the correctness of the invoice in a prescribed form; presumably the importer also certifies to the truth of the particulars furnished to the Customs so far as such particulars are. within his own knowledge..Penalties, Sfc. A Canadian importer is liable to penalties if he makes a false declaration; but we do not know what machinery (if any) exists for penalising a false certificate as to value D by the consignor abroad. It is an offence to bring into Canada, or to have in Canada, blank invoices bearing a certificate of correctness. The price of goods falsely invoiced is not recoverable in the: Canadian Courts. The existence of two invoices showing different prices is. prima facie evidence that the lower was intended to be used for fraud on the Customs.Checks on declaration of Value C. The ordinary Customs staff in Canada is assisted by a staff of expert appraisers stationed at the principal ports. The administration has- also the power of calling upon an importer to produce all invoices, books and documents relating not only to any particular consignment of imported goods but to all the goods he has imported during the preceding six years.Checks on declaration of Value D. Canadian Customs officials are specially employed travelling about Europe visiting consignors, examining their books and collecting information generally. We gather that these officials do not (as United States Consuls do) certify to the correctness of invoices, &amp;c, before shipment. Their function seems to be to investigate cases specially referred to them for the purpose from Canada, and to feed the Canadian Customs with information about the movements of foreign markets, tariff changes, &amp;c.8. It strikes us as a point of difficulty in the Canadian anti-dumping system that an importer of dumped goods has no inducement to &quot;give awav &quot; the price he has paid for them (value C). Whatever figure he gives for value C. the charge of ad valorem, duty is the same, i.e., it follows value D; and it would seem an easy matter for the importer to cloak a dumping transaction by a false (though to all appearances unexceptionable) invoice in which a sale value approximating to value D is specified. It may be (a) that the right of examining importers&apos; books is so sj^stematically exercised by the Canadian Customs for purposes of their ad valorem tariff as to ensure detection sooner or later for this kind of fraud. Or (&amp;) the Canadian Customs may rely upon outside information from rival, importers and traders for the means of selecting the particular invoices which are most likely to repav the labour of investigation. In this country it is upon (b) that we should have to rely almost entirely if we were called upon to administer an anti-dumping law on Canadian lines without creating new and elaborate machinery for the purpose of (a).h432B2
9. It remains to consider the still more difficult problem of value D. In Canada, where value D is the basis of the ad valorem Tariff covering a very wide range of imported commodities, tb/s problem had already been solved when the dumping duty was imposed. The machinery for assessing value D was ready to hand in working order; and it must have been a comparatively simple task to graft the anti-dumping principle on to it. With us the position is very different; for in tbe British Customs system of to-day machinery for assessing value D is non-existent as respects the great bulk of our imports, and only the rudiments of it exist even as respects the three classes of goods which are liable to ad valorem duties in the United Kingdom.10. We take it for granted that, unless or until an ad valorem tariff on Canadian lines commends itself to the Government as desirable per se, they will not embark upon the task of setting up tbe elaborate and costly machinery incidental to such a tariff merely for the sake of imitating the Canadian anti-dumping system. In this connection it may not be out of place to quote the following paragraphs from a memorandum we prepared for the Committee in October, 1916, about the means of applying to enemy goods the &quot; special regime of an effective character &quot; which has been advocated by the Economic Conference of the Allies*:  26. The difficulties, from an administrative point of view, of levying duties on an ad valorem tariff, apart from any additional complications if drawbacks have to be given, are too well known to need exposition. They must be great even when there has been plenty of time to elaborate a tariff after full consultation with the trades affected and to prepare the machinery of administration. They would obviously be enormously increased if a department with practically no tariff experience were called upon at short notice to work a hastily-constructed scheme. The first desideratum is a staff of valuers. Questions of value, like questions of origin, cannot be satisfactorily determined by the Customs without expert advice-a fact which has already &apos; been recognised by the appointment of experts as technical advisers in the administration of the ad valorem duties imposed in 1915. An ud valorem tariff, especially if of general or wide application, would need a very large staff of valuers representing a number of different trades, and stationed not Qnly at Headquarters but at some of the principal outports of the United Kingdom with a central appeal Board. To collect a sufficient number of suitable men after the conclusion of hostilities to undertake valuation duties on behalf of the Government would be difficult, but it could probably be done in a rough and ready manner sufficient to start the system.   The men would have to be very well paid.2i&quot;. Side by side with the operations of the valuers, the levying of duties on an ad valorem tariff would impose an immense amount ot work (administrative, clerical and manipulative) upon the Customs staff at Headquarters and at the ports. It is not possible to make any exact forecast, but it is probable that some 1,200 additional officers, with corresponding additions at Headquarters, would be the minimum number required to work a general uu valorem, tariff even if unaccompanied by any system of drawbacks. If it were decided to restrict an ud valorem taritf to selected imports, or to selected enemy imports, a smaller number would suffice. The Customs difficulties of a tariff, from the staff point of view, would of course be reduced if, concurrently with the imposition of a tariff, means could be found for relieving the Customs and Excise Departments of some of the multifarious work which it performs on behalf of other Departments (e.g., the collection of Income Tax for the Inland Revenue Department), and of the Old Age Pension work which monopolises so large a share in the activities of our Excise staff.11. When we wrote these paragraphs we had in mind a tariff developed on the lines of the ad valorem duties we now have, i.e., a tariff based upon borne standard values (B). Had we been discussing a tariff based, like the Canadian, upon foreign standard values (D), we must have emphasised also the necessity for the special organisation abroad which is (as we have seen in paragraph 7) one feature of the Canadian ad valorem and anti-dumping systems. We do not know, and have not enquired, how far, if at all, such an organisation could be provided by tbe Foreign Office through the medium of British Consular Officers (in combination with a system of Certificates of Origin, if this be adopted as part of the &quot; special regime &quot; for penalising enemy goods), or by the Board of Trade as an adjunct to their plan for appointing Trade Commissioners (cf. pages 16-20 of the Extracts from the Minutes of Proceedings, &amp;c, of the Imperial War Conference, 1917, Cd. 8566). It may be that the labour and expense of maintaining an organisation of this kind would in itself be regarded as too high a price to pay for any prospective benefit from anti-dumping legislation. (We notice in this connection that tbe revenue derived from the dumping duty in Canada is almost negligible, being not more than about  14,000, or less than one thousandth part of the Customs duties as a whole, though this fact may of course be a testimony to the efficacy of the anti-dumping tax as a measure of prevention.)12. We do not suggest that the idea of anti-dumping legislation in this country is neces-sarily negatived if the Canadian machinery cannot be adopted in its entirety. Bearing in mind the probability that we should in any case have to rely mainly upon outside information for the means of detecting a dumping transaction (see paragraph 8 above), we think it possible that, if some kind of anti-dumping legislation is considered an immediate desideratum, a fairly effective makeshift might be found in legislation on the analogy of the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act, .1897, and Section 16, Sub-sections (2) and (3) of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887. If this suggestion were adopted, we should not set up any special Customs machinery for the detection of dumping transactions; but we should be given statutory power to take action, by detention or otherwise, in relation to any imported goods as to which dumping is alleged by an outside informant, subject to such conditions (in regard to the security, .&amp;c, to be given by the informant) as may be prescribed by regulations drawn up by us for the purpose..13. It is to be remembered, however, that for the purpose of investigating an allegation made to us by an outside informant that any particular goods are the subject of a dumping transaction we should almost certainly require the assistance of the Foreign Office or of the Board of Trade (or of both) in procuring from abroad reliable evidence as to the value of the goods concerned in the market of the country from which they were imported. If therefore the Committee are disposed to favour the suggestion we have made in paragraph 12, they will no doubt ask the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade how far they would be able and willing to afford us the requisite assistance.
CONCLUSIONS.14.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : -(1) that the systematic enforcement of anti-dumping legislation on Canadian lines pre-supposes the existence of a general ad valorem tariff on Canadian lines, i.e., a tariff based on the foreign standard value of the imported article;(2) That, unless or until an ad valorem tariff on Canadian lines is set up in this country, the Canadian anti-dumping system could, not be adopted in its entirety without establishing elaborate Customs machinery at home and a special organisation abroad at a cost which would probably be regarded as prohibitive;(3) That in the meantime, given the co-operation of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, legislation might follow the lines of the Foreign Prison-made Goods Act. 1897, and Section 16 of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887.Customs House, E.C.,September, 1917. ,XI.SUMMARY  OF&apos; REPLIES  RECEIVED  FROM  CHAMBERS. OF  COMMERCE  TO COMMITTEES CIRCULAR LETTER OF THE 1st AUGUST, 1916.   (MAY, 1917.)A letter was circulated to a number of Chambers of Commerce on the 1st August, 1916,&apos; directing their attention to the terms of reference of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, and inviting them to furnish suggestions for consideration in regard to any of the matters included within the scope of the Committee&apos;s terms of reference.    Replies have been received from the following Chambers :  Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Bury and District, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Gloucester, Grimsby, Hull, Leith, London (3 Reports), Manchester, Morley, Newcastle and Gateshead, Newport, Nottingham, Oldham, Ossett, Plymouth, Sheffield, Swansea, Wakefield, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Woolwich.At the Special and Annual meetings of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom on the 29th February and the 1st and 2nd March, 1916, a number of Resolu-tions were passed with regard to future national policy. These Resolutions have been circulated to the Committee, together with a Memorandum and three Reports furnished by the London Chamber of Commerce, a Report by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, and a Memorandum by the Newport Chamber of Commerce.I. General Policy.As regards general policy, the London Chamber of Commerce has adopted the following resolutions:  &quot; That His Majesty&apos;s Government be urged to give effect, in conjunction with the Allies, to such recommendations of the Economic Conference in Paris as have not already been provided for, or which have only been carried partially into effect.&quot;&quot; That His Majesty&apos;s Government be urged, in conjunction with the Allies, to consider the effect of the recommendations of the Economic Conference upon future trade relations with neutral countries in order to avoid the danger of such neutral countries being induced to enter into commercial alliances with enemy countries after the war, to the detriment of the British Empire and the Allied countries.&quot;The Manchester Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the following statement of its views as to the commercial policy which it desires to see adopted:  &quot; This Chamber is convinced of the need for improved scientific education, especially in its highest branches; better organisation of individual industries; general amendments of Patent Laws; improvements of Transport and Banking Facilities; desirability of the appointment of a Minister of Commerce; the extension of the system of Trade Com-missioners, and thorough re-organisation of the Consular Service.&quot; But exceeding in urgency any of these desirable reforms, this Chamber considers it to be essential that after the war the same facilities for trading with the British Empire shall not be allowed to our enemies as those granted to our Allies and to Neutral Nations, and particularly that steps shall be taken not only to render dumping and a return to pre-war trade conditions impossible, but also, effectually to eliminate enemy influences so actively in operation prior to the war.&quot; This Chamber also urges that immediate consideration be given by His Majesty&apos;s Government to,the desirability of preferential reciprocal trading relations between all parts of the British Empire, and, as far as possible, with our Allies.&quot;
It is stated that of the 2,477 members of the Manchester Chamber, 932 members declared themselves to be in agreement with these resolutions, 234 were in opposition, and the remainder abstained from voting.The Plymouth Chamber of Commerce declares that it &quot; does not support any proposal to boycot German trade for a definite number of years, always supposing the peace arrived at to be a satisfactory one. Nor, subject to the. same condition, does it support a general Tariff against Germany, as the effect of that, apart from other considerations, would be to throw Germany into closer relationship with America and other countries to our great disadvantage.&quot;The Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce expresses satisfaction with the recommendations of the Paris Economic Conference, and views with concern the abnormal position of the exchanges of some of our Allies.II.-Fiscal Policy.V -       \ &apos; ...... &apos;-     &apos;       VsIn considering the subjects particularly referred to in the terms of reference of the Com-mittee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, the Birmingham Chamber gives detailed recommendations as to the practical measures to be adopted to give effect to each of the Resolutions of the Paris Conference. The Resolutions relating to Fiscal Policy are particularly noteworthy.For the period of Transition, it is recommended (a) &quot;that the period of years during which most-favoured-nation treatment should bedenied to enemy countries should be not less than seven;(b) that during this period the Allies should act together and should agree to enter intono treaty or convention relating to commerce or shipping which does not provide for equal or reciprocal treatment of all the Allied countries.&quot;As regards the special treatment of enemy commerce during the transition period the following recommendations are made . (a) that for a limited period at least seven years the Allied Governments should pro-hibit, except under licence,, the importation into their respective territories of such manufactured or partly manufactured goods produced in enemy countries as may be jointly decided upon it being, of course, understood that there may be necessary variations in the list as between one Allied country and another according to the particular needs of each;(b) that legislation should be adopted to prevent or restrict the dumping of foreign goods into Allied countries at a lower invoice price than that which would be charged in the home market for the producing country; that such legislation should be framed upon the principle of similar legislation which has been in operation in Canada for some years; and that it should provide at least for an additional customs duty equal to the difference between the invoice price for export and the fair home market value.Under &quot; Permanent Measures &quot; the Birmingham Chamber recommends (c).&quot; that with the view of stimulating the production of the United Kingdom, Customs Duties should be imposed upon, imports of manufactured and partly manufactured articles from all countries, subject to any arrangements made under Clause (d); (d) that any Customs Duties agreed upon by the legislature of this country should enable the Government to provide for mutual preferences as between the units of the British Empire, and reciprocal treatment as between the United Kingdom and its Allies, and any other foreign countries.&quot;Finally, in considering the means of consolidating inter-Imperial relations, the Chamber has resolved  ,&quot; that with the view of placing the United Kingdom in a position to give customs and others preference of a substantial character to the manufactures and products nf the British Empire His Majesty&apos;s Government be urged at the earliest possible moment to prepare a general custom? tariff of duties to be imposed upon imports into this countryt&quot;Some further general recommendations are made relating to fiscal policy &apos; The Association of Chambers of Commerce is of opinion that, with the &quot;object of maintaining and increasing our trade after the conclusion of the war, it is necessary that the different parts of the British Empire be drawn into closer commercial union, and that our trading&apos; relations with our Allies be fostered and that for the accomplishment of this purpose it is desirable that provision should be made :  (a) For preferential reciprocal trading relations between all parts of the British Empire;(b) For reciprocal trading relations between the British Empire and the Allied Countries;(c) For the favourable treatment of Neutral Countries-; and(d) For restricting, by tariffs and otherwise, trade relations with all enemy countries, soas.to render dumping or a return to.pre-war conditions impossible, and for stimu-lating the development of home manufacture and the consequent increased employ-ment of native labour.   . &apos; ,
The Bradford Chamber of Commerce considers that if adequate protection is afforded against the dumping of enemy goods Home Trade can be satisfactorily maintained, but the Spinners&apos; Section of the Chamber recommends that the import of enemy yarns should be prohibited in order &quot;to assimilate the yarns produced in this country.&quot; The Bradford Chamber also main-, tains that the trade with the Colonies which has been lost during the war will be promptly recovered when conditions are more favourable, and emphasises the importance of encouraging the export of fully manufactured articles. The Spinners&apos; Section is anxious to encourage the export trade of yarns and manufactured goods to Russia, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and other countries hitherto supplied by Germany.The Edinburgh Chamber states that, &quot; considering the peculiar political and financial diffi-culties confronting this country in the period of reconstruction which will follow the cessation of hostilities, and in view of the necessity of exceptional measures to meet the abnormal corn-petition of foreign countries whose resources have been artificially increased by the war, while those of this Empire have been temporarily diminished by their enforced diversion into com-mercially unproductive channels, this Chamber is in favour of the imposition of a tariff on Imported Goods, which in the meantime should be an on ad, valorem basis. That such tariff should provide for discrimination between Enemy Countries, Neutrals, Allies, and.our Overseas Dominions, and should allow of special adjustments to counteract dumping. That the question of foodstuffs and raw material and of semi-manufactured goods, which may be in effect the raw materials of British industries, should receive special consideration.&quot;In answer to a questionnaire issued by the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, 143 firms out of 166 who replied were absolutely in favour of discriminating as between enemy countries, neutrals, Allies and the Dominions in any tariffs that may be adopted. 143 also favoured a tariff pro-viding special adjustments to counteract dumping; and 135 were in favour of granting to British Empire countries rebates equivalent to the preference given by them to goods from the United Kingdom.The Hull Chamber of Commerce recommends that a system of fiscal policy should be intro-duced which would prevent unfair competition arising from dumping and subsidies, and the Exeter Chamber also advocates the prevention of dumping.The Second Report of the London Chamber puts forward a concrete Tariff Scheme to come into effect immediately after the war as a temporary measure pending the elaboration of a scientific tariff of specific duties.   This scheme is supported by several Chambers.The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber and the Swansea Chamber advocate reciprocal preferential trading within the Empire.The Sheffield Chamber of Commerce are of opinion that the control after the war of the Import Trade to Great Britain from enemy countries should be placed in the hands of some properly constituted British Government Authority until the whole subject has been considered with our Colonies, Dependencies and Allies and a scheme has been formulated.The Walsall Chamber advocates prohibition of importation of manufactured goods from enemy countries, except under licence, for a term of years, and protection from unfair foreign competition.III. Essential Industries.In commenting upon sub-head (a) of the Committee&apos;s Terms of Reference, the -London Chamber of Commerce declares that, &quot;apart from and in addition to any other measures, a tentative and ad valorem tariff, as suggested, should be applied with the least possible delay so as to provide for:-(a) preferential reciprocal trading relations between all parts of the British Empire;(6) reciprocal trading relations between the British.Empire and the Allied countries;(c) favourable treatment of neutral countries, and(d) for regulating, by tariffs and otherwise, trade relations with all enemy countries, soas to render impossible a return to pre-war conditions, and for stimulating the development of home manufactures and the consequent increased development of home labour. Further, that steps should be taken to prevent the dumping (and under-valuation) of enemy goods into British markets after the war.These measures should apply equally to industries essential to the &quot;safety of the nation&quot; and to those which are also necessary to the home and export trade and the employment of labour therein. All the chief industries affecting &quot; national safety,&quot; e.g., wool, cotton, metals, dyes, magnetos, optical glasses, rare earths, chemical, etc., appear to fall within the range of special enquiries by one or other of the separate Trade Committees appointed by the Board of Trade.&quot;The view of the Chamber as regards all classes.of industries, whether involving the &quot;safety of the nation&quot; or not, is that action on the lines of the conclusions of the Paris Economic Conference should be taken to counteract the policy of the Central European powers &quot;in organising their subjects residing in any part of the British Empire for commercial, industrial, financial and
economic purposes in times of peace, with a view to military aggression in time of war. Further, it is considered that His Majesty&apos;s Government should guarantee for a period of years, with proper safeguards, the continuance by subsidy or otherwise of new or &quot; key &quot; industries estab-lished prior to, and since, the commencement of the war. The establishment of a Ministry of Commerce specially charged with the advocacy and promotion of commercial and industrial interests is also recommended as a means of co-ordinating and directing a national policy in their development.&quot;In addition to the industries which are at present the subject of consideration of special Committees appointed by the Board of Trade,The Wolverhampton Chamber is of opinion that the following industries are essential to the safety of the nation :  Motor-car and Kindred Trades; Chemical Trades; Enamelling and Hollowware.The Nottingham Chamber includes under this heading :  Dyes and. Chemicals (including Motor-spirit as a substitute for petrol); Leather Trades; Rubber; Beet Sugar; Afforestation.The Birmingham Chamber includes:  Brass; Spelter; Foodstuffs; Nickel; Leather; Glass; Chemicals; Hides; Oils.The Ossett Chamber mentions Agriculture, Chemicals and Dyes, and states that the best way of maintaining these is by making arrangements for the largest possible interchange of commodities with our Allies and Neutrals.The Walsall Chamber mentions Munitions of War; Leather; Spelter; Chemicals; Beet Sugar; Oil; Food, and Agriculture, and is of opinion that in order to maintain the Leather trades there should be a prohibition of the export of raw hides.The Wholesale Provision Trades Association, of Bristol, whose recommendations are for-warded by their Chamber of Commerce, states that a large food production is necessary for the safety of the nation, and gives various suggestions relating to the improvement of agriculture.The Bristol Paint Colour and Varnish Manufacturers&apos; Association whose recommendations are forwarded by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, are of opinion that Zinc Oxides and Lithopone should be helped financially by the Government as the dye industry has been.The Bristol, West of England, and, S. Wales Sugar Dealers&apos; Association whose suggestions are forwarded by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce states that a sufficient increase in the pro-duction of raw sugar for our own supplies could be obtained within the Empire. American refineries are the chief purchasers now but British sugar refining should be resuscitated.The Morley, Swansea and Bury and District Chambers of Commerce state that Agriculture is an essential industry and give various suggestions for its encouragement.In order to make the nation more self-supporting in its food supply, the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce also advocates the encouragement of agriculture and live-stock raising and the better organisation of means of transport, collection and distribution.The Swansea Chamber refers to the great demand which will arise after the war for galvanised iron and allied products, and states that in order to meet this demand a convention should be entered into between the interested nations to enable all Zinc Ore Calamine won, and all Zinc Concentrates produced within their territories, to be supplied only to British and Allied manufacturers of Spelter.   Further, it is suggested &quot; that special attention be given to ores of low grade, and that for this purpose the State should offer both at the mines and at the works the best scientific and technical advice on the production and treatment of the material, and that every encouragement be given to the works&apos; proprietors to modernise their plant so that we may handle more of the world&apos;s trade and be more immune from competition.&quot;Certain general recommendations also are made as to the steps to be taken to maintain or establish industries essential to the safety of the nation. It is suggested by several Chambers that improved financial facilities for trade should be devised and that Exhibitions should be encouraged; the Wolverhampton Chamber suggests an extension of the recommendations of the Financial Facilities Committee to home industries and agriculture. On.the other hand the Plymouth Chamber advocates a system of direct subsidy by the Government, and the Neioport Chamber recommends &quot;that the Government should adopt without delay such legislation as would ensure financial aid on the part of the State being given for the promotion and assistance of approved British enterprises when the same are calculated to advance the development of trade in the national interest,&quot; and the Exeter Chamber recommends that the Government should guarantee for a period of years the continuance,, by subsidy or otherwise, of new or key industries established prior to and since the commencement of the war.Under this head several Chambers state that a fiscal policy should be adopted which would prevent the dumping of subsidised goods from enemy countries, and advocate a reform of the Consular Service and the institution of a Ministry of Commerce. The formation of a Committee to consider the position of the Chemical Trades is recommended by both the Manchester ami Grimsby Chambers,
IV.--Foreign Trade.Under Sub-head (6) of the Terras of Reference the London Chamber of Commerce suggests&apos; that in all Iron and Steel manufactures, in British Dominions, South America and China, the United States will have secured a great opening and that it will only, be through increased preference being given, by the Dominions that their Trade, can be regained by the United Kingdom. The London Chamber also states that when the War is over various practical measures may be taken-&quot; Amongst these, which involve legislative or voluntary action are the following:   the re-adjustment of trading privileges of aliens in this country, amendment of naturaliza-tion laws, licenses to trade, improved Diplomatic and Consular Services, preferences (other than fiscal) in the consumption of British Empire goods, improved financial and banking facilities, improved commercial and industrial organisation, oo-operation of capital and labour in removing restrictions of output, encouragement of trade Exhibitions at home and abroad, greater knowledge of modern foreign languages, extended use of metric system of weights, measures and currency, improved shipping and transport facilities, &amp;c.&quot;The Edinburgh Chamber recommends the adoption of the metric system of weights and measures and of a decimal coinage; the Swansea Chamber recommends the adoption of thJ Metric and Decimal Systems; the Bury and District Chamber favours the decimalisation of our existing weights and measures; some of the members of the Wolverhampton Chamber urge the adoption of the decimal system; the Plymouth Chamber asks for a serious consideration of the Decimal System of Weights and Measures; the Bradford Chamber considers that the adoption of the Decimal System of Weights and Measures would facilitate the export of goods from this country; and the Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber is^ of opinion that the Metric7&quot; System should be a compulsory part of elementary and secondary education for the purpose of securing its ultimate adoption in all commercial transactions within the Empire.Seven Chambers of Commerce repeat under this head the demand for the formation of a Ministry of-Commerce, the reform of the Consular Service and better financial facilities for export trade; five Chambers advocate improvements in the present system of education and three recommend improved transport facilities.The unification of the Bankruptcy and Commercial Laws in Allied countries as a step towards&apos; international law is considered desirable by the Bradford Chamber, and the Birmingham Chamber suggests the amendment of the law relating to the assessment of works and rating of machinery and the grant of a definite status to Chambers of Commerce (provided that they are representative of the commercial interests of their districts), as means of recovering home ,and, foreign trade lost during the war, and of securing new markets.The Edinburgh Chamber considers that the Government should undertake a publicity campaign in all neutral countries in favour of British goods generally and recommends that the Income Tax Laws should.be amended and codified.In this connection also, the Bury and. District Chamber states that it should be compulsory on all industrial firms to join a Chamber of Commerce. The same Chamber also recommends the institution in London of a bureau of manufacturers possessing a complete list of all manufacurers in the United Kingdom in every trade, with full particulars of their manufactures and their present and possible output. Consuls or Colonial buyers, it is said, could apply to such an institution to be put in touch with the actual manufacturers of the kingdom. It is also suggested that &quot;it may be necessary to apply a certain degree of compulsion to compile the necessary information.&quot;Transport facilities are dealt with in detail by the Birmingham and London Chambers of Commerce.As regards Shipping, the Birmingham Chamber recommends &quot; that the Allied Governments should take such steps as may be deemed desirable or necessary, having regard always to the Shipping Law and policy of their respective countries and empires, to stimulate and expedite inter-Allied shipping and to provide, if necessary, Government financial assistance at any rate for a definite term with the view of enabling shipping companies to trade between Allied countries at the lowest possible rates, it being understood that in return for such assistance the respective Govern-ments should exercise some effectual control over rates of freight and classification of merchandise.&quot;The London Chamber of Commerce devotes a section of its report to the consideration of the &quot; ton for ton &quot; question, and also quotes the recommendations of a sub-committee of the executive of the British Imperial Council of Commerce as follows:  (1) That H.M. Government be requested not to leave enemy ships free after the war to extend their share of the world&apos;s carrying trade until the enemy has replaced in kind all ships which have been lost by the Allies owing to the enemy&apos;s piratical methods, and that no peace terms should be considered which do not provide for such replacement.TST.B.-This resolution was originally drafted and adopted by the ExecutiveCouncil of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom. (2) That a lower scale of tonnage dues and port charges should apply in all British portsto British-owned vessels. (3) That privileges in British ports should be accorded to allied and neutral shippingequivalent only to the corresponding privileges accorded to British shipping byallied and neutral countries.. .(4) That enemy shipping should pay in British ports at least double the dues paid by anyother shipping.(5) That British Government Subsidies should in no case be granted to enemy shipping.
(6) That foreign tonnage in Empire ports should&apos; conform to Empire conditions regarding shipping.(7) That the shipping laws and regulations should favour the shipment of goods from oneport to another within the. Empire in vessels under the British flag registered insome part of the Empire, or in vessels belonging to Allied Powers. (8) That no agreements be entered into by British shipping companies with foreignshipping companies and combinations without the cognizance of the Board of Tradeor other Ministerial authority. (9) That measures should be taken to prevent foreign goods from being carried in Britishships from British ports at less rates than similar British goods. (10) That in the event of unfair treatment or preference to foreign goods the matter bereported through the British Imperial Council of Commerce to the Board of Trade. (11) That in the case of any British shipping company reported and continuing to give - preference in freight to foreign goods or to firms, the steamer or steamers of suchcompany shall pay such port and other charges without any rebates as shall bechargeable on foreign Vessels. The Edinburgh Chamber considers that the Government should make grants to providefor- .&apos;   ,  &apos; .&apos; ,/(a) Preferential railway rates on goods for export, and(6) Lower shipping rates where necessary to compete with subsidized foreign shipping.The Exeter Chamber recommends the imposition of discriminatory taxes on tonnage of enemy countries using British ports.The Walsall Chamber recommends that enemy ships should be prohibited from trading with Empire ports for a period of years.On the subject of inter-Allied communications generally the Birmingham Ch)amber recommends (a) that reciprocal postal and telegraphic rates should be arranged between the Allied Governments and their respective countries and Empires.The Chamber also deals with the subject of Inland Railway and Canal Transport. In addition to more detailed resolutions it is recommended:-(c) that in the United Kingdom the Government should take steps to carry out without delay the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Canals, and should also make more effective use of the powers it possesses to prevent railway companies from imposing unduly onerous rates and conditions upon the community.The Bury and District Chamber also advocates the &quot; Utilisation of Tramways and Inland Waterways and Canals.&quot;V. Resources of the Empire.With regard to Sub-head (c) the London Chamber of Commerce and certain other Chambers make the general recommendation that the Home and Dominion Governments should encourage the production and utilization of raw materials and manufactured goods within the Empire under such legislative conditions as wall prevent their being controlled by or on behalf of subjects of enemy countries. They consider that the steps already taken throughout the Empire will conduce to this end, and that their continuance would appear to be fully contemplated by the resolutions of the Economic Conference.The Wolverhampton Chamber suggests, in this connection, that a system of internal prefer-ence should be adopted, that territories accruing as a result of the war should be taken over and developed by the Empire for the benefit of the Empire, and that Government assistance should be given to Scientific Research.The Plymouth Chamber states that &quot; an imperial congress should be summoned to consider our inter-relationships.&quot;The Bradford Chamber of Commerce recommends:  &quot;that the resources of the Empire should be ascertained; in the case of Bradford textiles the stock of animals producing wool and hair should be noted and arrangements made to improve them by all available means, and proposals should be made whereby wool -growers should be encouraged to deal with their produce in such a manner that at all times the needs of the United Kingdom and allied countries would be adequately supplied before other claims were considered.&quot;The Bury and District Chamber is of opinion that the attention of the Governors of Colonies should be drawn to the industrial necessities of the United Kingdom and its dependence on supplies of Tropical produce such as gums, ores, oil-bearing nuts, starch-bearing roots and fibres suitable for the Textile and paper-making industries, the demand for the latter industries being in excess of the supply. The Colonial Officials should then report to an institute such as the Imperial Institute, from whence reports could be issued periodically and be readily available as data for investigators and exploiters.Further, the Bury and District recommends that all Mines and Minerals and the Royalties attached to them should become the property of the State.The Hull Chamber of Commerce recommends that the resources of the Empire should be developed by internal preference as against foreign countries.The Ossett Chamber advocates legislation to prevent the sale of sources of supply within the Empire to any foreigner, without the consent of the Federal or Imperial authority.The Swansea Chamber considers the youth of the nation to be its greatest asset, and recommends a thorough re-adjustment of our educational system- Attention is particularly drawn to the evils of juvenile street trading.
429The Newcastle, and Gaieshead C7uj?/iiW. declares tliat tlic practice which has hitherto -pre-vailed of allowing raw, materials to be exported-&quot;-freely..from the CrownColonies to present ,e^emy/ countries should be controlled. . &apos;      . ...    , - -&apos;&quot;. \The Woolwich Chamber considers that there should.be an Industrial Truce for a period of years after the war and that the raw materials in the Empire should: be prevented from falling into enemy hands. . .&apos;- .     - .   -The following particular raw materials are suggested, for the consideration of the Committee:  &apos;   .(a) Cotton. The Oldham Chamber states that the British Cotton Growing Association has found that cotton of every variety can be grown in the British Empire. The Government have assisted the Association in experimenting as to the variety of cotton suited to the various climates and the Governmental contribution should: be increased. The Bury and District Chamber consider that it is of vital import-ance that the growth of cotton within the Empire should be developed to the uttermost.(6) Lead, Zinc and Barytes.   The Bristol Paint Colour and. Varnish Manufacturers&apos;, Association recommends that these resources should be better exploited.(c) Coal.   The Sivansea Chamber of Commerce emphasises the importance of a morescientific system of production and distribution with special reference to the; development of Coals of lower grade qualities which exist in great quantities in this country.(d) Timber.     The Edinburgh Chamber considers that the desirability of establishingnational forests with a scientifically trained forest service should be urged upon the Government.VI. Foreign Control,Under sub-head (d) the London Chamber of Commerce states that the application of manu-facturing processes to raw materials within the Empire can possibly be assisted, by duties on raw materials exported from the Empire. The limitation of German shareholdings in British Companies would also probably be desirable.   It is added that:  &quot; While the influx of foreign capital may be useful to a reasonable extent, foreign &apos; control&apos; and influence in the future should be restricted in view of past experience, bearing in mind, however, that British capital is frequently invested in foreign countries as well as in British Dominions and Dependencies, and that the predominant influence in any management usually attaches to the most forceful elements in the development of enterprise whether at home or abroad.   This postulates an intensive cultivation of the scientific and commercial brain power of the Empire as the surest road to progress.&quot; The Bury and District Chamber recommends that all sources of industrials within the Empire should be held in trust by the Imperial and Colonial Governments, leases being granted for their exploitation to Companies or Corporations, the majority of whose members both in numbers and capital holding shall be citizens of the Empire.The Swansea Chamber states that the sources of supply within the Empire can be prevented from falling under enemy control by the more effective control of the exports of all raw materials within the Empire, by the application of the most up-to-date manufacturing processes of all such raw materials and by the utilization of bye products to the best advantage.The Wolverhampton Chamber states that the measures introduced by the Australian Goverll-ment to prevent the foreign control of the sources of supply in Australia should be adopted.Specific suggestions are made by certain Chambers of Commerce as to the best means of eliminating enemy influence within the Empire.&quot;As regards (a) Individual Activities, the Association of Chambers of Commerce recom-mends &quot;that legislation should be promoted to prevent enemy subjects for a period after the war from taking up employment or a domicile in this country without special license.&quot; The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce proposes: -(a) &quot;that during the period of reconstruction after the war persons of enemy nationality should, not, except under license, own or control or be engaged in factories or works which are concerned in producing articles essential either to national defence or to the economic independence of the Allied Countries; &quot;(b) &quot;that this restriction should be most rigidly applied to Directors, Partners, Managers, Engineers, Analysts, Chemists, Draughtsmen and others who, by reason of their position, skill, or opportunity, might be able to supply information of a valuable character to their Governments or commercial communities.&quot;The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber is of opinion:  (1) that alien enemies should be required to take out a permit of residence revocable atthe discretion of the police authorities; (2) that no hotel, restaurant, cafe, inn, club or private cafe be allowed to employ waiters,cooks, or others of present enemy nationality; (3) that similar regulations be applied to musicians, mercantile clerks, chemists, teachersof languages, university professors and others for ten years; (4) that if any alien enemy be allowed to trade in this country(a) he should be compelled to trade under his own name;(b) his books should be inspected at stated intervals;(c) he should pay double income tax.(5) That commercial travellers, canvassers, agents and others of present enemy origin be compelled to take out a license costing, say  100, per annum. 14432 F 2
These regulations apply only to &quot;enemy&quot; aliens and to the reconstruction period. The Birmingham Chamber also recommends that &quot; the command of British ships should be held only by natural-born subjects of the United Kingdom and its Dominions and that certificates to&apos; Pilots in British waters should only be issued to British-born subjects &quot; and makes the following recommendations with regard to commercial travellers: -(a) that Customs Duties should be levied upon all samples of merchandise brought into this country by commercial travellers a refund of such duty to be made where the said samples are re-exported within six months of the date of their importation: (6) that a definite tax should be imposed upon commercial travellers visiting this country;(c) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be empowered to enter into reciprocal agree-. ments with any country in regard to the taxation of commercial travellers and the levying of Customs Duties upon samples.A number of Chambers have resolved that the Naturalization Laws should be amended.As regards (b) Shareholding in Industrial Companies and Control of such Companies, the Association of Chambers of Commerce has resolved (i) &quot; that H.M. Government be urged to take immediate steps to consult the Governments of the Dominions overseas and ascertain their views with regard to&quot;the control of businesses in the Empire managed or owned by the subjects of enemy countries,&quot; and (ii) &quot; that in the event of enemy, companies or firms being permitted to re-open or commence trading in any part of the United Kingdom, India and the Crown- Colonies, they shall be subject to such control or inspection as shall make it impossible for them to be used as political agencies under the guise of commercial establishments.&quot;, . The Manchester Chamber of Commerce declares it &quot;essential . . -. particularly that steps shall be taken . . . effectually to eliminate enemy influences so actively in operation prior to the war.&quot;The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber considers tbat enemy aliens should not be allowed to own shares in English Companies, limited or otherwise, directly or indirectly, and that alien enemy banks and insurance companies should not be permitted to establish themselves in this country after the war and that those at present in existence should be wound up at the earliest possible moment.The London Chamber of Commerce recommends-&quot; that the limitation of German shareholders in British Companies would probably be desirable, although after the war Germany may not for a long time have much capital to spare for foreign investment. In any case it may be better to be without the aid of German money in order not to be subject to any German control or influence.&quot;The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce recommends that &quot;during the period of reconstruction enemy subjects and persons of enemy origin should be prohibited from controlling, supervising or having any predominant or control-ling interest direct or indirect in the commerce or industry of the Allied Countries.&quot;The Plymouth Chamber of Commerce has resolved that&quot; all present enemy countries must be prohibited from maintaining or establishing any industries or acquiring real property within the British Empire except under most carefully guarded license. License of residence in the Empire must be necessary for all enemy aliens.&quot;The Walsall Chamber recommends that&quot; it should be made illegal for subjects of enemy countries to acquire any holding in British corporations or to trade within the Empire for a period of years.&apos;-- The resolutions thus cited relate to  &quot;enemy&quot;  aliens, but some recommendations go further:  The Association of Chambers of Commerce has resolved that&quot; legislation should be enacted under which H.M. Government shall have the power to insist that any companies or firms producing, manufacturing, or trading in the United Kingdom, India and the Crown Colonies shall be British controlled, both as regards management and ownership.&quot;The Bristol Chamber of Commerce (Paint, Colour and Yarnish Manufacturers Association) recommends that&quot; no alien company should be allowed to trade except under the conditions that not more that a third of the capital be held by aliens.&quot;The Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce is of opinion that&quot; steps should be taken to assess the selling branches of foreign factories (registered as British Companies) on the basis of their turnover, as, at present, they are able to evade payment of income tax by arranging the prices at which their goods are to be invoiced to them by their factories.&quot;The Hull Chamber recommends that&quot; there should be a registration of names of the partners in private companies and that limited companies should have at least 75 per cent, of British shareholders.&quot;The following Resolutions have been passed relating to (e) the Ownership by Aliens of Real Property, with which is involved the question of the development by alien interests of the raw material resources of the Empire, including Mines and Mineral Deposits.
The Association of Chambers of Commerce hsis resolved that &apos;- u :      .&quot;;this Association urge upon H.M.-Government the advisability of instituting legisla-tion to prevent in the future raw materials from the Crown Colonies passing first hand to our enemies, and also that an endeavour be made to come to ah agreement with the British Self-Governing Dominions with the same object.&quot;1 The London Chamber of Commerce recommends that &quot; no enemy should be allowed to hold or occupy land in the British Empire for any purpose contrary to public policy.&quot; Other resolutions extend the suggested restrictions to all aliens. Thus the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce recommends that; &quot; an agreement shall be reached between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions whereby aliens shall be required to obtain a license before securing any interest in British source&apos;s of supply of raw materials and the primary materials of industry, and that such licenses should be granted only after the applications have been advertised and after the local Chambers of Commerce and other representative bodies have been given an opportunity of lodging objections.&quot; The Bradford Chaviber of Commerce recommends that &quot; steps should be taken to guard against enemy or foreign individuals, firms or com-panies gaining control of raw materials produced in the Empire.&quot; The Nottingham Chamber of Commerce recommends that-&quot;the minerals and raw materials within the Empire should be retained under the control of British subjects and that steps should be taken (a) to put an end to existing monopolies of foreign subjects over such minerals and raw materials, and (fe) to prevent such monopolies being obtained in future.&quot;VII. Industrial and Commercial Organisation.Apart from the specific recommendations made by the various Chambers, and summarised above, attention may be drawn to the widespread recognition, in the communications from the Chambers, of the need for commercial and industrial re-organisation by the voluntary effort ofUnited Kingdom traders.The London Chamber of Commerce devotes the whole of Part I. of its Third Report to &amp;t consideration of commercial and industrial organisation. At the outset the Chamber desirei to affirm,its conviction &quot;that the practical application of measures for the extension of trade and industry after the war will be mainly a matter for private enterprise.&quot; It is declared,-moreover, that &quot;individual and collective effort voluntarily undertaken, supplemented and not, superseded by Government action, will offer the most adequate guarantees for the due extension of trade in the future, subject to conditions which will assist and not retard its development.&quot;The Birmingham Chamber, in the preliminary recommendations in its Report, states that-&quot; at the close of the war one of the most serious problems, namely, that of securing commercial and industrial efficiency, must be settled at home. International commerce inevitably involves competition in trade and industry, and whilst much may be done-by the Governments of the British Empire and its Allies, your Committee desire to guard against Government help and assistance by tariffs or otherwise being looked upon as sufficient in themselves to secure the objects in view. They would rather regard such help and assistance as incentives, to intensified and continuous effort on the part of merchants, manufacturers and workers alike.&quot; It is stated further that the gravest problem which confronts this country to-day is theadvocacy and practice of the limitation of production, and the Chamber therefore places oilrecord its opinion : -&quot; (a) that in order to secure the industrial and commercial efficiency of this country, the first and most necessary reform is an alteration and improvement in the relations between capital and labour, whereby labour shall produce as much as possible and be remunerated at standard rates for all increased output:  -&quot; (b) that every effort should be1 made between organised bodies of employers and workers to arrive at mutually satisfactory terms of agreement.&quot; , The Edinburgh Chamber recommends that the Government be urged to impress upon all industries the importance of co-operation and collaboration in Scientific Research work connected with each particular industry.The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce in its report on &quot; Trade after the War &quot; first considers &quot; the improvement of our own methods and organisations both individual and national.&quot;   Under this head the Chamber points out &quot;that there is no substitute for that personal enterprise, pushfulness and resource which have marked out individual businesses as conspicuous successes, and it cannot be ; &apos;. too strongly advocated that in. order that our Country and Empire may maintain first rank, it is essential that our individual firms strive to keep up to date both in methods and organisation.&quot;
Further, the Chamber states that our trade organisation needs thorough reformation, and it is&quot; recommended that manufacturers in kindred trades should associate whenever possible for mutual advantage.In this connection the Birmingham Chamber recommends &quot; that every encouragement should be given by the Government to traders to organise themselves in their several trades,&quot; and the Morley Chamber states that &quot;a much better organisation in works is required and less com-netition, larger works and more co-operation amongst producers.&quot;XII.SUMMARY OF REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF BRITISHCOLONIES AND PROTECTORATES.Replies to the Colonial Office Circular of the 25th September, 1916, in which the Govern-ments of British Colonies and Protectorates were invited to state their views on the questions submitted to the Committee on Commercialand Industrial Policy, have been received from the following British Colonies and Protectorates: -&apos;Bahamas, Nigeria,British Guiana, Nyasaland,British Honduras, Rhodesia, Northern,Ceylon, &apos; Rhodesia, Southern,Federated Malay States,       Seychelles, Fiji, Sierra Leone,Gambia, Straits Settlements,Gold Coast, Trinidad,Hong Kong, Uganda,Jamaica, . The Windward Islands (St. Lucia, Grenada andLeeward Islands, St. Vincent),Malta, Zanzibar.Mauritius,The present Memorandum is a summary of the recommendations and suggestions contained in these replies which are specially relevant to the subjects under the consideration of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy.I.-Fiscal Policy.1. The Governments concerned and the local representative bodies to whom the questions under consideration were referred by these Governments generally express their willingness to co-operate in any scheme of Imperial Policy which the Imperial Government may decide to adopt.In this connection the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce points out that whatever Imperial Policy is adopted, the importance of trade between Hong Kong and China must be taken into account. In considering the adoption of Imperial Preference the following facts must be remembered :  (1) Even a small tariff may encourage direct Trading with other ports, to the detriment of Hong Kong.(2) A tariff on foreign goods entering Hong Kong would mean a double tax on the same goods entering China via Hong Kong. [The Governor suggests, however, that goods in transit could, by the extension of the bonded warehouse and drawback system, be made free of any tariff operative within the Colony.](3) If an exception were made in favour of Hong Kong in a general scheme of Imperial Preference, the import of foreign goods into other parts of the Empire via Hong Kong and duty free would have to be guarded against.On the other hand, preferential trade relations between the British Empire might help Hong Kong to become a depot for exports from China in order to qualify for preferential treat-ment, and this would largely increase the trade of Hong Kong.A Special Committee of the Board of Management of the Jamaica Agricultural Society &quot;and of the-Merchants&apos; Exchange has resolved that although the tariff of Jamaica has hitherto been framed with a view to the raising of necessary revenue, there would be no objection to the principle of \ preferential treatment to importations from the United Kingdom, British Possessions, and Colonies, and also from Allied Nations being adopted, provided that such treatment becomes the practice of the British Empire generally, but that nothing should be done to prevent similar arrangements with other friendly nations who grant reciprocal terms.A special Committee appointed by the Governor of Malta recommends that any system of preferential trade or customs union within the Empire, as well as any prohibition or restriction on enemy trade which may be decided upon, may be extended to Malta., The Governor of Nyasaland advocates Free Trade within the Empire in respect of the products or manufactures of its several parts and preferential treatment.of products and goods of Allied nations on which the Empire in any measure depends. He considers that if Nyasaland enjoys equal preference with the rest of the Empire in the markets of the Empire and in the markets of
those foreign countries which are in commercial accord with the United Kingdom and if imperial assistance is rendered in opening up the. communications of the-Protectorate, it will be&apos;able, to hold its own and contribute in an appreciable degree to that independence of enemy resources which it is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of the Allied nations toattaim     ,      . ; &apos;   &apos; &apos;1 : - &apos;.&apos;While advocating the adoption of a scheme of Imperial Preference, a Special Committee appointed by the Governor of the Windward Islands points out that such a policy would affect more or less all the West Indian Colonies, because their tariff is imposed for revenue purposes.The Committee does not consider that any measures such as the subsidising of Imperial Steamship Lines and Cable Companies would be a satisfactory compensation by the Mother Country for preferential trade entry into the markets of the Empire, because there would be no means comparable to those possible under a tariff of meeting the inevitably frequent change of conditions.2. The following recommendations are made as regards the differential treatment of the importation of foreign goods and the control of exports from the Empire after the war:  1. British Guiana. ;  ...The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce recommends &quot;total prohibition, for a period, of direct and indirect importations of enemy goods manufactured in enemy countries or by enemy subjects in neutral countries, and control generally of trade by Imperial Parliament.&quot;2. British, Honduras.While expressing himself in favour of Free Trade, the&apos; Governor considers that the penalisa-tion of enemy trade would not have&apos; any serious consequences, since the trade of British Honduras with enemy countries before the war was inconsiderable.One member of the Governing Council advocates high discriminating duties against the goods of enemy origin that can be supplied wdthin the Empire.Another member is of opinion &quot;that it will.be to the interests of the mother country and of the colony to introduce a tariff prohibitive against goods manufactured in enemy countries, and especially in Germany and Austria.&quot; - ...3. Ceylon.The Governor states that the Government and Legislature will readily adopt any measures which may commend themselves to His Majesty&apos;s Government for adoption in the United Kingdom. He points out, however, that Ceylon is not a manufacturing country, but a producer of food and raw materials, and that the only practical measures which appear possible are the levying of harbour dues on enemy shipping and the prohibition or restriction (by means of. an export duty) of the supply of Ceylon products to enemy countries.4.  Fiji.The Governor recommends &quot; That the importation into Fiji of all goods the product or manufacture of the Powers now at war with Great Britain and her Allies should be prohibited absolutely for not less than 25 years.&quot;^ A Special Committee appointed by the Governor states that Fiji should support the policy of imposing either a countervailing duty on foreign imports or on imports from other than Allied countries, if such policy be adopted as an Empire measure of self support, or allowing a special rebate of Customs duty in respect of products imported from parts of the Empire or Allied countries which have adopted that policy.Fiji is economically so dependent, however, on Australia and New Zealand that her policy must also depend on the policy of these dominions. .The &quot; rebate &quot; could (from the point of view of Revenue) be granted by imposing a higher rate of Customs duty on goods imported from countries outside the Empire or other than Allied Possessions. The duty on Imperial and Allied goods may be at the rates, now levied, the General Customs duty being increased by the amount of the &quot;rebate &quot; to be granted.5. Federated Malay States.The Chamber of Commerce of the Malay States recommends the imposition of a protective tariff on all goods of other than British origin imported into the Malay States. The High Commissioner is in favour of this proposal, provided that it does not involve taxation of food.6. Gold Coast.The Governor states that as the Gold Coast possesses no manufacturing interests,, being a producer only of raw material, her trade interests are (1) to secure the best market for her produce, and (2) to obtain the supplies she needs of the precise kind and quality that she requires and at the lowest possible prices. The Governor touches on the responsibility of Great Britain to the tropical populations of the Empire, and emphasises the importance of main-taming their confidence in the justice of British,rule which has induced the people of the Gold Coast voluntarily to contribute both men and money to the prosecution of the war. If a protective policy is adopted in order, to divert the Empire&apos;s supplies of raw materials to the manufacturing centres of the United Kingdom and the Self-Governing Dominions, it would
-appear to him more logicaLand more appropriate that the measures designed to effect this end :should be (aken,. and that the resulting sacrifice should be borne, exclusively by those countrieswhich stand, to benefit by the policy in question, and not by the producing Colonies whoseinterests are bound.to be injured by its adoption.As regards the conservation of supplies immediately after the war, the Governor considers that, with the exception of minerals (which are already in British hands), the Gold Coast pro-duces nothing which can appropriately be earmarked for the exclusive use of either the United Kingdom, or countries devastated by the war, or of Allied Countries. This point,is further elaborated in Section II. of this Memorandum.7. Mauritius.The local Chamber of Commerce is in favour of granting preference to imports into Mauritius of British Goods and of prohibiting the entry of goods of enemy origin for five years.8. Nyasaland.The Governor considers that Nyasaland should take part in any Imperial scheme for the exclusion of enemy goods during the transitional period after the war.&quot;The Acting Chief Secretary considers that preference in the. matter of customs duties would exercise a deterrent effect on the importation of goods from enemy countries and that the direction of British goods to British markets could be effected by a modified form of the present system of permits to export to foreign countries, which would be issued only in regard to a surplus of any commodity that remained after Imperial requirements had been met.A Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce recommends that all goods of enemy origin should either be prohibited from entering the Protectorate or that they should be heavily penalized for a specified period.9. Seychelles.The Colony is anxious to participate in any scheme adopted for the elimination of German trade. The Governor sees no objection to the imposition of a heavy differential import tariff on all goods of Austrian and German origin and suggests that such a tariff might be as high as three times the rates of duty on articles imported from other countries.10. Sierra Leone.The Comptroller of Customs is of opinion that.&quot; Customs Preference to our Allies, provided they reciprocate, and reciprocal tariff relations with neutral countries (but in no case placing them on an equality with the British Empire or its Allies) should enable the British trader successfully to combat German competition.&quot;11. Southern Rhodesia. The penalisation of German trade appears to be generally desired.At various public meetings held in August, 1915, resolutions were passed stating that it is in. the future interests of the British Empire that the Government of South Africa be requested so to amend the Customs tariff by placing additional duties upon goods imported from enemy countries as to render it impossible for them to compete successfully with the products and manufactures of the British Isles, Colonies, and Allied and Neutral States in the future.The Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa and the Rhodesian Munitions and Resources Committee have resolved that the Customs tariff of the Union of South Africa be so amended as to provide for :  (a) a substantial rebate in favour of the products and manufactures of the British Empire;(b) the principle of Customs preference to the Allies, provided they reciprocate;(c) reciprocal tariff relations with other countries but in no case placing other countrieson an equality with the British Empire or its Allies;(d) a special tariff against the products and manufactures of the present enemy countrieson such a scale and for such a period as may be agreed upon at the conference between the Imperial and the Dominion Governments.12. Uganda.For the Reconstruction Period the Governor puts forward the following suggestions for consideration:(a) Differential Import Dues on the manufactures and products of all countries not inreceipt of most-favoured-nation treatment. At present imports into Uganda pay 10 per cent, ad vol. duty. It is suggested that for countries not in receipt of most-favoured-nation treatment the duty should be raised to 33\ per cent. This would meet the danger of dumping, and would avoid any complicated procedure.(b) Differential Export Dues on produce exported to countries not in.receipt of most-favoured-nation treatment.   It is suggested that all raw produce exported to these countries should be subject to a 10 per cent, ad -vol. tax at the port of shipment in i&apos;        &quot;      addition to any ordinary export tax imposed.
Tie Uganda Chamber of Commerce is of opinion that reciprocal trading relations might well be established between all parts of the Empire and as far as possible with Allied nations. Resolutions have also been passed by the Chamber:  (1) That specific duties be charged on all goods imported which are the manufactures ofthose countries not allied to Great Britain. (2) That an export duty be charged on all produce or other exports not intended foiconsumption or use in the British Empire or Allied Countries and their Colonies.The Governor of Uganda advocates the renunciation of the Berlin Act, 1885, and the Brussels Act, 1890, which restrict the power of the countries concerned to co-operate in adopting the Resolutions of the Paris Conference.13. The Windward Islands.The Government of St. Lucia and the Governor of the Windward Islands think that &quot;a three-decked tariff&quot; on the system successfullv applied in Canada before the war, namely a general tariff, a British preferential tariff and an intermediate tariff, would be satisfactory. Such a tariff could be framed to meet all the necessities of the post-war situation, both penal and otherwise, without arousing resentment in any quarter other than enemy countries.It is believed that especially favourable treatment can be given to our Allies without alienating neutral countries, by giving effect to Resolution C (ii) of the Paris Conference-&quot;the establishment of direct and rapid land and seaport services at low rates,&quot; and &quot;the extension and improvement of postal, telegraphic and other communications.&quot;Attention is particularly drawn to the danger of retaliatory measures which might result from a policy of placing the United States on a less favoured basis as regards tariff rates than other foreign nations. St. Lucia, and other West Indian Islands, have depended on the United States during the war for food supplies and other necessities, and also as a market for agricul-tural produce. Again, the whole of the bunker coal trade in St. Lucia, which is of great importance to the Colony (imports before the war varied from 100,000 to 120,000 tons per annum), is conducted with American coal in spite of the preference of 20 per cent, on British and Canadian coal which was granted four years ago.The Government of St. Lucia is opposed to the suggestion made by the Agricultural and Commercial Society that enemy products should be prohibited from entering British countries for a period after the war. It is thought that this matter should be controlled by a penal tariff aided by such natural aversion from purchasing goods of enemy origin as consumers in British countries may be Expected to have for a number of years after the war.A Special Committee appointed by the Governor in Grenada urges the continuation of prohibition of import of enemy goods for so long a period as it can be effectively carried out or until circumstances such as the restoration of the industries of the Allied countries justify its modification, and thereafter the establishment of a tariff against enemy countries sufficiently substantial to defeat any attempt to overcome its effect either by way of subsidized steamers, preferential freight rates, bounties, or other means.The Committee adds that the entry of the United States into the war as an Ally has made it immaterial to the Windward Islands whether Allied or neutral countries are treated alike or not.In considering the possibility of restricting the export of goods essential to enemy countries the Committee draws attention to the need for providing compensatory outlets for surplus products.14. Zanzibar.In the opinion of the Government, an examination of the trade statistics shows that Zanzibar would not be injured by the complete exclusion of imports from enemy countries. As regards exports the only commodities which need be taken seriously into account are cloves and clove stems. The exports of these to Germany and Austria in 1913, valued.  124,563. out of a total export of  431,693. It seems, however, that the Indian, Chinese, and American demand for cloves is increasing, and there appears to be no cause for anxiety, therefore, as to the possible measures of retaliation to be adopted by enemy countries in return for any policy of excluding enemy goods from Zanzibar.II. Essential Industries. 1. British Guiana.The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce and the British Guiana Planters&apos; Association favour the protection, if and when required, of all industries which are necessary to any part of the Empire, whether already existent or desirable to create or foster. Major industries such as coal, iron, oil, sugar, cotton, rubber, &amp;c, within the Empire should be owned or controlled as far as possible by British born subjects only.The encouragement by the Imperial Parliament of facilities for emigration and immigration between all parts of the Empire is also advocated under this head.2. British Honduras.The Governor suggests that the import from places outside the Empire of articles which have hitherto been made almost exclusively by Germany, and which for the safety of the Empire should be produced in sufficient quantities within the. Empire to render it independent of outside supplies in time of war, should be prohibited so long as protection for such industries is necessary.
50 3. Fiji.A Special Committee appointed by tbe Governor suggests that in order to counteract Germany&apos;s efforts to retaliate as a result of any measures to restrict her trade with Fiji, His Majesty5s Government should stimulate as far as possible all industries hitherto conducted by Germany in connection with which copra is a raw material so as to offer ready and unrestricted markets in the United Kingdom for that commodity, which is produced within the Empire., The Colonial Sugar Befining Co., Ltd., express their opinion that it does not appear possible to increase the Fijian output of sugar to any considerable extent, the present output being nearly 120,000 tons. In New Zealand they are able to hold the trade against imports from other countries without any customs or other advantage.4. Gold Coast.The chief production of the Gold Coast are cocoa, palm oil and palm kernels.The export of cocoa rose between 1909 and 1914 from 20,213 tons to 52,888 tons. In 1913 Great Britain took 26,652 tons of this export and Germany took 15,460. It is stated, however, that large quantities of the British imports were re-shipped to Holland and Germany, and that since 1914, when the exports of cocoa to those countries were restricted, Gold Coast cocoa has been a drug on the market. Further, the United States has not been found to be a satisfactory outlet, because Gold Coast cocoa, owing to its low quality and to the. much longer transit by sea is at a disadvantage in competition with the produce of Central America and the West Indies.Tbe Governor maintains, therefore, that any attempt to restrict the exportation of Gold Coast cocoa to Germany either director ma Great Britain or Holland will result less in injury to present enemy countries than in the acute depression of the Colony&apos;s staple industry.The production of palm kernels and palm oil in the Gold Coast was decreasing before the war. In 1909, Germany took 86 per cent, of the export of palm kernels, and in 1913, 65&apos;7 per cent. Germany took only an inconsiderable amount of oil, however, the greater amount being imported by Great Britain. The Governor considers that an export duty on palm, kernels which are not exported under a guarantee that they will be crushed in Great Britain would inevitably depress the prices paid by the merchant to the producer, and would probably deal the coup de grace to an industry which had been steadily declining before the war. He points out that the native producer is absolutely at the mercy of the European merchant for the sale of his goods; that the merchant would be compelled by the imposition of the proposed tax to reduce his costs; that since the outbreak of war the absence of German competition had resulted in a fall in the price locally offered for palm kernels; and that the whole commerce of the Gold Coast is largely controlled by a strong group of firms who are easily able to regulate local prices.On the other hand, the Governor suggests that, if it be desired to establish a kernel-crushing industry in England, and if some form of protection is considered necessary for this purpose, such protection should be afforded by the imposition of import duties upon the articles manu-factured from palm kernels or by some other means, but that the native producer cannot equitably be called upon to pay by the restriction of his market for the establishment of an industry from which he can derive no profit.5. Hong Kong.The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce states that the sugar refining, cement, and ropemaking industries should be protected in any scheme of Imperial policy which may be adopted. The ship and engine building and repairing works of Hong Kong should also be stimulated.6. Jamaica.A Special Committee of the Jamaica Agricultural Society and of the Merchants&apos; Exchange declares that the essential industries in which Jamaica is specially concerned are those of the supply of fruit (bananas, citrus fruits and coconuts) sugar, coffee, cocoa, dye woods, dye wood extracts, tobacco and manufactures thereof. It is stated: (1) That the exports of citrus fruits would be stimulated by a preference being secured in shipments to the United Kingdom, British Possessions, Colonies, and Allied Countries which do or may impose duties on such fruits.(2) That an increasing industry may develop in the manufacture of copra, and that care should be taken that the admission of coco-nuts and of copra on most-favoured-nation terms to Allied Countries is made secure.(3) That preferential tariff treatment would be essential to, and would probably induce very considerable development of the sugar industry, but that countervailing duties should also be arranged as a protection against bounties if and when these are again given by foreign countries.(4) That the production of coffee would be stimulated if preferential treatment is generally given to British Possessions and Colonies and Jamaica is admitted to share therein.(5) That the export of coffee, cocoa and other products to French markets has been often unduly hampered by the French tariff arrangements which demanded a heavy surtax when coffee was shipped by a steamer which called at any European port before reaching France; and that it would be a material assistance to trade with that country if this regulation could be altered.(6) That this Committee desire to direct attention to the anomalous position occupied bv Jamaican produce in regard to French Customs duties whereby Jamaican products come under the maximum tariff.
The Acting-Governor states that the Leeward Islands produce three commodities of special value to the Empire, viz., lime-juice, sugar, and Sea Island cotton, and emphasises the import-ance of encouraging their production.8. MauritiusThe predominating interest of the Colony is the sugar industry. Those who are connected with the industry are strongly in favour of protection against the unfair competition of State-aided foreign sugar in the markets of the Empire. They consider that sugar grown in British Colonies should receive preference within the Empire over sugar of foreign origin, and in a greater degree over sugar produced in present enemy countries.The Chamber of Commerce associates itself with the recommendations of the British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation for :  (1) A comparatively low duty on Empire grown sugar.(2) A higher rate on sugar from Allied countries.(3) A still higher rate on sugar from neutral countries.(4) Prohibition for five years of sugar from enemy countries and thereafter a tariff rate 50 per cent, in excess of the highest rate then current on sugar from all sources.9. Nigeria.The Government consider that oil and oil producing seeds and nuts, hides and skins, and cotton are the chief Nigerian products which are essential to the safety of the nation in time of war.To maintain these industries it is advocated that an export duty be imposed on all kernels crushed outside the Empire (to which may be added the territories of our Allies) and that the work of the British Cotton Growing Association be encouraged.10. Nyasaland.The Governor recommends the grant of bounties or subsidies to establish or develop in British territory the production of food supplies, materials, &amp;c, required to make the Empire self-supporting.11. Sierra Leone.The Comptroller of Customs is of opinion that an export duty of  2 per ton on palm kernels would keep this trade in British hands. A similar duty on hides, piassava, palm oil and ginger would enable the British Empire to absorb the whole of these products.The Governor states that a heavy export duty on kernels shipped to continental ports would both stimulate the local crushing industry and check the creation of a monopoly. Alternatively, the export of palm products only under licence may be found expedient.12. Southern Rhodesia.The Administrator forwards a recommendation of the Association of Chambers of Com-merce of South Africa that with a view to encouraging the establishment of new industries in the British Empire and giving a measure of confidence and security to capital co be embarked therein, as well as assisting the expansion of existing industries, the Government of the Empire be urged to make it obligatory on all Government Departments, municipalities, railways, dock and harbour boards, gas, water, electric light corporations and all such bodies spending public moneys to purchase Empire made goods, and to place all contracts with British firms, exceptions to be made only by special permission of proper authority.13. Trinidad.Cocoa and Sugar may be regarded as falling within the category of essential materials in respect of which the British Empire should be independent of enemy source of supply.The Governor states that Cocoa is admitted into the United States on fair terms, and that so long as such favourable treatment is accorded the American demand will afford sufficient stimulus to ensure the development of the industry.The production of Sugar in Trinidad had dwindled from 69,000 tons in 1895 to 40,000 tons in 1912. The rise in price during the war resulted in 1916 in an increase to 68,000 tons, and the crop for 1917 is estimated at 70,000 tons. The present production of the Colony might be increased by about 50 per cent, if prices are maintained at a paying level. Such stability could be assured by the granting of a moderate preference to Colonial sugar in the United Kingdom; and, if a policy of preference is adopted by his Majesty&apos;s Government, it is recom-mended that such preference be granted to Colonial sugar.The Chamber of Commerce is of opinion that the production of sugar and cocoa can be main-tained by &quot; inter-Empire preference.&quot;14432 g 2
Cotton is the chief product.Existing legislation provides for the purchase of cotton seed only under licence from the Government, and the Governor suggests that this should be extended to exclude all other than most favoured nation subjects for a period of five years, when the position can be recon-sidered if necessary. Similar legislation with regard to coffee, rubber, hides and cocoa is advocated.15. The Windward Islands.The Government of St. Lucia endorses the recommendation of the Agricultural and Com-mercial Society of St. Lucia that some preferential treatment should be accorded in British markets to West Indian products, particularly sugar, molasses, rum, cocoa, limes, lime juice, coco-nuts, logwood. These industries are already satisfactorily established, but there is much room for their improvement and development. Representations are especially made in support of preferential treatment of the sugar trade. It is said that the sugar industry of Cuba, owing to favourable tariff treatment by the United States, has in 16 years grown from 500,000 tons to 3,000,000 tons.. A special Committee appointed by the Governor in Grenada states that the principal pro-ducts of Grenada are cocoa, nutmegs, mace, lime, juice, cotton and cotton seed, and that cocoa and spices are essential to the Colony&apos;s existence. The Committee points out that the maintenance of these industries would be safeguarded by a preference in British, markets.III. Foreign Trade. 1. British Guiana.The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce advocates:   1. Steps to prevent dumping. 2. The adoption of the metric system..3. Special attention to the study of foreign languages in all schools.2. Federated Malay States.The Chamber of Commerce of the Malay States recommends that British manufacturing firms should be urged to confine their agencies exclusively to British firms. The High Commis-sioner states, however, that unless this recommendation is enforced by law it will not be carried out.3. Fiji.The Special Committee appointed by the Governor states that a substantial proportion of hardware, glass, cutlery, and sewing machines imported into Fiji before the war came from enemy countries. The Germans especially were alive to the necessity of producing articles of a cheap class, for which there was a demand among the natives. Such goods came to Fiji through the Dominions and the United Kingdom.4. Gambia.The Governor is of opinion that some way should be found of bringing Asiatic rice direct from the producing country. In 1914, 3,500 tons came from Germany as against 2,000 tons from France and 1,000 tons from the United Kingdom.A considerable trade was carried on from Hamburg before the war in inferior spirits, cheap hardware, cutlery, glassware, jewellery, and beads.5. Gold Coast.The Governor states that since the outbreak of war the United States have shown a greater ability to &quot; capture&quot; the import trade of the Colony than was ever displayed by Germany, and that if German goods are excluded from the Gold Coast after the war American merchants will gain rather than British merchants. American imports rose from  251,742 in 1913 to  751,225 in 1916, while imports from Germany in 1913 were only  386,670. During the same period the imports from the United Kingdom rose from  2,468,600 to  3,860,765.The Assistant Comptroller of Customs considers that practically all enemy goods which the Colony has been accustomed to receive are being or have been replaced, though sometimes by dearer substitutes. It is stated that the United Kingdom ought to supply ale and beer, cotton goods, earthenware, mineral waters, paints and oils, perfumery, provisions, tools, wearing apparel and woollen manfactures all of which were formerly imported from Germany. Further, that abnormally high prices are being paid for agricultural implements, beads, blue indigo, furniture, certain kinds of hardware (enamel ware), certain kinds of musical instruments and certain kinds of machinery, large quantities of which were supplied by Germany before the war.6. Hong Kong.The Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce states that the export trade in Chinese produce is open to further development which would be stimulated by the scientific absorption by Great Britain of produce previously largely exported to the Central Powers, whence such products as essential oils, cantharides, hides, human hair, wood oil, coco-nut oil, peanut oil, star aniseed, gall nuts, tobacco, tea oil, ginger, tumeric, galangal, nux vomica, kwongsi cassia, bristles and soy were re-exported to the Allied countries in manufactured form.
434The Acting-Governor considers that an adequate steamship connection with the United Kingdom is essential if the influence of the United States is not to extend.8. Malta.A special Committee appointed by the Governor recommends that, in order to replace German and Austrian trade by British trade, commercial travellers should be more frequently sent to the Colonies, and that British merchants -should be induced to produce goods that will meet the requirements of their markets; that the system of through bills of lading from and to inland towns in the United Kingdom should be adopted; and that the continental uniform rate of postage on parcels should be adopted. (It is pointed out that the German postal rates encourage the use of the post for trade, and further that the British postal rate to Egypt is lower than the rate to Malta.)9. Nyasaland.The Acting Chief Secretary points out that during the five years before the war 89&apos;75 per cent, of the imports into Nyasaland came from the United Kingdom, British Possessions Allies and Neutrals, and I0&apos;25 per cent, from present enemy countries. He states that goods from Germany and Austria were mainly provisions, sugar, flour, glassware, hardware, stationery, machinery and cotton and woollen manufactures, the last being the most important item.As regards exports 88&apos;4 per cent, went to the United Kingdom and British Possessions while 6&apos;26 per cent, went to Germany. It is stated that although the trade with enemy countries was not great, it shows a tendency to increase if left alone.10. Seychelles.The Governor points out that trade relations with Germany have developed in late years more than is shown by official statistics. Before the war the trade in cinnamon bark and essential oils was almost entirely confined to Germany.11. Sierra Leone.Germany is largely interested in the trade in hardware (matchets), cotton goods, and gin.1. Matchets are essential to the primitive methods of native agriculture, and it is most desirable that this trade, which was formerly in English hands, should be wrested from the Germans.2. Cotton goods are a matter of less importance at present, because England can still supply them, but it is desirable that the English hold of this trade should not be lost.3. The German hold on the gin trade is due to cheap bottle-making rather than to cheap distilling. The Comptroller of Customs is of opinion that steps should be taken to encourage the British bottle-making industry, either by subsidy or by the imposition of a protective duty. On the other hand, the Governor is inclined to favour closer Government control, or even a Government monopoly in the matter of spirits.12. Straits Settlements.The Penang Chamber of Commerce gives the following reasons for the success of German trade in the East:  1. German enterprise in pushing trade by means of commercial travellers. 2. Maintenance of continuous supplies by Eastern houses. 3. Adaptability to native requirements.4. Assistance afforded by German Commercial Banks and consequent extended credits. 5. Subsidising of shipping lines by the German Government.To prevent the resumption of German trade the Chamber recommends that British manu-facturers should be induced to confine their agencies to British houses and to ship their goods in British steamers; that the British travelling public should be urged to confine their support to British and Allied lines and that no GoA^ernnient official should be allowed to travel in any other than such vessels. The Chamber also favours the scheme for the establishment of a British Trade Bank proposed by the home authorities.During the war the Chamber has noticed the activity displayed by Japan and America to capture the trade in the Colony formerly done by enemy traders, and points out that Japan has obtained a footing in the trade in matches, enamelled ware, glassware, porcelain ware, cotton goods especially towels, singlets and buttons toys, chemicals, drugs, beer, and cement. America is carrying on an advertising campaign, and has supplied comprehensive catalogues of American manufactures to the various Consuls.13. Southern Rhodesia.The Bulawayo Chamber of Commerce believes that the German practice of building up business by means of &quot; consignnrent stocks &quot; led to a very considerable import trade in German goods in spite of the preference given to British goods. [This preference, except in the case of tobacco and intoxicating liquors, averages about 6 per cent.]
Further, it is thought that United Kingdom manufacturers should be made aware that it is not advantageous to grant sole selling rights or agencies extending over very large districts except to firms with branches in all the chief towns in such districts. Otherwise it is necessary for a local merchant to pay an over-riding commission before he can deal in a particular line of goods, and such a commission must eventually be paid by the consumer to the detriment of the trade in question.14. Trinidad.The Chamber of Commerce states that after the war the import trade, which has been diverted to foreign countries during the war, will revert to the home country, especially if manufacturers will abandon their policy of conservatism and show themselves prepared to meet the wishes of consumers as regards the stjde of their manufactures.The Collector of Customs writes that German, Austrian, and Swiss goods were introduced in large quantities into the Colony by the larger importing firms through their purchasing agents in the United Kingdom, where the goods were billed, and so shown in the trade returns as im-ports from the United Kingdom. The small importer also was exploited by the German manu-facturer through his commercial travellers, while the British commercial travellers directed their attention almost exclusively to old-established firms. Consequently, the small trader has turned to the United States during the war, and if after the war he can put a cheap American article on-the market the larger importing houses will have to do likewise, and so still further reduce the trade with the United Kingdom. Again, German manufacturers are well represented by the German consular agents, and it is suggested that a Trade Commissioner system, with headquarters at Trinidad or Barbadoes, should be established for the West Indies unless a reciprocal system of preference is adopted throughout the Empire.15. Uganda.The Governor states his opinion that no tariffs or other restrictions short of entire prohibition will prevent the recurrence of the German and Austrian trade in blankets, hardware, lamps, coloured and fancy cloths, and agricultural implements, unless merchants and manufacturers are prepared to study and cater for the native market.The Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions in favour of the establishment of an Imperial Ministry of Commerce, the extension of the Trade Commissioner system and the Consular Service, improved banking facilities and the prevention of dumping.16. Tlte Windward Islands.The Agricultural and Commercial Society of St. Lucia advocates in this connection  (a) Preferential tariffs between all parts of the Empire and the encouragement of Imperial trade.(6) Arrangements between the Allies for reciprocal tariffs between themselves and also between them and neutral countries, which will not attempt to exploit them for the benefit of enemy countries, and which will undertake not to form commercial alliances with the latter to our detriment and that of our Allies. ;The Administrator is of opinion that St. Lucia&apos;s main markets for her purchases of manu-factured goods and flour would, with Imperial preferential tariffs, inevitably adjust themselves after the war in favour of the United Kingdom and Canada, with a subsidiary but important source of supply in the United States. The Governor points out, however, that in spite of the reciprocal agreement with Canada, the United States still maintains her position as the more important supplier of flour.A special Committee appointed by the Governor in Grenada states that during the war trade has to some extent been diverted from the United Kingdom to the United States. Some of this trade will naturally revert to-the United Kingdom after the war, but as steamship com-munication with the United States is speedier and more frequent, special attention should be directed to improving the steamship services between the United Kingdom and the West Indies and possibly to further reduction in cable rates. The motor car trade is particularly mentioned by the Committee, to illustrate this point.The Committee states that the trade of the Colony is affected to some extent by the 30 per cent, differential duty imposed by Venezuela in violation of commercial treaties upon imports from the British West Indies.Further, the Committee urges the improvement and extension of the Consular system and the adoption of a uniform decimal system of currency, weights and measures for the British Empire.IV.-Resources of the Empire. 1. Bahamas.The House of Assembly considers that it is of primary importance that the Bahamas should be included in an all-red steamship connection with the Mother Country.&apos;2. British, Guiana. The Georgetown Chamber of Commerce recommends:  (1) The establishment of regular steamship communications with the United Kingdomand with Canada, subsidised if necessary. (2) A guarantee of financial assistance from the Imperial Government for approved schemes for the development of the Colony.
The Special Committee appointed by the &quot;Governor suggests that the Colony requires better steamship communications with the United Kingdom and India, and lower freight rates. At present Fiji is dependent on shipments from Sydney, and the rates of freights from that port to Fiji are very high.4. Gambia.The Governor suggests that a valuable Imperial link might conceivably be formed if an adequate steamer service could be inaugurated between the Dominion of Canada and the West Coast of Africa via the West Indies, whereby rice, flour, and sugar could be carried for African consumption, the ships filling uf5 on the return with cocoa and other West African produce.5. Gold Coast.The Governor maintains that the first and most important step to be taken to develop the resources of the Tropical Colonies is to facilitate the flotation of loans, and that-steps should be taken to enable loans raised by Crown Colonies and Protectorates on the security of their revenue, to be issued under the formal guarantee of the Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.The Governor points out, also, that the main communications of all the Crown Colonies are sea routes, and that all of them are at the mercy of monopolists and monopolistic combines. He states that, purely from the point of view of the Crown Colonies, anything (including Govern-mental control of shipping) which tended to reduce freights and to facilitate communication by sea would prove highly advantageous to them.6. Jamaica.In connection with the resolution of the Paris Economic Conference relating to the exchange of Allied products by the establishment of improved transport services, the Special Committee of the Agricultural Society and of the Merchants&apos; Exchange declares that the policy recom-mended at Paris would especially assist Jamaican exports, but that any subsidies given to steamship lines should be dependent on (a) The control of freight rates by the Government granting the subsidy and by thefixing of maximum rates from time to time.(b) The prohibition of the formation of any conference or combine.(c) The prohibition of the granting of rebates dependent on the restriction of business tocertain lines.(d) The provision of suitable accommodation for the safe conveyance of fruit or otherperishable cargo.7. Nigeria.The Governor-General submits that since it is in conjunction with our Allies that we -propose to take steps &quot; to develop our economic position and independence in relation to enemy countries,&quot; they should be invited to co-operate by taking such steps as may be feasible and judicious to give effect to this policy.The Governor is of opinion also that it is to the interest of Nigeria-in common with the rest of the Empire that the traditional policy of the &quot; open door&quot; should not be replaced by one of exclusive privilege as against the foreigner, and that Allies and neutrals should be welcomed and the introduction of their capital facilitated under stringent safeguards.8. Nyasaland.   ,Tbe Governor, a Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Agriculture and Commerce, and the members of the Executive Council agree in emphasising the great importance for the develop-ment of Nyasaland of transport facilities both internal and external.The Governor states that the cost of the necessary railway extensions to connect Lake Nyasa with the present railway and to bring the Protectorate into direct communication with the port of Beira may be estimated at  2,000,000. Such a scheme would involve the acquisition of the portion of Portuguese East Africa through which the railway would be laid and the purchase of interests in existing railways.The Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce urges the importance of adequate ocean shipping facilities and states that before the war the Protectorate was dependent for a regular steamship service upon the Deutsch Ost Afrika Linie.As regards resources capable of development, a Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce recommends a rebate on the duty imposed in the United Kingdom on Tobacco shipped by British firms and in British bottoms and preferential treatment of British grown Cotton, in the event of any change in fiscal policy. The Committee also points out, in this connection, the benefit which would accrue from cheap and regular freights. The acting Chief Secretary in commenting upon these proposals states that a rebate might be considered when paying prices
are not obtainable but tbat the Tobacco industry, at present,.needs no sucb encouragement. He considers that high priced commodities such as tea, tobacco, and cotton can stand on their own, but that the production of maize, wheat, cattle, &amp;c, needs encouragement, preferably in the form of cheaper freights and shipping facilities.The Governor also considers a rebate unnecessary if Imperial Preference is inaugurated and if Imperial assistance is given for opening up the communications of the Protectorate.The Director of Agriculture states that the production of cotton, maize, wheat and rice could be increased by the inauguration of improved transport facilities. A preferential tariff would - also encourage production.Other measures suggested by the Governor for the development of Nyasaland are facilities for the acquisition of land by British subjects and for their settlement in Nyasaland, and the establishment of an Agricultural Bank.. %9. Northern Rhodesia.The High Commissioner for South Africa has forwarded a resolution passed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Agricultural and Commercial Association requesting that their claim for pre-ference on their products, especially on tobacco, may be taken into consideration. It is stated that, although the Association^ output is not yet large, the fact that Rhodesia and Nyasaland are the only countries which can produce a substitute for the popular American &quot;Bright&quot; tobacco gives promise of enormous possibilities for these two colonies if Imperial preference is granted.10. Seychelles.The Governor emphasises the imperative need of shipping facilities for the Colony, and urges that after the war the General Post Office in London should use every endeavour to include the Seychelles in the itinerary of a subsidised British Mail Service to British East Africa and Mauritius. It is stated that the absence of a British subsidised mail service in the Indian Ocean has had an adverse effect on British trade, and has tended to promote foreign influence.&apos; 11. Southern Rhodesia.The Administrator states that the production of maize, which Under normal conditions con-siderably exceeds local requirements, is expected to increase, and that it would be greatly stimulated &quot; by the making of further arrangements such as that by which the Imperial Govern-ment have offered to purchase at a fixed price all maize produced this year in excess of local requirements.&quot; Active steps should also be taken at once to encourage the production of wheat which at present is insufficient for local needs.As regards minerals, the exportation to the United States and other countries of chrome ore and of copper from the Falcon mine, where it is found in conjunction with gold, has been allowed during the war by arrangement with H.M. Government. In the case of copper this was due to the fact that practically no facilities for treating the ore exist in Great Britain and in this connection the Rhodesia Munitions and Resources Committee recommends that machinery should be organised throughout the Empire for dealing with all the essential products of British territory.Indications go to show that there are large deposits in Rhodesia of tungsten, asbestos and antimony, but the last two products are only exploited irregularly, and it is to be considered whether some assistance could not be given through some financial institution, such as &quot; an industrial bank &quot; and also by making the services of experts available at a reasonable charge. It is suggested that experts might be attached to the Imperial Institute from which useful assistance is already received, in order that their services might be available in Rhodesia and other dependencies. The visits of such experts would lead to much closer co-operation than is possible at present between the Institute on the one side and the Rhodesian Administration and recognised Rhodesian industrial organisations, such as the Chambers of Mines and of Commerce, Agricultural Union and Munitions and Resources Committee, on the other.As far as raw material is necessary for munitions the Imperial Government might assist; (a) by making contracts for the purchase of such material at a fixed price for a numberof years;(b) by making an annual payment in return for reserving the right to call for suchmaterial at any time;(c) by the provision in Great Britain of facilities for treating such material;(d) by having experts available as mentioned above.The Adminstrator draws attention to the importance of cheap and rapid railway and steam-ship communication. At present the small volume of traffic over vast areas makes it impossible to fix low railway rates, and the demand for them discourages the sinking of capital in lailways. It is therefore suggested that the position would be greatly improved if the Imperial Govern-ment would guarantee for a fixed period some interest on . capital expended on approved developing lines.The Rhodesia Munitions and Resources Committee recommends :  (1) The formation of a local committee, supported by the Government, and having wide powers to investigate and expedite the development of the resources and industries of the country.
(2) General scientific education; technical education; extending and increasing scientific investigation; the institution. of travelling and research scholarships; the thorough investigation of diseases affecting the development of resources; the establishment of industrial hanks; the subsidising, where necessary, of industries which are important to; the .welfare Or development of the Empire; the subsidising of ocean freights anddandvtransport where proved to be necessary or desirable; the encouragement of emigration to British /territories, and its. discouragement elsewhere; the unification of the patent laws., ,   ...       &apos;&apos;12. Trinidad.The Chamber of Commerce advocates the formation of a Trade, Bank to give more assist-ance to both agricultural and commercial enterprises. It is recommended also &quot; that the Government should foster and encourage private enterprise and should control or do away with all rings or combinations which tend towards destroying competition, such, for instance, as the Conference of Steamship Lines, which has unduly increased freight rates and has established an objectionable system of rebates under which shippers are unfairly bound for long periods of time. No steamers seeking employment need callat the&apos;Port of Spain, as any firm shipping by such an opportunity is boycotted or penalised thereafter. Thus, steamers desiring oil fuel or cargoes of asphalt are often discouraged from calling at the Port of Spain and the trade of Trinidad, more especially in those important products, is in consequence restricted instead of being developed.&quot; &apos;13. Uganda. -(The Governor states that the most crying need in the Protectorate is for transport facilities. A railway into theheart of the country is required to link up the Uganda Railway to the confines of the Congo. ,14. The Windward Islands.For the purpose of increasing the population in St. Lucia the Government of St. Lucia recommends (1) The inauguration after the War of a system of assisted East Indian immigration under Government control.(2) The materialization as soon as possible after the War of the proposed land settlement scheme in St. Lucia of better-class European settlers with small capital who have been serving in His Majesty&apos;s forces.The Governor, however, would hesitate before offering any inducement to young English-men to settle in St. Lucia. He is of opinion that St. Lucia should be developed by capitalists Avho are prepared to await the return of their outlay, and who would employ local men to openup and develop their land.(3) Financial arrangements to be considered for the deepening of the harbour of Castries, St. Lucia, to a uniform minimum depth of thirty feet, and for removing certain obstructive coral shoals, also for extending the wharf accommodation.The Governor is doubtful whether St. Lucia will be able to retain its importance as a coaling station now that coaling depots are being established in the Panama Canal zone. Should the Trinidad harbour works be sanctioned, owing to the proximity of oil, the largeness of the anchorage and the importance of the place, Trinidad will probably become the naval base in those parts.(4) The establishment in the West Indies of a State-aided and partially State-controlled agricultural bank, for the assistance especially of planters with medium-sized holdings.  -The Governor is in agreement with this suggestion. He considers that this matter could he dealt with locally.(5) In connexion with any future steamship mail contract to and from the United Kingdom, the following arrangements to be made :  -(a) The effective control of freight rates chargeable not only in any mail contract steamers,but also in all the steamers owned or controlled by the company securing the mail contract between the West Indies and the United Kingdom. The control to be vested in a responsible Government Board to be set up for this purpose.(b) The abolition of the rebate system in regard to cargo carried in any of the ships ownedor controlled by the company securing the mail contract.The Governor endorses these proposals, but fears that the scarcity of tonnage immediately after the war, the demands of the South American trade, and the policy of the &quot; shipping ring &quot; will make it difficult to execute it.A Special Committee in Grenada, appointed by the Governor, also recommends that if any subsidy is granted to a steamship service between the United Kingdom and the West Indies, freight rates should be controlled, and if practicable that the formation of any conference or combine, as also the system of rebates which operates against legitimate competition, should be prohibited.(6) If necessary, the maintenance of two or three freight steamers by the West Indian Governments to cater for West Indian, trade.The Governor does not consider this suggestion feasible.   - -14132 .

(7) Arrangements to be made(a) For fixing cable rates between the West Indies and the United Kingdom and Canadaat least as low as those at present payable between the West Indies and the United States of America; and(b) For the reduction of inter-West Indian colonial cable rates. ..The Governor thinks that tbe headquarters of the Cable Company, being a British company, should be in Trinidad, instead of, as at present, in St. Thomas. He does not consider the local rates excessive (Grenada to Antigua, 8d. a word; Grenada to Barbadoes, Aid.; Grenada to Trinidad, 3d.; Grenada to British Guiana, 10d.).(8) The establishment of some satisfactory form of closer union between the West Indian colonies for dealing with affairs of common interest to them.The Governor is of opinion that more co-ordination as regards customs, company and shipping legislation could be effected by instructions from the Secretary of State.(9) The institution of a Colonial Development Board at the Colonial Office to aid in the development of the resources of the Crown Colonies and Protectorates.The v Governor holds that Colonies are best served by the recommendations of &quot; the man on the spot,&quot; and he would be sorry to see any change in the present system of Colonial Government or any interference in the Government by &quot; a body of people in England who invariably have their own axes to grind,,?The Agricultural&apos; and Commercial Society suggests the following ways of developing Imperial resources by educating British peoples&apos; to a better understanding of the various portions of the Empire, and of its vast and varied resources; by encouraging the production of an adequate supply, at a reasonable cost, of the raw material and commodities essential to industry, and by conserving them primarily for the benefit of the Empire; by promoting among manufacturers a more careful and methodical study of the commercial requirements of the British and foreign markets; by giving facilities for more scientific treatment of all products of industry, and for the economic distribution of such products; by giving facilities by legislation, financial assistance, and otherwise for promoting industrial enterprise and banking within the Empire, for the development and organization of British shipping, for improving the means and reducing the cost of communication and transport, including cable wireless, and postal communication to and from Great Britain and the Dominions and between the Dominions; by facilitating by legislation, financial aid, and otherwise the flow of emigration of British subjects to British countries, and so to conserve British manhood for the nation. But the Society feels that nothing that can be recommended towards the solution of this question will be of any value, to the West Indies at least, until the Mother Country gives up the doctrine that it is better to buy cheap foreign goods fostered by cartels, bounties, and hostile tariffs, than to protect and maintain at a reasonable price those produced within the Empire. Under a different creed Martinique has, in spite of disastrous hurricanes and volcanic eruptions, from which St. Lucia has been happily exempt, developed and prospered exceedingly, while St. Lucia has retrograded or remained stationary and under populated.The Executive Council of St. Vincent state that the principal exports from St. Vincent are arrowroot and cotton.(1) Unless circumstances arise to give the arrowroot produced in St. Vincent an advantage in its competition with alien supplies of starches in the English market there is no prospect of an increase in the- demand for it.(2) If the demand for Sea Island cotton in Lancashire increases it is hoped that some measures will result that will ensure such a minimum price as will enable groAvers to extend cultivation,.notwithstanding the high average cost of production resulting from the fluctuations in output.The Council state further that the expansion of the Sugar Industry in St. Vincent would probably go a long way lo the attainment of a position of moderate prosperity in the Colony, and it is hoped that the means of establishing a modern type of factory will be provided by a loan from the Imperial Government on easy terms. The Colony is particularly well suited to the cultiva-tion of sugar.The prevention of freight combines is advocated, and also the removal of the surtax on produce landed in a French port from a ship which has called at any European port during the voyage to France.15. Zanzibar.The Acting Resident is of opinion that it is of primary importance that there should be a fast service via the Suez Canal of cargo steamers of moderate size, say, 6,000 tons. If there are not found to be sufficient inducements in the way of freight and passengers to secure this, it would be worth while, provided that the Government of East Africa, Uganda, and the lately conquered territories were willing to co-operate, to subsidise such a service. Advantage should also be taken of the regular Peninsula and Oriental Mail Service to the East by the institution of a fast connection between Aden and Zanzibar, and to this also the Government would, if neces-sary, be justified in giving financial support, relatively to the benefits to be derived. Possibly the Peninsula and Oriental and British India Companies, who are now working in conjunction, might be prepared to consider both these proposals together. The currency of any contracts that it may be possible to enter into for the purposes indicated should not, in the opinion of the Acting Resident, excsed five years.
437Y. Foreign Interests. -    &apos; ;a. Individual Activities.  .;The Cliamber of Commerce of the Federated Malay States recommends that a trading tax be imposed on all nationals of present enemy countries, the amount to be based on a percentage of the annual turnover. The High Commissioner is also in favour of prohibiting subjects of hostile nations from holding land and from establishing themselves in any trade, shipping or banking concerns for a period of years.The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce recommends that enemy subjects should be prohibited from entering Hong Kong for a minimum period of 10 years after peace is declared, and that they should after that period be admitted only under licence. The Chamber is of opinion that more effective control of other friendly aliens should also be aimed at, and that it might be practicable to institute a form of registration for the purpose. The Governor favours the maintenance after the war of the Registration of Persons Ordinance of 1916 and the Travellers Restriction Ordinance of 1915.   These Ordinances affect persons of other than of Chinese race.The Governor of Nyasaland considers that Nyasaland should take part in any Imperial scheme for the treatment of enemy subjects as regards their activities in industries or professions and their right to acquire land or to have a financial interest in commercial undertakings.-A Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce recommends that enemy firms or persons should be prohibited from carrying on trade in the Protectorate during the war and for a specified time afterwards.All the Chambers of Commerce in Southern Rhodesia and the Rhodesia Munitions and Resources Committee endorse a resolution of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa: &quot;That no trading licences be issued to enemy subjects or to agents of enemy firms provided that there shall be reasonable safeguards in respect of existing licences.&quot;The Governor of Uganda also is of opinion that during the period immediately following the war no enemy firms should be allowed to establish themselves or take cut licences to trade until conditions become normal. An alteration in the existing licensing laws is advocated to restrict licences to trade for a period of five years to subjects of most favoured nations only, to be followed by a surtax on all licences to trade subsequently issued.The Uganda Chamber of Commerce recommends that it should be compulsory for non-Allied firms and individuals trading in Uganda to produce balance-sheets for audit by the Adminis-tration, and that a tax be levied on all profits shown, such tax to be the equivalent of the income tax charged by the home Government on British dividends or profits at the time of audit.The Government of St. Lucia (Windward Islands) do not consider that the proposal of tho Agricultural and Commercial Society for the prohibition for a period of trading by enemy subjects in British countries is either feasible or possible.A Special Committee appointed in Grenada by the Governor of the Windward Islands recommends that enemy subjects should be prevented by legislation for a period after the war from engaging in business or taking up employment or domicile within the Empire, and that registration of aliens be made compulsory; that commercial or travelling agents from Allied and Neutral countries before obtaining; custom be required to produce certificates of nationality of themselves and of the houses they represent; and that persons of enemy nationality be pro-hibited from engaging in any banking, investment or similar business within the Empire.With regard to the subject of Naturalization, the Governor of Fiji recommends that no alien enemy should be naturalized in Fiji until he has resided in the Colony continuously for not less than 20 years; the Trinidad Chamber of Commerce suggests that naturalization in general should not be so easily or lightly granted as hitherto, and that subjects of present enemy countries should be debarred from naturalization for a considerable period of years; and the GoA-ernor of Southern Rhodesia forwards the recommendation of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa &quot;that enemy subjects holding certificates of British naturalization shall be required, within a reasonable period of the conclusion of peace, to produce papers of denaturali-zation from the country of their origin, or satisfy a competent authority of their inability to obtain them.&quot; The Governor of British Honduras states Iris opinion that the proposal of some of the members of the Council to prohibit naturalized British subjects from ever holding office in the Colony is futile. Naturalization should not be granted to persons Avho are not considered by the Government to be fit persons to hold office, but should be granted only when the Colony, as well as the individual, is likely to benefit by the change of nationality. Provision should also be made for cancelling certificates of naturalization when the holder has left the Colony and is not occupied in commercial relations connected with it. The Government of St. Lucia consider that for 10 or 15 years after the war no enemy subiect should be naturalized in the British Empire, and in any case that the naturalization laws should be much more stringent.A Special Committee appointed in Grenada by the Governor of the Windward Islands supports the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the West Indies in recommending:  (a) That British citizenship or naturalization should not be allowed to present enemy subjects until after 20 years&apos; uninterrupted residence under registration in the.British Empire, hrit to other aliens after five years; (b) that the oath of allegiance be accompanied by an oath of divest-ment of allegiance to. the power of which the person has hitherto been a subject ;&apos;(c) that in order to obtain British citizenship the children of alien parentage within the Empire be required to take out naturalization papers on attaining their majority.MM H 2
GOb. Shareholding in or Control of Industrial Companies. The British Guiana (Georgetown) Chamber of Commerce recommends:  (a) That no person, limited&apos; liability company, or corporation of enemy parentage or nationality should be allowed to own real estate, or to hold, explore, or work Crown or Other land within the Colony at any time or to carry on any trade or business in the Colony for 25 years, without the special permission of the Governor in Council, except such persons, Companies or Corporations as have been allowed to trade here uninterruptedly during the war. (6) That in the event of any permission, as above, being given, the majority say two-thirds of interest or shares, bonds, etc., in such undertakings should be held by British born subjects, and that the majority of any Board of Directors should also : be British born subjects. The Chamber of Commerce of the Federated Malay States recommends that no company, firm or individual be allowed to trade, carry on business or hold land in the Malay States except under licence, and that the registration of partnerships be made compulsory.The High Commissioner considers that the first part of this recommendation would tend to prevent subjects of Allied and Neutral countries from bringing capital into the Colony, and further, that it would be inadvisable that the granting or refusing of licences to subjects of Allied or Neutral countries should be left to the Government. Such a restriction might, how-ever, be applied to enemy subjects after the. period of years has elapsed during which they should not be allowed to hold land or establish themselves in any trade, shipping or banking concern. The High Commissioner adds that the proposed restriction which is aimed at Japanese corn-petition is impracticable since it would be impossible to discriminate in the granting of licences between the subjects of particular countries.The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce suggests that more effective control of alien and native firms particularly alien and Chinese Corporations trading as Hong Kong registered companies should be aimed at. The Chamber states that the requirement, of the local Ordinance are frequently ignored and that there is in fact no real control.The Governor points put that this question is of great difficulty, and refers to the problem of compulsory registration of Chinese partnerships a problem hitherto insoluble. He considers that a general system of licensing involving inspection of books and transactions would be impracticable, as it would discourage Chinese traders from establishing themselves in Hong Kong. He states also that the suggested control of alien and Chinese Corporations trading as Hong Kong registered companies is in conflict with the Royal Instructions, and that the Govern-ment does not believe that abuses are more prevalent in one class of local company than in another.Further, the Chamber of Commerce recommends that the following restrictions be placed upon insurance companies :  (1) That British traders or insurance companies be allowed to insure and reinsure onlywith British Companies. (2) That British insurance companies be allowed to employ only British agents on Empireterritory.(3) That a special tax be imposed on all premiums secured by foreign companies doingbusiness in Empire territory. (4) That provision be made that the books of foreign insurance companies shall be opento inspection by properly appointed auditors, and that such books shall be kept inEnglish.The Attorney-General, in criticising these proposals, points out that their adoption might drive a good deal of &quot;marine insurance elsewhere. Exports of Chinese products might thus be insured at Canton.Again, certain difficulties of administration are brought forward by the Attorney-General who also makes the following criticisms of the proposals, considered as a possible Imperial policy:  (1) It may be doubted whether protection would be the best policy either for the publicor for the British Companies, as it has never been tried. (2) Discrimination might lead to reprisals.(3) The object of the policy is not clear as insurance is not a &quot; key &quot; industry.The Governor of Nigeria is of opinion that the introduction of capital by Allies and neutrals into Nigeria should be facilitated under stringent safeguards, and that in order to secure the effective Operation of this policy any neutral who acquires any real property with a view to establishing a business in Nigeria should, during the Reconstruction period be required to register the Company in the United Kingdom and be subject to such rules in regard to the directorate and the personnel of the local agents as may be considered advisable, and should be subject to such conditions in regard to the acquisition of real estate as appear under that head. This proposal is based on the assumption that during the Reconstruction Period neither present enemy subjects nor any neutral on their behalf shall be allowed to control any business in Nigeria, but that after that period it will be neither possible nor advantageous to exclude present enemy subjects from the commerce of the world.A Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce recommends that.all British.companies operating in Nyasaland which have foreign shareholders or partners should get rid of such share-holders or partners and. that legislation should be enacted to enable them to do so and also to prohibit all such enemy persons from acquiring shares or interests in firms operating in Nyasaland for a certain period.
The Acting Chief Secretary considers that in order to exclude foreign interests, the constitu-tion of the directorate and the origin of the capital of concerns operating in Nyasaland should be subject to careful examination and that necessary limitations shoiild be established.- &apos;In the Straits Settlements; the Singapore and Penang Chambers of Commerce recommend (1) that no foreign trading, shipping or banking concern, individual,; or firm of a country notified in the Government Gazette be allowed to establish themselves in the Colony without a special licence from the Governor in Council. - .;(2) That a trading tax based on a percentage of the annual turnover be imposed on any individual firm or company of a present enemy country.      &apos;&quot; ;   - -The Penang Chamber of Commerce considers also that no individual or firm of a present enemy country should be permitted to be the representative agents of British manufactures or commercial undertakings.The Governor is of opinion, however, that the adoption of the first recommendation might discourage aliens from bringing their capital into the country, and that at any rate there should be a proviso to that recommendation that no enemy alien should be allowed to establish himself in any trading, shipping or banking concern for a period&apos;of years. He is in agreement with the second recommendation. -The Trinidad, (Port of Spain) Chamber of Commerce suggests that companies or corporations in which aliens possess a controlling interest should, not be allowed to hold real property.The Government of St. Lucia uphold the principle that only British controlled companies should operate in British countries, but are opposed to any measures which would tend to preserve the development of British resources entirely for British capital, which is likely to prove inade-quate for the purpose. It is considered a sufficient safeguard that the majority of the capital and the chairman or managing director of any company registered or operating in a British place shall be required to be British.c. Acquisition of Real Property.The British Guiana (Georgetown) Chamber of Commerce recommends that no person of enemy parentage or company of enemy nationality should be allowed to hold real estate.The Governor of British Honduras considers that it would be desirable to revert to the old law under which aliens could only acquire land by licence. This restriction would be intended as a safeguard against Germans, but it is thought that it would not be without advantage in the case of other nationalities.The High Commissioner of the Federated Malay States considers that if a country does not permit British subjects or subjects of the rulers of the Federated Malay States to hold land in that country, then the Malay States should be permitted to impose the same restrictions on the subjects of the country in question.The Governor of Fiji recommends that no alien enemy should ever be allowed to acquire and hold in the Colony any description of property, whether personal or real.The Governor of the Gold Coast recommends that the supply of minerals available in the Empire should be withheld from foreign exploitation and control and, provided that sufficient British capital is forthcoming to defray the cost of development, he advocates:  1. That no concession shall receive a Certificate of Validity under Section 15 of Ordinance No. 14 of 1900 (The Concessions Ordinance) unless it be the property of bond fide British subjects.2. That every Director of a Mining Company or Corporation engaged in mining operationsin the Gold Coast shall be a British subject. 3. That not less than 80 per cent, of the share capital of any such enterprise must be heldby British subjects.The Governor-General of Nigeria submits that no present enemy subjects should be allowed to acquire any title to real property during the period of Reconstruction and as long thereafter as the international situation may demand; that no foreigner should be allowed to acquire real property, whether from Government or from private owners, except on leasehold-the conditions if be verified by Government, if Government is not the lessor and to include safeguards to prevent transfer to enemy subjects or use on their behalf or the recurrence of such abuses as were effected by Germany; the land to be used for the bond fide purpose for which it was acquired.The Governor&apos;s suggestions are accepted by the Nigerian Council except by the Attorney-General, who considers that foreigners should be allowed to acquire freehold property, but only under the authority of an Ordinance, that no lease to a foreigner should exceed 21 years except with the approval of the Secretary of State, and that the right of foreigners to acquire leases (or exclusive prospecting rights which carry the right to acquire leases) of minerals which are essential for national defence, should be restricted. .A Committee of the Nyasaland Chamber of Commerce recommends that all enemy firms and persons should be prohibited from purchasing land in the Protectorate during the War, and for a specified period afterwards.In the Straits Settlements, the.Singapore Chamber-of Commerce recommends that no present enemy subject be allowed to own immovable property in the Colony.The Gc-T0^nor is in agreement with this recommendation.The Trinidad Chamber of Commerce (Port of Spain) suggests that neither aliens nor eoni-panies or corporations in which aliens possess a controlling interest should be allowed to hold real property.
The Governor of Uganda states that in order to prevent the restablishment of enemy firms local legislation should he enacted prohibiting the sale, lease, or transfer of property to other than most-favoured-nation subjects for a period of five years.The Uganda Chamber of Commerce also has recommended that subjects of non-Allied nations be not allowed to hold land on the same terms as British subjects.The Government of St. Lucia concur in the view of the Agricultural and Commercial Society that no enemy subject should be permitted to purchase property or own land in freehold in British countries for 10 or 15 years after the war.The Acting Resident at Zanzibar states that the logical sequence of the action which has already been taken in respect of the acquisition of enemy business premises would be the enact-ment of legislation to prohibit enemy subjects from acquiring or holding real property of any kind in the Protectorate.d. Shipping.-The British Guiana (Georgetown) Chamber of Commerce advocates reciprocal treatment of vessels of Allied and neutral countries and exclusion of German shipping from ports of the Empire for a period, and after that period right of entry under disabilities as compared with British, Allied, or neutral shipping.A member of the British Honduras Council considers that high light dues should be imposed on the enemies&apos; ships.The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce hopes that the ton for ton policy will be adopted, and recommends that ships belonging to the Central Powers should not be allowed to use British Ports as freely as before the war; that subsidized ships of the Flags of enemy powers should be subjected to penalties; and that if Germany attempts to use British ports as stages on a route leading to the development of Whampoa, in order to divert trade and shipping from Hong Kong, port dues from Suez outwards should be placed on differential terms and coaling facilities restricted against German ships employed in such policy. The Chamber also considers it desirable to consider the practicability of applying port dues to alien shipping on reciprocal terms.The Governor states that in the opinion of the Hong Kong Government the exclusion of enemy shipping would not be in the best interests of Hong Kong.A special Committee appointed by the Governor of Malta recommends:  (a) That the establishment of coaling firms of enemy origin or coaling firms under enemyinfluence should be forbidden. (6) That inducements should be held out to British shipowners to use Malta as their bunkering port in the Mediterranean.(c) That the carriage of goods to British ports in British ships should be encouraged bythe remission or reduction of duties, or by other means.(d) That the employment of Maltese officers and men in the British Mercantile Marinevshould be encouraged.(e) That the desirability of allowing the naval dockyard in Malta to be used as a ship-building yard should be urged in the proper quarter, and that steps should be taken to impress upon shipbuilders the advantages accruing from the use of Malta as a centre of ship construction.The Governor of the Seychelles recommends that dues on German and Austrian ships should be placed at a figure to make them prohibitive.In the Straits Settlements, the Governor and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce recom-mend that an extra due be imposed on the cargo of all vessels using the Suez Canal which fly the flag of our present enemies. The Singapore Chamber considers also that vessels of enemy countries should be permitted to trade between British ports, and that no special tax should be levied on any such vessels when entering or leaving Singapore. The Chamber is in favour of imposing as large an indemnity as possible, and states it is in favour of an imperial &quot;ton for ton &quot; policy.The Governor agrees with these recommendations. He considers that, if a tax were levied on a vessel flying the flag of a present enemy, trade might be driven to a neighbouring country, but if the tax were levied at the Suez Canal Singapore would not be handicapped in the manner suggested above.The Comptroller of Customs in Sierra Leone recommends a system of differential charges against all enemy and foreign shipping.The Administrator of Southern Rhodesia forwards a resolution of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa that differential charges against all enemy shipping be made at the South African ports.The Governor of Uganda recommends that, if the East African ports could be adequately served by British and friendly shipping, increased shipping arid registration dues should be imposed on vessels the property of countries not in receipt of most-favoured-nation treatment. The local Chamber of Commerce is of opinion that all ships of alien countries registration should pay greatly increased harbour dues, over and above those paid by British shipping.The Government of St. Lucia (Windward Islands) state that since only ten of the 835 steamers which called at Castries in 1913 were of German origin the adoption of the resolution of the Agricultural and Commercial. Society in favour of penal charges against and disabilities upon.German shipping. would not appear to be of vital importance. In this matter they are content to adopt whatever measures may be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government to-be desirable1.  They suggest, however, that any disabilities imposed should have for their object the
439prevention of British cargo being carried in enemy bottoms rather than the penalization of enemy shipping by means of excessive charges or by the refusal to supply bunker coal to enemy ships.A Special Committee appointed in Grenada by the Governor of the Windward Islands recommends that enemy shipping should be required for a period after the war to pay higher dues in British ports; that no British Government subsidies should be granted to enemy shipping; that foreign tonnage in Empire ports should conform to conditions obligatory on Empire shipping; that preference should be given to British shipping by lower, tonnage dues and port charges; and that privileges accorded to allied and neutral shipping should be equivalent only to corresponding privileges granted by Allied and Neutral countries.The Acting Resident of Zanzibar states that before the war the greater part of the shipping between Zanzibar and Europe and India was in German hands. He suggests that by raising the port dues from one anna to eight annas per registered ton in the case of enemy ships their return would be effectually prevented.XIII.SUMMARY OF REPRESENTATIONS BY CERTAIN TRADE ASSOCIATIONS.A number of the more detailed representations which the Committee has received from certain Trade Associations are summarised below.1. In addition to recommendations relating to large industries which are specially men-tioned in the Committee&apos;s Report, detailed representations have been made as to the following industries:  (a) Rubber.(b) Sugar.(c) Leather.(d) Paint, Colour and Varnish.(e) Glass Bottles. if) Furniture.A.-RUBBER.The British Rubber Tyre Manufacturers&apos; Association, Ltd., recommend that some immediate steps be taken to protect the Rubber industry, either by prohibition of imports or by a protective tariff.American trade in motor tyres has greatly increased during the war because the stocks of tyres usually held by agents in this country could not be kept up owing to the heavy war demand, and the agents were obliged to obtain American goods. Thus, in 1913, the imports of motor tyres from America were valued at  224,428; in 1915,  1,225,422; and during the half-year to the end of June, 1916,  1,063,585. (Tyres were expressly excluded from the restriction of import of Motor Vehicles.)Again, the increase of the American Motor Tyre trade in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, India, and the East has been very serious. The total American exports in 1914 (11 months) to Australia, New Zealand, and all other countries excepting Belgium, France, Germany, Russia, England, Canada, Mexico, Cuba and the Philippines were valued at  570,337. In 1916 (11 months) these exports had risen to  4,818,497.In other Rubber goods, American manufacturers are also making great progress as regards the capture of British markets. In Rubber Thread the keenest competition exists, and American producers are keeping their prices 5 per cent, below British prices, and far below the price in the American market. Considerable quantities of unnecessary rubber luxuries are also being imported, to the future disadvantage of British manufacturers now preoccupied with war work.B.-SUGAR.The policy advocated by the British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation to develop the supply of Sugar within the Empire is based on a general British Tariff differentiating in favour of the Empire and our Allies as against Enemies, it being essential, however, that a minimum prefer-ence for Empire products should be secured.The following detailed recommendations are made:  (1) That Empire Sugar be granted preferential treatment to the extent of 50 per cent, on any tariff that may be in force; such preference at no time to be less than one halfpenny per pound for Sugar exceeding 98 degrees polarization, graduated according to the existing British Tariff. (2) That Sugar of their own production exported to the United Kingdom by . Allied Countries may by negotiation be granted a concession not exceeding 12J per cent, of the General Tariff in force. (3) That Sugar of their own production exported to the United Kingdom by Neutral Countries shall pay not less than the General Tariff rate, but that Neutral Countries declining to enter into favourable reciprocal arrangements with the Empire, or giving more favourable treatment to other countries, shall in addition be subjected to a surtax.(4) That the import of Sugar, directly or indirectly, from Enemy Countries be i totally prohibited for a period of 5 years after the war, and that thereafter it shallnay the General Tariff in force plus 50 per cent, surtax; such surtax at no time to be less than one halfpenny per pound for Sugar exceeding 98 degrees polarization, graduated according to the existing British Tariff.(5) That the exporting country shall iri every case furnish approved Certificates of origin.
(6) That a dumping clause on the lines of the Canadian Tariff he instituted.(?) That if at any time His Majesty&apos;s Government be satisfied that the export of Sugar to this country is being assisted by means of Bounties, Kartels, Rebates of Freight, or any other artificial means whatsoever, immediate steps shall be taken to counter-vaihsuch assistance before applying the Tarifi., - (8) That all products: the composition of /which includes Sugar shall be subject to the same scale of Duties based upon the Sugar contents.(9) That the difference between Excise on Home Grown Beet and the Duty on Empire Grown Sugar shall, be  2 6s. 8d. per ton basis 98 degrees until the crop of Home Grown Beet reaches 50,000 tons of Sugar per annum, thereafter the advantage to cease. . &quot;-* ., .&quot; ... , .(10) That tbe British Government be asked to adopt the above recommendations forthwith, and to make agreements with the Dominions, Colonies and Dependencies to secure preferential treatment of Empire Sugar on the foregoing lines for a term of ten years certain or such longer period as may be agreed upon.The Organisation point out that these recommendations are based on an assumed general tariff on Sugar of Id. per pound. Should this rate of duty be changed, they do not suggest that the preference granted to Empire and Allied Sugar should be increased beyond the \d. and \d. per pound respectively. They recommend, however, that the 50. per cent, surtax on Enemy Sugar should be maintained, and.tbat the difference between Enemy and Empire Sugar should never be less than Id. per lb. on Sugar exceeding 98 degrees, graduated according to the existing British Tariff.The Organisation state tbat, given adequate security in this market, the ultimate ability of the Empire to produce its own requirements cannot be questioned, and it is believed that the requirements of the Empire can be produced at a cost enabling retail sale in this country at 2\d. per lb. exclusive of duty, as against the average (for 4 years) pre-war price, exclusive of duty, of 2d. By the time the Empire becomes self-supporting (about, 10 years is estimated to be the probable period) the cost of production should admit of a lower selling price.It is further recommended that, in the event of it being considered that the British Govern-ment are bound by the Brussels Convention of 1913, they should forthwith give the necessary six months&apos; notice of their intention to adopt a preferential policy.C- LEATHER.The Association of Factors, Merchants and Importers of Leather, Hides and Tanning Materials have presented a detailed statement of the views of the various sections of their Association on the subjects included in the Committee&apos;s terms of reference. Such of their state-ments as relate to matters in the Committee&apos;s terms of reference are summarised below.The Association is of opinion that the manufacture of Leather in this country is essential. The Foreign Hides&apos; Section states that before the war Germany had a large industry producing stock for Fancy Leather goods, but that the bulk of her raw supplies for this work was drawn, in the form of Tanned Skivers, from England. As regards Chrome Leather (including Box and Glace), the supply of raw material is obtained to a large extent from within the British Empire, and the Foreign Hides&apos; Section is in favour of some form of Imperial Preference with special concessions to Allies and friendly Neutrals.The Madras Kips Section is of opinion that in order to maintain and establish the Leather industry the raw material should be conserved and that the resources of the Empire should be used within the Empire.The Market Hides and Tanning Materials Section recommends that the greatest encourage-ment possible should be given to producers and growers of tanning materials within the Empire and that immediate steps be taken to withdraw all restrictions on import trade.The Light Leather Section recommends that the production of Light Leather in this country should be increased and that care should be taken that raw material necessary for that purpose is brought to this country as cheaply as possible.The Importers Section is of opinion that the interests of the Boot and Shoe Manufacturers should be carefully watched so that they may be able to obtain the cheapest supplies for their requirements. It is hoped that eventually sufficient leather will be produced in the Empire to meet the demand, and until that time it is recommended that every facility should be given for the importation of leather from Allied Countries.The Sole Leather Section points out that the production of Sole Leather of all sorts should be increased in order that home and export trade may be developed.D.-PAINTS, COLOUR AND TARNISH.The National Federation of Associated Paint, Colour and Varnish Manufacturers of the United Kingdom have forwarded to the Committee a Report on the present position as regards the supply of materials for their trade, and the relative importance of; these materials. The dependence of this country upon Germany before the war is especially emphasised, and it is requested that in the event of the Government wishing to impose import duties on.any of the materials in question an opportunity may be given to the Association, tb consult with the Government in the matter.E.-GLASS  BOTTLES.A deputation ,of manufacturers and workmen in the Glass Bottle Trade who were received by the Chairman claimed that the Glass Bottle industry should be regarded as a key industry.
44---The- deputation.- advocated total -prohibition, of import of German and Austrian goods for five years after the war, to be followed by a duty of 75 per cent, ad valorem. A duty sufficient to prevent the importation of cheap bottles produced at lower rates of wages or under worse labour conditions than in this country should be imposed upon imports from other than enemy countries (a 33^ per cent, duty was suggested). If, however, British manufacturers should be found to be unable to supply the demand they should be allowed to import under Government control to the extent of the shortage, and the goods thus imported should be required to be sold at not less than the British market price.In order to improve the Glass Bottle industry in this country the deputation recommended that a National Board should be established composed of Government officials and manufac-turers and workmen in equal proportions (or alternatively with a Chairman only appointed by. the Government) with the following functions :  1. To deal with selling prices and wages and the placing of contracts.2. To consider improvements of methods of production and working hours.3. To deal generally with all matters affecting the trade and the relations of employers and employed.The Deputation hoped that if the industry received the protection suggested it would be possible by means of scientific research and the introduction of improved methods of manufacture to cheapen the. cost of production and eventually to compete successfully in foreign markets. They could hot compete at present with the Japanese, whose competition, especially in Australia, was becoming more dangerous even than that of the Germans. The only hope was in obtaining adequate preference in Colonial markets.The objection to a monopoly held by the Glass Bottle Manufacturers in this country would be met, it was contended, if the suggested National Board were established.. It was stated, further, that the trade would be ready to accept regulation of their profits by the Government to safeguard the consumer against excessive prices and regulation to secure the workmen engaged in the industry a fair share of profits. &apos;F. FURNITURE. -The National Federation of Furniture Manufacturers consider that the manufacture of Bentwood Chairs can be successfully undertaken in this country if certain State assistance is forthcoming.In addition to a subsidy to enable a sufficiently large works to be established they advocate the imposition of an ad valorem duty of 50 per cent, on goods of enemy origin and a duty, of 33J per cent, on goods from other foreign countries.2. As regards Fiscal Policy generally, the Federation of British Industries circulated a questionnaire to such of their members as were considered representative of the views of the most important interests in each trade. Replies were received from 352 firms and 56 Associations as follows :  Organisation of Industry. Questions 1, 2 and 3. 1. Is further co-operation desirable : - A. Between Manufacturer and Manufacturer?B. Between Trade and Trade.2. If it is desirable, can this be best obtained by an extension and strengthening of the Association system?3. If so, should action be taken to promote such extension by legislation giving Associa-tions a legal status as in Germany? More than 94 per cent, of the replies (383 replies) to Questions 1 and 2 were in the affirmative, thus approving of an extension of the principle of co-operation. There appears, however, to have been some doubt as to the means of giving effect to the desire for co-operation since 81 out of the 408 firms and Associations who sent in replies did not answer Question 3 or gave doubtful answers; 322 replied in the affirmative.National Economic Policy. Questions 4 and 5.4. Will either economic considerations resulting from the changed economic position of the country owing to the war, or international considerations resulting from the same cause and from the action of the Central Powers, render a change of economic policy necessary?5. Should this change involve the institution of a system of duties imposed in the defence of national economic interests? 375 replies favoured the institution of a system of duties, while 8 more stated that some change of economic policy was necessary, without committing themselves to Question 5.Question 6.Should this system include provision for preferential arrangements : - A. Within the Empire?B. With the Allies?     &apos;   1 ........
-  375 of-the replies received-were-in favour of preferential arrangements,371 advocating&quot; preference both within the Empire and with the Allies and 12 being in favour of preference within the Empire only.Questions 7 and 8.7. Should there be differentiation in the treatment accorded to neutral and enemy countries?8. Should all preferences or differentiation be based on a system permitting reciprocal treatment to any country which extends preferences to the United Kingdom?310 of the replies to Question 7 favoured differentiation between neutral and enemy countries and 359 advocated reciprocal treatment of any country extending preference to the United Kingdom.Question 9.Does your particular trade require any exceptional protection, assistance or exemption? 277 -replies to this question were in the affirmative and 102 in the negative.Lai our. Question 10.Is it desirable to invite the co-operation of Labour and other interests in carrying out any plans which may be based upon the principle deduced from tbis investigation? 371 replies desired that the co-operation of Labour should be invited.XIY.THE POSITION OF ALIENS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.Memorandum prepared prom Information furnished by His Majesty&apos;s&apos; Ministers in thoseCountries.The following countries do not in any way differentiate between Aliens and Nationals as regards the right (1) to hold real property, (2) to engage in certain industries and to occupy certain positions, and (3) to hold shares in or participate in the management of industrial companies:  The Argentine Republic, Belgium, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Morocco, Panama, Peru, Spain, Uruguay, Venezuela.Reference is made in this memorandum to the differential treatment of aliens (whether by law, by custom or by treaty) in Chile,* Colombia, Denmark, France,* Greece,* Guatemala,* Hayti, Holland,* Honduras,* Italy,* Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, * Norway, Paraguay,* Portugal, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, United States.I. Restriction of freedom to engage in certain industries and to occupy certain positions. 1.   In a few countries all industrial activities of foreigners are regulated :  In Colombia foreigners enjoy the same rights as are granted to Colombians by the laws -of the country to which the foreigner belongs.   In the districts of the Choco and the Darien however, grants of vacant State lands and of mining concessions to foreign corporations or individuals are prohibited.In Denmark the right of an alien to take part in any industry is dependent on the condition that he has been domiciled in Denmark for five years and upon his good behaviour during that time.In Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, generally speaking, equality is assumed between natives and foreigners, but for enterprises where Governmental concessions are necessary, conditions of concessions can be fixed by the Executive.In Hayti foreigners in. order to engage in industry must obtain a licence. This is usually accorded but may be withheld for specific reasons. The Commercial Tax paid by foreigners engaged in industry is double that paid by nationals.In Holland there is no differentiation by law between aliens and nationals, but at the same time modifications of the principle of equality are to be found, for instance, in the contracts made by the Dutch Government with the Dutch Lloyd and with the . Cie. de Navigation Java-Chine-Japon.In Japan the treatment of aliens is governed by treaty.  &quot;Under existing treaties industries are not exempted from regulation by Japanese law.     (By the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1911 most-favoured-nation treatment is only conceded in regard i   to,the prosecution of industries.)In Mexico the tendency of legislation, which is arbitrary and spasmodic; is to compel any foreigners who obtain any interest in the country to renounce their right to appeal for support in so far as those interests are concerned, to the governments of their own countries. - .   .&apos;In Paraguay although no restrictions or disabilities are placed on foreigners as such, there is a tendency to make laws affecting properties and. industries held mainly or exclusively by foreigners whereby the latter in practice become subject to the pay-ment of special taxes.* It should be noted, however, that foreigners incur very slight disabilities in these countries.
In Sweden the general rule is that the right of aliens to carry on trade, industry, handi-,crafts or other occupations with a view to commercial profit is subject to the sanction of the Government.In Switzerland, in the Canton of Uri, domicile is necessary for the conduct of a business.2. Aliens are disqualified in a number of countries from engaging in certain industries and from occupying certain positions.France. There are a few restrictions with regard to certain professions, and foreigners are not allowed to tender for certain Government contracts.   No foreigner can be officer or engineer of a French ship. Greece. No alien can be a master of a Greek ship.Italy. No alien can be a master or captain of an Italian ship, and two-thirds cf tho crew must be Italian.Portugal. Only Portuguese subjects may be Advocates, Solicitors, Medical ,Vf*vnPatent Agents, Custom House Agents. Holland. In spite of the equality of nationals and foreigners before the law there arecertain restrictions applicable rather to naturalised persons than to foreigners.Such restrictions occur in the law relating to stevedores by which at least onedirector or managing director in a Stevedore Company must be a natural bornsubject.Japan. No foreigner may carry on mining operations although a company as being a Japanese juridical subject may do so. 1Switzerland. In Zurich certain restrictions are enforced with regard to spirit distil-leries, salt sellers, public house licences, live stock breeding depots, druggists and apothecaries.   In order to practise a doctor must ha,ve a Swiss medical certificate.II. Laws restricting the oxonership and holding of Real Property by Aliens. (a) Ownership of land.In Chile a few instances of special legislation have shown a tendency to modify the equality which has existed hitherto between the Chilean and the foreigner. Thus, the laws authorising the President to lease land to the Sociedad Explotadora de&apos; Tierra del Fuego and to the Sociecfod Ganadera de Jenta Grande, stipulate that at least 80 per cent, of the shares shall belong to&apos; Chileans. Again, in another law . concerning the sale of land it was stipulated that the purchasers or lessees must either have been born in Chile and married, or head of a iegally constituted family, or have resided in the territory of Magallanes before the date of the auction if they are purchasers, or must have resided for five years in any part of the national territory if renting the land. Also the purchasers or lessees were forbidden to sublet or transfer that ownership or administration of the land during a period of 14 years.In Guatemala subjects of adjoining states cannot acquire unoccupied land on frontier districts and foreigners cannot &quot; denounce &quot; more than 1,650 acres of occupied land. Provision is made for contracts to be given only to Guatemalan citizens, in a decree stating that all petroleum and kindred deposits are Government property.In Hayti foreigners are absolutely debarred by the Constitution of Hayti from acquir-ing or holding real property. In practice the law is evaded by means of mort-gages, in which respect foreigners are not restricted. The revision of the law is now under consideration.In Japan while foreigners may acquire the ownership of real property in the form of buildings, they cannot as individuals own land. A company or partnership organised by foreigners under Japanese law may, however, as a Japanese juridical person, own land.In Norway foreigners or foreign companies cannot acquire or lease real property for more than ten years without Concession, and conditions of concession can be imposed by the Government in the public interest. A Norwegian Company is defined as a Company incorporated in Norway with a Board consisting of only Norwegian citizens and with its domicile in Norway.*Norwegian citizens and foreigners are treated alike at present in being com-pelled to obtain concessions in order to acquire rights over waterfalls of more than 500 h.p. electric energy, but an alteration in the law is under discussion by which nationals would receive more favourable&apos;treatment.Foreigners and foreign companies may not acquire forest land. A Norwegian Company in this connection is defined as a Company whose Directors are all Norwegian citizens with domicile in Norway and whose share capital is Norwegian. In Siam the ownership of real property by foreigners is controlled by Treaty, not bv legislation. Thus British and Danish subjects, French proteges, and French Asiatic subjects alone enjoy the same rights of property as the&apos; natives of Siam. Other foreigners cannot purchase land within four miles from Bangkok without special permission until they have lived in Siam. for ten years. They may, how-ever, buy land or plantations anywhere within a certain distance from Bangkok.* A change in the law is contemplated by which all the share capital would be required to be Norwegian and provision would be made for concessions to be granted with a time limit.
In Sweden aliens may, not without special Royal consent acquire real property (thisis an extension in 1916 of a law of 1892). In the Canton of Berne, Switzerland, ownership of land is reserved to members of theCanton.In the United States in those states which differentiate between Aliens and Nationals in respect of land holding (about 15 States have no restrictions) the right to hold land is made dependent on either citizenship of. the United States (or declared intention to obtain citizenship) or upon residence in a particular State, and the restrictions in most States are applicable to land holdings both by individuals and by industrial corporations. A reservation is made, however, in a few States by which aliens and alien companies are free to, acquire land for the purpose of conducting mining operations. In some States also, aliens are allowed to acquire land by devise or descent, but not by purchase.(b) Mining Rights.In France foreigners can obtain mining concessions but the power, to grant them (as in the case of natives of France) is discretionary. There has, however, recently been a discussion in the Chamber of Deputies about the grant of a petroleum con-cession in Algeria to an English Company, and the question of a new regime with regard&apos;to concessions seems to have been raised.In Holland the law of 1893 allows the transference of a Mining Concession to a limited company provided that the majority of the directors of such a company are of Dutch nationality.In Japan foreigners are not allowed individually to engage in mining, but a foreign company formed under Japanese law as a&apos; Japanese juridical person may enjoy mining rights.In Norway no foreigner and no limited company except such as have a Board of only Norwegian directors with domicile in Norway may prospect or acquire mining rights without concession. Only the Norwegian State and Norwegian Principalities may carry on regular mining work without concession^In Portiigal foreigners may not obtain licences for the exploitation of mineral coal and other combustibles for navigation.In Siam, although there are no legal or Treaty disqualifications in respect of mining concessions to foreigners, mining by foreigners is not always encouraged by the Siamese Government. \In Sweden aliens are prohibited, except by special Royal consent, from working mineral deposits or carrying on mining. The prohibition against the appropria-tion of a mineral deposit is absolute.In Switzerland the Canton of Berne grants national treatment as regards mining con-cessions only to citizens of those States which grant reciprocity to Switzerland in respect of settlement and industrial facilities.III. Laws restricting alien influence in Industrial Companies. /In Denmark any branch established by an alien Company must have an independent management there. This condition is not regarded as fulfilled if persons domiciled abroad have power to sign in the name of the company without reference to the persons domiciled in Denmark.In Greece foreigners cannot be members of the Board of Directors of a Corporation (but they can participate in the administration of Commercial Companies).In Japan aliens are prohibited from holding shares in agricultural and industrial banks, and the Oriental Colonization Joint Stock Co.In Norway foreign companies may not carry on banking business. All the share-holders in a Banking Company must be Norwegian citizens but under special control, a tenth and with Royal permission a third of the share capital may be in foreign hands. *In Sweden aliens are prohibited from holding shares in a Banking Company and in certain Railway Companies; aliens are allowed by the law of 1916 to possess only less than a fifth of the share in a Swedish Company, owning real property or mines; and an alien must obtain a Government licence to become a member of the Board of a joint stock Company or of a registered Society. , In Switzerland by Federal Law the majority of the members on the Board of Adminis-tration of Swiss Railway Companies must be Swiss citizens.In the United Stated very few regulations exist restricting alien interests in industrial companies and these most frequently refer to landholding (see Section II. (a) above). Such regulations usually require one or two directors of a company operating in a particular State to be resident there and, in some States, the head office to be situated there also.Under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution the State cannot impose any burden on commerce with foreign nations among the different States. For domestic business, however, a foreign corporation is required to obtain a licence in a number of States.&apos; Alteration of the law in order to make it more stringent, e.g., by providing that the majority of shareholders should also be Norwegian is understood to be contemplated.
In New York and Pennsylvania attention is paid to the nationality of the incorporators of a company rather than to that of the shareholders. Thus, in New York, two-thirds of the incorporators must he citizens of the United States and one must he a resident in New York; and in Pennsylvania an industrial company must be formed by three persons of whom one must be a native of the State.  -In Washington, foreign companies are prohibited from doing banking busi-ness and in Oregon, foreign Fire Insurance Companies are required to make a deposit.In Indiana, foreign companies are forbidden to encourage immigration of foreign labour or to import it.It is noteworthy that since-the Treaty of 1899 between the United States and Great Britain the right of any State to restrict the freedom of citizens of Great Britain is very doubtful.IV. Laws restricting shareholding in Shipping Companies and ownership of ships by foreigners.In France the &quot; Administration des. Douanes &quot; has the discretionary power to grant or refuse registration of ships belonging to Limited Companies. There are also restrictions preventing foreigners from holding shares in certain shipping companies.In Greece foreigners cannot participate in Greek vessels more than in half shares.In Italy not more than a third part of an Italian ship may be owned by a foreignerunless resident in the Kingdom or unless he has lived there for five years. In Portugal foreigners are not allowed to own vessels or shares in vessels or craft of allkinds belonging to Portuguese ports or sailing under the Portuguese flag. In Sweden a foreigner&apos;s share in a ship must not extend to more than a third of thetonnage of the vessel and he may not be the principal owner.XV.MEMORANDUM ON TRADE ASSOCIATIONS IN GERMANY BY Dr. ERNEST J.SCHUSTER.(Furnished by the Federation of Brit sh Industries.)(1) Introductory Observations.Many Associations have been formed for a variety of purposes within the German Empire consisting of persons, firms and corporate bodies carrying on the same trade or the same industry, either throughout the country or within a defined local area. These purposes may be roughly classified as follows: (1) The furtherance of technical improvements and of legislation assisting the objects of the particular trade or industry; (2) The mutual protection of the members in their negotiations with employees and workmen and the Trade Unions or other Associations representing them; (3) The regulation of output and prices and the restriction of mutual competition.To these must be added a fourth class of objects which are determined by the Imperial Accident Insurance Law. Under that law the insurance against accidents is in the hands of a number of Associations composed of the employers carrying on a particular branch of industry, and formed not only for the purpose of insuring the&apos; persons employed in that branch against accidents happening in the course of their employment, but also for the object of deAdsing means for the prevention of such accidents and for that purpose exercising control over the individual undertakings comprised within the particular association.The survey of objects is by no means exhaustive, but it is not necessary for the purpose of this Memorandum to specify the other classes of objects. *Some Associations are formed for several of the classes of objects which I have mentioned, but the majority work exclusively for one particular object, or a small group of objects, and there may of course be competition and overlapping between several Associations. I mention this fact to show that the distinctions are not so clear cut as they may appear, and that it is almost impos-sible to give an accurate and complete representation of the interaction of the various activities I have mentioned.As most of the complications and legal problems arise in connection with the objects I have enumerated above sub (3) (regulation of output and prices and restriction of mutual competition) and certain cognate matters, I propose to deal exclusively with the Associations formed for these  &apos; objects, either exclusively or in combination with others.(2) Legal Character of Trade Associations.The Associations formed for the objects indicated above are not required to take any parti -cular legal form and as a% matter of actual fact, they assume a great variety of forms. The Association may itself be a trading body, in which case each member covenants with that body to sell the whole of the production permitted to such member to the Association at prices to be -fixed in the agreed manner, and the right of selling belongs to the Association exclusively. On the other hand the Association may simply exist for the purpose of enforcing the arrangements as to production and sale prices agreed upon between the members. The well known Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate is an Association of the first mentioned kind, whilst the Upper Silesian Coal Convention belongs to the, secondly mentioned class.** The production of the Rhenish-Westphalian Association amounts to nearly 60 per cent, of the whole Prussian production, that of the Upper Silesian Convention to about 20 per cent.
* There is no provision in German law analogous to that of s.l of the Companies (Cons.) Act 1908 which prescribes incorporation by specified methods in the case of all associations whose mem1 ers exceed a specified number. There is, moreover, no provision similar to s. 5 of the Trades Union Act 1871 which in the case of any Association coming within the de&apos; nition of a Trade Union contained in s.23 prohibits the more usual methods of incorporation.f Where the Association is not a corporate body, or where in the case of its being a corporate body the restrictions on the members are not embodied in tbe Articles of Association, the relation between the members inter se of tbe relations between the individual members and the incorporated body are deemed to be in the nature o! partnership relations and the rule of s.723 of the German Civil Code is held to be applicable under which a partnership entered upon for an indefinite period of time may be terminated at any time by each partner, while a partnership entered upon for a definite period of time may be terminated by a partner in the event of any other partner committing a breach of any essential stipulation of the partnership agreement. The disregard of the restriction on the part of other members of such an unincorporated Association therefore entitles a member aggrieved thereby to bring about the dissolution (See decisions of tbe Imperial Court in Civil Matters, Vol. 53, p. 19, Vol. 74. p. 33.)A member of a Trade Union or other workmen&apos;s Association may at any time terminate his membership and his obligations towards the Association cannot at any time be enforced by action. (Imperial Trade Regulation Statute, s.152 (2) ). It was at one time contended thai this statutory rule may also be applicable to members of Trade Associations, but the Imperial Court has definitely repudiated this doctrine (See Vol. 38, pp. 160-161).Where the Association is a trading body it must be either incorporated as an &quot; Aktiengesell-schaft &quot; usually described in the abbreviated form &quot; A,G.,&quot; or &quot; Gesellsckaft mit&quot;beschrankter Haftung,&quot; usually described in the abbreviated form &quot; G.m.b.H.,&quot; oras a &quot;Verein&quot; for economic objects (German Civil Code s. 22), or it must be constituted in the form of a Commercial Partner-ship, or a &quot; Commandite Partnership.&quot;* (The form of the A.G. G.m.b.H. is usually chosen in such cases.)Where the Association does not itself carry on any trade it may be constituted and is fre-quently constituted as an unincorporated &quot; Verein,&quot; which has some of the characteristics of a non-commercial partnership (in which the members may limit their liability), but in other respects it is treated as a quasi corporate body.The constitution of an Association for the purposes I have mentioned, whether as a trading body, or as a body intended to secure the observance of the obligation of its members is, according to German law, not deemed to be against public policy or otherwise unlawful; nor does the fact that such an Association is formed for an indefinite time make its constitution unlawful. The last mentioned point was specifically raised in the case of the &quot; Association of Manufacturers of Tiles in the Kingdom of Wurttemberg and the Grand-Duchy of Baden &quot; which had been formed as a &quot; G.m.b.H.&quot; One of the members claimed a&apos;declaration to the effect that the formation of the Association was invalid, or in the alternative that the clauses in the Articles restricting the rights of the members as to the production and the sale of tiles were invalid and could be rescinded as regards any particular member by notice to the Association. The claim was finally dismissed by a judgment of the Supreme Imperial Court at Leipzig dated 7th June, 1910. The Court quotes with approval the statement in the judgment of the Court below to the effect that &quot; the Articles of Association did not impose any unlawful deprivation of liberty on the members, and that all individual provisions were of a nature which were necessarily involved by a &apos; Kartell&apos;; that the restrictions to which the members had submitted with regard to their respective undertakings were only proportionate to the advantages arising by reason of such restrictions. The fact that the members were deprived of the right to terminate their liabilities by notice was in harmony with the essential nature of a G.m.b.H. and was not in itself sufficient to lead to the conclusion that there was an excessive restriction of liberty.&quot; (Decision of the Imperial Court in Civil Matters, Vol. 73, pp. 431 s.s.)t(3) Legal Limits of Restrictions Imposed upon Members.The German opponents of agreements as to output, distribution and sale prices contend that such agreements are not merely &quot; contra bonos mores,&quot; but also that they violate the principle of freedom of trade established by s. 1 of the Imperial Trade Regulation Statute. These views have not found favour with the Courts. The Supreme Imperial Court at Leipzig has repeatedly dealt with these agreements and has always sanctioned them, subject to the observation of certain safe-guards which will be specially referred to below.The judgment of the 4th February, 1897 (Decision in Civil Matters, Vol. 38, p. 155) contains the following full and lucid statement on the subject:&quot; The Appellants have .... in the first place .... contended that the agreement of the 22nd March, 1893, .... was of no legal effect, inasmuch as it was opposed to.the freedom of trade. This objection cannot be regarded as well founded. The Plaintiff Association .... was formed with the object of preventing for the future a detrimental competition between the Manufacturers of Woodpulp in the Kingdom of Saxony, and to enable their products to be sold at higher prices than could be obtained under the influence of unrestricted competition. As regards the question whether an Association formed for any object of this nature is violating the principle of Freedom of Trade established by the Imperial Trade Regulation Statute two points of view have to be considered; in the first place we must ask whether any arrangements between traders having for their object the maintenance of certain minimum prices for their products operate in an unlawful manner against the intention of the Legislature to further the interests of the community by the freedom of trade; and secondly whether the liberty of any individual affected by such an arrangement is restricted in a manner defeating the intention of the Legislature.&quot; &quot;The first question has repeatedly been answered in the affirmative, more particularly outside of Germany (here follow a number of references to books and articles on the subject), but in opposition to these views the following facts have to be taken into consideration.   If in any branch of trade the prices of the products fall too heavily,
443and if thereby the profitable carrying on of such branch of trade is prevented or imperilled the crisis resulting therefrom is not only detrimental to each individual trader, but also to the economic interests of the community, and it is therefore in the interest of the community that the prices in any branch of trade should not for any length of time be so low as to be inadequate .... Hence it cannot be asserted in an unqualified and general manner that it is contrary to the interests of the community, for persons engaged in any particular branch of trade to close up their ranks in order to prevent or moderate mutual underbidding, and the fall in the price of their products which would otherwise result therefrom; if the prices are really so low for any length of time that the persons engaged in the trade are threatened with ruin, then the closing up of their ranks appears not only as a justifiable act of self-preservation, but also as an act furthering the interests of the community. Many authorities have accordingly considered&apos; the formation of &apos; Syndicates&quot; and &apos; Cartels &apos; of the kind in question as a method, which, properly applied, was bound to be of special advantage to the economic well-being of the community, inasmuch as it prevented the losses arising from an unsound over-production and the calamities resulting therefrom (here follow a number of references to books and articles).&quot; &quot;German and other Courts have accordingly held on repeated occasions-that there was no violation of the principle of the freedom of trade from the point of view of the protection of the interest of the community against the selfishness of individuals if persons engaged in a particular branch of trade combined for the purpose of main-taining the vitality of that branch of trade by protecting it against the deprecia-tion of its products and all the disadvantages resulting from the under-bidding of individuals. (Here follow references to reports of German and Italian judgments.) Agreements of the kind in question are therefore open to question ,from the point of view of public interests safeguarded by the freedom of trade, in so far only as in any individual case there are features objectionable on special grounds, more particularly if it is clear that the creation of an actual monopoly and the usurious exploitation of the consumers was intended, or that they were in fact brought about by the stipulations and arrangements actually made . . . . &quot; &quot; As regards the second of the questions referred to above, the provisions of the Imperial Trade Regulation Statute, under which each individual is entitled to carry on any , trade he may choose, except iii so far as any existing law prescribes or admits ofexceptions or restrictions, is not to be taken as meaning that an individual may not by contract undertake any obligation as to whether, where or how he is to carry on any particular trade. This Court has persistently held that this is not the meaning of s. 1 of the said Statute, having always been of opinion that stipulations &apos; in restraint of competition &apos; may be validly entered into, subject to the limitation that though the earning capacity of an individual may be restricted, it ought not to be destroyed for all time, either entirely or in particular directions.&quot; (Here follow references.)This decision and others to the same effect have been consistently followed notwithstanding the fact that they were arrived at under the old law, which was displaced by the German Civil Code. The attempt to declare arrangements of the kind referred to unlawful by reference to some of the provisions of the new Code have always been repudiated by the Imperial Court (see for instance Vol. 56 on p. 274).The statement to the effect that an agreement for the regulation of output and prices of the nature referred to becomes unlawful if it creates an actual monopoly or facilitates &quot; the usurious exploitation of the consumers &quot; does not exhaustively deal with the stipulations which may be declared invalid on the ground of being opposed to the public interest. Thus an arrangement involving a breach of contractual duty towards others on the part of the members of a Trade Association would not be upheld by the Courts. This principle formed the ground of a judgment of the Superior Imperial Court, dated 24th&quot;April, 1912 (Vol. 79, p. 279). This judgment dealt with the arrangements of a Brewers&apos; Association the members of which had agreed not to sell beer to publicans and retail dealers, except at certain minimum prices and subject to certain conditions and without regard to any subsisting contracts, and the Association had agreed to indemnify any individual member against all claims of third parties in respect of breaches of any subsisting contract. The Court held that an agreement by which a party bound itself to disregard his obligations towards third parties was &quot; contra bonos mores &quot; and could not be upheld.The fact that some stipulation entered into between the members of a Trade Association is void on the ground of being against public policy does not necessarily invalidate the existence of the Association, even though it is embodied in the Articles of Association. Thus in the case of the Tile Manufacturers Association referred to above, the Articles contained a clause by which the members referred all disputes to the exclusive decision of the Board of Supervision or of a Com-mittee appointed by that Board. This clause was held to be invalid, but it was held that its invalidity did not affect the validity of the Association (Vol. 73, p. 431).*(4) Enforcement of Agreements.There is no general rule of German law similar to the rule contained in s. 4 of the Trade Union Act, 1874, which prevents the Courts from entertaining &quot; any legal proceeding instituted with the object of directly enforcing or recovering damages for the breach of ... . any agree-* The same rule applies in English law (see Osborne v. Amalgamated Society 1911 1 Ch. 540, 552.)
ment between tbe members of a trade union as snch concerning tbe conditions on which any member .... shall or shall not sell their goods, transact business, or be employed.&quot;*There seems, however, to be some doubt as to the manner in which the covenants of members of Trade Associations can be enforced.There seems to be no question that the Association may sue a member who has failed to observe the restrictions imposed upon him for payment of the agreed penalties, but there seems to be a doubt whether an injunction may be obtained restraining a member from committing breaches in the future.   (Decision of the Imperial Court in Civil Matters, Vol. 38, pp. 158-161.)A member of an Association who sells the undertaking in respect of which he became a member of such an Association remains liable to the Association unless he is released by special agreement. It is for him to see that the purchaser is substituted as a member in his place. (See the judgment of the Supreme Imperial Court of the 19th February,. 1901; Decisions in Civil Matters, Vol. 48. p. 305, ss., particularly p. 315.)(5) Rights of Traders remaining outside of their Trade Association.The question as to how far the actions of an Association, representing the interests of a particular trade, may go in hampering the business of outsiders carrying on the same trade has been frequently.before the German Courts. The following two cases, which came before the Supreme Imperial Court, indicate the limits of the pressure allowed to be put on outsiders.The German Booksellers&apos; Association, one of the oldest and most powerful German Trade Associations, had induced a large number of publishers to give an undertaking that they would not sell books to any bookseller who did not observe the regulations as to the limits of discount to be allowed to customers, or that they would not allow to them the full discount usually allowed by publishers to booksellers. One of the booksellers affected by this proceeding brought an action to restrain the Association, on the ground that the proceeding was in the nature of a tortious act. The Court held that a condition imposed upon the publishers compelling them to refuse all discount to a. particular bookseller, would be in the nature of a tortious act, and would have entitled the Plaintiff to an injunction, but as long as the discount allowed enabled the bookseller to carry on his business, though at a reduced profit, the measures taken by the Association were a legitimate . method of protecting the interests of the booksellers&apos; trade. (Judgment of 14th December, 1902, Vol. 56, p. 271.)The second case is of special interest because it is one of the rare German instances of colla-boration between a Traders&apos; Association and a Wor.kmen&apos;s Association. The German Gold-beaters had formed an Association which in its turn had entered into arrangements with the Metal-workers&apos; Trade Union. By these arrangements the Gold-beaters&apos; Association bound itself only to admit such members as would conform to the agreed regulations as to wages, working hours, &amp;c. The Plaintiffs had previously refused to conform to the conditions of the Metal-workers Trade Union, and had been bovcotted by the workmen. They had, however, subsequently declared their readiness to accept the conditions and claimed admittance as members of the Gold-beaters&apos; Association. This could not be clone as the Metal-workers&apos; Trade Union, notwithstanding this offer, continued the boycott. It was, however, proved by the evidence that this continuance of the boycott had been brought about by the Gold-beaters&apos; Association who simply wished to eliminate the Plaintiffs&apos; competition.The Court held that the non-admittance to membership, was not in itself a tortious act, but that the fact of inducing the workmen to continue the boycott, and thereby preventing the Plaintiffs from carrying on their trade, gave them a good cause of action. As regards the general right to refuse admittance the judgment contains the following passage:&quot; If a number of traders form an Association in order to benefit the persons joining it by measures to be taken for that purposes, it is not an act &apos; contra bonos mores,&apos; to refuse membership to one or more traders carrying on the same kind of business and thereby to prevent their participation in the advantages of the membership: this rule holds good even if the refusal of admittance results in material damage to the trade of the rejected candidate.&quot; (Judgment of 2nd Februarv, 1905. Vol. 60. p. 94).(6) Results of German Government Inquiry.&apos; The German Trade Associations began to gain importance in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and the widely expressed fear of the creation of monopolies and oppression induced the Imperial Government to institute an inquiry of which the-results were published in 4 parts, which were successively submitted to the Reichstag between 1905 and 1908.t The enquiry excluded Artizans&apos; Associations, Agricultural Associations, and Associations formed merely for the purpose of fixing conditions as to payment and delivery. Among the 385 Associations included in the inquiry, 19 belonged to the coal industry, 62 to the iron industry, 46 to the chemical industry, 27 to the stone and earth industry (cement, chalk, &amp;c.); 132 Associations had been formed by the manufacturers of tiles. One volume of the report deals specially with the Coal Syndicates, which absorb nearly all undertakings engaged in the production of coal, coke, and briquets or of bye-products like tar, benzole and ammonia.* As to the application of this section in the case of an Association of Tea Warehousekeepers see Chamberlain&apos;s Wharf v. Smith-1900-2 Ck 605.t Their contents are summarised by Mr. Lusenskv in the &quot; Deutsche Juristenzeitung &quot; Vol XII., pp. 1042-1047 ; Vol. XIV., pp. 347-352.
The German Government have not made any proposals as to legislative action, nor has there been any persistent demand for such action in any quarter. It is felt that owing to the great diversity in the form of the constitution of &apos;the Associations in question any attempt to impose statutory limits on their activities would produce serious difficulties and complications, whilst on the other hand it would be almost impossible to compel these Associations to bring their constitu-tion within any stereotyped form.(7) Concluding Observations.A comparison of the German legal rules affecting Trade Associations with those prevailing in this country shows that, as regards the limits within which restraint on trade is permissible, the principles applied are nearly the same in both countries. The judgments in the cases of Att.-Gen. v. Adelaide Steamship Company 1913 A.C. 781, and Salt (N.W.) Company v. Electrolytic Company 1914 A.C. 461, contain passages which seem to be almost literally identical with passages in judgments of the German Imperial Court on the same subject. The real difference between the laws of the two countries as regards Trade Associations arises through the prohibition of the enforcement of certain kinds of agreement contained in s. 4 of the Trade. Union Act, 1871, and the 2&quot;)rovisions of s. 5 of the same Act which hampers the formation of a Trade Association coming within the definition.of a Trade Union contained in s. 23. The greater freedom of the German law in both respects has no doubt materially.helped the growth of these Associations.It will be remembered that, as stated in my introductory observations, I have only dealt with Associations formed for the purpose of making common arrangements as to output, distri-bution and prices, and that I have excluded those formed for other objects, as for instance researches as to improved methods or extension of markets, negotiations or co-operation with Workmen&apos;s Associations, precaution against accidents, &amp;c. The fact that in Germany different forms of Associations are used for these different objects seems to cause much waste of labour and overlapping. Associations of undertakings engaged in the same branch of industry or trade combining all these activities could, in my opinion, work with much greater efficiency in all directions, but in a country like Germany such Associations would probably be obnoxious to the Government authorities as possessing too much power.
