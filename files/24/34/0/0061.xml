(This Document is the Property of    3His Britannic Na]e?*y&apos;8 Government).^flr^^^lpLY OF MILK FOR YOUNG OHILDRBIT AND MOTHERS.ffij     MEMORANDUM OF TEE FOOD CONTROLLER./     - &apos; &apos;   &apos; 1 -       ^.       ^* - m -m. -       warn - -       -        - -I.TV-^^Brioe of milk is now 8d. a quart in London and 7jd in many large industrial areas.     I am not responsible for this rise in the cost of an essential food for young children, since the price to be paid to producers was agreed by the Cabinet before I undertook the Office of Food Controller.   Representations have reached me from many quarters that young children of the poorer classes are likely to&apos;suffer severely during the coming winter owing to the inability of their parents to provide them with milk at the present high rates. Other foods on which children largely depend., such as sugar, Jam and butter, are scarce, and have doubled in cost since war broke out. .2*   The probable necessity for rationing the general population makes it essential that sufficient supplies of milk, a food which is necessary for children but not for adults, should be earmarked for the children and obtainable by them at a reasonable price.   Provision for securing these ends is3 in my opinion, the most effective means of counteracting the malnutrition among young children which is almost certain to arise if the shortage in staplo foods becomes more aeute * /30   The two essentials of the problem are;-(i) priority in the supply of milk to all children.(ii) a reduction in price of milk as supplied in caseswhere considerations of health makes this desirable.Ity 4.   It is proposed that in any scheme of rationing milk a prior claim for children, invalids, expectant mothers, and certain classes of munition workers on the milk supply shall be recognised.   This may involve some curtailment cf consumption by adults,   The Local Eood ,Committees are already empowered to make arrangements for the delivery of milk in priority to any class of consumers, and instract-ions are being issued to Local Food Committees to secure that machinery is at once set up for the purpose of securing such priority to the classes indicated,
souced ice.5.   It is further proposed, with limitations explained he-low, that milk shall he supplied at the reduced price of 4d. per quart, an average price before the war, throughout the United Kingdom, in the following cases (or in specially necessitous oases on such terms as the Local Authority may determine)(a) expectant mothers in quantities required on grounds of health.(b) Infants in cases where artificial feeding is required on medical grounds, quantities up to If pints a day.(c) Children from 9 months to 18 months, 1% pints.(d) Children from l  to 3 years, 1 pint.(e) Children from 3 to 5 years, quantities up to 1 pint that may be authorised by the Local Authority after consultation with the Local Food Control Committee.tribution   6.   In each locality the Local Authority should be ultimatelyCards.responsible for the selection of familes to whom cheap milk should be supplied.   The choice of methods would necessarily vary-according to local conditions, and would be left to the Local Authority.     It is my intention that the selection should net be based directly on the financial circumstances of the parents, but that milk should be supplied at the reduced price(a) on grounds of health,and(b) on conditions that would ensure that the health of the child was benefiting to the full extent by the milk supplies by stip-ulating. for example, for:-(i) periodical attendance of the child at an inhant welfare centre.or(ii) periodical visits to the home by the health visitor or other accredited person.Ordinarily application for cheap milk would be made, subject to any arrangements made by the Medical Officer of Health through:-(a) a recognised Infant Welfare or Maternity Centre.(b) a Health Visitor.(c) a n^-Lotilcaro committee (for children under 5 inaotte7ii&apos;u&apos;.nee at school),or other authorised organisation.
7. The Local -Food Control Committee would see that milk in the required quantities is supplied either(i) direct at the centre or the schoolor(ii) by special milk depots established by the Committee for the purpose, or by one or more dairymen undertaking for the Committee the functions of a milk depot,The cheap milk would not be delivered at the home unlessdistance, illness or other circumstances made it necessary, inwhich case arrangements for the purpose would be made by theLocal Food Control Committee.8.   I suggest that the cost of reduction in price should be divided equally between the Ministry. .of Food and the Local Kates9.   I am advised that the necessary po?/ors can be secured by an Order issued by me, with the concurrence of the Local Government Board, under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.10. On the advice of the Local Government Board, I suggest that the Local Authorities to carry out the scheme should be the existing Health   Authorities, viz Tov/n Councils, Urban District Councils and Rural District Councils and to Londonthe Borough Councils, rn SOme cases it may be desirable to melee the County Council the authority.11. It is open for consideration whether the adoption by l^cal Authorities of the Scheme is to be(a) compulsoryor(b) optionalor(c) compulsory except in cases where the Local Authority after considering the views of the Food Control Committees concerned and the Medical Officer of Health, are satisfied that no special arrangements for children within their area are necessary,
and b    12. Where a Scottish Local Authority has already prepared aland. . ,scheme under the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915,which is approved hy the Local Government Board for Scotland,no separate action will be taken by the Local Pood Committeeexcept to arrange fpr a priority supply of milk.     It may bedesirable to extend to Scotland the operation of any order thatmay be issued in order to secure for Local Authorities widerpowers in the distribution of cheap milk.     In Ireland specialarrangements will have to be made.     The Irish Pood Control&apos;Committee.-- already have the matter under conside^tion and havestrongly urged the provision of cheaper milk for infants.13, It is difficult to estimate what proportion of mothers would apply to Infant Welfare Centres and Public Health Visitors for a certificate to enable them to obtain cheap milk for themselves or their children, but the fact of having to make each application, and the obligation to fetch the milk will certainly deter large sections of the population from availing themselves of the proposed facilities.     The proportion would probably be heavy in industrial areas and low in residential districts and throughout the rural districts of Great Britain, .The estimated cost of the required rebate if the adoption of the new powers is not made universal and compulsory is  2,200,000 of which there would fall on the Exchequer  1,100,000.This estimate allows for the adoption of the scheme by 75 per cent of urban and of 50 per cent of rural authorities throughout the.United Kingdom, and is based on the assumption that application may be made on behalf of 50 per cent of the child population.   Deductions are made for the saving by the use of Glaxo and the elimination of the cost of delivery.PiHONDDAcINISTRY OP POOD, vtb December, 1917.
