J T--.3 Document isjhe property of 1SECRET. His-Flntanpic Majesty?s Government)/    A[3&apos;L^xX     MINISTKY   OF   FOOD.Bi&amp;pdrt for Week ending Wednesday, November 28, 1917.PART I ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Purchases. Lord Rhondda lias cabled to Mr. Hoover expressing&apos; his anxiety concerning the statement that total exportable wheat surplus from United States and Canada will not exceed 133,000,000 bushels and pointing out that unless the Allies can rely upon North American exports considerably in excess of these figures and upon a larger amount of grain than is now being allocated we shall be confronted with a situation of extreme gravity. Mr. Hoover has replied that the only solution of the wheat, situation lies in the importation of Australian, Indian, and Argentine supplies and in the insistence of all Food Controllers on the imperative necessity of priority tonnage for this purpose. He adds that while every effort is being made to reduce consumption he cannot contemplate increased supply unless provision is made for replacement from Argentine at a later date.Mr. Owen Smith cables that he has been refused permission to ask for quotations for 11,000,000 tins of pork and beans required by the army for December shipment pending the receipt of information from Great Britain regarding the release of pig tin. The Ministry had already made representations to the Foreign Office and other bodies concerned on this point.Mr. Hoover has set up a department in the United States Food Administration designated the &quot; Division of Co-ordination of Purchase,&quot; and a packers&apos; committee lias been constituted to work with this body which will deal with the purchase of fresh meat and packing-house products by the United States Army, Navy, and other United States Government departments, the American Red Cross, and by Great Britain, France. Italy, Russia, Belgium, and other Allies. The scope of this body will probably be extended to cover practically all the foodstuffs required for export. On or before the fifteenth of each month the Allied Commission must furnish to the newly created division a statement showing the actual requirements which each Ally is ready to purchase for shipment during the following calendar month, as well as a statement showing the estimated requirements for the five calendar months succeeding the month for which the actual requirements are shown. The actual requirements will be allotted among the packing houses by the packers&apos; committee and contracts will be made by each Ally with the packers, as at present. All parties interested will attend a conference on or about the 25th of each month, when prices that are &quot;fair and just&quot; for purchase during the following month will be ascertained. Steps are being taken to control the prices of the products by limitation of packers&apos; prices and of the prices which they will pay farmers for hogs. Mr. Owen Smith points out that under these regulations both finance and shipping facilities must be provided by the respective Governments in advance, and that unless better arrangements are made with the Treasury there will be grave risk of the Allied Commission being unable to fulfil any British buying orders.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. The Ministry has not yet succeeded in obtaining further credits in the United States, and no purchases of bacon, hams, and lard have been made since the 10th November. The War Office has been informed of the very serious situation which has been created by the stoppage of purchases. If purchases can be resumed at once the requirements of the Army up to the 31st December can be met in full by reducing civilian supplies to 50 per cent, of the quantity needed, but unless funds are provided immediately packers in the United States will cease to cut for the British market, in which case it will take seven weeks for an order to be executed. It will, accordingly, be necessary in that event to take all bacon arriving from North America for Army requirements and cut off the civilian supply completely  a course which is likely to lead to serious unrest among miners and munition workers.k   (33)4299-5   Pk 1   70   12/17   e &amp; s a
The Bacon, Earns, and Lard (Distribution) Order, 1917, dated November 24th, empowers the Food Controller to prescribe forms of application, and to issue direc-tions relating to the distribution and disposal and use of bacon, hams, aud lard.Batter and Cheese. Representative!? of the Ministry of Food have visited Ireland in order to discuss with the Food Control Committee for Ireland and other represen-tative persons the details of application of the Butter Distribution Scheme in that country. It is hoped to make a statement as to the successful result of this mission shortly.Cereals. The date on which the reduced prices of Oat Products become effective has been deferred to 31st December, 1917.The following regulations have been prescribed with respect to the sale and use of imported flour :  (1) Imported flour may not be sold by retail or used for any purpose except when mixed with flour milled and mixed in the United Kingdom in accordance with Orders and directions of the Food Controller.(2) The proportion of imported flour in the mixture must not exceed 25 per cent, in England and Wales and in Ireland. In Scotland the proportion must not exceed 25 per cent, for flour used for the manufacture of biscuits intended for wholesale sale, and must not exceed 50 per cent, for flour sold by retail or used for some other purpose.The maximum prices permissible on the retail sale of flour containing imported flour are the same as those applicable to wholemeal and G.R. flour.Coffee and Cocoa. An Order regulating the retail price of coffee has been drafted, and the question of fixing prices for cocoa is under examination.Dried Fruits. As the result of the interview with M. Venizelos, it has been agreed to raise the purchase price for currants to 49s. per cwt. f.o.b. Patras, as against the 52s. per cwt. asked for by the Greeks. M. Burlumi has, accordingly&apos;, been instructed to purchase 5,000 tons of currants at the above price.The Foreign Office has received assurances that there is every prospect of the proposed commercial agreement with Spain being completed. Mr. Rowley is, there-fore, remaining in Spain, with a view to purchasing the 6,000 tons of raisins provided for in the agreement.No purchases have been made in America, owing to the inability of the Treasury to provide credits.A cargo of 4,360 tons of dates, purchased by us in Basra, has left for this country.Feeding Stuffs. The Committee of technical experts and representative feeders of dairy and other stock has decided that the priority ration for dairy cattle should be 6 lbs. per diem of concentrated feeding stuffs, cows in urban districts being allowed special consideration. It was not considered practicable to give priority to anv other class of stock.Fish. Arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Shipping for securing carriers in order to ship herrings from Stornoway to the United Kingdom during the coming season. The existing arrangements had broken down for lack of boats. The Stornoway catch last year amounted to 13,000 tons, and it is hoped that a considerably quantity will reach the market without preservative.Jam. At the request of the Local Food Committee 5 tons of jam have been despatched to Coventry. This town apparently had no jam at all. Arrangements are being made which will enable this branch to rectify scarcitj&apos; within 48 hours, provided transport facilities are available.The price of honey has advanced three-fold since the beginning of war, and it is considered that control may become necessary.Meat.  The Food Controller has made an Order providing for the registration and licensing of persons engaged in the cattle and meat trade. Retail meat traders must apply to their Local Food Office before 17th December, 1917, for a certificate of registration, which will be issued before loth January, 1918. Keepers of slaughter-houses, and Live Stock Auctioneers and Cattle Dealers must apply to the Local Food Office and the Live Stock Commissioner respectively before 3rd December, 1917, and these will be issued before 1st January, 1918.   There are also provisions in the Order
A meeting was held in the House of Commons attended by a large deputation representing the Lancashire Cotton Operators. The deputation attended to discuss with Lancashire members the situation arising from the shortage of cotton. The difficulties of the cotton operators were emphasized in relation to the fact that they have had comparatively little advance in wages with which to meet the high cost of living.Mr. Snowden, M.P , among other things, alleged that the effect of the policy of the Food Ministry had been only to increase prices and reduce supplies. Mr. Clynes attended the meeting and disproved these statements. He outlined the policy of the Ministry and showed that whilst it was inevitable that regulations and orders should temporarily interrupt supplies and cause some dislocation, the steps taken had given considerable relief to the working classes. The meeting showed its appreciation of the statements made on behalf of the Ministry.Sugar Distribution Scheme.The following arrangements have been instituted :  (1) Any person who has either never been registered on a household sugar card or who has been so registered, but has since ceased to be a member of that household, must obtain an application form from a Post Office between November 26th and December 15th, On receiving this form duly completed the Ministry of Food will forward to the applicant a ration paper, upon periodical presentation of which eight sugar coupons available for the purchase of sugar for a period of eight weeks will be obtainable at any Post Office. The Post Office will date-stamp the ration paper showing the period for which it has been honoured.These coupons will be available at any retailer&apos;s in any locality.(2) Those persons who were originally registered on a household sugar card, but have since left the household, would therefore be twice registered unless further steps are taken, and it is necessary to ensure that double supplies shall not be drawn by or in respect of such persons.To this end every person who was registered on a household sugar card, and is still a member of that household, must obtain as soon as possible after December 8th from his retailer a declaration form. On filling this up he will receive from his retailer a sugar ticket, which must be presented whenever sugar is being purchased.as to tlie keeping of records and the making of returns by all holders of certificates and licences, and as to the revocation of the same.Oils and Fats.-No decision with regard to the definite allocation of freight space for oil seeds, oils and fats has been reached.The total quantity of oil seeds (reduced to oil equivalent) and oils and fats imported during the first ten months of this year, after deduction of exports, amounted to 338,000 tons as against 541,000 tons for the same period, last year.For October alone the quantity available for home consumption was 30,000 tons against 40,000 tons last year.Sugar. The Commission is now receiving reports from its representatives on the International Sugar Committee in America. These indicate that considerable difficulty has been experienced in settling the conditions in respect of the purchase by the Committee of the Cuban crop ; but an agreement has now been executed and the price fixed at 4*60 cents per lb. f.o.b. in Cuba.Tea. Arrangements for the purchase by the Ministry of Indian and Ceylon tea are now practically completed, so far as companies with headquarters in London are concerned, and the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Ceylon have been asked by cable to make similar arrangements with companies having their headquarters in those countries. They have also been asked, on completion of the arrangements, to prohibit the export of all tea on private account to the United Kingdom. The scheme of purchase provides for all tea shipped by producers subsequently to the 31st October being taken over by the Food Controller.
The sugar ticket is also adapted for use upon removal. It can be presented at any Post Office, and in exchange a ration paper and coupons for the ensuing eight weeks will be supplied to the applicant, who wall thereupon come under the procedure described in paragraph (1).It is not correct, as has been said in some quarters, that the household sugar card system has been abandoned. The form of procedure under (1) will apply only to a small part of the population. As regards the remainder, the only material difference is that in such cases, instead of one comprehensive card for each household, individual cards will be supplied which are adapted for use upon removal, with a view to providing a convenient method by which the person who has removed may obtain sugar immediately upon arrival in his new district. It will be understood in this connection that removals of households en bloc form only a very small percentage of the total removals.Enforcement of Orders.The Food Control Committee for Ireland (Powers) Order, 1917, confers on ihe Irish Food Control Committee the power of enforcing in Ireland all Orders heretofore made or hereafter to be made by the Food Controller under the powers conferred unon him by the Defence of the Realm Regulations except such Orders, if any, as the Food Controller may from time to time determine ; and the Committee and such persons as they may designate or appoint for the purpose are authorised to prosecute any offence committed in Ireland against the Defence of the Realm Regula-tions occasioned by any breach of such Order.Complaint has been received that the Local Food Control Committee at Lambeth, on acting on quite vague information, instructed its own inspector to institute on a lady&apos;s premises what proved to be a fruitless search for hoarded food. This illustrates the necessity for confining the power to authorise searches to persons who will be careful not to abuse it.The Battersea Food Control Committee have tendered their resignation as a protest against the refusal of a magistrate to adjudicate on a charge against a local butcher for exhibiting a list of meat prices in excess of those fixed by the Committee. Representations to the Home Office have been made on this point, aud attention has also been called to the inadeqxiate fines inflicted by the same magistrate for proved contraventions of Food Orders.Prosecutions.Bread.-Barnard Nordhaim, baker, of St. George&apos;s in the East, was fined 401. for selling bread which had not beeu made 12 hours. A baker of Tooley Street was fined 51. and 3L 3s. costs for selling a roll of bread weighing more than 2 ozs.Butter. A trader of Swindon was fined 71. 10s., and William Ruddick, of Newcastle, was fined 21., for selling butter at excess prices.Food, Conditions of Sale. Thomas Transby, Multiple Shop, Brighton, was fined 101. and his assistant fined 21. for refusing to serve tea unless a sugar card was deposited. Lipfons, Ltd., was fined 101. 10s, and lOi. 10s. costs for the same offence at West Ham Police Court on November 22nd.Jam Prices Order. William Warmington, of Battersea, was fined 11. and 11. Is. costs for selling jam at excess prices. Frederick Henry Karry was fined 21. and 10s. 6d. costs at the S.W. Police Court for the same offence.Meat Maximum Prices Order. On November 21st a Finchley butcher was fined 30L, his manager 51., and his assistant manager 57-., at the Highgate Police Court for selling imported meat beyond the maximum prices. George Lewis was fined 50L at the Glamorgan Police Court for selling meat above the maximum price by giving short weight.A Surbiton butcher was fined 71. 12s. on November 22nd for failing to send the Local Food Control Committee a copy of the price list of meat sold at his shop.Milk Prices Order.-John G. Potts and John G. Vert were fined SOI. and 40/. respectively-21. for each offence at the North Shields Police Court on November 23rd for selling milk wholesale at a price exceeding the maximum.
PART : II. SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.Imports.The aggregate weight.of imported foods has again fallen and was only 121,000 tons last week (Table A). The average for the four weeks ended November 24th was 142,000 tons and for the previous four weeks 145,000 tons. To preserve the standard of living of the year 1916, it is estimated that about 185,000 tons weekly is required.Wheat and flour have improved, though still below requirements, but other cereals (including rice) have diminished, so that of cereals all together the importation was 82,300 tons as compared with 80,300 tons in the previous week.The imports of all kinds of meat and bacon have fallen off. Butter and margarine were at nearly the same level as the previous week, namely, 1,783 tons when taken together.In. tea and sugar there was a decrease, 1,000 tons of tea and 11,200 tons of sugar being received.The only marked improvement was in cheese of which 9,600 tons arrived, the greatest amount in any week during the last six months.Consumption.Meat. The supply of meat (home-fed and foreign) at four principal markets in the week ending November 17th, was 8 per cent, greater than in the previous week, equal to the average of October 1917, but 14 per cent, less than in the corre-sponding week last year (Table B). Home-fed meat, however, is 8 per cent, greater than in the corresponding week of last year. As compared with the previous week there was an increase of 6 per cent, in home-fed and 131- Per cent, in foreign meat.The supply of fat cattle in 59 markets in the week ending November 21st was 10 per cent, above last week, 12-J- per cent, above the corresponding week last year, but.2 per cent, below the average of October 1917.The supply of fat sheep fell 3 per cent, from that of the previous week and was lower than in any of the preceding nine weeks. It was, however, 27 per cent, higher than in the corresponding week last year.The supply of fat pigs has fallen off greatly and was less than half that of any of the first three weeks of November 1916.A preliminary return from slaughter-houses for October (Table D) covering less than half of those received for September, indicates a greater increase in the animals slaughtered when October 1917 is compared with October 1916 than is shown in the tables relating to Live Stock and Dead Meat Markets (Tables B and C).Bread and Flour. The completed Bakers&apos; and Retailers&apos; returns for the use and sale of Hour in the four- weeks ended November 10th (Table E) confirm in every detail the preliminary figures given last week. The increase over the previous four weeks is 3 per cent., bread and flour being taken together. The increase for bread alone is 1 * 7 per cent.As compared with the corresponding four weeks of 1916 the increase in bread is. ] &apos; 8 per cent, and in flour 2&apos; 3 per cent. A general comparison of the movements of bread and flour, viewed in the light of the remarks made on the retailers&apos; returns, suggests that during the early summer the purchases of flour fell off owing to the difficulty of baking bread from it in the first period of dilution, that they remained low in anticipation of the reduction of price, and that since September 15th home baking has been carried out to its former extent and that home stocks have been rapidly replenished. It is possible that larger home stocks than usual are now held and that actual consumption has increased not quite so much as the index numbers-suggest.The movement in the various Food Control Divisions is shown in Table L. As compared with last year the Divisions of Newcastle, Leeds, and Nottingham, where home-baking is prevalent, show the greatest increase, and next comes the Cambridge Division. The Scottish and the Welsh Divisions also show an increase. In Lancashire and in the Birmingham Division there has been no change, in London and the Home Counties a perceptible decrease, and in the Reading and Bristol Divisions, a slight, increase.a   4299-5B.

They are using at the rate of about 75,000 tons of flour annually under contracts for the army abroad, and about 112,000 tons annually for other-purposes including the supply of army and navy canteens at home. These figures may be compared with the general use of flour by bakers, &amp;c, for the home population which is about 100,000 tons Aveekly.Biscuit Manufacturers&apos;1 use of Flour.	Consumption.
