d/hs/678^His Britannic JV&apos;.?jesty&apos;s Government.)853xmmKi op blockade ihfohma^ioi2Srd - 29th Ho v. 1917.IPgl, PENIsARK.     She negotiations with the Danish delegates at Washing-ton have come to a standstill on the question of tonnage. Denmark possesses about 850,000 tons dead-weight of steamships over 500 tons gross.     u?he Danish Government desire to retain 515,000 tons dead-weight for national purposes, while the United States Government maintain that 350,000 tons would he a sufficient allowance.     The discrepancy &quot;between the two esti-mates may he partly due to the fact that the Danes are now to receive from the United Kingdom more coal, hy 50,000 tons a month, than was originally arranged.      hey will in consequence need about 250,000 tons dead-weight for their trade with the United Kingdom in coal and agricultural produce.   We are ex-plaining to the United States that the new coal agreement was concluded to save Denmark from &quot;becoming dependent upon German eoal, and is therefore advantageous to the Allies in general.She new negotiations &quot;between the Danish and German Gov-ernments have so far led to no definite result.   She Germans are particularly anxious to obtain hides and edible fats from Denmark,   But they also desire to improve the mark-exchange by exacting higher prices for German coal and   iron;   and they object to the &quot;shameless&quot; prices which they are asked to pay fos Danish bacon, butter and cattle.The Eden Ministry is anxious to improve its relations wi the Allies.       The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who realises that some time must elapse before a general agreement with the Allies can be secured, has sounded Sir E.Howard to ascertain on what terms Sweden would be allowed to import, for her immediate needs, some moderate quantities of maize, fertilisers,mineral oi
coffee and other articles.     Sir S. Howard thinks that it would &quot;be politic to make some concessions of this kind; otherwise M. Eden may fall from power and a pro-German Ministry come into power.     It appears that M. Eden is pre-pared to sanction the chartering of Swedish tonnage to the Allies, in quantities proportionate to the imports which Sweden is allowed to receive from overseas.The Germans have concluded a new coal agreement with Sweden, and have undertaken, as before to deliver E50,000 tons of coal a month;   hut it is unlikely that their actual deliveries of eo$l will reach this figure.   In October they only delivered about 175,000 tons;   and in the preceding ten months they did not once succeed in bringing the monthly deliveries up to BOO,000 tons.   One of the conditions for thei new coal agreement is B Swedish loan of fifteen million kroner to Germany,     The Swedish Government are expecting 4,000 tons of German potatoes, and a private Swedish firm has obtained, at a very high price, a large consignment of German sugar for industrial purposes.g3.   IQRWAY.      The proposals which Dr. lansen submitted, on Oct 16, to the United States War Trade Board have been fully con-sidered in Washington and also by the Blockade Conference in London,     It is expected that the War Trade Board will re-quire Norway to prohibit absolutely the export to Germany \ of fish oil,  and of all metals and minerals, except copper, the export of viiich will continue to be regulated by the Anglo-Norwegian Copper Agreement.     On the other hand the export of fish and fish products to Germany, at the rate of-48,000 tons a year, will be permitted.     On the vhole theseterms are satisfactory, although H.M. Government were in favour of cutting down the exports of fish and fish pro-ducts to  5,000 tons.
It was agreed at the London Conference that the available Eorwggian tonnage should bo divided equally between Great Britain and the United States.     This agreement does not affect; tonnage which was allotted to the Allies before the conclusion of the Anglo-Norwegian Shipping Agreement.jl. jPiTK^ItlBHPS.      Under their new coal agreement with Germany theNetherlands are entitled to 200.000 tons of German and 50,000 tons of Belgian coal a month.     If possible the Germans will increase the deliveries to SO0,000 tons of German and 60,000 tons of Belgian coal.     The minimum quota of German coal for October has already been delivered, and,   the November quota ma^ be larger.     But no Belgian coal has yet arrived.   The Butch refuse to take coal which has been requisitioned from the Belgian collieries;   and the latter decline to sell to the Hetherlande out of their free stocks.   The Dutch have so far only succeeded in importing 30,000 tons of British coal.   The difficulty is that the Germans will not give safe-conducts, for the purposes of this trade, except to paddle steamers;   and the Dutch find a difficulty in obtaining vessels   of this kind.M. London has asked us to assist him in proving that the sand and gravel which have be n despatched from the lether-lands to the occupied territories in France and Bgigitim are be-ing used for military purposes.The I.Q.T. maintain that they cannot posaibly arrange for the total cessation of the free imports of Dutch Colonial produce after the Hew Year;   and they are asking us to modify our decision on this point.SVITZSR.UA1B).      &apos;j?he Federal Government estimate that Switzerland re-I quires  50,000 tons of coal a month, even on the present reducedscale of consumption.     The Germans have promised 200,000 tons
a month; hut their average monthly deliveries in August, September and October were only 170.000 tons.The existing stocks of cereals in Switzerland will be exhausted by the end of March, and the harvest of 1918 will not be available until November.     To feed the population in the intervening seven months, at least  40,000 tons of breaa-corn will be required.     Austria, has offered maize and other cereals from Eoumania.   But the federal Government apprehend that any offer made by the Central Empires will be saddled with onerous and embarrassing conditions.     It is proposed that Switzerland should purchase and charter, with our sanction a number of enemy ships which are lying at Flume and in Spanish and Dutch East Indian ports, in order that she may import grain from overseas.   H.H. Government are prepared to recognise these transactions, prorided that the enemy owners do not receive excessive sums for the ships thus bought or chartered, and that the Federal Government will pay the Allies a handsome royalty (100 francs per gross ton per month) for their complaisance.ABGEHTIHE GRAM.       The Argentine Government have now formulated their proposals for the sale of the exportable surplus of cereals to France and Great Britain.   They are prepared to authorise the purchase mt by the French and British Governments of a maximum of 2,500,000 tons.    The quantities purchased are to be exported before Iov.1. 1918.     Tonnage for the purpose is to be provided by the United States,  France and Great Britain.   The Argentine Government will give the purchasers a credit of forty million sterling.   The whole of &quot;the debt, with interest, is to be paid within two years of the signing of the Agreement.The French and British Governments are anxious to secure
895.the whole of the Argentine wheat available for export;they have accordingly asked the Argentine Government to requisition the whole, and to undertake that none shall bo exported to any other countries except with their consent.    The Argentine Government demur to these conditions, and for the moment there is a deadlock in the negotiations.     Sir R. Tower thinks that we should be well advised to make a final and definite offer, for rejection or acceptance.of their scheme, that the United States, France and Britain shall provide seal for Argentine requirements.   This will be no easy matter, unless the United States are prepared to find the coal.IDjjB 0AKP.4IGI.
