SJDOCUKKHT IS THE. PHOPEF.TY OE HIS II ITAIBTIC KAJDSTY &apos; S GQVEriTBDBT)WAR . CiiDTLET.(Memorandum by Chief Secretary for Ireland)During my visit to Dublin at the end of the past weeh, I was able to ascertain more definitely than before the position with regard to the drilling of Sinn Eein volunteers in the Irish provinces.    The movement does not appear likely to spread through the country, but is becoming a definite and continuous cause of trouble in Clare, part of Limerick, part of Tipperary, part of Cork,  and Kerry.    It is not thought by the G.O.C. (Sir Bryan Hahon) or the Inspector General (Brigadier General Byrne) to have serious military significance.    It does, however, keep the counties concerned in a restless and disturbed condition, and it renders the duties of the Constabulary in some districts exceedingly difficult.    Shot guns are being occasionally produced by individual men in connection with drilling.    The Leaders of the movement by their systematic defiance of authority stir up large numbers of young men to open expression of hostility and contempt against the police, who in their scattered and isolated posts in certain districts are apprehensive of what may befall them in case a local rising should occur, before the necessary force to.repulse such an outbreak could be brought into operation.     These unsettled conditions in various areas in the counties I have mentioned appear to necessitate repressive action.Decent efforts of the military and police toward enforcement of the Defence of the lie aim regulations against drilling have failed of effect since   the   general   resortC JB :E T 2845
of prisoners arrested under these Regulations to the hunger strike.    The prison authorities show no resource in dealing wi th the difficulty.   I think they have he en Intimidated hy the turmoil which followed the death of Thomas Ache,    It is necessary to consider the situation in the light of these facts.Two alternatives seem to he open; either to imprison convicted offenders in Ireland and after public warning that such a course will be taken,   to keep them in prison although they starve themselves,  or to transfer such offenders to an English prison or place of internment and in case any of them have to be released for reasons of health to prohibit their return to Ireland.    Sir Eryan Manon would concur in either course.    The Inspector General cf the Royal Irish Con-stabulary believes the death of a prisoner in prison from starvation while undergoing imprisonment in Ireland for drilling would probably have a serious effect in the country, I expect that either course will have good effects,  and believe transfer to England will have fewer risks than im-prisonment with a determination to let the prisoners starve if they think fit,I have discussed procedure with Sir Bryan Mahon,  and agree with him that,  in case arrests are necessary in cense-quence of the persistence of drilling,  they should be (by limiting them to leaders)as few as possible as rapidly effected and disposed of as possible, and that after prompt trial men convicted and sentenced to imprisonment should be removed to an English prison or prisons.    In case of trial by court martial this can be done by direction of the local Commander-in*Chief.   Numerous prisoners who have subjected
themselves to temporary starvation in prison&quot;, at large in Ireland, under license.     Some of them are already giving trouble.      These in case of re-arrest should be removed out of the country for the time.Under powers contained in the Army Act a prison for offenders sentenced by court martial can be appointed by military authority.      In view of the clamoua.- there is for treatment of the prisoners in question in the same way as prisoners of war.  it may bo wor.hr while   to consider whether the power of the military authority might not be exercised in a way which would remove the difficulties which have been caused by past endeavours to treat those men as more criminals.Since the decision of the War Cabinet seven cr eight weeks ago, which author:red tho transfer of insubordinate prisoners from Ireland to England I have had various communications mirth the military authorities and the Home Office,  but as yet without any definite result.      The matter may become very urgent and I shall be glad to have authority to proceed, and to secure the effective co-operation of the prison authorities in Englands(Signed)      Eh Ei ieee.3rd December., 1917.
