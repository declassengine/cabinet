COMMITTEE   ON   THE   PKODUGTION   AND DISTEIBUTION  OF  MILK.1. This Committee issued a first Interim Report (Cd. 8608), dated June 8th, 1917, wherein they dealt, in the main, with the disposal of surplus summer milk; with the utilisation of milk so as to preserve to the nation the maximum amount of food constituents obtainable; with the relation that the retail price of milk ought to hear to&apos;the prices of milk products, beef and feeding stuffs and with farm labour.2.   The Committee are glad to learn that, generally speaking, effect has been given to their recommendations.I.-Causes of Possible Milk Shortage. ........3.   Since issuing the first Interim Report, the Committee have been in ^contact with the development of administrative action affecting milk and milk products.   They have also tried tt . ascertain whether the fear of a serious shortage of milk during the coming winter was justified, and, if so, what steps should be taken to alleviate the serious position which might arise.They obtained the views of many persons, and had the opportunity of examining all data in the possession of the Departments concerned, which enabled them to consider the following among other possible causes which might prejudice the future milk supply:  (1) An excessive slaughter of milch cows for beef.(2) A reduction in the number of in-calf cows and of heifers.(3) The effect of guaranteed prices for cereals.(4) The.breaking up of a large acreage of grass land.(5) The lack of dairy farm labour.(6) A shortage of home-grown feeding stuffs.(7) The shortage and high price of imported feeding stuffs.(8) A shortage of artificial manures.(9) The waste, loss and uneconomic use of milk. The result of their enquiries enabled them to report to the Government early in the summer . lhat the information then available did not lead them to anticipate any serious national shortage-/1^ stated, however, that the occurrence of local shortages was not improbable.   At the date of this report, however, there are indications that the shortage may be more widespread than was anticipated.4. In reporting to the Departments concerned the Committee have used the term *&apos; shortage &quot; as implying a scarcity of milk amounting almost to a famine. They do not desire to convey the impression that enough liquid milk is at present being consumed by children, or that its total consumption might not be considerably increased with advantage. During the, war it may not be possible to do this by adding appreciably to the number of cows, but the Committee believe that steps could be taken to reduce existing waste and actual total -loss of milk and thus increase the quantity of milk available for direct human, consumption. The elimination of this . loss would also helpJ.to reduce the price of milk as allowance for it has to be made by dealers.5. - The returns of the number of cows and heifers and other cattle obtained by the Boards of Agriculture in April and June did not confirm the impression widely prevalent either that there was an excessive slaughter of cows for beef or that the number of in-calf cows and heifers was seriously reduced, but shewed that the total number of cows and heifers in calf or in milk in the United Kingdom in June 1917, was practically the same as in June 1916 and 1915. .6. In certain areas, temporary conditions directly attributable to the war appear-to have accelerated that abandonment or reduction of milk production in favour of cereal cultivation, which had been anticipated by some competent authorities as a possible post-war development. . The guarantee of a minimum price for home-grown wheat and oats has materially changed the outlook of British farming. Of recent years milk production has been undertaken by an increas-ing number of farmers, because, in spite of the early and long hours, coupled with Saturday and Sunday labour, it gave regular and assured, returns and was free from foreign competition. With security assured for corn-growing, some farmers are now being tempted to adopt the. least laborious method of utilising the straw and roots which will be produced in greater qxiantifiesas the acreage of arable land increases. In areas where dairying has in the past been taken up as ft necessity, the easier practice of beef and mutton production appears likely to replace the production of milk on certain farms.(13762-9.)  Wt 2340-37J.  25,25,25,12,12.   11/17.  D &amp; s.  Q 3.second interim report.
7&quot; Any local decrease in milk production has, however,.up to the present, synchronised with an increase in the size of herds in other localities where climate favoured the growth of grass and &apos; other crops, especially during the winter. These districts are often inadequately provided with railway or&quot; other facilities for transporting this milk to distant centres of population with the result that it is used for calf-rearing, butter making, &amp;c. It is&apos; desirable that milk should only be so utilised when there is an adequate supply of whole milk for human consumption.8 The breaking up of pasture land has created some anxiety among the^ farmers who have been accustomed to produce milk mainly on grass. This is likely to continue until they have adapted themselves to altered conditions and methods. A sufficient number of farmers have already done this to show the practicability of such alternative methods.9. Shortage of labour has hampered all farmers, and particularly those who have increased their arable land. The greater worry attendant on arable farming has consequently caused some of them to reduce their- output of milk. \ tThe Committee welcome the decision of the Government to grant exemption from military service to men engaged on farm work of national importance. They have recommended that, in view of the necessity of maintaining during the war the supply of milk derived from town dairies, men (other than Class A men) employed by town cow-keepers in milk production and doing the same work as employees of country dairy farmers should have similar rights of exemption.10. Careful enquiries did not reveal any serious shortage in the prospective supplies of home-grown cattle foods. Although in some districts the hay crop was below the average, the prospects for the autumn grazing and the supply of roots for winter were good; there will also in many districts be increased supplies of straw. In spite of the requirements of the Army the War Office has issued a notice to farmers and stockbreeders authorising the use of a reasonable quantity of hay, or oat or wheat straw in their possession for consumption by stock in their possession or control. /11. None of the foregoing points appeared to the Committee seriously to threaten the supply of milk in the winter of 1917-18. In their opinion, the adequacy of the supply depended partly on the supply and distribution of feeding stuffs, and partly on the price which producers would obtain.II. Supply and Distribution of Feeding Stuffs.12. The war has reduced the actual and prospective supply of cake, offals, maize etc., to a serious and even dangerous extent. In view of this fact, the Committee recommended in June to the Departments concerned the recognition and admission of the prior claims of dairy cattle in the allocation of the curtailed amounts of concentrated feeding stuffs. They fully realised the inconvenience that would be caused to other stock owners if a large proportion of the. available concentrated foods were ear-marked for milch cows, but in their Opinion national necessity made the admission of this prior claim imperative. The Committee accordingly submitted a scheme which involved the control of the supply and distribution of concentrated feeding stuffs. Under this proposal they advised that the owners of cows shquld, during the winter months beginning in October and extending to April, be entitled to a minimum daily allowance for each cow in milk of 2 lb. of cake and 4 lb. of offals or maize; that, where the :ratio of acreage to milch cows was less than one acre to each cow, this allowance should be increased, and that this increase should rise proportionately with the decrease of acreage, so that town dairies with no land attached should be entitled to a minimum double ration of 4 lb.&apos;of cake&quot; and 8 lb. of maize and offals per cow per day. It was estimated that this allowance of cake, if claimed by everv cowkeeper, mip-ht amount to a total of some 364.000 tons for the period from October to April inclusive.&quot; The Committee also recommended that an additional 25 per cent, of this total, or 91,000 tons of cake, should be reserved for dairy stock and be used to meet the special requirements of cows with exceptional milk yields, of districts which have been largely dependent on concentrated feeding stuffs in the past, and other special cases.13. The Committee further recommended that an adequate supply of oats, beans and peas grown on the farm should, as far as possible, be left to stock-owners. They emphasised in par-ticular the need of making an early announcement of the Governments policy so that dairymen might know what feeding stuffs would be available and what machinery was being set up for their distribution.14. The Committee are aware that the foregoing ration will appear inadequate to many milk producers. They have accordingly suggested that immediate steps be taken to explain the causes which have led to this shortage in the actual amount of cake and maize, and to assist&apos; farmers by giving them information on the best and most economical methods&apos; of feeding their cows under the present exceptional circumstances. They are of opinion that for this purpose use should^ be made of the country and local press, that explanatory addresses should be given to dairy farmers&apos; societies; and that farmers who have successfully adooted rations suitable to the present conditions should be invited to demonstrate their results to others.15. Enquiries were made by the Committee as to the probable supplies and control of prices of artificial manures. They are glad to report that an endeavour is being made to maintain and even to increase the production of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate and basic slag, and that prices have been fixed for the various qualities delivered under different conditions As &quot;the value of basic slag in improving grass has been often demonstrated, -the Committee&apos;hope that County War Agricultural Committees&apos; will advise dairv farmers:;to make the fullest pos-
* &apos; -sible use of this manure on suitable soil, so as to obtain;^&apos;aibeiier::pash^:and/:ii^7ie .vyields of hay next summer, thus helping to maintain the supply of grass and hay in spite of the decrease in the acreage of grass-land. - ,       :,- J6, In view of the opinion field by responsible people that there would be serious.local shortages of milk in certain districts during the coming winter, the Committee considered the possibility of so far controlling the distribution of milk as to remedy or reduce such local difficulties by diverting supplies of milk drawn from other areas. Their proposals for mitigating these difficulties by means of collecting depots are set out later in the present Report.Ill; Price of Milfa17. Since the publication of the first Interim Eeport, the price of milk has been fixed for the period beginning 1st October, 1917, and ending 31st March, 1918. The Committee consider that the winter prices fixed for producers are such as to give them a fair and sufficient profit. They hope that the Food Controller may soon find it possible to lay down certain guiding principles concerning milk prices for the subsequent period. The prices fixed should give farmers a reasonable profit, shordd encourage winter milk production, and should, in the interest of the consumers, be as low as may be compatible with the maintenance of pro-duction and of quality. The Committee believe that it would be in the interest of consumers if, instead of having a flat rate for winter and summer milk, it became a recognised practice to charge a higher price in winter when the cost of production is high than is charged in summer when the&apos;cost of production is low. This should be accompanied by a reduction in the price of summer milk. Under the settled conditions of pre-war times, farmers, particularly those who made contracts for twelve months, tried to balance their lack of profit or their losses during the winter by big profits&quot; obtained during the summer. Under the very unsettled conditions which obtain now, and which are likely to continue for some time, farmers will probably so regulate the calving of their cows as to get the maximum output of milk in summer. In certain grazing areas farmers deliberately arrange to have all their cows calve in the spring, and-make no attempt to maintain their output of milk during&apos; the winter. Hence it is essential, if winter milk production is not to fall to a dano-srmisly low level, that it should be made reasonably profitable. The Committee believe that deliberate and acknowledged attempts to make up the losses on winter milk by large profits in the summer result in aggravating the existing natural disparity in milk yields due to the difference in winter and summer feeding.18. The Committee also reported to the Ministry of Food that during their enquiries they had often been told by witnesses that the only inducement to farmers to produce cleaner and more wholesome milk than the ordinary supply was the prospect of obtaining a higher price fqr such milk. Similarly, they had been frequently informed, and wore already aware, that there was considerable room for improvement in the wholesomeness of milk.In these circumstances, the Committee felt bound to call the attention of the Food Controller to the fact that the Milk Order of 7th September, 1917, discouraged any farmer from trving to improve the hygienic quality of his milk, by getting the reward to which he had been accustomed or else should be entitled for the extra labour and exnense entailed. The price &apos;fixed in the Order being a maximum price Vised&apos;on the cost of production of the average quality of milk would, in their opinion, not only check any improvement of the milk supply, but might actually tend to lower the standard.In view of the importance of maintaining the health and welfare of child life the Committee consequents have urged upon the Food Controller the desirability of recognizing the -production and sale of milk of a higher hygienic qualitv than the ordinary market milk, and the need for taking the necessary steps connected therewith.19. Thft Committee believe that the &quot; plough &quot; policy now adopted by the Government, though it will reduce the amount of pasture and aftermath available for thp summer fwding-pf cows, will give an&quot; increase in roots, straw and home-grown grain..which will assist winter milk production and lessen the present dependence of the dairy farmer on the sunnlv of imported feeding stuffs.  They hope to deal more fully with this subject in their-next report.IV. Preferential Distribution,20. The Committee examined the possibility of allocating the supplies of milk, if they became materially reduced, to different sections of the community on some system of priority according to their respective needs. They obtained the views of the Food (War) Committee of the Royal Society, as well as of the representatives of Day Nurseries, &amp;c. They also had the advantage of studying the German war rations and the report of a scheme which had been adopted in Stockholm.In considering this question in connexion with an emergency like the present, it has been necessary to have regard to the past habits of the population in regard to milk consumption. However desirable it might be from the point of view of public health to increase the consumption of milk particularly among the poorer classes, from the very inadequate pre-war figure to an amount which is more in accordance with their physiological needs, the present is not a propitious time to attempt such a reform on any great scale. The most that could well be expected at a time when there is a prospect of some diminution in supplies would be to insure that people generally did not suffer from lack of milk more than in normal times and that where milk was physip-logically necessary it was.supplied in adequate amounts. .     ; ., &apos;i
Before the, war  he, total amount of milk available for consumption as milk in the United JBangdom allowed, of somewhat less than an average of I pint per head of the whole population per day throughout the year. Figures of the Board of Trade shewed that the average consumption among workmen&apos;s families did not reach two pints per head per.week.This pre-war consumption, however inadequate, must be taken into consideration in any scheme of milk rationing during the war.- The, Committee have ventured to put forward the following classification and rations as a guide to the Departments concerned.Group 1. A. Children from birth to nine months to receive up to not more than 1\ pints per day on a medical certificate stating that the infant cannot he breast-fed or can only be partially breast-fed.B. Children from 10 to 18 months 1\ pints per day. ;C. Milk on a medical certificate.Group 2. Children from 19 months to 5 years 1 pint per day. -..&apos;Group 3. Children from 6 to 14 years 1 pint per day.Group 4. All other persons.The Committee have advocated a priority scheme rather than a flat rate. They have net placed nursing mothers in Group 1. They feel that nothing should be done to discourage breast-feeding and they are aware that in most cases other foods are more suitable than milk for nursing-mothers.21. The Committee understand that the Food Controller is taking steps to secure a proper distribution of the available milk, supply to the sections of the community most in need of it.The Committee have had their attention directed to the large demand of the Army for milk, They believe that, in case of considerable scarcity, a limited additional quantity of milk could 1)6 obtained for children and invalids if its use for cooking purposes in the Army were restricted.V. loss of milk through souring.22. At the end of their first Interim Report, the Committee stated that, during the warmer months;of the year, there was always a considerable loss of milk through souring; that this was aggravated by the curtailed transport services of the recent summer and that less well-timed train services, involving longer exposure of full churns at stations, delay in transit and at the destination were certain to augment this loss.- Their various enquiries repeatedly brought to the attention of the Committee the large amount ;&apos;of milk actually lost and wasted and the preventable deterioration in the quality of much of the milk coming to large towns. Before the war, this wastage and deterioration in quality-were to be deprecated. It is now a matter of urgent importance that they should be pre-vented.-- /The Committee are of opinion that this can be done without great difficulty.Accumulated evidence showed that, not only did this national loss and waste exist, but that, -owiug to the war, it was of a more serious character than the Committee had &quot;anticipated. One firm stated that the quantity of milk received in a sour condition between April and August, 1917, was over 4,000 churns approximately 68,000 gallons w^th a value of about , 4,000-and several independent witnesses gave it as their opinion, based on their own experience, that the average percentage of London milk lost through souring was from 1 per cent-, in.&apos;winter to at least 2 per cent, in summer. As the total quantity of milk sent by rail to London annually has been estimated to be some 90,000,000 gallons, a loss of even 1 per cent, annually would amount to 900,000 gallons, which at is: 2d. per gallon, amounted to  52,500 nefore..the war and now at 2s. per gallon would total  90,000. ,yl-preservation of milk by pasteurisation.i-23. rjThe Committee have found that a large proportion of London and other city milk h pasteurised, although sold to the public as fresh milk.   Some firms, which, before the war.Sasteur-ised 30 per cent, now treat the whole of their milk in summer and much of it in winter. . ^investigation, the Committee found that, in the majority of cases, the milk was pasteurised, not with the primary object of destroying any disease germs which might be present, but to postpqne/souring and so add a few hours to its life. It was repeatedly stated by witnesses that, unlessrtbemilk were pasteurised as soon as it reached town, it would become sour before delivery.v  The-Committee also received some evidence that milk was not infrequently pasteurised more than once.24.-&apos;- The Committee are of opinion that pasteurised milk, for which there is undoubtedly often a demand, should be sold as such and not as fresh milk, and that milk which is purchased as freshmilk should not have been artificially subjected to a high temperature. Would-be purchasers of fresh and pasteurised milk are entitled to get what they pay for and should not be&apos;required to pay for what they do not actually receive.? The Committee feel it necessary to call attention to the fact that there is now neither a.statutory definition, of pasteurised milk nor a guarantee that any article sold as sucn answers to, the;^escription; and further that, although certain milk may be made safer by pasteurisation, d&apos;irtyj;miik. can never be converted into clean milk by the process, however well this may be car^i^d^Qttti&apos;,&apos; Pasteurisation should never be regarded either by producers or traders as a sub-.sf/ira(e for cleanliness in handling milk.
The Committee are sensible of the fact that it is not possible to give immediate effect to these particular recommendations. ; -25. The Committee were impressed by the evidence laid before them to the effect that, In ordinary circumstances, milk, if produced under fair conditions of cleanliness and chilled soon after milking, does not require to be pasteurised in order to make, it keep sufficiently long to reach the consumer in a sound and satisfactory condition.&apos; Milk produced under good farm conditions and properly chilled at country depots within a short interval of milking has been and is being sent unpasteurised from Scotland to London, arriving actually in a better condition than some of the milk from English farms not far from London which has been cooled only to the temperature of the water on the farm, i.e., 56Q F. to 620 F. The Committee have also been informed that pasteurising costs more than chilling. It is further estimated that something like 3 pints per churn of 17 gallons (or 2&apos;2 per cent.) are lost through evaporation, &amp;c, during pasteurisation.VII. Establishment of Country Milk Depots.26. Consequently the Committee feel confidence in stating that the present heavy loss&apos; of milk through souring and the unsatisfactory condition of much of the milk, which., though not actually sour, has yet lost its freshness, is unnecessary and avoidable, and that milk. o  a better quality and of no greater price could be provided were it chilled soon after milking at country depots located at centres conveniently situated for the producers and with good, railway communications to cities. They are of opinion that a comprehensive scheme can only r be completed after the war, but that such a scheme can and should be initiated&apos; during the war for the reasons and on the lines set out in this Report.27. In addition to reducing materially the above serious loss and wastage and improving the quality and wholesomeness of the milk, the following further advantages would arise if a suitably organised system of country depots were established for its collection, treatment and distribution:- . .....  .(a) The quantities of milk sent to towns could he regulated to meet the daily needsof the retailers.   Under the existing system when city milk dealers obtain their milk, direct from individual farmers, the natural changes in the seasons bring&apos;&apos; about a superfluity of milk in summer and a scarcity in winter, causing con-siderable irregularity in the supplies.   Whereas wholesale and retail dealers have to meet a comparatively uniform demand throughout the year, the winter output of milk on many farms is less than 40 per cent, of the summer output.   In some cases dealers contract for uniform amounts from the producers, leaving the&quot;&apos;-summer surplus to be dealt with at the farms.    In others they purchase all the milk on farms, undertaking to dispose of any surplus.   In either case&apos; the surplus was and is a source of anxiety and loss.   In the winter also retailers have often to make up their quantities by the purchase of &quot; aecommo-dation &quot; milk.   Several representatives of the wholesale and retail trade stated&apos; that this regulation of supplies through the purchase of accommodation milk added an average of one penny per gallon to the cost to the consumer.   If the milk . were sent from the farms to properly equipped depots, the exact quantities required by the retailers cotdd be despatched, the surplus being disposed of without worry or;: loss to either producer or distributor.(b) The gross milk production of the country would, probably he increased, as the farmers&apos;&quot;would, &quot;through the depots, have an assured market for the whole of the milk they could produce at all seasons of the year, without the risk of having an unsaleable surplus thrown on their hands or of having sour milk returned to them.   The Committee understand that farmers using such depots in Scotland had before the declaration of war increased their milk production b;v- about 25 per cent. &apos; This . increase is not confined to any one season but is spread over the whole year,; and/&quot; results not only in an increased supply of properly chilled milk for summer&apos;-;use,!-and an increased output of high grade cheese, but also in a larger supply of winter^ milk, i.e., at the time of greatest natural scarcity. -  - -(c) Surplus m,ilk could be dealt with near the sources of production instead of in the towns;and cities, thus avoiding the extravagance of sending to towns by rail milk which is not wanted as liquid milk and which deteriorates as raw material for cheese-making. Cases were quoted of surplus London milk which bad gone sour having been poured down the drains. Such a waste could hardly occur if facilities existed for regulating the supplies sent to cities and utilising any surplus at country depots. A further waste occurs when milk is made into cheese in cities, the whey being generally, unused, whereas in the country it can be fed to pigs. ,i(d) Better hours could he obtained for milkers.   The public have long been aware of-theobjections felt by milkers to the early hours at which their daily work begins. This is usually necessary in order to get- the milk despatched to large to^ns^fori consumption within a few hours owing to the risk of loss of the imperfectly.eddied&apos;-milk through souring. If the milk were.collected and chilled within&quot;a reasonable^ time the risk of its not keeping would be practically-eliminated andithe need-fo^the-&apos; excessively early hours of milking removed.   -yri&apos;&quot;-*;.ui v* 1- \Ay sia-l^4-28. Accordingly, in order to increase and improve the food available during the war, the Committee have recommended to the Government,&quot; and desire again to urge, that suitable centres should be established in selected districts as soon as possible: (1) where milk coiild be
collected, chilled, treated and dispatched in such quantities and at such times as may be required to meet the needs of consumers, and (2) where the surplus could be made into cheese, &amp;c. The Committee are convinced that private effort alone would not enable anything approaching the minimum number of depots required to be established in time to affect the situation this winter or even next summer. They have suggested two alternative methods for the establishment and maintenance of these centres, i.e., either through the Agricultural Organisation Societies of the respective countries concerned, by means of Government loans, repayable, say, in five years, or other period; or by the Boards of Agriculture, as has been done in the case of the establish-ments for the drying and preserving of fruit and vegetables. In the former case, the establishment of the. depots should be approved by the Boards of Agriculture.. The Committee believe that, if this course were adopted, better and more1 milk could be provided immediately without any increase in the price, and that better and more cheese and butter could be made at once.29. The Committee realise that, during the war, depots should preferably be established where existjng buildings can be adapted readily and without much cost. They do not recom-mend or believe it possible, this year or even next year, to get a large number established, but they feel convinced that, in certain districts, particularly where the milk supply is not now available for consumption as milk owing to difficulties of collection and transportation, there is an urgent need for the creation of some such machinery and organisation; that the necessary amount of money would not be large; that money so spent would be well expended and would be repaid to the State; and that from the national point of view the outlay is justified as a war measure.30. The Committee have submitted details as to suitable localities, where milk is not now being used to meet national requirements, for these initial depots, their cost, the plant required and other particulars. The initial depots should only be established &quot;in districts which are served by an adequate system of roads. They should be situated near a railway, a brine-cooling plant should be provided, and although the Committee do not consider that a pasteurising plant should be necessary they do not object to its installation. The capital cost of a depot to deal with 1.000 to 2,000 gallons of milk per day, which they believe is the smallest amount that is economical at present, should range from  1 to  2 per gallon.31.   The Committee propose to deal more fully with some of the points touched on, as well as with others connected with the future development of the milk supply, in their next report.
