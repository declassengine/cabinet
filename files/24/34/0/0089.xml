THE  DISTRIBUTION  OF  MILK.Draft drawn up by Dr. Hutchison and Dr. MacFadden and amendedand approved by the Committee.The Committee have been assisted in considering the questions referred to them hy Major Astor by the memoranda on the subject received from medical members of the Committee, by the examination of such published figures as were available^ bearing on the consumption of milk in this country in pre-war periods, and by information as to the present and prospective state of our milk supply. Concerning the last, it may be said at once that although any marked diminution in the milk supply in the immediate future is not anticipated, local shortage of more or less acute character may occur.Circumstances obviously demand that the questions put by Major Astor should be considered not only from the point of view of what is physiologically desirable, but also, in view of a possible future diminution of supplies, from what is physiologically necessary. Between these two extremes, conditions of supply may leave room for a number of intermediate adjustments of the scale of rationing, each calling for expert guidance from the medical aspect. It is anticipated that such adjustments of this kind as might be called for would be local rather than general.In considering these questions in connexion with an emergency like the present, it is necessary also to keep in mind the past habits of the population in regard to milk consumption. However desirable it may be from the point of view of public health to increase the consumption of milk among our poorer classes from the very inadequate pre-war figure to an amount which is more in accordance with their physiological needs, the present does not seem a propitious time to attempt such a reform on any great scale. The value of milk is not well understood by the people, and there might be danger of waste if supplies on a fully adequate scale were provided for them. The most that could well be expected at a time when there is a prospect of some diminution in supplies would be to insure that the people generally did not suffer from lack of milk more than in normal times and that where milk was physiologically necessary it was supplied in adequate amounts.As regards pre-war consumption of milk, figures given in the Board of Trade&apos;s &quot; Report on the Cost of Living of the Working Classes, 1908 &quot; (Cd. 3864), indicate that the weekly consumption of fresh milk in urban workmen&apos;s families in 1904 averaged only 1*8 pints per head. According to Prof. Noel Paton- the consumption of milk by the working-class families of Glasgow averages about half a pint per &quot; man &quot; per day.. The total amount of fresh milk calculated as being available in 1916 was 928,034,000 gallons. On a population of 45,200,000, this would yield a weekly allowance per head of 3&apos;23 pints. (&quot; Report of the Food (War) Committee,&quot; Cd. 8241, 1917.) The pre-war figures for Ireland give an average consumption of 3 pints per head per week. pI. The suitability of the Stockholm ration for the classesSpecified below.    The ration referred to is-Class 1 ...      ... - 1 litre, or nearly If pints per day.&quot;       ^ IT      33 33 33       0&apos;88      ,, ,,3j       ^    ... ... 4 ,, ,,&apos;      0&quot;44      ,, ,,        ,,4 ...       ...     in accordance with a medical certificate.Taking the first of the questions put by Major Astor, the reports received from the medical members of the Committee agree generally that the amounts laid down by the Stockholm scheme are physiologically adequate and, indeed, liberal.(10772)
Glass 1 of the Stockholm scheme, namely, children from birth to the age of 2 years.  Sir Clifford Allbutt and Dr. Hutchison criticise the inclusion of infantsfrom 0 to 2 years under a single ration, and most of the other reports refer more or less directly to this fault. The waste involved in this scheme would largely be avoided by altering the infant age grouping as follows : Group 1. 0 to 9 months (normally breast-fed) to receive milk on medical certificate up to 1^- pints per day.Group 2.&apos; 10 to 18 months l  pints per day.As these groups include the section of the population for whom milk is a physiological necessity in approximately the amounts stated, the maintenance of this supply should be a first charge on the country&apos;s milk resources.Class 2 of the Stockholm scheme, namely, children from the age of 2 to the age of 12 years, and old persons above the age of 65. Sir Clifford Allbutt and Prof. Leonard Hill would extend the age period of this group to cover puberty. They doubtless had &quot;physiological desirability&quot; in view when recommending this step. Others appear to be content with the Stockholm provision for this age group, viz., f of a pint per bead per day. Having in view the amounts consumed by the working-class families as shown in the figures given above, it is clear that the argument for physiological necessity is much less strong at these ages.We think it would be desirable to sub-divide this class into two groups Group 3. 19 months to 5 years       ...      ...      1 pint.Group 4.: .6 to 14 years ...       ...      ...      1 pint.This would ensure for the younger of these age groups priority over the elder, which would operate favourably for the younger in the case of diminishing supplies.We would propose omitting the age group 65 upwards from this class, leaving such individuals in it as really require milk to obtain it on a medical certificate as arranged for the last group (6).Class 3 of the Stockholm scheme, namely all other healthy persons. [Group 5.)  There appears to be general agreement as to the amount, namely &quot;44 of .a pint, prescribed for this class in the Stockholm scheme being sufficient, but several of the reports suggest that as milk is unnecessary in this age group no allocation should be made for it. In administering a priority system of rationing this would obviously be the correct course- to take if the necessity arose. It might be desirable on general grounds how-ever to make a small allowance of milk to adults.In considering the needs of the last three groups, it should be remembered that milk is largely taken in the form of milk puddings or in making palatable other kinds of food.Class 4 of the Stockholm scheme, namely sick persons and pregnant women. (Group 6.) Professor Leonard Hill and Professor Cushny criticise the proposal to deal with the requirements of invalids by means of a doctors certificate, and the latter refers to the experience of the Ministry of Food in this respect in the case of bread. It is difficult to see however in what other way this class could be dealt with. The Ministry of Food would of course need to devise some means for limiting abuses, such as, for instance, a schedule of diseases which need a milk diet. On the understanding that this schedule is narrowly limited, this group should rank with groups 1 and 2.The Groups suggested above are (1) 0 to 9 months, lj pints per day. (2) 10 to 18 months ,,(3) 19 months to 5 years, 1 pint per day. (4) 6 to 14 years, 1 pint per day.(5) All other healthy persons, \ pint per day, or according to supply available-. (6) Sick persons and pregnant women, according to medical certificate.In allotting supplies to the different groups preference would be given in the order 1 to 5.   Group 6 would rank with groups 1 and 2.
II. The relation of the Stockholm ration to the normal pre-war consumption of milk in the United Kingdom.No figures are available to enable us accurately to compare the pre-war con-sumption of milk with that provided by the Stockholm scheme. It is fairly clear, however, that the latter represents a much larger consumption per head than exists in this country. As has beenestimated, the total milk available in the United Kingdom, only allows of the consumption of about \ pint per head per day. The figures of the Board of Trade report show that the average consumption among workmens families did not reach 2 pints per head per week. As already pointed out these are facts which should be taken into careful consideration in any scheme of milk rationing.III. The advisability of adopting a flat rate and the possibility of its adoption leading to a wastage or to unnecessarily high consumption of milk by certain classes at the expense of the remainder.The Committee advocates a priority scheme rather than a flat rate. Anomalies can, to a large extent, be removed by careful sub-division of the age groups when such a food as milk is concerned. The revised sub-divisions suggested above have been made largely for this purpose. Even so difficulties will remain. The scheme for instance does not recognise the normally higher consumption of milk by the middle and upper social classes as compared with the working classes. We think, however, that any danger of waste, due to over reservation of milk for a given class, would be avoided by insisting on early notification of demands by customers within the limit of the quantities allotted to them on the priority scale.IV. Suggestions for a lower scale, if the above allowance were unobtainable, or were thought to be considerably in excess of normal consumption.We have already suggested modifications of the Stockholm scale.   In the case of the six groups which we have suggested above, any diminution in the milk supply necessitating alteration in the allowances,-should be met by a reduction, first of all, in groups 5 and 4, until the milk allotted to these groups was exhausted, and subsequently, if necessary, a reduction in the allowance of group 3.
