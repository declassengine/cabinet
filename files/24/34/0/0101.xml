SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION Nov. 30 - Dec., 6. 1917.81. MARK EXCHANGE.        The Mark Exchange improved rapidly and steadily in the week Nov. 28th to Dec. 4th.   The Danish Exchange rose from 45.00 to 55.00;   the Norwegian from 45.00 to 55.00;   the Swedish from 40.00 to 49.50;   the Swiss from 64.90 to 72.00. This steady improvement has succeeded a period of rather violent fluctuations and for the first time the Scandinavian and the Swiss exchanges have risen simultaneously and in a proportionate degree.S2* DENMARK.       Iiie War Trade Board have submitted to the Danish Minis-ter at Washington proposals for an agreement on the lines re-commended by the blockade conference in London.   These propos-als sanction the export from Denmark to Germany of 2,600 hor-868 per month, of 6,000 head of cattle per week, and of 2,100 tons of fish per month.     The surplus of Danish pork and dairy produce would be divided between Germany and the Allies in the average proportions of the three years 1912-1914,There is still some difference! of opinion as to the amount of Danish tonnage which should bl available for the purposes of an expansion of the present Unglo-Danish Shipping Agreement into a more comprehensive agreement between Denmark, the United Kingdom and the United States.!  In the circumstances we have thought it advisable to discontinfc our discussions of the Shipping question in London with Mr. Shiekstadt until the United States have reached a clearer understanding with the Danish Minister at Washington.The Danes are holding up exports of butter and eggs to the United Kingdom until we agree to pay higher prices. The
4652/,Danish Government maintain that their agreement to divide their surplus dairy produce equally between Germany and Great Britain was based on the assumption that we should pay the prices prevailing in the countries adjoining Denmark.   We cannot admit that any such assumption can be read into our Agreement.The war Trade Board have submitted their proposals for a Uonvegian Agreement to Dr. Hansen.   They put forward thefkfollowing demandss-(1)   That Norway shall cease her exports to Germany of antimony, bismuth, manganese, mica, nickel, tin, titanium, v oIfram, ferro-silicon, molybdenum, oupreous and ferrous pyrites, and of all copper except crude or refined copper exchanged for an equivalent amount of German manufactured copper;(2)   That 8or?/ay shall sell to the U.3.A. the whole of her surplus of calcium carbide and calcium nitrate in return for supplies of kerosene and of fertilisers;(3)   That Norway1e exports to Germany of fish and fish products shall be limited to 48,000 tons per annwa ana shall not include fish oil.TheBe proposals agree in the main with Dr. Sansen&apos;s ori-ginal proposals, but Dr, Uansen asked that Norway should be allowed to export to Germany 20,000 tons of carbide, 100 tons of molybdenum ore, 5,000 tons of ferro-silicon and 18,000 tons of calcium nitrate.We have notified the Norwegian Government that we shall cease purchasing Norwegian fish f except roes and meal) on Deo. 26th.   Consequently we shall be unable to prevent the rosurap-tion from that date of unrestricted exports of Norwegian fish to Germany,   The Norwegians have   so far refused to arrange a loan for the financing of further British purchases of herrings or to guarantee that the present limitations upon the export of fish to Germany will be maintained. The herring
466fishery starts towards the end of December and the Norwegi-ians already hold a surplus of 18,000 tons of dried cod which they can send to Germany as soon as the existing restrictions are removed.     If we are unable to prevent the! Norwegians from disposing of large quantities of fish to Germany between the termination of our own purchases and the conclusion of a satisfactory arrangement with Dr, Nansen at Washington we should at least insist that these exoorts be counted into the 48,000 tons allowed to Germany under the United States proposals,NETHERLANDS. Early in the week the State Department atWashington instructed Mr. MacCormick to return to London as soon as the Paris Conference had risen -to discuss blockade matters with delegates from Holland and Sweden. The Dutch delegates have arrived in London, but Mr. Mac-Cormick has no?; been suddenly recalled to Washington. It is; to be feared that, in the absence of Mr. MacCormick, little or no progress wall be made towards a definite settlement with the Dutch.A crisis in the Dutch Cabinet which arose upon a dif-ference of opinion h tween Mr. Treub and Mr. Posthuma on economic questions appears to have terminated in favour of Germany.   Mr. Treub recently resisted with some success the; granting of further financial credits to the German Govern-, meat.     He is particularly concerned in the institution of the Export Centrale, a Government body which will closely control all future transactions involving payments by the belligerents for Dutch produce.   Mr. Treub attempted to stop the export of Dutch cheese to Germany until payment was guaranteed in a form recognised by the Export Centrale. He was compelled however to give way after a short crisis
467during ?&amp;ich both he and Mr. Posthuma temporarily resigned their portfolios.     Mr. Treub does not feel that his posi-tion is in the circumstances at all secure.   It is not expected that the Export Centrale will get seriously to work before the lew Year, though several important appoint-ments have been made to the Board .The Butch are not prepared to confirm the new Anglo-Butch Shipping and Goal Agreement until a settlement has been reached with the United States regarding supplies for Holland.     Meanwhile we are leaving all negotiations in res-pect of Butch ships in United States ports to the United States Government.The general embargo upon British exports to Butch territory has tended to interfere with our supplies of tin, petrol and other important commodities obtained from the Butch East Indies.       The embargo has accordingly been raised in&apos; respect of excorts to the Butch Colonies.SWITZERLAND.        As a. result of discussions in Paris the United States have determined the final form of their economicagreement with Switzerland and have thus reached their   \\- . - .      - \Vfirst conclusive understanding with a neutral power.The agreement makes virtually no change in the present blockade arrangements affecting Switzerland.   It associates the United States with existing measures and commits them to an active participation in the management of the blockade.     The Agreement as originally drafted at Washing-ton was more drastic than the Agreement concluded at Paris. Allied opinion in France and at Berne however is strongly opposed to further pressure upon Switzerland at this particular moment.   Switzerland   will have exhausted her present supplied of bread cereals by April 1st next, and
468the Swiss, if we drive them too hard, may turn for supplies to the Central Powers, who are apparently not indisposed to help them in return for substantial oonoessions.   She Paris Conference has not only agreed to abstain for the present from any further pressure upon Switzerland, but has also pledged the Allied Wheat Executive to find B40.0Q0 tons of bread cereals for the Swiss before the next harvest.   Later on attempts may be made by the Allies jointly to improve the terms of our present agreements with Switzerland.Sir H. Eumbold has discussed with the Swiss President our proposals for a -British loan W Switzerland.   The Pre si-dent objected to some of the proposals in detail, but Sir H. Rumbold gathered that we shall be able without much difficulty to secure a loan of Er. 10,000,000 monthly, repayable in five years, at 5fo interest plus a commission of not less than lj$ to the Swiss banks.   It will probably be necessary to guar-antee to the Swiss the use of a definite quantity of tonnage in proportion to t he amount of the loan.   They have asked for a minimum allowaaoe of 70,000 tons a month.RUSSIA.      The Allies have decided that in the present state of affairs no further arrangements can be made for sending sup-plies to Russia.   The transit to Finland of foodstuffs already in Sweden will be authorised by our Minister at Stockholm, but gradually and in limited quantities.SUBMABIME&apos; CAMPAIGN.
