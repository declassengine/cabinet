****************************************PACIFISM.&apos;REPORT by Mr. BASIL  - THOMSON.**** **********************************************t**-*******
PACIFISM. (Report by Mr; Basil Thomson.)  oooOobo   -The developments during the past fortnight have been unfavourable to the Paci-fists.     The newspaper outcry about &quot;Boloism&quot; has had the effect of hardening public opinion against them, and they seem to feel themselves on the defensive, and to think it necessary to dony that they are supported by Enemy funds.A   Joint Committee of the War Office and the Metropolitan Police is now sitting and the books of a number of the smaller Societies which have been seized by the Police during the last fortnight, are being examined by chartered accountants.The following is a list of the places visited by the PoliceNO-CONSCRIPTION FELLOWSHIP,   :5, York Buildings&apos;, Adelphi, W.C. and . 4 and 5, Duke Street, Aaelphi, W.C.FELLOWSHIP OF RECONCILIATION. 17, Red Lion Square, W.C.-   INTERNATIONAL FREE TRADE LEAGUE, 28, Victoria Street, S.W.B. Zusman&apos;s flat at 15, St. Anne&apos;s Villas, loyal Crescent, W., andBlackie&apos;s house at Reigate.ARNOLD LUPTON&apos;S premises at 7, Victoria Street, S.W.T. KEELEY &amp; CO. (alias Isaacson) 47, Darnley Road, Hackney.WOMEN *S PEACE CRUSADE,39, Doughty Street, W.C.MISS THEODORA WILSON-WILSON, s(&quot;New Crusader   &amp; Christian Peace Crusade), 10, Mecklenburgh Square, W.C.THOMAS KEELL,127, Ossulston Street, N.W,   (&quot;Satire&quot;).PEACE NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE, (City Police) 47, New Broad Street, E.C.&apos; NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES,Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, W.C.A more detailed account of what was found will be furnished in the next fort-nightly report, but it is sufficient to say here that at the premises of Mr. Arnold Lupton, 150 letters and postcards from soldiers stationed in the United Kingdom, were found, and that in all the premises, specimens of pamphlets and leaflets that would almost certainly not have been passed by the Official Press Bureau, were founc ready for distribution.There was evidence that these Pacifist Societies were closely inter-related, and that the names of the same persons recurred either as Subscribers or members of the Committees.     So far as they have yet been examined, the accounts seem to shor that the &quot;Bol$ismn is home-grown.p aCIFIST LEAFLETS.The new Regulation requiring that all pamphlets and leaflets shall bear the name-*f the author and printer, and shall be passed by the Official Press Bureau,
has now come into force, and instructions are being issued to the Police, explain ing how the Regulation is to be applied.     It will enable the Police to pro-ceed against the distributors of illicit leaflets, and will also make it an offence for any of these Societies to have in their possession illicit leaflets ready for distribution.     It is possible that&apos; at first we shall be flooded with typewritten leaflets, or sheets printed by a secret press, such as the cheap and portable machine, easily moved from house to house in a taxioab, which was used last year for the production of Miss Christabel Pankhurst&apos;s &quot;Britannia&quot;.   But in the long run, the Regulation is likely to do good.There is some consternation among the Pacifists at the passing of the net? Regulation.     A Meeting of the Socialist Party was held at liuddersfield on the 18th November to protest against it, particularly at the requirement that pamphlets should be submitted to the Censor.A large number of Pacifist pamphlets such as &quot;Democracy and Peace&quot;, &quot;Three Years cf War&quot;, &quot;An Appeal to Women&quot;, nA Reasonable Man1s Peace&quot;, &quot;Save the Children of all Nations&quot;, &quot;Securit?/&quot;, etc., etc., were distributed during the Salford Bye-Electicn.     A man named Guilliam was found folding these pamphlets for distribution, and said that he had been working voluntarily for the Peace Movement for eighteen months.     He produced an Exemption Certificate issued by the Hale Urban District Council last May, exempting him from combatant service only.     He refused to give his address, and as he had moved about without noti-fying the Registration Authorities, he was taken to the Police Station and chargeHE INTERNATIONAL FREE TRADE LEAGUE.The International Free Trade League calls for special notice.     It was founded quite lately by Benjamin ZUSMAN, who was born in England in 1850, of Russian parents, and who married in 1912 the daughter of the late Vice-Admiral T. B. M. Sulivan, and sister of Captain i*i. A. Sulivan, R.N.     He is a personal friend of Mr. Arnold Lupton, and a Pacifist.     The &quot;League&quot; seems to consist of three persons, viz., Mr. R. Blackie, Mr. Arnold Lupton, and Mr. Zusman.    So far, the League appears to have done nothing but re-print and distribute 400,000 copies of Mr. H. G. Well&apos;s &quot;A Reasonable Man&apos;s Peace&quot;,&apos;which is re-printed from the &quot;Daily News&quot;, and which advocates allowing Germany a road to the East, and to Central Africa.     This leaflet has been widely distributed.KB INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY.The Independent Labour Party has held a good many Meetings lately at 78, Hyde Road, Gorton, Manchester.     Councillor R. J. Davis, lect&quot;.jring on &quot;is Permanent Peace Possible?&quot;, declared this to be a Capitalists&apos; War, and advocated a general strike if the War went on much longer.     He was asked how this policy would stop the War if the Germans did not also &quot;down tools&quot;, and he replied that it was a question of getting the whole world to organise, and then it would only need one day to bring about Peace.Speaking at Long Eaton, Tom Mann declared himself to be an anti-Militarist, and demanded the repeal of the Military Service Act.He made a tour in South Wales this month, during which he delivered revolutionary speeches.     At Gwaun Cae Gurwen, on the 11th November, he said
that he was a revolutionary, and that there ehculd be no law.     &quot;Law is a fraud and the people that aa.ce. it are frauds, and the place where it is aade. notioe of the law.    why not do as you please?&quot;Referring to the 150 summonses issued to. the Ammanford colliers for breach contract, he said, &quot;If they proceed against these men, and make them pay a fine, 1 tell them not to pay.   I advise you here to-night to &quot;down tools* at onoe.   I sha watch developments, and I hope you will aot upon my advice&quot;.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, M.P., is expected to visit South Wales at the beginnin of December, to address members of the Independent Labour Party in private. This) was arranged at a private meeting at Merthyr, where it was decided that a secret meeting should be held at Merthyr on the morning of the 2nd December, when Mr. Ramsay Maodonald would be present, and that he should address a public meeting in the evening. Gory Hall, Cardiff, has also been reserved for a private meeting tc be addressed by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald.The Works of the Daimler Company at Coventry were recently flooded with Peace literature by some unknown person.THE WOMEN&apos;S PEACE CRUSADE.The affices of this organisation have been raided during the past fortnight, and the books are being examined.     The Crusade has been very aotive in Lancashire working from their headquarters at 5, John Dalton Street, Manchester.     The dis-tribution of leaflets is done voluntarily by women, who used to distribute them by night, but they now call openly at houses, and on tho 8th November, they were handing their leaflets to persons leaving a concert at the Free Trade Hall.     I told that Mrs. W. C. Anderson (Miss Mary McArthur) who carries great weight with women Trade Unionists, is doing much harm among young ;vomen by her Pacifist propaganda, and that she and her husband are entertaining disillusioned and dis-contenfled young Officers on leave from the Front, and are using their statements for the purpose of propaganda.In other parts of the North, the Crusade has not been a cuecess, and in South Wales they have not at all had matters their own way.Mrs. Philip Snowden endeavoured to address a Meeting at Consett on the 29th Ootobcr, but the Meeting broke up in disorder.     She had previously addressed a Meeting at Stanley, Durham, which was al^o a fiasco.The set-baok to Paoifism in the Provinoes and in London is believed, by my informants, to be largely due to the efforts of the War Aims Committee, and arrangements have now been made, by which the Committee shall be kept quickly informed of any movement that may come to the knowledge of New Scotland Yard, in which it appears that a Meeting, oither indoors or in the open air, might usefully be arranged.THE WOMEN1S INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE.The second Yearly Report just issued, shows a membership of 3,576, and the subscriptions and donations have increased from  1,025 to  1,320. The expend-iture last year was  1,522, and there is a balance of  523.am
?RALD LEAGUE.The followers of Mr. George Lansbury have continued to conduot their Meetings In Finsbury Park.     One of the speakers, H, J* Ste-nning, might have been prosecuted for what he said, under Regulation 27 of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, but it was thought that a prosecution would act as an advert-isement for the League, and do more harm than good.At another Meeting of the same League, in Philpott Street, Commercial Road, the audianoe was composed ohiefly of young&apos;Jews, who melted away when the collection was mentioned.At a Meeting in Finsbury Park on the 18th November, the raiding of the various Pacifist Societies was desoribed as a blow at liberty.     The speaker, Mr. H. J. Stenning, informed the audience that the Government oould find no evidence that money was received through Germany.JSJTORKERS&apos; FEDERATION.The Paoifist Meetings in open spaces in London are now encountering a good deal of opposition.     The Workers&apos; Suffrage Federation, which seems to be an ordinary Pacifist body, held a Meeting on the 4th November in Hyde Park.     The speaker, Miss Minnie Birch, was severely heckled, and had to be arrested for her own protection.     The greater part of her audience followed her to the Police Station, making hostile remarks.The Federation is trying to form a new Branch at Camberwell, and some of the noisy women, formerly convicted of disorder in connection with the Suffrage Movement, such as Clara Cole, Sylvia Pankhurst, and Isabel Shaw, are moving inthe matter.WOMEN&apos;S LABOUR LEAGUE.At a Conference held at Glasgow on the 17th, Resolutions were passed, urging the distribution of food by Local Authorities, immediate attention to the lack of housing accommodation, and the negotiation of Peace on a basis of inter-national co-operation.BELFAST VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.A new body styling itself the Vigilance Committee is becoming active in Belfast.     It is believed to be working in^conjunction with the Clyde Workers * Committee, as an off-shoot of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers of Belfast, The District C ommittee of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers ordered some of the representatives to appear before them, and explain the object of the new Movement, and a deputation, headed by Daniel MoGettigan, attended, but as a result of the interview, tho Amalgamated Society of Engineers wrote to their head-quarters in London, and reported that the Vigilance Committee was a body of no importance.     It has, however, some funds.     It recently gave a concert, at which expensive cigars and cigarettes were dispensed broadcast, and there is much speculation as to where the money comes from.     MoGettigan is believed to be a Sinn Feiner.     He has always been an agitator, and has openly declared that he las no loyalty to King or Country.     He served his apprenticeship at Harland &amp; Hl&apos;7oolf &apos;.s, and was subsequently at Cammel Lairds, and Vickers at Barrow, where he
-.vas on submarine work.     He is now employed by the Telegraph Contractor on a new oruiser at Belfast.WORKMEN&apos;S AND SOLDIERS&apos; COUNCIL.This Society has now no stated office, but appears to enjoy the hospitality of the British Socialist Party.     It has lately issued a long manifesto, entitled &quot;A Plea for a People&apos;s Peace&quot;, which contains the familiar warning that Peace will be made by the &quot;privileged diplomatic caste11, and that the people will be nothing but pawns in their hands.     They demand that the workers must press vigorously for an International Conference, and take the reins of Government into their own hands. It appears to be reoeiving but little support from soldiers,THE WORKERS&apos; COMMITTEE MOVEMENT.This body has made a good deal of headway during the last few weeks.     The younger engineers expeot to be called up early next year, and they are trusting to the Committee to protect them.     Kealey, of Manchester, says that he can use the high price of food at the right moment to stir the &quot;workers to revolt, and W. F. Watson has promised to throw his Amalgamation Movement into the Workers1 Committee, and support them as far as he can.THE ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION.A great effort has been made by this Union to get all the men working at Electriwal Power Stations to jcin it, on the ground that those who control electricity will control civilization.A man named Stavenhagen delivered a typioal revolutionary speech, and said he would decline to discuss matters in a friendly manner with employers, whom ho looked upon as the bitter enemy of his class.     All the speakers appeared to be Pacifist, and there were frequent dalls of &quot;Strike&quot; when the question of enforcing their demands was raised.     The Meeting was held at the Holborn Town Hall, on the 19th November, and admission was strictly by ticket, but means were taken for obtaining a transcript of the speeches.SOCIALISTS AND THE WAR.Mr. H. Morrison of the London Labour Party has been trying to turn the tables on the papers whach have raised the cry of &quot;Boloism&quot; by issuing a &quot;Special Bolo Number&quot; alleging that all social evils in London and mismanagement by the London County Council are due to &quot;Boloism&quot;.     The Northcliffe Press is held up to repro-bation as being run on similar lines to Bolo Pasha&apos;s activities in the French Press.    Mr. Morrison is spreading reports that in Labour Circles it is felt that loyalty to the Government has been strained to breaking point, and that in some trades the growing unrest is taking on a political rather than an economic colour. He thinks that a purely Labour Government is what is wanted.George Lansbury defends his pacifism on the ground that the country is already lost from a military point of view, and that England oan only retrieve her fortunes by making peace at once.     Like other pacifists, he declares that America has come in only for oommeroial reasons.
On the 10th November, Miss N. 0&apos;Shea of The Cottage, Cosham, gave notice to the Chief Constable, Portsmouth, that she intended to hold a meeting on &quot;A Negotiated Peace&quot; outside the Dockyard Gates.     The Chief Constable replied that no such meeting would be allowed, and the matter dropped.     Miss 0&apos;Shea is connected with Miss Maud Ethel Marsh, who is now remanded at Portsmouth for offence under the Defenoe of the Realm Regulations.Miss, Gertrude Agnes Ostler, of Penshurst, Harrop Road, Hale, Cheshire, was reoently employed under the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions as a Welfare Investigation Officer in the Manchester area.     She is a member of the Union of Democratic Control, and Women1s Peace Crusade Movement, and she used her official position for peace propaganda work.     Her case was brought to the notice of the Ministry of Munitions, who took immediate action.RUSSIAN AND JEWISH REVOLUTIONARIES.Dr. J. Gavronsky arrived recently in London from Petrograd, and said that he had a special mission from the Russion Provisional Government in connection with Russian Exiles in this country.     This man was formerly a member of Tchitcherine&apos;s Committee, which had its headquarters at Finsbury House, Finsbury Pavement.     A meeting was held at the Monnickendam Rooms, Leman Street, E., at which it was suggested that every,Je*j should prepare to fight for their own cause, but the meeting was not very well attended, and it may be said that there is now less unrest among the Russian Jews in the East End than at any time during the last few months.    The Russian Political Refugees Defence Committee, however, is protesting against the internment of Tchitcherine, Peter Petroff, &quot;Mrs.&quot; Irma Petroff, and other Russians.GENERAL.While it may be said that Pacifism is not making any marked headway, it is right to record a very remarkable rise in the deposits in the Savings Banks.     As the attached table will show, the excess of deposits over with-drawals rose between September and October from  1,915,000 in September to  2,225,000 in October.     It is true that in the same months there was a large rise in the investments by small investors in War Securities, as is shown by the attached table, but it would certainly appear as if for some reason the small investor has taken suddenly to show preference for Post Office Deposits at Plover War Securities at double the interest.     Efforts are still being made to discover the printer of the leaflet nDon&apos;t buy War Bonds&quot;, but hitherto without success.
