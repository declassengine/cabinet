AII263MEMORftHDUM FOR THE WAR CAB BEST.The entry of the United States of America into the war on the side of the Allies led to a concentration of German reser-Vists in Mexico early In 1917.The majority of these men are believed to be In the North of Mexico, but in the event of hostilities breaking out between Mexico and the United States of America it is feared that local desperadoes led possibly by Germans might attempt a raid on the Colony of British Honduras either with or without the assistance of the Mexican Government.The only forces available in British Honduras to resist ich a raid would be the local volunteers.    Steps have been and are being takBn to render these forces efficient and to bring their equipment up to datj.The situation has become more threatening during the last two months, there being indications that President Carranza in Mexico has been captured by the German element and is practically committed to war against the Allies.A Conference was accordingly held at the Colonial Office on the 29th October at which representatives of the Colonial Office, the War Offloe, the Foreign Office and the Admiralty were present and the whole position was considered.It was thought that the rainy season would prevent any land operations for the next three months:   and that the local forces oould deal with raiders until the battalion of the West India Regiment stationed in Jamaica could be sent over.    This could be done at from 7 to 10 days&apos; notice.    The possibility of an attack by water along the River Hondo was discussed and the ques-tion of the provision of armed launches to meet such a contin-gency is under oonsideration.In
In the event of open war with ];ezico and an attack in force on British Honduras further assistance might be required. But it is not considered either necessary or politically desir-able to raise the question of assistance by United States of America troops to repel raids.As regards the other neighbouring Central American Republics, Honduras has finally broken off relations with Germany,The president of Nicaragua is practically a nominee of the United States Government.The president of Guatemala broke off felations. with Germany on the 29th of April 1917.   He had declared a state of siege on the loth of April and on the 21st of April had conveyed to the acting Governor of British Honduras through the Commandants of the Guatemalan territory of Izabal an offer of every possible military assistance in case of necessity.   This offer,however, is probably not to be taken too seriously.San Salvador is strongly anti-American arid is rumoured to be coquetting with Mexico&apos;, but she experienced an earthquake recently which may have crippled her to some extent.In Mexico itself it is understood that rebel forces hold a large part of the Province of Chiapas and so command the approaches to Guatemala.   Under existing circumstances, there-fore, president Carranza could not attack Guatemala or British Honduras from that direction without first dealing with the rebels though it must be remembered that a popular war, such as that against the United States of America might unite all parties in Mexico.   On the other hand, Chiapas and Tabasco being in a state of unrest, raids from that quarter by gangs of desperadoes instigated by German agents are not impossible.. In Yucatan, which is the province of Uexico bordering on BritishHonduras
Honduras, the Mexican General is Jlvamdc.    He is said to have under his contend an -&amp;rmy&apos; of 6&quot;,000 men.   It is possible that he might be induced to side with the Allies against President Carranm. , He is understood to havB amassed a handsome fortune during his tenure fcf office in Yucatan, so that political rather than pecuniary assistance would perhaps be likely to carry the most weight with him.It has been thought desirable to acquaint the Cabinet with the situation of this British Colony, and at the same time tojraise the question whether&apos;&apos; it is advisable to attempt to influeooei1General Alv&amp;rado to declare himself in opposition, to the j?lans--6  the pro-Germans in Mexico,W.H.L.3.XII.17.ONIAL OFFICE,
