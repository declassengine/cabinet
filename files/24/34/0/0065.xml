1 ^\2864&apos;Jg ftiovemment.!CENSORSHIP OF LEAFLETS/7Referring to Mr. Herbert Samuel&apos;s letter on the above subject, already circulated, I assume thai the War Cabinet would desire to meet the objections of ex-Ministers, if this bah be done without weakening the regulations.    This is the more desirable as at the request of Mr, Adamson   the leader of the Labour Party, I have since rebfeived a deputation representing Labour Organisations who expressed a similar view.The main objection taken to the regulation is the requirement that leaflets should be passed by the PreBB Bureau, a requirement which would enable the Censor to forbid the issue of a leaflet although not offending against the regulations. Apart from the opinion of the Liberal ex-Ministers, this requirement has been found in practice to be somewhat inconvenient, as there are pamphlets&quot; which cannot well be stopped but to which it is undesirable to give an official sanction.    Such are oertain leaflets of the Union of Demooratic Control and Mr. Wells&apos; plea in favour of na reasonable peace&quot; pamphlets like these must of necessity be passed, and may afterwards be issued with a note that they have been allowed by the Censor.        Upen the whole I think that it would be an advantage to omit the words objeoted to, and to insert words requiring a leaflet to be submitted to the Press Bureau seventy-two hours at least before it is printed published or distributed.     This would give time for the authorities to consider the leaflet and in case it proves to be objectionable to take steps to prevent its issue.But I think that at the same time Regulation 27 should be strengthened.by inserting words which will make it an offence to spread reports or make state-ments intended or likely &quot;directly or indirectly to impede or interfere with the successful prosecution of the war&quot;.    These words would enable us to stop certain pamphlets and newspapers whioh are not now directly hit by the regulations, and the effect of the changes taken as a whole would be to increase and not to diminish our powers for dealing with objectionable literature.Words should be inserted exempting election literature from Regulation 27C; but the esemption for leaflets issued with the authority   of the Government (e.g. the publications of the War Aims Committee) should be retained.If the Cabinet agrees I propose to write to Mr. Samuel in the above sense.G, CAVE,th December, 1917,
