Haig-s Minute 0,A,Bo 720 of December 2nd, pointing out,(i)   that he has been obliged to use in the Cambrai battle troops destined to relieve the French;(ii)   that from the present British right to the sea there are :69 German divisions, of which 5 are Landwhhr,,from the French left to Switzerland there are : 79 German divisions of which 11 are Landwehrj(iii)   that while active operations are in progress he does not feel justified in carrying out any extension of his front;(iv)   he forwards correspondence which has passed between himself and General Petain on the subjecto2*     The history of the question is as followsThe British Government accepted the principle of taking over more line from the French at the Boulogne Conference on September 25th, 1917, the amount of the extension and the time at which it should take place being left to the Commanders-in-Chief *, 678. Cn the 19th October, 1917, Sir Douglas Haig informedGeneral Petain that the most he could do would be to use the four divisions to be relieved by the French on the. coast to extend his line to the Squill, and asked whether the VTar Cabinet would support him in this contention.On
On 24th October, 1917, tho War Cabinet decided that the extent to be taken over must be subject to the  . necessity for giving opportunities for leave, rest and training, and to the plan of operations for next year, and that in any case relief could not commence whilst offensives were in progress *On the 24th October this decision was communicated to Sir Douglas Haig,The latter then arranged to study with General Petain a possible relief down to the Barasis - St0 Gcbain railway.After the receipt of orders to send two divisions to Italy this offer was reduced to an extension down to the Basse Porct - Sta Gobain railway, and then only if no more divisions woro sent to Italy0The present situation is that, since the principle cf extending the line was accepted,, Sir Douglas Halg has been ordered to send five divisions to Italya   A sixth division (4th Australian) has been converted into a draft-finding unit, whilst as the result of the Cambrai battle his front will have been lengthened, necessitating the employment in the line of at least one more division than before the battle.     This makes a total decrease of the strength of the British troops on the Western front available for&apos; reserve or for extension of the line of seven divisions, while our troops have been fighting continuously from July 31st to the present time,Cn the other hand, the French advance on the Ailette on 18th and 19th October shortened their front by the equivalent of two divisions, and they have not fought since.     Further in the Ilorth, the French have relievedf our-
four of our divisions, whilo wo nave relieved six of theirs, giving them the advantage of two on balance. They thus have a relief of four divisions (two on the Ailette and two in the North) to set against tho six they have sent to Italy0The result of theso various changes is that, as compared with the situation before the Italian collapse;. the French are now two Divisions to the bad and we- are four Divisions to tho bad- plus the effect of thj Cambrai fightingu(Sdy) W.R.RobertsonaGeneral, C * I .G sS *War Office,6th December. 1917.* -

C.1/127/563.(See VJar Office letter O.l/lvC.27 of 2nd October,1917).You will notice in my letter Ho.0.A,D.678/3, dated 2nd NoArember, that I made the proviso &quot;that I am not called upon to send any additional divisions as reinforcements to those already despatched to the Italian front.   Since then I have been called upon to send four additional divisions to Italy, of which three have already been despatched or are in movement.GeneralToPctain (Copy at-tached)To GeneralPetain (Extract attached)To GeneralPetain (Copy at-tached)Further, it was agreed that no date of relief should be settled until after the Cambrai operation which was in course of preparation at the time. After the Cambrai operations had taken place I suggested to General Petain in my letter Ho. C.A.D.714,-dated 25th November, that the relief should commence on the 12th December and should be confined in the first instance to the front of one Corps (two Divisions).The enemy subsequently assumed the offensive in strength against the British troops on the Camera! battle front, and I was obliged to- use the two divis-ions, previously earmarked for relief of the French, as reinforcements In the battle.-&apos; I was therefore obliged to send my letter Ho. O.A.D.719, dated 1st December, to General Petain informing him that the relief must be held in abeyance.The ii.q,, First French Army and the First French Corps (four divisions) are being relieved in the Bix-schoote sector&apos; by British and Belgian troops on the 4th December.This is how the matter stands at the moment.In.connection with the question of extension of my front and relief of the French, I wish to draw your attention to the relative strength of the enemyas
as opposed to the French and British forces on the Western Front at the present time..   The following calculation Is madeFrom the present British right to the sea : 69 German divisions of which 3 are Landwehr.From the French JLeft to Swltzerland :.79 German divisions of which 11 are Landwehr.Under these circumstances and while active operations are In progress on the British front I do not feel justified in carrying out any extension in relief of French troops *(sd).

3 .678/:To:The Commander-in-Chief,French Armies of the North and North-hast.My dear General,I beg to thank you for your letters No, 26306 of the 23rd October and No. 36.560 of the 29th October, 1917.I have studied the question of the various reliefs involved in your proposals, and am prepared to carry them out in the following manner provided that I am not called upon to send any additional divisions as reinforcements to those already despatch-ed to the Italian front.2.     With regard to the Nieuport Sector, I propose that the relief of the British troops shall begin on or about November 17th, in order that the two divisions&quot;&quot;thus released may be available soon after for the extension of my front on the loft of the G.A.N.,   I have already spoken to General Anthoine on the subject and made provisional arrangements with him to the above effect.3.     The extent of front v/hich I can take over from the G.A-.-N. is limited not only by the number of troops at my disposal, but also by transportation resources.     As I have already informed you, I am prepared to extend my right as far as the River Oise;. and I can arrange to meet your wishes by also taking over a small sector South of the River.     As, however, I am unable to undertake any railway construction or maintenance South of the Amiens - Menessis Railway, it will be necessary for me to maintain my troops holding the front South of the River Oise by road and lorry from that line.     The extent of front, there -fore., which I can take over South of the River will be restricted by the above considerations.     The effect of this will be to limit the extension of the British front to the neighbourhood of the Basse Foret - St. Gobain Railway.Further, I should add that it will be impossible for me to undertake the maintenance of roads leading to the front South of the River Oise.The actual date upon which I can relieve the left of the GSA,N. will depend upon certain operations with which you are acquainted.     If these operations are not protracted, I should be- prepared to commence the relief during the last week of November.     In any eveiit you may rely on me to carry It out with the least possible delay&apos;.44     I shall be glad to hear as early as possible whether you are in general agreement with these proposals, so that the detailed arrangements can be made between our respective Staffs and Departments.,Yours very truly, &apos; (Sd)    D.

I shall be obliged if you will consider whether, instead of extending your front ail at once, it would not be preferable for you to extend your right gradually to the South, in such a way as to complete the relief at the time you have provided for.This manner of proceeding would have the advantage of allowing our armies to carry out in the most convenient manner the- operations necessary for the relief, and would enable the British troops arriving In this zone to become familiar with its conditions without undue haste.If you adopt this idea you&apos; could relieve the division on my left as soon as you desire.     The General Staff of the Army, which will replace the Third French Army, could instal itself in the Headquarters of this Army so as to ensure that it will exercise command of the sector from the time the first British units arrive.In order to allow, according to your request, that the details regarding the relief of -the Third French Army shall be arranged as soon as possible, I&apos;propose that the representatives of our Staffs and Administrative Services shall meet at my Headquarters at a date to be fixed by you after the 9th November.Your s s inc ore ly, (Sd.)

O.A.D. 678/6.11th November, 1917.From :-The Commander-in-Chief,British Armies in France..ToThe Commander-in-Chief,French Armies of the North and North-east.My dear General,I beg to thank you for your letter No.5010, dated 5th November.Since writing my letter No. O.A.D. 678/3, of the 2nd instant, I have been called upon to despatch an Army Headquarters to Italy.     General Rawlinson, who had already established his Headquarters at Bury with a view to studying the front at present held by the Third French Army, has therefore necessarily been withdravm to take command of the Second Army on the Flanders battle front.I hope, however, shortly to withdraw an Army Command from the battle with a view to studying the front of the Third French Army and will inform ycu when this can be done0In any event I beg to assure you that I shall do my best to meet your wishes, but you will doubtless understand that in the present uncertain state of affairs I cannot arrange anything more definite for the moment.Yours very truly,(Sd.)

From :    The General Commanding-in-Chief.To :       Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig,Commanding-in-Chief, the British Armies in France.Monsieur&apos;le Marechal,I thank you for the information you have sent me, by your letter of November 25th, on the subject of the withdrawal ofthe Degoutte detachment and the reliefs of the French 1st and3rd Armies.I have given orders for the French troops assembled in the Peronne region to evacuate it as soon as possible.   The Staffs and Services of the British 3rd Army have taken over their duties with a despatch for which I am grateful to you,I wish also to express to you my regret that circumstan-ces have not allowed the employment of the Degoutte detach-ment by the side of your troops.   The French Army would have been proud to take part in the exploiting of an operation which, by Its audacity of conception, by the excellence of its preparations, and by the extent of its results, will constituteone of the most marked successes of the year 1917,,I have no objection to make on the subject of the dateyou have fixed for the relief of the 1st Army.General Anthoine will be ready to carry out the movementsInvolved in this operation under such conditions as he may beinformed of by you later..It would be convenient, in order to avoid congestion onthe Nord railway system, that the units of the 1st Army shouldreturn   &apos;
return to the French zone hy route inarch,I should he grateful if you would have the possibility of their movement through the British zone looked into, and if you would authorise General Anthoine to order their several departure as soon as you consider their presence unnecessary from the point of view of the left flank of theBritish 2nd Army.The relief of the 2 left Divisions of the French 3rdArmy will take place commencing on December 12th as you propose,    I should be glad if this date could be advanced, to however small a degree.I ask you besides, in spite of the difficulties which this relief will cause you, not to defer the extension of your right to Barisis.     Information which I have lately received, bids me consider the possibility of German operations In Lorraine, in Alsace, or even against my right by way of Swiss territory, and consequently forces me to form a reserve consisting of as many divisions as possible; this is the reason -hy I attach such importance to the liberation of the units holding the front of the 3rd Army.Yours very sincerely,(Sgd.)     Petain.

Owing to the number of troops I havebeen called upon to despatch to Italy I have no other divisions available as the continued fighting on my Third Army front necessitates frequent reliefs there.Yours very truly, (sd) Dc HaigoFIe1d-Mar shalt
