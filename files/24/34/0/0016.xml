/3 -ljh   jvw** g jj^n (this Document is the Property cf^iJTo RrJtannic Maiestv&apos;s Government.)V0REPORT relating to the War Y/ork of the Board of Agriculture for /^/Scotland for the week ending 28th November, 1917.mm^Pood Production.1- Supply of Fertilisers.Considerable difficulty is being experienced by farmers in Scotland in obtaining adequate supplies of fertilisers.   The Board have for some time been collecting information as to the supply and demand in the various districts, and as soon as sufficiently complete information is available, the whole question of distribu-tion will be carefully considered in consultation with the Central Committees.   Printed circulars detailinr arrangements as to prices of fertilisers, and. copies of the Orders issued by the &quot;inistry of Munitions on the Bubject have been distributed by the Board.(a) Supershoaphate:The shortage is moot marked in the oase of Superphosphate. This is due to the difficult&apos;/ of netting shipments of raw Phosphate Rock,    The Board have made representation on the subject to the Ministry of Munitionc and the Ministry of Shipping, and it is hoped that a larger quantity of thi.: material than has recently been im-ported may in the near future be made available for Scotland.(b) Sulphate of Ammonia:Owing to the demand! of the Miniotry of Munitiona the quantity of thii). fertiliser available for agricultural purpocee is more limited than in former years.   The Board have been in communication with the Sulphate of Ammonia Distribution Committee who have been, able so far to arrange to mpply at leaart port of the requirements of the various districts. &apos;(c) Baaic Slag:The came difficulty iu not experienced in obtaining supplies of this fertiliser but the existing supply does not altogether oatiufy the demand.   Arrangements hare been made to grind and test a low-grade Slag produced by two firms in Lanarkshire with a view7 to ascertaining whether it is suitable for agricultural U3e.(d) r/apte Carbonate of Lime:In view of the shortage of lime for agricultural purposes the Board havo hc*d under consideration the question of U3ing the waste carbonate of lime produced at paper factories and tanneries and a: leaflet has been issued on the subject.   The Board have been in correspondence with District Agricultural Committees with a view to(a) persuading farmers to give the   material a thorough trial and(b) encouraging manufacturera to set up plant for turning out the lime in a condition suitable for agricultural requirements.(e) BIant-Furnace Dust:It has been ascertained that the dust taken from blast-furnace contains a not inconsiderable amount of potash and arrangements have been made to have a limited quantity of this material made available for distribution in Scotland.(f) Allotments:A   leaflet impressing upon allotment-holders the importance of combining their orders for supplies of fertilisers, seeds and plants and placing them without delay has been issued to various Associations, Town and Parish Clerks, etc.   A   leaflet on the subject of &quot;The Manuring of Gardens and Allotments&quot; has been prepared and widely distributed.2 7
2. Labour : Lambing Shepherds.In view of the great difficulties experienced last year by cheep-owners in obtaining sufficient skilled labour for the lambing season the Board, in conjunction with the Agricultural Section of the National Service Department (Scotland), have circularised District Agricultural Committees and Agricultural Sub-Commissioners with a view to ascertaining the probable amount of extra assistance required for next season,   ^tyien this hay been ascertained it it, proposed to approach the Military Authorities with a request for the temporary release from the Army of all skilled lamberi;.3. Cultivation of Lands (Scotland) Order.The Board have issued a ciroular to certain Town Councils requesting their views on the existing Cultivation of Lands Order which it is proposed to amend and re-i&amp;sue next year.4* Testing of Seeds Order 191? .Reference was made in last week1o report to the issue of this Order and to the additional work ---bich &apos;&quot;ill require to be under-taken by the Board1a Seed Testing Station in the analysis of samples for the Scottish Seed Trade.   The number of samples received to date is 1412, most of which have been forwarded during the past three weeks.    It may be mentioned that the average number of samples reosived annually prior to the present year was about 1000.   The pressure at the Board5s Station is therefore very great but additional staff and equipment are being provided and it is hoped that serious delays in furnishing merchants with the parti-cularo required by the Order *-&apos;ill be avoided.5. Wart Disease of Potatoes Order.The work of inspection under this Order has almost been com-pleted for the year and the Board regret to report that the number of scheduled premises in Scotland has increased during 1917 from 2574 to 5300.   A great variety of causes has contributed to this result   and it is hoped in subsequent reports to deal with these and also with the question of the measures that are to be adopted to prevent the further spread of the disease.Collection of Statistics and Returns relating to Agriculture.1* Annual Estimates of the Produce of CroLS.There is appended a cop;.&apos; of the Preliminary Statement of the Produce of &quot;wheat, Barley, Oats, Beans and Hay which has just been issued.   The figures were circulated with last weekfs report.There is aloo appended a Table showing the Produce and Yield of Potatoes, Turnips and Mangolds.   The yield per acre of both potatoes and turnips ie the highest on reoord, and the total produce of each of these crops has been exceeded only once - that of potatoes in 1889 and that of turnips in 1908.   The crop of potatoes this year is considerably more than double that of last year, while the turnip crop shon*s an increase of 36.7 per cent.
2. The Cropping Programme for 1918.There       Expended a Table shoving the acreage under crops (excluding rotation grasaeri and olo^ei) in each county in Scot-land in 1016 (column 3.), with the actual increase or decrease in 1917 (column 2) &amp;nd th3 inortsaoe in 1918 (as allotted to each county under the srrangeaiants for increased food production) as oomparol with 1917 (oclumr. 3) and 1916 (column 4).   The decrease of tho arba under crop in the oountieo of Berwick, Haddington, and Peebles ia understood te be due to the taking of land for military purposes.3. Potatoes (C-roy/ers1 Returns) Order 1917.The tabulation of the Returns made under the above-named Order is now practically finished, and the reaults *ill shortly be communicated to the Food Controller.III.

The total yield of Wheat, amounting to 304,000 quarters, exceeds that of last year by 21,000 quarters, or 7&apos;4 per cent.; the area under the crop shows a decrease of 2,150 acres, but the yield per acre is 4 bushels above that of last year, and is practically equal to the average for the last ten years. Bai-ley, with a total yield of 705,000 quarters, shows an increase of 58,000 quarters, or 9&apos;0 per cent.; the area under the crop is less by 10,600 acres, but the yield per acre is nearly 5 bushels over that of last year, and is, like that of Wheat, practically equal to the decennial average. The total yield of Oats, 5,447,000 quarters, is the highest recorded since the statistics of the produce of crops were first collected in 1885, and exceeds last year&apos;s yield by 919,000 quarters, or 20-3 per cent. The area under the crop is greater by 50,750 acres, while the yield per acre exceeds last year&apos;s by 5\ bushels and the decennial average by 3  bushels. The produce of Beans, 29,700 quarters, shows an increase of 5,300 quarters, or 21-7 per cent.; the acreage is greater by 722, while the yield per acre exceeds that of last year by 2  bushels and the decennial average by 2 bushels. The total produce of Hay, taking all kinds together, is 901,000 tons, which is less than that of last year by 134,000 tons, or 12-9 per cent. Hay from Rotation Grass shows a total yield of 657,000 tons, a decrease of 103,000 tons; the area shows a small increase, but the yield per acre, although only ^ cwt. under the average, is 5 cwts. under last year&apos;s yield. Of the other Hay, the total yield of which amounts to 244,000 tons, the ordinary Meadows yielded 141,000 tons, and the Timothy Meadows 103,000 tons; the former, with a decrease of 2,000 acres in area, shows a yield 6 cwts. under that of last year, while the latter, with an increase of over 3,000 acres, has a yield about ^ cwt. under last years. The average yield of the two together (which is not shown in the table) is 30-4 cwts., which is i cwt. above the decennial average.The estimates of the yield of the Potato and R,oot Crops will be issued shortly.Board of Agriculture for Scotland, 29 St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh, 26th November, 1917.(3253)-Wt. 5027/145 4000.   11/1917.
