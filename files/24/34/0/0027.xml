HIS ERITMIIC mMTTB OTSBBiST).IllRATIONIHG- AMD THE TRAHSPOftT OF FOODSTUFFS.4. e-artij* &quot;G T 28o7.MemorMdiin&apos;-by Professor Leofiexd..:Hiil..According to the estimates of the British&apos;Medical Journal, Nov. 17th, 1917, one-third of the energy value of the food required for productive work, would have to be made up out of non-rationed foods, if the Yapp rations were made compulsory.This estimate is not excessive as some of the Yapp rations are not fully available, e,g., margarine.The only foods non-rationed and available in large quan-tities   axe potatoes and turnip-swedes.   The nation is- told to use potatoes in place of cerealso   Tho water content of cereals-may be taken as 15%. of potatoes 75% and of swede-turnips 90too    Potatoes and&apos;swedes also pa,ck less closely than cerealso   To repla.ee then one-third of the energy value of the food now eaten m the form of cereals by potatoes requires the transport of a bulk equal to more than iwj^e^^e^t^t^^Jk^p^ cereals now transported, and three times the case o*f swede-turnips aIn a recent conversation at the Ministry of Shipping, my brother, Sir Norman Hill, informed me that the ten million urban population included in greater London can only be fed with bread in the way now co-ordinated by ships bringing cereals to the Thames   side elevators, where machinery passes it on to the mills and so to the bakeries.     It would be im-possible to feed London with cereals from other ports. Rail-way transport is inadequate and the supply of flour from the mills could not be worked in the reverse direction.   Grea.,ter Manchester and Liverpool form another ten million urban popu-lation; the Glasgow district nearly two and one-half million,. The great ports feed the dense populations around them.If we take the estimate that the total consumption of cereals per annum is five million tons, and that Greater London^ Liverpool-Manchester and Glasgow urban populations (22i million) consume one-half; then the bulk of potatoes sufficient to make good a one-third reduction of cereals in these populations is five million tons (twice the total bulk of cereals they consume*)The conclusion then is reached that an extra ton thousand tons of potatoes a day would have to be imported - and a still larger bulk of swede-turnips when the notaoo supply fails -by rail or road into the above urban districts *Supposing, in the compulsory ration, only ono-tenth of the energy value has to be made good, the required transport of potatoes and swedes would still be enormous.Sir Norman Hill tells me that it is far easier to bring wheat into London from Boston or New York than potatoes from Norfolk.   He says petrol is as difficult to transport as food;
therefore the road haulage of potatoes by petrol motors cannot be counted on.    The lessening of cereal consumption dees not set free carts suitable for the conveyance of bulky food stuffs such as potatoes or turnips .   Railway transport is strained and it does not appear to him possible that this can be made adequate to meet so great an extra demand.If economic conditions were uncontrolled, prices would naturally lead to the greater use of cereals in the densely populated urban districts surrounding the ports, and of potatoes in rural districts and in cities close to potato supplies .The conclusion seems inevitable that when compulsory rationing Is introduced, substitution of cereal by potato and turnip to any large extent is impossible, and the cereal supply by ship must be kept up for the dense urban popula-tions .   Sir Norman Hill tells me that the available shipping could be used with very much greater advantage than it is now , and that , by the setting free of steel supplies and the utilization of the home army for labour as well as defence, shipbuilding could be very greatly accelerated.   The diffi-culty , he says, in the completion of the American shipbuild-ing programme lies in the provision of trained seamen.CONCLUSIONS .By the more efficient use of shipping and the building of ships the cereal supply must be maintained and increased to balance the shortage of other foods if the urban pcpula-tion is to be properly fed, productive work not reduced and undustrial unrest prevented .To introduce anything like the Yapp ration compulsorily would be disastrous in the face of the unsolved difficulty of transporting potatoes and swede-turnips, the very bulky, but only available in large quantities, non-rationed substitute foods .The public in the dense urban districts cannot be expected to follow the Yapp ration , because they cannot obtain an adequate supply of substitution foods .(Signed) LEONARD HILL.November 27th, 1917.
Extract from&quot; a Memorandum, dated November 15th, 1917 &quot;by Sir ITorman Kill, as to the loss of steamship carrying power in the ten months, January to October, 1917, as corn-pared with the corresponding months of 1916, giving his o lo 1calculations.-First.    The loss of annual carrying power resulting from -       the net losses in Shipping Tonnage should have &quot;been more than made good by the concentration of Shipping on the shorter voyage trades.Second. In fact,  there has &quot;been a loss of annual carrying power amount in;-; to 22 per cent.Third. This loss of annual carrying power results from the increase in the time occupied in each round voyage.Fourth. There is little hope of the annual carrying power being increased by the addition of new tonnage, as the Government&apos;s Shipbuilding Programme has proved a failure.Fifth.    The time occupied in the round voyage must bereduced if the essential supplies of the nation are to be brought in.Sixth.   The effective organization of. the sailings of the Liner Tonnage referred to in paragraph 5 - that is,  the organization of about 30 sailings each week in the North Atlantic Trade - would cover about one-third of the total imports into the United Kingdom,  representing probably,-, considerably more than one-half of the total imports into the United JCingdom from the United States and Canada.
