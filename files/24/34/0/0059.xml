Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. GNW/004SECRET.WEEKLY   REPORT   Oil   NORWAY.    IV.(Nov. 30th,  1917)From a reliable Norwegian source it is learnt that the Nansen Mission to U.S.A. has not met with the success that was anticipated, tnd the Norwegirns uxe thereby proportionately discour ged.     It is believed that if the U.S.Government insists on forbidding the import of food-stuffs to Norway, and as the people htvc to live, the Government, which is at present strongly oro-Ally, owing to the Germr-n sinking of Norwegian ships, end loss of life and suffering entailed on their Nationals, may be driven against their ?/ill into the arms of Germany, who is offering them facilities for the imports tion of food stuffs, against the supply to them of fish, molybdenum, nickel, etc.     The same conditions, to a greater or lesser degree, apply to Sweden and Denmark.On the other hand the question of the Asland Islands has to be considered,     If Germany takes these Islands, it becomes a direct, menace to the freedom of the Baltic, and this, together with the reason stated above might drive the three Scandinavian States to side with Germany in the war.     This is the meaning of the meeting of the three Scandinavian Monarchs in Christiania, namelyto/arrive at a decision as to what course they should pursue in certain eventualities, and if possible to try to preserve their neutrality.Many Norwegians are of opinion that if the Scandinavian countries submitted to the American proposals, they would be driven auto-vatically into an economic war with Germany.As the feeling is prevalent that Russia will cease to be a Greattry to
- 2 *Power, it is thought that German dominion in the Baltic might devel-op into a sort of Hansa hegemony over Scandinavia.   The Stockholm &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; says that the Christiania meeting cannot possibly be.regarded as pro-German &quot;activism&quot; in disguise.     If this view be oorrect, the statement made that the meeting had been &quot;engineered&quot; by the German Minister in Stockholm would seem to be incorrect. The above mentioned paper continues :-&quot;If the Entente intends to continue the traditional policy of France in the Baltic, it must see that Sweden is enabled to maintain her independence towards our stronger neighbour in the South, who is now also in the East of the Baltic&quot;.By French policy sup-oorting Sweden against Germany is probably meant the policy initiated by Richlfceu in the 17th century, but the resemblance in striking with the situation in 1S55, when England and France backed Sweden and Norway against .Russia.   To-day Germany occupies, with regard to Sweden, the position formerly occupied by Russia.As far as food is concerned the position in regard to Norway is more acute than that of Sweden and Denmark.As regards the latter country it normally produces more than is required for its own consumption.     There is a considerable shortage of oils, fat and butter which are rationed in order to keep up the exports.   The Danish export of dairy produce in 1915 was  22.000.000 to Great Britain, against the total imports of ell sorts from Great Britain, of  7.000.000.As regards Sweden, the harvest has been a bad one- Potatoes have been imported from Germany, which country is anxious to ob-tain exports of iron ore from Kirmavara and Luossavara, ^nieh is of exceptional quality.As far as can be learnt from Norwegians themselves, they would not be prepared to go into the war on either side, if they could
^possibly avoid it.     It would be a mistake to assert that they are so pro-Ally in their sympathies that they would be ready to come in, on receiving a hint to that effect.     They would be prepared to put up with a great deal for the Allied cause, which is what Mr.. Gunnarr Kunsden, the Premier, meant by saying recently &quot;after all they had potatoes and herrings&quot;.1 (a national dish), but it must not be supposed that if the shortage of- food becomes very acute, owing ta what they suppose, rightly 4r wrongly, is the fault of the Allies, that their neutrality might not be seriously threatened.It is evident that the situation in Norway is urgently demanding a solution.    Every day it is reported that a hundred workmen here, and a hundred workmen there, are dismissed from the saw-mills, planing mills, etc., because the Entente countries will not issue licenses for importing timber from Norway^    Other factories are stopping because of lack of lubricating oil.   &apos; The fishing fleet has to keep in harbour because cargoes of paraffin and benzine had been bought in the United States, and although Norwegian steamers were lying ready to carry those cargoes, yet the export from America wa&amp; prohibited.     The situation in reflected in reports from labour exchanges.    While last year the number of situations vaoant far exceeded the supply of labour, now the positions are reversed. The Anglo-Norwegian Trade Journal for November points out that&quot;If the United States and Great Britain put too great a pressure upon Norway, demanding an entire break with those agreements which have been entered into in the past, they may force Norway, to resign herself to her fate, making the best possible arrangements with her Scandinavian neighbours and elsewhere.    While Norway would suffer rauoh through this there can be no doubt but that it would also militate against the objects which the Entente have in view, and wauld create in Norway a sense of grievance due to feeling themselves treated with undeserved injustice ahd ingratitude&quot;.
A very interesting debate took place in the Storthing on November2th on the subject of Norway1s food supply, and the United Stateslots, in the cousse of which M. Kowinckel, the President, said -&quot;The negotiations with America are the central point. We did not approach America as beggars.     We have rendered, and can render, the Western Powers services, and if we come to an agreement it will be as our right, and not as a favour.     But an agreement with America would be paid for too dearly if it were to be at the expense of our neutrality or a rupture with the other Northern Powers.     This view is shared in its main features bv the majority   of the Storthing and the Norwegian Government.     We wish together to maintain peace&quot;.At the formation of the Liverpool branch of the Norwegian Chamberf Commerce 1ST.  .F. unds9n, past president, said :-&quot;When you hear various things stated in the press about the neutral there is an unfortunate tendency to lumo them together, which is very unfair to Norway.     During the war we have heard a great deal about the rights of small nations.     Hardly any speech is mrde by the v: rious states-men representing the Entente countries which does not in-elude the assertion that they are fighting for the freedom of the small countries.     Germany, on the other hand, points the finger of scorn at the sufferings of the small countries which are attached to the Entente and comperes this with the position of Bulgaria.     In small countries which are still neutral there are a number of sceptics who, while strongly condemning the German brutality, yet ask themselves whether all Great Powers are not really alike at heart:   whether they are not just out to do the best they can for themselves.     They recollect how Denmark was left to her fate by those very Powers who claimed to be protec-tors of small nations in 1863.     They are inolihed to be somewhat sarcastic when British statesmen make much of the fact that they are fighting for Belgian liberty.     They ask themselves whether Great Britain is not really fighting to protect herself agrinst having the German Emoire extended to the coast of Flanders and Calais, and for nothing else. And yet, at the back of it all, the majority feel instinct-ively that Great Britein, France, and the United States arethe natural protectors of small nations;........ Vie havoconsistently tried to secure fair representation of British policy in Norway.     We try to counteract the insidious propaganda which is trying to draw Norway within the orbit of the Central Europe scheme:   the cry now, is not only Berlin - Bagdad, but North Sea - Bagdad........ Norway mustnot become an &quot;entrepot&quot; for goods intended for Germany.....No one has any right to say that a small nation with an annual Budget of  8.000.000 shall join in a war which is costing Great Britain this amount a day.     This is the humiliating position in which the small nations find them-selves, through no fault of their own.   .They almost become a danger to themselves and to others&quot;.
The Norweigan papers of November 16th report the sinking of a 4convoy of/ships.     This is believed not to have been reported in the English papers.The Seandinavian Interparliamentary Council has summoned an extra-ordinary meeting at Christiania for the beginning of December.A Stockholm paper of November 86, reports that the people of the Aaland Islands resolved to send a deputation to the Swedish Government to state that the islanders desire to be reunited to Sweden.The Norwegian papers to hand to Nov. 23 are mostly preoccupied with questions arising out of the shortage of supplies, -jad consequence slack-tags of the labour market.This want of employment is now most appreciable among the seafaring class, bakers, iron workers, and generally unskilled labourers.      It is thought that want of employment will be very general this winter.The shortage of oil has caused considerable ir.-( nvenience, especially in the North.     It is stated (Morgenblad Nov. 22) that taking the fish oil output at 8.000 tons a year, some 2660 tons may be allocated for industrial purposes.   How very inadequate this is, the paper says, is shown by the mere faot th?..t the soft soap industry fUone requires 6.000 tons r. ye?..r.     Alongside this st\tement, there are published details of e;me million and o half barrels of herrings, bought cn behalf ?f the British Government, which are warehoused, and have been allowed to become rotten and no longer fit for human food.     These could be used in the fish oil factories, of for the making of food for cattle, but it is stated that the British owners will not sell, end do not care about the forage difficulties, which each day become more intense.   A new system of making margarine from fish oils is said to have recent!&quot;&apos; been perfected, and this consequently increases their value. Mention has previously been made of the German &quot; Central einkauf Gesellschaft&quot;.   This company, as such, is now about to be disolved
but it is suggestive - what chance have Norwegians against such an industiral invasion with the command of enormous capital.    The -company may he diso&amp;ved, hut the organisation remains, divided into smaller companies which are different only in name, and just as effec-tive, their agents being placed all along the coast.     This condition is worst in Finmarken and gives rise to black-listing, the procuring of information, etc., etc.&quot;Sabotage&quot; on an extended scale is reported by the &quot;Christiania Portland Cement Babrick&quot;.     A German violinist, l!ax Halpanz, who played in the Theatre Orchestra at Trondhjem, has been arrested as a spy, (Nov. 81) and 2 others, assistants.     A new discovery is reported of a method of employing acetelyne gas, without water for large motor boats, mot^r cycles etc.     Cylinders to hold this gas it is stated can be procured up to 60.000 litres capacity.The body of C.35.Ward, one of the crew of the British destroyer &quot;Mary Rose&quot; which was sunk in the North Sea on Oct. 17, has been washed up in the Trondhjem Fiord.It is reported (Nov. 30) that the result of the meeting at * Christiania has been the declaration of the 3 Scandinavian Governments, each for itself, to observe in the utmost degree their neutrality towards all belligerent Powers, and secondly to assist one another with merchandise during the present difficulties; thirdly the desir-ability of co-operation between the two countries was expressed. Representatives will assemble immediately to facilitate the exchange of merchandise in the most effective manner.The Norwegian Commercial ?leet on Nov. 1, aggregated 2.105.000 tons, and 3273 ships.   During October 31 ships of 44.440 tons were lost from war causes.   The nett loss, after allowing for new construction, was 21.140 tons,A Scandinavian Peace Conference will be held at Christiania on Dec. 3 &amp; 4; 25 delegates representing the 3 Scandinavian countries will attend.j * * * m on        -:0m
