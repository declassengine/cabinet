The danger will be averted if the Government1s Home Hule Bill satisfies the Irish people and is passed quickly into law - an &quot;if,&quot; however, which makes the prospect in that direction exceedingly uncertain.     The surest safeguard against the menace which yesterday1s decisions have created will be a sensible and intelligent use by the Government and the Irish people of the weeks hich must elapse before conscription can be enforced;   we may count, perhaps, on an interval of not less than a month.    $he Rationalist plans for resisting conscription have not been announced, but we may suppose that tho persons? &amp;ay and ecclesias-tlcal. who have accepted the serious responsibility for yesterdayJs decisions will accept also the responsibility for discouraging deeds of passion and lawlessness during the next   few weeks. The Government cannot&apos; cancel its conscription proposals in the face of the present throats - that would be aa act of fatal weakness in Ireland and an aot of treachery to our Armies in Prance - but it can give   tho Irish people and their loaders a last opportunity to oscape from a truly miserable position, Tho introduction of the    Home Hule Bill should bo accompanied by a final appeal for voluntary recruits from&apos; Ireland, and this appeal should be at once generous and intelligent.     We all admit now that many mistakes were made in the earlier recruiting campaigns.    Political prejudices wore ignored, and too little attention was paid to those national instinctst which all Irish-men, whether from north or south, possess in commons    fhe new appeal should avoid all the old mistakes.    It must be such a call as will make young Irishmen at homo ashamed to l&amp;avo&apos; the young fighting men of Ire lend, England and franco in the lurch*If that appeal is made, simultaneously with the lit reduction of a just measure of Homo  hxlo, can tho $atlonaiiist Naders reject it?    Are there not, rather, a hundred cogent reasons why they must accept it?    If they accept it, they will bo false to no decision which they made yesterday.     Thcs? will improvo immoaaur-ably the prospects of th* Homo Hule Bill.     They v&amp;ll give a mag-nificient impetus to- the healing work of tho Irish Convention.$hoy

It is almost eertain that, if the forces which united yesterday to defy oon-script ion, will unite to-morrow to answer the OeYer:ameat?* appeal for recruits, at Imet five divisions of Irish volunteers! oaa o^ raised wlt&amp;in tho next few weeks *    On the other hand, if a last apptal       voluntary recruits le Ignored by the Church.* ^turned aownwbf the Nationalist leaders, and Boycotted by tho younfc men of $ationaliet Ireland - what then?    2ben ws chall see no hope at all for Ireland,   either in the insaediate or in tho distant future.    Such a rejection would create the worst possible atmosphere for the Home Rule Bill - tho sole barrier against the chaos which is threatened by yesterday1e decisions. If the Sovez^nment is compelled to enforce oonseripticn in this country and meets with any general resistance, Home HuXe will receive its ouietuj^ and Ireland, so far as the interest and sympathy of tSoTree nations are concerned, will bo as dead as tho moon*    Eor soul, will perish in a sordid and, perhaps, bl&amp;od^stalned confusion at the moment when the defeat of &amp;ermany8e ambitions will make the world young a^ain - a place of boundless possibilities for the triumphant civilisations of Burope and i$erica,     If Ireland refuses to seni hor sons to 1 ranee, either as honourable volunteers or as honourable oon-scripts, she will forfeit the good-will of tho United States and nea&amp; never look again for help or sympathy to the demooraey of Bsglend*    She has to-day what seems to be her very last opportunity of saving her honour and preserving her peace * We hops most earnestly that the (rovsrnment will make that oppose tunity easy for h^r and that she will accept ite^
