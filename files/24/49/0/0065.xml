^H^jOCmmT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ;sjLiLJLiJL.I.T. 4365,.WAR CABINET.THE NEW HUNGARIAN PREMIER.Note by Political Intelligence DepartmentThe following Reuter wire dated Zurich, April 24, appeared in this morning1b papers:&quot;Count JoBeph Serenyi is the new Hungarian premier.   He was Minister of Commerce in the wekerle Cabinet, and is well-known in Swiss banking circles as being closely connected with the Deutsche Bank in Berlin.   He recently took a prominent part in the negotiations for the acquisition of the Roumanian oilfields;&quot;The Vienna correspondent of the 1Neue Zurcher Zeitung&apos; aays that Count Serenyi is extremely friendly to Germany and &quot;persona gratissima&apos; at Berlin as an advocate of the !Mittel-Europa* policy, but that he will probably meet with deter-inined opposition from Count Karolyi and the Socialist parties.&quot;It is obvious that two different men have been mixed up in this wire - Mr. Joseph Szterenyi and Count Bela Serenyi.Mr, Joseph Szterenyi is one of the most prominent economists and financiers in Hungary, well-known in parliament and in the press as perhaps the chief Hungarian supporter of Central European union. On the last reconstruction of the Wekerle Cabinet he became Minister of Commerce.   He is by race a Jew.Count Bela Serenyi belongs to one of the oldest aristocratic Magyar families.   They own large landed estates in Hungary and also in Moravia.   Curiously enough, a Moravian cousin of Bela Serenyi, the Count serenyi who is &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (chief of the autonomus authorities) of Moravia considers himself a &quot;Bohemian&quot; of that peculiar feudal type as described in our report No. 3 on &quot;Count Czernin and the Czechs&quot;.    (The wife of this Moravian Serenyi was born a Comtesse Harrach and is a sincere sympathiser with the Slovak national movement.)    Count Bela Serenyi himself is the thorough orthodox Magyar jingo; otherwise he is an uncertain quantity.   His position.of aristocrat and big landed proprietor is with him a kind of profession, and his faith.   He originally belonged to Tisza&apos;s . party but was never a Tisza puppet - for that he thinks too much of himself as an aristocrat.On the whole his appointment - for there can be no doubt that it is he, and not Joseph Szterenyi, who has been entrusted, with the formation of the new Hungarian Cabinet - can be described as a Court appointment,  Conservative but non-committal.    This is an attempt to steer round the difficulties which arise out of the bitter personal feud between Tisza and his opponents.April 36th, 1918.
