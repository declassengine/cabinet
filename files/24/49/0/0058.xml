CZERNIN AND GERMANY

All indications point to the conclusion that the resignation of Czernin and the events which caused it have been for Berlin a bombshell quite as serious in its effects as the Lichnowsky disclosures, if not more serious. Clemenceau&apos;s coup has certainly succeeded to the fullest extent. It looks as if he had even disarmed criticism legarding the suthenticit, of the Emperor Charles&apos; letter. There has been plenty of such criticism and it was natural and plausible. But there is an undercurrent in the comments, particularly of the shrewd Jowish press (e.g. Berliner Tageblatt and Frankiurter Zeitung), which conveys the feeling that it is not worth while, after the explosion at Vienna and Czernin&apos;s resignation, to devote more labour to challenging the authenticity of the letter. Indeed the tactics of leaving it open to the public to accept or reject the authenticity of the letter seem to be adopted. The lesson for the Emperor Charles would then be all the more severe. He would be put on his good behaviour for the future.

Thus, without explicitly assuming the authenticity of the letter and while apparently building on the view, now officially accepted, that Charles wrote a different, but still an imprudent letter, to Prince Sixte, the Vienna Correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung, the best autbority, frankly ex-pounds the full gravity of Czernin&apos;s resignation. Czernin appears to have attacked Clemenceau in entire ignorance of what his own Sovereign had been doing and "in ignorance of the fact that our enemies possessed very dangerous weapons".
Then there were bis reckless attacks upon the Czechs in his Kathaus speech, End finslly - what for Berlin is most important - the opinion of &quot;those who regarded mnohjtf the contents of the telegrams e:-changed between the Emperor Charles rntl the Kaiser as wronp&quot;.In fact there is under the surface deep dissetis-faotion and disquietude in Vienna and cmonp all the Germen parties there.     In Berlin the resignation may lead to initiatives which are not to be expeoted from the slacker Austrian Germane. The character of the Emperor Charleshas heen revealed by this episode and it is probable that the Kaiser end the German Government v.ill have less hesitation than ever in openly applying: the screw to Vienna whenever they think it expedient.     It remains to be seen whether this situation can indefinitely continue, if tho war is prolonged.     It may beoome so iatolerable for the Hofburg that the cbanoe either of the Austrian Socialists or of tho Nationalist Parties will arrive.    The Kaiser sees the dangers of Czernin&apos;s resigna-tion and has bestowed upon him the Iron Cross of the first olass intending it doubtless as a testimonial to hie doubtful fortitude as an instrument of the &quot;German peace&quot;.The fall of Ozernin is employed on tbo other hand by the Pan-German and militarist detractors of Ktthlmann as an encouragement for their schemes.     &quot;So perish all who dothe like again&quot;.But there is evidence that the German porei^n Office, unable to oppose any open resistance to the Hindenburg-Ludendorff policy of a militarist &quot;German peaoe&quot; is redoubling-its efforts through agents and neutralB in Switzerland to bring about &quot;conversations&quot; with the enemy.     Czernin tried to help this policy by his speeches, ineffective though they wero for the purpose in view.,     The German elements which
Sinde what precodos was written, news has arrived from the Hague to the effect that  ecordinf to frontier telerrams the German Government has decided to take proceedings egxinst Erzberger &quot;for his part in the Austrian efforts towards peace last summer and in the spring oi this yoar&quot;.     Count Reventlow, in the Pan-Gorman Deutsche Tageszeitun^,, gives the story of v/hat Erzbcrger is accused of having&quot; done.     He is made responsible   * for tho &quot;Peace Resolution&quot; passed by the Reichstag last July 19. He managed to secure the support of the Centre for the resolution by producing a letter which hed been addressed by Czernin to the Emperor Cberles and in which Czernin declared that Austria desired ^ecce rnd must heve it jefore the winter of 1917.   Erz-bergcr added that he had been &quot;authorisec1 from an authoritative quarter to read out this letter.&quot;It was evidently assumed that the authorisation came from Czernin himself, but it is now denied from Vienna tnat Czernin ever gave Brzberger cny such letter.     It is not, hov/eVer, denied that such a letter was written and the suggestion ic that a copy of it might have reached ^rzberger indirectly.It remains to be seen whether the threat to prosecute Srzberger will be carried out and, if so, whether the Reichstag will submit to this proceeding.     If there is a public trial, which in any case is rather unlikely, it ought to bring important dis-closures regarding the policy of Austria end ^ustro-German rela-tions during the last twelve months.still hope for some result from such efforts are for the moment oast upon their own resources.     The Charles-Clemenccau episode has made their position more and more difficult in the face of the predominance of the military party and its backers.
