Confidential.Political Intelligence Department,April 26th, 1918.Foreign Office.AUSTRIA/004.10MemorandumonUNREST   IN   AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.The following statements appear in the Vienna &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; of March 26 in connection with the Emperor1s journey to Bohemia.     &quot;From all parts of the mountains surrounding Bohemia Insistent requests arrive from the German population for help in their misery.    All details which have become known since the accounts given in the Upper Chamber by Count Nostitz and Abbot Helmer have deepened the impression produced by these speeches. Suffering is especially great in the Erzgebirge, the Riesengebirge and the Bohemian Forest.    In certain parts of these territories the mortality has risen in an appalling degree, and a new disease claims there many victims.     Professors of the German University at Prague have taken up the matter in the Supreme Sanitary Council and have explained that the new disease is entirely due to in-sufficient and improper feeding.    The government has united the seventeen political districts of Western Bohemia into One economic unit in order to pool the resources of the suffering and the food producing districts.     The German-Bohemian Relief Committee of the Upper House has done remarkable service.     BUt the misery is so great that it oould not be relieved      The Emperor is to spend two days in Bohemia.&quot;The following wire from Zurich appears in the &quot;Times&quot; of April 24:&quot;The Austrian Minister -of Railways announces the complete suspension of passenger traffic on the Northern Railway in con-sequence of the shortage of coal due to the miners&apos; strike.&quot;     This is the first we hear about a miners&apos; strike in Austria.
Some of the evening papers on April 22 published the following paragraph;&quot;In East Galicia the movement assumes the character of a social rising against the large Polish landowners in favour of the dllvision of land.&quot;     The Bolshevik movement is thus obviously spreading from the Ukraine into the Ukrainian parts of East Galicia - which was only to be expected.In last night&apos;s wires it was stated that the Austrian Premier, Dr. von Seidler, has promised to the Polish members of the Austrian Parliament that the administration of Galicia should be handed back to the Poles.     This may please the Polish gentry and intelligentsia in Galicia but will have no influence on the revolutionary movement among the Polish peasants and workmen and will drive the Ukrainians into sheer frenzy.     The Ukrainians who form about 80 per cent of the population of East Galicia would prefer any, even a military government, to that of the Polish landowners.     Until now they entertained hopes for a division Of Galicia into an Ukrainian and a Polish part.     Should dominion over the entire country be once more conceded to the Poles nothing will be left to the Ukrainians but revolution.     Whilst the Polish masses in Galicia hardly share the Jingo interest of the Polish gentry   and intelligentsia in East Galicia, to every Ukrainian peasant the problem of East Galicia is of vital importance. Should they obtain self-government within that province a new era would start fpr the Ukrainian peasants and the Polish landowners would get the time of a toad under the harrow; i.e., the relations between peasants and landowners would be inverted.The news from Hungary is very confused.     From last nightfs wires it appears that great excitement prevails among the working olasses in view of the possible return of the Tisza regime, and that attempts are made by the Emperor-King in favour of a Coalition Cabinet and compromise on electoral reform.     Obviously Charles
is being driven in opposite directions by the fear of the Germans and by the fear of revolution.     He has taken a few steps towards Tisza to placate Berlin^ but does not dare to go the whole lengthy and even steps back because of the consequences which that might have at home.It is difficult to see how revolution in Austria-Hungary or anywhere else can become effective unless the army joins in, and we have no reliable information about conditions in the Austro-Hungarian army.     It is however impossible to assume that con-ditions of misery and general unrest at home should leave the soldiers unaffeoted.If ever a country was ripe for revolution Austria-Hungary is it now.     And the last stage which usually precedes revolution seems to have set in - the people at the top are losing their heads.    Yet it is equally hard to see how revolution in Austria-Hungary can be avoided, and how, in view of Germany^ strength and oontrol, it can break out and be effective.26.4.18.
