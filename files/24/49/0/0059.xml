[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]32 191Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1918.SECRET.j -U^SM^coj^AVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No.48.Week ended, 20th April, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Mines have been laid in the Heligoland Bight and in the approach to the Baltic.    North Sea.On 15th April the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron undertook a sweep of the Cattegat, and sank 10 enemy trawlers by gunfire. No other enemy vessels were seen. The trawlers were apparently unarmed, and being used as look-outs ; 10 skippers and about 100 men were taken prisoners.On the morning of 20th April one of our large America seaplanes, on patrol from Yarmouth, sighted. an enemy force of two battle cruisers, four light cruisers and eight destroyers 20 miles off Terschelling. steering east.   Our seaplane was fired at by the * destroyers but was not hit.In the afternoon of the same day five of our destroyers sighted four enemy destroyers about 15 miles north-east of Terschelling Island. The enemy proceeded east at full speed and were pursued by our force until a large number of enemy ships were seen to be approaching. One enemy destroyer was hit at extreme range. The destroyer &quot; Sturgeon &quot; was hit in the engine room, but suffered no casualties, and was taken in tow by the light cruiser &quot; Cleopatra &quot; and reached port safely.On the night of 17th-18th April the monitors &quot; Terror,&quot; &quot; Erebus,&quot; &quot;Marshal Soult &quot; Flanders and &quot; Prince Eugene,&quot; supported by three small monitors, one division of destroyers, area, four torpedo boats and eight motor launches carried out a bombardment of Ostend and enemy batteries in the vicinity.   The enemy batteries replied, but no ships were hit.Early in the morning of 18th April one or two enemy destroyers fired a few rounds into Adinkerke and retired.The weather generally has been unsuitable for dying, but R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, employed on naval duty have carried out several patrols and reconnaissances. On 19th April four 230-lb. bombs were dropped on enemy trenches near Nieuport.  -On 20th April four 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to an enemy trawler north-north-east of Zeebrugge Mole.On 20th April H.M. trawler &quot; Nomitor &quot; was mined about 7 miles from Orfordness Casualty, and sank.   The skipper and four men were killed.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review 14 to 16 large enemy submarines have been located, Submarines four of which were of the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot; type.   Of these latter one was operating, operating about 200 miles west of Finisterre, one in the vicinity of Madeira, one off Sierra Leone, while the fourth, outward bound, only left port at the end of the week.In Home Waters activity was experienced chiefly on the Holyhead-Kingstown route, in Lyme Bay and at the western end of the English Channel, and to some extent in the North Channel.   The North Sea has been markedly quiet/The &quot; Deutschland &quot; type submarine^ operating to the west of Finisterre attacked a convoy by torpedo and sank one ship off the coast of Portugal, this being the first recorded occasion on which a submarine of this type has operated against a convoy.(0 1108)   wt.      55  4/18   h*s

The percentage of losses to sailings in Overseas trades is 3.11 as against 2.22 last week, in Cross-Channel trades is .16 as against .09, and in Coasting trades is 1.30 as against .35, the percentage of losses to sailings, as regards all United Kingdom trades, being 1.63 as against .93 the previous week.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all merchant vessels, Foreign as well as British, sunk, damaged, and unsuccessfully attacked in the last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine, classified according to areas.-It will be observed that the total number of attacks is this week much smaller than, in the previous week, particularly is this so as regards the ocean routes and also in the

The attacks in the Mediterranean which have up to the present been reported, are also less numerous this week, and it is only in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel area where activity has been very great. &apos;The ratio of losses to sailings of British and Foreign merchant ships engaged in United ProportionKingdom overseas trades during the three months of January, February and March last, of convoyedas regards both convoyed and non-convoyed vessels, is shown in the following tables    &apos; and non&quot;G convoyedvessels lost.CONVOYED VESSELS.
ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. There has been a further increase in enemy minelaying activity during the week under review. In Home Waters mines have been laid in the Lerwick, Kirkwall, Harwich and Dover areas, and in the North Sea some distance east of Montrose, but no reports have been received of mines laid in Foreign Waters which are within British zones of responsibility. The minefield laid this week off the East Coast of Scotland was in waters likely to be traversed during Fleet movements and which are also on the Scandinavian convoy routes.Casualties.

Further, the cutting of these mines has resulted in the discovery at different times of new minefields in three sepafate localities.The development of the installation of this gear is being pushed forward as rapidly as possible.MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.During the week 13 enemy merchant ships arrived at, and 10 sailed from, Norwegian Merchant-ports outside the Cattegat.   No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam. men.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.All the large ships of the Russian Baltic Fleet have now reached Kronstadt, and practically all the destroyers and submarines have also arrived or. are on their way there. The Naval Attache reports that 160 vessels of all descriptions are still proceeding through the ice from Helsingfors to Kronstadt; some are short of coal, but assistance is being sent to them. Should the Germans and White Guards occupy Petrograd, it is hoped that the more valuable ships will be destroyed, although no definite promise of destruction has yet been obtained. Tremendous efforts were successfully made at Reval, Hango and Helsingfors to prevent the ships in those ports from being captured, and the destruction of our submarines at Helsingfors is reported to have had considerable moral effect on the Russian sailors.With regard to the Black Sea&apos; Fleet the enemy failed to capture the warships which were at Odessa, as they were successfully evacuated to Sevastopol. At Nicolaev the enemy obtained possession of two submarines under repair and one oil-tanker ; and, in addition, the following ships which wercunder construction : One Dreadnought battleship (launched October, 1916), four light cruisers (one almost completed, two unlaunched), four destroyers, two submarines (one almost completed), and four Holland-American type submarines (one launched and the remainder in packing cases).The whole of the remainder of the Black Sea Fleet, consisting of two Dreadnought battleships (each now having a crew of about 300 men), seven pre-Dreadnought battleships, four cruisers, thirteen oil-burning destroyers and twelve submarines, are at or near Sevastopol, except four destroyers which are at Batum and Novorossisk.(0 1108)   , A 3
Recent- indications show that the Central Powers, with the aid of Turkey, are to attempt the occupation of the Crimea, in which case it seems probable that the ships at Sevastopol will fall into their hands. The enemy appear to be concentrating their naval units at Odessa, where the Turkish cruiser &quot; Hamidieh &quot; and one or two of their destroyers, and also four monitors and four smaller craft of the Austrian Danube Flotilla, have already arrived.The food ships have now left Murmansk with an armed escort, and are nearing Arch-angel, where the local Executive Committee are using their influence with the Central Authorities to facilitate the exchange of the stores. Endeavours are being made to arrange for the guarding of the Murman Railway by the Czech Corps, which is now at Omsk, and consists of 45,000 men who are willing to fight the Germans.Italy.On the 16th April the Italian submarine II5 was unfortunately torpedoed and sunk in the Adriatic by the British submarine Hi, the captain, second in command and three of the crew being saved.Naval Staff,25i* April, 1918.[Appendices.
