In so far as the Greek Government can supplement the ration Of fresh or frozen meat for- the troops in the &quot;war zone from local sources, it should maks purchases for this purpose under conditions approved of by the Inter-Allied Commission at Athens.   Payment for the meat so provided to come from Allied funds *     Meat provided locally for&apos; the Greek Army outside the war zone to be bought by the Greek Government subject to the approval of the Inter-Allied Commission and to be&apos;.eharged to the Greek loan of 750,OCX),000 francs.I (4)   I reeemiaend that the following clause take the placei1    of the Original Article 6 in the Draft Agreement of March 9tk, 1918, which has not been-approved of by the British Govertimetri-t*YX*   As regards the Articles which it was suggested in the Agreement of 5th September that the American Government should provide, the supply of all except sugar, meat and coffee has already been undertaken by the British and French Governments to be paid for out of credits to be opened by them under the same con-ditions as those applying to the payment of other imported supplies.

British War Office will furnish as such as it car.; the Greek Government to supply the balance from local re-sources,  subject to the approval of the Inter-Allied Oommission.   In view of the original expectation on the part of the Greek Government that the whole of these sup-pi: es would he imported, it is agreed that the meat supplied locally for the War zone shall be paid for out of the special credits furnished by the Prench and British Governments and not out of the loan of 750,000,000 franc3, without prejudice to the general principle that Army supplies purchased within Greece itself are a charge on this loan.In case of need for the purchase of any item of equipment or supply not already covered by the above provision, the Greek Government should, in the case of articles to be purchased outside Greece,  apply to the British and  Tench Governments through the Inter-Allied Commission at Athens.    In the case of any purchases in Greece itself for utilisation in the vrar zone which have a special character similar to the purchases of meat justi-fying the same financial conditions as have been applied to meat, application for approval should be transmitted to the British and French Treasuries through the Inter-Allied Commission.&apos;1(Initialled)   J.C.
