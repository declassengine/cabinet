The Board are proposing to refer appli-:cants to the Secretary of the local District Agricultural \.Committees for supplies of the aforementioned forms.With a. view to standardising the scrutiny the Board thought it advisable to set forth in detail (as shown below) of worker can be considered to be highly skilled workers and under what conditions such workers can be &quot;irreplaceable and essential for the cultivationhavewhat classes agricultural be deemed to &quot;of the farm.&quot;1.   A highly skilled Agricultural worker must be either(a) a ploughman or horseman - capable of handlingefficiently a pair of horses for every kind of field work,or (b) a general skilled worker on a dairy farm, including a Cheese Maker,or (c) a hill shepherd,(d) a skilled market gardener.2./The Secretary,District Agricultural Executive Committeef:--.Vt
2.   Before a man under 1 (a) or 1 (b) above can be regarded as &quot;irreplaceable and essential to the cultivation of the &quot;farm&quot; he must be either(a) the.only able-bodied man on the farm whether a relative of the occupier of the farm or a hired employee,or    (b) a man whose release for Military Service would, coupled with such release of another or others from the same farm, involve the&apos; putting out of work of more .than one pair of horses necessarily employed, owing to there being no competent person to work them at present on the farm - provided that in any event at least, but not more than, one-third of the men of any age similarly engaged are to be released for service -. if such one-third are-within the terms of the Proclamationor   (o) a hill Shepherd necessarily employedor    (&amp;) a market gardener responsible for the cultivation ofnot less than the equivalent of three acres and occupied in growing crops of essential food stuffs other than - fruit.-3.     In all cases the man in respect of whom application ismade must be whole-time employed on a   farm on farm work.The Board have arranged with the Director of National Service (Scottish..Region) for the joint scrutiny of the forms accom-:panying the applications by a local representation of the -two De-tpartments with a view to facilitating and expediting&apos; subsequent pro-iceedings before the Tribunal.     Thus in regard to all. cases where at the preliminary scrutiny the Representative of the National Service Department agrees.^ that the case falls within the conditions preecriTie &quot;by the Seoond Schedule to the Proclamation, such case will be held to be oertifled by the Board for presentation to the Tribunal without further formality.     Similarly in all cases, which upon scrutiny the two representatives agree not to be covered by the terms of the said Second Schedule, the question of certification by the Soard will be thus disposed.of negatively.    All oases, however, in regard to which the two representatives cannot agree will &quot;be remitted to the Scottish Regional Headquarters of the National Service Department for disouss-:ion with the Board, who will at that stage decide- whether to issue a certificate or not.The Board will be glad, therefore, if your Committee will select one of their members or officers to aut as the Board1a localrepresentative for these purposes so far as the area of the -----..... . District Agricultural Executive Committee is concerned and fill arrange for obtaining the services, where necessary, of any q^ther members of the District Committee to assist the local represen-:tative with   their local knowledge in considering any given case or set of cases.     In cases where delay would be involved in calling tjie Committee together specially to consider this request, the Board think that it will be sufficient if you will consult the Chair-tman of the Committee for the purpose in view.The Board will forward to you in the course of a few days a supply of forms to issue to applicants as instruoted in the accompanying copy of a Press Notice.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,CHAS. WEATH1RILL,Secretary.
