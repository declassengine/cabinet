mm(This Document is the Property^; His Britannic Majesty^ Governme1%25th April 1918. FQTOKE! OF TIE RUSSIAN FLEETS. Adpiiralty1 Memorandums or - the War Cabinet.It is desired that the War Cabinet should be informed of the present position in regard to the Russian Baltic and Black Sea Fleets,BALTIC FL2ETOn February 26th Revel was occupied by the enemy, who claim to have captured 8 old submarinesn    Over 60 ships were evacuated to Eolsingfors.On April 3rd Hango&apos; was occupied by the enemy, who captured one eld gunboat.    Four new Holland-American type submarines were destroyed by their Captains to avoid capture.On April 13th Helsingfors was occupied by the enemy, but the British submarines were destroyed and our Naval Attache, co-operating with Admiral Razvasov, managed to evacuate to Kronstadt all the big Russian ships, including the&quot;four Dreadnoughts and the majority of the destroyers and submarines, only a few Auxiliaries being left behind.    In addition to the evacuation of the ships a large quantity of stores were destroyed.At the present time, therefore, no warships of great value have been captured by the enemy in  he Baltic/but- all the large ships, i.e.-4 Dreadnought Battleships3 Pre-Dreaclnought Battleships, and9 Cruisers,are already at Kronstadt and about 160 ships of all descriptions including -70 Destroyers 23 Submarines,are believed either tc have already reached Kronstadt. or to be making their way thither through the ice,If the Germans and White Guards now advance and occupy Petrograd, as appears to be their intention, it is hoped that the valuable ships will be destroyed, although no definite promise as to destruction has yet been obtained.     The tremendous efforts which have been succass-fully made for evacuating the ships from Revel, Hango and Helsingfors -would seem to justify the hope that Trotsky will not now permit the Baltic Fleet- to fall into the hands of the&apos; enemy.BLACK SFA FLBFT. .On March loth Odessa was occupied bv the enemy hut only 15transports revacuated to Sevastopol,^ained In the Port, all the&apos;warships having beenlicolaev was occupied by the enemy, who probably 3s, 1 oil tanker and 5 transports and, InOn-March 15th N captured 2 submarine^ , i. -. -addition, the following vessels under construction, namely:-1 Dreadnought Battleship (launched October 1916) 4 Light Cruisers u almost completed, 2 not launched) 4 Destroyers (not launched) 2 Submarines (l almost completed) 4 Holland-American Type Submarines (I launched, the remainder in packing cases).The
ffcs Port of Nicolaev, with its large modern shipbuilding plant and coal and iron mines, can be of the utmost use to the enemy for building submarines!The remainder of the Black Sea Fleet consists of the following:-2 Dreadnought Battleships 7 Pre-iteidncught Battleships 4 Cruisers,13 Oil*-buming Destroyers, 3.2 Submarines.All these ships are probably at or near Sevastopol excepting 5 c? 6 Destroyers5 of which are at Novorossisk,    The 2 Dreadnoughts each now have a crew of about 500 men,, and the remaining Battleships and Cruisers each have about 22 men lefB on board0     Many of the Officers have been murdered and others have taken refuge with the Tartars in the Crimea,Recent indications shew that the Central Powers, with the aid of Turkey5 contemplate an attempt to occupy the Crimea, in which case it seems probable that the remainder of the Black Sea Fleet will be capturedaTrotsky has made a vague statement that the Fie&amp;tr would be ordered, to Novorcssisk if necessary to escape capture  but it is doubtful if he can now communicate with the South of Russia, and if he could, whether Admiral Sablint who is now Ccmmander&quot;-in-Chief 5 could succeed in preventing  he ships falling into the hands of the enemyt3. request has been made by Trotsky for British Officers to be sent to the Black Sea to reorganise the Fleet, and the Naval Attache is in communication with Mr Lockhart on the subject,If the enemy capture the Russian ships at Sevastopol, their Naval Forces would (after a considerable period has elapsed for the necessary refitting and braining of crews5 &amp;cj be increased by the&quot;foilowing units:-2 Dreadnought Battleships;-2 Cruisers&quot;;I bight Cruiser (possibly); 13 Oii-burning Destroyers;   and Some Submarines,The remainder3 including the older Battleships and Cruisers even if they could&apos;be manned, could never form a homogeneous force and would be an encumbrance in a sortie from the Dardanelles BWith regard to the destruction of the Baltic Fleet and to the destruction or removal to Kovcrossisk of the Black Sea Fleet, it would seem that the only course is to bring as much pressure as possible to bear on Trotsky through Mr, Lockhart, although it is of course realised that the chances of Trotsky being induced to&quot;take definite action in the matter are not very great a/signed)    ERIC GSDDES..4.
