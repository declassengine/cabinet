General Remarks.Progress of Joint Industrial Councils.1. The Whitley Report laid it down as the best policy&quot; in establishing Industrial Councils &quot; to leave it to the trades themselves to formulate schemes suit-able to their special circumstances/&apos; and proposed that the Government should con-fine itself to putting the proposals before employers&apos; and workpeople^ organisations, and offering advice and information. This was done by a letter addressed by the Minister of the Labour to the principal employers&apos; associations and trade unions, explaining the reasons for the Government&apos;s adoption of the Report, and requesting them to consider the question of carrying out its recommendations so far as they were applicable to the industry of the organisation addressed.The Ministry had, however, anticipated that it- would not be possible to leave the initiative in forming Industrial Councils entirely to the trade organisations con-cerned, owing to the need for making the principles of the Report widely known and understood, and the difficulty of getting competing rival organisations of employers and workmen in the same industry to combine, without some external pressure. Officers of the Ministry were therefore detailed to get into touch with industries in which the prospects of an Industrial Council were good. At the same time a cam-paign was undertaken to explain the Report and to secure its discussion.By these means misconception and suspicion, which at first were very prevalent both among employers and workmen, have been gradually removed, and it may now be said that the principle of the Report has taken a firm hold, and that there is a
strong feeling in favour of giving it a trial among both employers and workmen, because it offers a real opportunity of removing the employers&apos; difficulties with labour, and of definitely improving the status of the employed.On the other hand, experience has shown that in normal cases after an industry has approved of the general principles of the Report, an interval of from six to eight months must necessarily elapse before the first meeting of the Joint. Industrial Council can be held. The reason for this lapse of time can best be shown by setting forth the usual method of procedure that has hitherto been adopted.As a rule a preliminary conference is called, either by the industry itself or by the Ministry of Labour, at which representatives are present from the leading associations of employers and workpeople. At this meeting a sub-committee is appointed &quot;of equal numbers of employers and trade unionists. This sub-committee meets at intervals of a fortnight or three weeks, and the number of meetings necessi-tated has ranged hitherto from a minimum of three to a maximum of twelve. As a rule the sub-committee have before them the model constitution, prepared by the Ministry of Labour, which has to be adapted to the particular needs of the industry. The most difficult question which confronts the industry is the decision as to what associations should be represented upon the Council, including the vexed question as to whether direct representation should be given to associations of factors, brokers, and merchants, and also to scientific and technical associations.The Ministry of Labour has been able to speed up this machinery bo some extent, but its powers in this direction are naturally very limited; these are purely of a per-suasive nature, and the Ministry cannot induce associations to meet except at their own convenience. Any attempt unduly to hasten matters would probably lead to associations, especially of workpeople,, suspecting State interference contrary to the fundamental principle that the setting up of a Joint Industrial Council is a voluntary action carried out by the industry itself.In the building industry, Avhere the movement for an Industrial Council began in 1916, and was accepted in principle by all the leaders and the most important organisations by the summer of 1917. the final draft has only recently been approved by the constituent organisations. In the pottery industry, a much simpler case, where the movement also arose spontaneously, and there was an equal body of opinion in favour of the scheme, negotiations lasted from April till the end of December 1917. The Ministry of Labour has, however, been able to point out to the various industries the urgent necessity of the Joint Industrial Council coming into existence at the earliest possible date. Only so will it have time to give adequate con-sideration to those problems of reconstruction, upon which it is intended to take the advice of representative joint bodies in each industry, where such joint bodies can be formed.The present position is as follows: In 1 industry (pottery) the Council is established.In 1 industry (building) a constitution has been framed.In 7 industries (printing: heavy chemicals; carting; rubber; cable making; tinplate; and gold, silver, and jewellery) draft constitutions have been completed, and are under consideration.In 6 industries (woollen, furniture, boot and shoe, tramways, leather goods, silk) committees have been appointed and are drafting schemes.In 12 industries (paper-making, lace, bobbin manufacture, electrical con-tracting, hosiery, baking, coach-building, sawmilling, electricity supply, gas, newspapers, carpets) the separate organisations are giving official consideration to the proposal.In 13 industries (iron and steel, light castings, steel tubes, fine chemicals, bedstead manufacture, hollow-ware, cocoa and confectionery, enter-tainments, docks, gas-meter making, surgical instruments, flour mill-ing, furniture removing) the separate organisations are discussing the proposal unofficially with officers of the Ministry.The above figures are mutually exclusive.From this statement it will be clear that, in spite of the intrinsic complexities of the organisation, 15 Industrial Councils, covering between 2 and 3 million work-people, should be at work within the next three months, and a further 12, covering another million workpeople, by the end of the year.Concurrently with this direct approach to the trade organisations, steps have been taken to stimulate study, of the Report.   These include arrangements made by
II. Press Comments.The Military Situation.The amount of attention devoted to the actual military situation is still small. The more patriotic press, of the type of the &quot;British Citizen &quot; and &quot;Clarion,&quot;&apos; appeals for confidence and unity in the nation the latter hoping for improved leader-ship now that promotion by seniority has been abolished. There is an impression that the military situation is not so grave as the Government and press have made out, and the &quot; New Age &quot; in particular notes the calmness of the people as against the panic of the authorities.The more pacifist section confines itself to emphasising the terrible nature of the struggle and the guilt of those who are responsible for prolonging it. This is the point of view of the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; though in the latter there is a somewhat apprehensive article by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, who fears for the Channel ports. The &quot; Woolwich Pioneer,&quot; again somewhat changed in tone, is how-ever of opinion that &quot; there is no reason yet for doubting the ultimate issue of the struggle.&quot;the Ministry of Reconstruction with General Headquarters, under which two officers of the Ministry of Labour have visited France to lecture on the Whitley Report, and the War Office are proposing to distribute 100,000 copies of the Report in pamphlet form to the troops.The experience gained has thrown light on the limitations of the first Whitley Report. Its proposals are confined to well-organised industries. It is diffi-cult in practice to draw a line between well-organised and other industries, and the officers of the Ministry are constantly called on, either to suggest modifications of the Whitley Report to suit the circumstances of the less-organised industries:, or to indicate the Government policy for them. In order to deal with these industries as a provisional measure pending the establishment of Industrial Councils, the Minister of Reconstruction, in conjunction with the Minister of Labour and the President of the Board of Trade, has decided to set up Interim Industrial Recon-struction Committees, which will be joint in character and will obviate the necessity of referring to individual associations or setting up ad hoc committees every time a Government Department wishes to obtain the advice and experience of an industry.The following trades, among others, are being dealt with in this way: tanning and currying, glass, tobacco, railway carriage and \vagon building, patent fuel, rope and hemp, oil and seed crushing, soap and candles, fertilisers, and glue, the dyeing and cleaning industry, and packing-case making. It is hoped that these Interim Committees will pave the way for, and eventually merge into, Joint Industrial Councils.For the badly organised trades the extension of the Trade Boards Act, and an addition to the powers of Trade Boards, for which provision is being made in an amending Bill, will go some way to meet the,need, and any duplication of machinery is undesirable.The industrial policy implied in the Whitley Report is capable of application, to all industries, and the needs of the situation are leading to such an application. It has three aims: (1.) A joint representative organisation in each industry, capable of advising the Government on any problem of the industry, and bringing together representa-tives of all sections and interests of the industry.(2.) Machinery for establishing standard rates and conditions for each industry.(3.) Machinery for enforcing minimum rates and conditions.In a well-organised industry the trade unions and employers&apos; associations are able to achieve the second and third of these objects, and, by coming together to form Industrial Councils, will achieve the first. In the badly unorganised industries the Trade Board already deals with the third object, and requires only a slight extension of its powers to deal with the other two. The same objects can be met in all other industries by a linking up of the Industrial Council scheme with the Trade Board machinery.
The Man-Power A ct.The passing into law of this measure has not modified the almost universal hostility already expressed towards it.With the exception of the &quot;British Citizen,&quot; which desires to see everyone handling a rifle, the patriotic papers are inclined to accuse the Government of panic. This is very emphatically the point of view of the &quot;New Age,&quot; which attacks particularly the extension of the age limit, as not calculated to produce efficient soldiers, and the Irisji clauses as likely to add a new fighting front to that already in existence. &quot;Justice &quot; is in substantial agreement with this standpoint, but the &quot;New Statesman&quot; is rather more optimistic as regards Ireland, and thinks that the Government intend to hold their hand. Generally speaking, this section of the press, while regarding the natural feeling of Englishmen as justifiable, thinks that the subject should be dealt Avith from the point of view of general expediencv and on those grounds condemned.The opposite camp deals with the subject of Ireland on grounds not onlv of expediency, but also of principle, and is on each ground more than dissatisfied. The &quot; Herald&quot; reverts to Ireland in several places and from different points of view, but always comes to a hostile conclusion. The &quot; Irish Notes &quot; which are published breathe a spirit of hostility and rebellion, and this is the note of a resolution by the Dublin Socialist Society also printed. Finally, Irish regiments fighting in France are reminded of General Gough&apos;s &quot;splendid example &quot; of 1914, and an appeal is made to British Labour to overthrow the Government.The proposals to increase the age of military service are. even by several of the patriotic papers, regarded as savouring of industrial conscription. The &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; says that our Prussians are &quot;cock-a-whoop,&quot; and the &quot;Bradford Pioneer &quot; stigmatises the act as &quot; the most iniquitous and ugly of all war measures.&quot;Criticism of the Government.Rather extreme criticism of the Government appears not only in the &quot; Herald,&quot; which again declares that it is neither capable of conducting war nor of making peace, but in several other papers of the same set, such as the &quot; Call &quot; and *&apos; Labour Leader./&apos; They are inclined to adopt the point of view expressed in the &quot; Daily News,&quot; which held that the present Administration was riding deliberately for a fall over the Man-Power Act, and they are heartily sorry that it did not succeed in its object.The &quot; New Age,&quot; while.not prepared to defend all his actions, points out that Mr. Lloyd George is the only possible head of a Government, while the &quot;&apos; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; has a very soberly-worded article, emphasising how the issues of the moment may contribute to the losing of the war, and calling upon the nation to try and &quot;recognise the enormous complexities and responsibilities which the Government has to face,&quot; and upon the Government to trust in the nation and treat it frankly.Distrust of the Government is evident in some of the trade journals as well as in the weekly press; the &quot; Patternmakers&apos; Report &quot; for April may be instanced. This journal thinks that &quot; it is a thousand pities that in the greatest trial which our nation has been called upon to face our rulers should be so discredited that our workmen cannot take their words to mean what they say, and that a mixture of deceit, cajolery, and force should be considered the stock-in-trade of a successful politician.&quot;Foreign Affairs.In foreign affairs the fall of Count Czernin and the negotiations which led up to it are the chief topics of discussion. The &quot; Herald&apos;s&quot; opinion is that Count Czernin and the Emperor Karl had ceased to be an effective force working for peace. The situation in Austria is thought to be much the same as that in Russia before her collapse, and it is suggested that the refusal of Germany to consider the needs of Austria may have even more disastrous consequences to her than did the refusal of the Entente to consider the needs of Russia.The &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; both regret Count Czernin&apos;s resignation, and are inclined to rate him much more highly than M. Clemenceau The &quot; Clarion &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; on the other hand are well satisfied with the situation. The &quot; Clarion &apos;&apos; is not sure whether the peace move was genuine or a deep German scheme-in any case it is disposed to rate the Emperor Karl very lowly while the &quot; British Citizen &quot; sets him down as weak and a bar.
The arrival of the American delegation is welcomed by &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Clarion,&quot; though the pacifist papers are somewhat silent about it. The &quot;New Age &quot; is disposed to be angry with the &quot;Times&quot; for suggesting that President Wilson has given up his efforts to distinguish between the German Government and the German people, and emphasises its opinion that this is particularly the moment to work along such lines.The Labour Party.The conduct of the &quot; Labour Party &quot; with regard to the Man-Power Act is very unfavourably criticised, not only by the &quot;Herald,&quot; &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and &quot; Call,&quot; but also by the &quot; New Age.&quot; Their opinion is that a bad start has been made by the new party, which displayed a regrettable weakness and lack of unity. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; continues its attacks on the policy of a Lansdowne-Labour Govern-ment, and attempts to prove that Lord Lansdowne&apos;s policy both at home and abroad has been one of reaction.Various of the provincial papers devote space to the activities of the local Labour Parties, which are now beginning to publish their constitutions, and the general feeling appears to be optimistic.The Food Situation.This subject continues to attract attention, though the comment is of a somewhat diverse character.One of the chief complaints of the moment is that the co-operative societies are not being fairly treated as regards supplies, the distribution of which is said to be inequitable. This subject is especially dealt with in the &quot;Leeds Citizen &quot; and in the &quot; Co-operator.&quot;III. District Reports.London and South-E astern.The situation in this district still remains satisfactory.As regards man-power no serious agitation has arisen, and the calling-up of members of the A.S.E. proceeds smoothly, the men having apparently fully realised the seriousness of the present situation.Opposition to the Act seems to be based largely on the fear of industrial con-scription, and among the men at Woolwich it has been described as the thin end of the wedge towards that end. The action of a firm at Acton, in getting four young men who had enlisted voluntarily brought back to their works, has caused con-siderable hostile comment.It is clear that any action on the part of employers to retain dilutees would be met with discontent; thus, for instance, in the Royal Gun Factory some agitation was aroused by the appointment of a dilutee in preference to a skilled engineer, but this subsided upon the removal of the dilutee.It is thought that the end of the present battle will probably be the signal for a renewal of demands for peace by negotiation.Grumbling has already become evident among some workmen in the London district on the subject of additional rations. Complaints have been heard that the extra amount is not being granted all round.South-W estern.Recruiting in the Isle of Wight is proceeding satisfactorily, and large numbers of men have been passed through the hands of the military authorities. The con-sequent dislocation of work is not expected to be serious, as large numbers of women are offering themselves to fill the places of the men.This area seems at present that in which the food situation is causing most anxiety. The shortage of meat is said to be particularly acute at Bristol, and this is aggravated by the fact that the dockers themselves are handling the large supplies of meat which arrive at that port.
West Midlands.The provisions of the Man-Power Bill have on the whole been received quietly in this district, though some details of its administration meet with adverse criticism. Thus at the B.S.A. works at Birmingham a greater number of men are called up in one day for medical examination than can be dealt with by the authorities, and this results in a considerable waste of time. The proposed abo-lition or reconstruction of the tribunals is also the subject of some discussion.No objction to teach the discharged soldiers, who have been introduced in the B.S.A. works to take the places of those called up, has so far been displayed.The I.L.P. are again showing some activity in this district. In particular they demand the release of ex-Private Simmons, who was recently sentenced to a term of imprisonment.The propaganda of the War Aims Committee in Coventry is apparently pro-ducing satisfactory results in combating the pacifist spirit which still exists among some sections.Yorkshire and East Midlands.Reports from this district are on the whole satisfactory.In the West Riding the output of munitions is said to have been largely increased of late, and in other parts of the district, particularly among the miners at Nottingham, recruiting is proceeding satisfactorily. It is expected, however, that as soon as the situation on the Western front improves renewed efforts in favour of peace by negotiation will be made.Again few7 signs of Labour unrest have appeared throughout the area.Local propaganda in favour of Bolshevism is reported among the Jews of Leeds, where the Secretary of the Jewish Tailors, a Russian by birth, and a some-what fiery speaker, has been active.The Labour Party in Leeds are proposing an entirely new constitution, and are making great efforts to secure the votes of the newly enfranchised women.North-Western.Considerable local unrest, which the local officer of the Ministry of Munitions is inclined to regard as somewhat threatening, exists in this district.This is more particularly evident at Widnes, where the shortage of beer, especially among labourers at the chemical works, is creating discontent, which may ultimately extend to more serious trouble unless Jthe difficulty is remedied. The housing question is also becoming acute here, as the floating population is steadily on the increase.The Mersey District Boilermakers held a meeting at Liverpool on the 21st, at which a question of demarcation between the boilermakers and electricians at Messrs. Cammell Laird&apos;&apos;s, Birkenhead, was the main subject of discussion, a dispute having arisen as to the working of a certain machine. The matter was subsequently left to arrangement between the men&apos;s officials and the firm. The meeting also demanded a larger scale of food rations for boilermakers, as the present ration is considered insufficient to produce efficient work.Characteristic of the times is the withdrawal by the Barrow shop stewards of a resolution which they passed recently, asking for a conference of Trade Unions for the discussion of peace proposals.Northern.The situation in this area still continues to be very satisfactory in all respects, and no unrest has been reported, while considerable zeal in the increase of -hip-building output has been manifested.The attitude of the A.S.E. towards the comb-out is also stated to have improved.Excellent propaganda work has been done in this district by a naval officer. This type of man is always said to ha*ve more effect than the professional orator.South Wales.The Labour situation generally is reported as satisfactory in this area, and large numbers of young miners still continue to enlist voluntarily.
Such influence as the Unofficial Reform Committee among the miners has aopears to be diminishing. Their activities have been denounced by Mr. Vernon Hartshorn, the well-known leader, both in the Press and from the platform. His efforts appear to have made an excellent impression.Arthur Cook, a leading syndicalist agitator,, has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the D.O.R.A. A well-attended protest meeting was held among the miners in the Rhondda Valley on Sunday last, and a resolution was passed calling upon the Central Executive to take up the case.Scotland.The general situation in this district is still quiet.The arrest of John McLean has apparently taken the extremist leaders by surprise, and considerable apprehension seems to exist among them lest they may suffer the same fate. It is thought very improbable that the engineers would consent to a strike upon this question, though they will probably raise a fund for McLean&apos;s defence; so far there have been no signs of serious agitation over the case.At the C.W.C. meeting on the 20th, Tommy Clark referred to the danger of arrest or deportation, and advised the members to show discretion, as he believed that the Government were determined to pass the Man-Power Bill at all costs, and the C.W.C. eventually informed a special conference which met on Sunday last that the workers were not prepared to take drastic action. In spite of a good deal of wild talk this conference got no further than the establishment of a defence fund.The local Sinn Feiners are passing a number of resolutions against the applica-tion of the Man-Power Bill to Irishmen, many of whom seem to be leaving the district for Ireland.The I.L.P. also held a fairly well attended meeting against&quot; conscription on Sunday, some 2,000 being present. A resolution demanding immediate negotia-tions for peace was passed.Ireland.Arrangements had been made for a national one-day strike as a protest against the extension of conscription to Ireland. This demonstration took place yesterday, but no details beyond what has been reported in the Press have been received.1Y. Disputes. (a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work.A condition of quiet continues to prevail this week, and the number of strikes reported is even smaller than it was last week.The Shipyard Labour Department reports only two new stoppages of work, and it is satisfactory to note that work has now been resumed in each case.Of the new cases reported, one at Messrs. S. Cook and Co., Liverpool, took place in consequence of the introduction of women. Upon investigation the men alleged that the firm had given them their dismissal; they are now claiming the 12-1 per cent, bonus, and the matter has been put into the hands of the S.L.D.The second occurred at Leeds, and was apparently of a trivial nature, being due to an objection to a change in the work&apos;s management; 147 men were involved.It is also reported that 50 electricians employed by a firm in the London area came out on strike, owing to the refusal of the firm to take his position away from a foreman who had been dismissed from his official position in his union. It is hoped that a settlement will be speedily effected.A total of 1,504 workpeople involved in strikes for the week ending 17th April is reported by the Ministry of Munitions, a number considerably less than that reported for the previous week. It is again to be noted that at the end of the week covered by this report no strikes were in progress in munitions industries.The most important of the three strikes settled involved 600 coopers in the Liverpool district, who demand an advance of 20 per cent, in their rates. The matter was referred to the Committee on Production, and the men returned to work upon the promise of a rapid settlement of the dispute.Another case involved about 100 aircraft workers at Heaton Chapel, and arose out of the severe attitude of the manager of Crossley Motors, Ltd., towards men who persistently gambled in the canteen.   The stoppage only lasted half a day, however.
The Coal Controller reports nine new stoppages of work, in seven of which work has already been resumed.Work has also been resumed in each of the six cases which have been previously reported. The number of men involved is again high, being rather under 14,000, but it is satisfactory to note&apos; that in most cases the stoppages were of exceedingly short dura-tion, and rather in the nature of demonstrations than actual strikes.Several of the stoppages seem to be in connection with military service; thus, one in Yorkshire and one in Nottingham were due to the grievance of the &quot; post-war &quot; miners, while in Lancashire the methods of recruitment caused a stoppage. In Lanarkshire also two strikes in connection with recruiting took place.Two stoppages of several days occurred in Wales in connection with various miscel-laneous grievances.The War Office Contracts has no new or old cases of stoppage of work to report this week.(b.) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.The Shipyard Labour Department report 22 new and 107 old controversial cases, out of which total 25 cases have now been settled.Trouble among the shipwrights on the Clyde is threatened on the question of how much overtime ought to be worked by them before diluted labour; is introduced, and notices to leave are being handed in by men in the Greenock and Port Glasgow regions. The matter is most acute at Messrs. John Brown &amp; Co., Ciydebank, where the Shipyard Labour Department are investigating the matter in conjunction with the men&apos;s society.Other cases reported by this Department are not of a serious nature.Unrest upon the question of dilution is this week reported by the Ministry of Munitions in the Belsize Motor Works, Manchester. At a mass meeting on the 12th the workers determined that no male person should be allowed to start on any skilled job without producing a skilled soeiety&apos;s contribution card, and that all semi-skilled tool-setters should be discharged at once. A strike is threatened im-less these demands are granted, but the difficulty is being discussed by the Employers&apos; Association and the union.The Belfast Corporation have refused to comply with an award of the Com-mittee on Production, conceding an advance to their employees, and in consequence the men threaten proceedings before a Munitions Tribunal. The dispute at Messrs. Blair, Campbell and McLean, Glasgow, referred to in last week&apos;s report, has now been settled.A dispute over an allegation of bad time-keeping on the part of a Manchester firm had an interesting settlement, a workers&apos; committee for the improvement of time-keeping being formed.The trouble at Cardiff over the refusal of the Corporation to brine; up advances so far granted to its employees to a level of 205. above pre-war rates has by no means subsided, and much bitterness was displayed by the men at a meeting held on Wednesday last.The Coal Controller has no new controversial cases to report, though nine old cases still remain unsettled.The War Office Contracts Department reports one new and two old cases of dispute.The dispute as to unemployment benefit in the jute trade at Dundee has not yet been settled.A dispute was threatened between the National Society of Woolcombers and the Masters&apos; Association of Spinner-Combers, since the latter had omitted to carry out the agreement of March 18th, viz., that the Levy scheme should come into operation at the date of reduction in the top-making programme. This situation arose out of the fact that the masters are divided ino two erroups, of which the Spinner-Combers belong to the West Riding Spinners&apos; Federation, and with this Federation the operatives have no fixed relations. It has now been decided that the Spinner-Combers should be requested to carry out this agreement, as the second group of masters have already done so.The Committee on production heard 31 arbitration cases during the week, 29 in London, and 2 in Bradford, and in addition, sitting as a Special Arbitration Tribunal, it has heard one case arising out of the 12-1 per cent.The Committee has also heard application made fry the Engineering and Ship-buiidine; Trades Federation of the Mersey and Liverpool districts for an advance
in wages to all &quot; low-paid trades &quot; connected with that industry in the Mersey district. This is in pursuance of an agreement entered into between the employers&apos; associations and the unions.It has been found necessary to proclaim, under the Munitions of War Act, the dispute between the Port of London Authority and the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation, arising out of a demand by the Federation for a national increase of 8d. an hour over pre-war rates. The other ports accepted arbitration, but, as the Port of London Authority refused to be parties to any arbitration proceedings, steps had to be taken to bring them within the Act. The hearing has been fixed for Friday, the 26th April.- 206 differences have been reported to the Chief Industrial Commissioner of which 65 are claims for the 12^ per cent, bonus. Of the total, 78 fall in the engineering and shipbuilding group. The number of cases referred to arbitration is given as 72.Among the cases dealt with may be mentioned a dispute arising out of various matters connected with the strike of bricklayers in South Wales during January last. This had culminated in a threat to cease work, but the parties were got together, and decided that certain of the points of immediate difficulty should be referred to the Committee on Production.A serious dispute arising out of a demand for a 12^ per cent, increase in wages which had been put forward by bakers in Glasgow has been settled by their acceptance of an offer of 75. per week increase.13.
