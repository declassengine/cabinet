WAR0 A 3IH 3?.S E OEET.G.T.- 4396.A.GEjBOlH DiiMiiBDS 01 HOLLAND.Draft Joint Note by Permanent Military Representatives.- Supreme War Council; also&apos; Hote by flrenoh Military Represent tativec;.i.D&amp;JPT JOINT NOTE.1The British ^?ar Cabinet have asked for the views of the Military Representatives on the military aspects of the ease, that is, whether Holland should be advised by the Allies :(1)   To submit to the German demands, or(2)   To resist even to the point of war.It has been suggested to the British &apos;&quot;.&apos;ar Cabinet that in the event of Germany sending troops from the &quot;estern Uront to invade Holland, it might be possible for the Allies to send troops to reinforce the Dutch Army. Guns, machine guns, aeroplanes and munitions of war would also be supplied to the Dutch Army.The Military Representatives having considered the above question are of opinion that :(i) The interests of the Allies are best served by Holland remaining neutral.(ii) The vital interests of the allies are :-(a) To prevent large quantities of material such as rubber, food,, fats, etc, from falling into German hands.(b) To prevent any part of the Coast of Holland which oould be used in any way as naval bases from being made available for German naval enterprises.With these conditions in view the Military Representa-tives are of opinion that Holland should be advised not to go to war with Germany unless the Central Powers attempt to violate that part of Holland which lies West of the New Holland v;ater line of defences and inundations which stretch from Loevestein on the MiuiS, through UTRECHT to MUIDM.
AK3P5XORE. TO JMAFX JOIflT NOTE.The Military Representatives in forwarding Joint Note   2To* 26 have taken into account the following:-If Germany makes further demands and insists en being given free access to all parts of Holland, it must be pointed out to the Eutch Government that such a demand means the abdication by Holland of her position as an independent State,  and that an such a question no foreign power could be in a position to give her advioo.If Holland accords to Germany the most extreme demands of free access to all parts of Holland the Allies must seize positions on lutch soil where small forces can be supported and from which the means.of all access to the epen sea can be completely controlled.If Holland resists the extreme demands of Germany and decides to fight for her just rights she has sufficient troops to defend her fortifications and her protective inundations on the New Holland water line.   The Allies could help her with war material and aeroplanes,     In this case and to this extent assistance should be promised to Holland, especially as from aeroplane bases on Dutch territory the manufacturing distriots of North Western Germany can be subje&amp;ted to frequent and severe raids by Allied bombing squadrons.

Note for the Permanent British Military Representative by French Military Representative.

THE PASSAGE THROUGH HOLLAND OF SAND AND GRAVEL FROM GERMANY TO BELGIUM.

Germany has just placed the Government of the Netherlands face to face with a categorical demand for the free passage across Holland of sand and gravel from Germany to Belgium as from tho last May. Germany moreover has notified that in case of need she will not hesitate to have recourse to force.

Holland is therefore faced with a real ultimatum, the rejection of which may lead to a rupture with Germany, or possibly a declaration of war by the latter.

Forseeing this eventuality, the War Cabinet has asked the opinions of the Permanent Military Representatives on the Supreme War Council on the desirability of advising Holland either to submit to the German demands or to resist them.

The French Permanent Military Representative regards the question thus formulated ae rather of a diplomatic order, and thinks that it would not be opportune to offer Holland any advice which she has not, as far as his knowledge goes, invited.

Taking a purely military view, the French Permanent Military Representative is of the opinion that his British colleague might be authorised to answer the War Cabinet, giving prominence to the three following points:-

(a) Holland by her own unaided strength is not able to offer military resistance to Germany.

(b) The Allies, whose whole energies are committed to the battle in Picardy and Flanders, would find it very difficult to furnish Holland with the necessary, assistance.

(c) The military occupation of Holland by Germany would give the latter very valuable advantages, e.g. from an economic point of view: a considerable source of agricultural products and cattle to feed her armies; from a navel point of view: a first class base for submarines: i.e. Port of Antwerp freed by the conquest of the Mouths of the Scheldt; from a political point of view: a hostage of the utmost value at the time of settlement.(Sgd.)
