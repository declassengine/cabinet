/    -     ?11&quot;tThlt Document Is the Property of ^^^^ L His Britannic Majesty^ Government.)WAR     C A 5 I 11 E f.Irish dotation.Mote by the Secretary,I venture to circulate to Members of the War Cabinet a oopy of a personal letter I have received from Sir Mark Sykee.     Together with the letter I circulate a copy of a note of a conversation I myself had with Sir Mark Sykes a week ago,(Signed)     M.2s*BUiKffl. &apos;2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 27th April, 1918.Ojtyy of a letter from Sir Mark Sykes to   t.r Maurice Eankey.gated-  7-ch April 1918.My dear Hankey,I am here without a typewriter but I am sure you will for give me if I write you my views on the Irish situation.X assume that our objective is :To obtain as many men from Ireland for war purposes as is possible with the least expenditure of moral or material war resources, and without endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom, I foresee certain dangers confronting us to which I would draw attention.If the Government proceeds with a Home Rule Bill and enforces conscription at the same time, it runs the risk of provcAing two quarrels, and will have to drop the Home Rule Bill and face a desperate situation in Ireland, entailing much bloodshed and the setting up of a rule of force which will ultimately become unpopular here,The results of this will be, to give an accretion of strength ,to Pacificism and Revolutionary movements in England and the U.S.A..   If once we are forced to rule Ireland by sheer violence and terrorism, we shall be faced   with any evil which will grow, by that I mean that though our policy may have immediate support both here and in the U.S.A. gradually it will grow unpopular, a section of the pro-War press hostile to the Government will espouse the cause of the Irish, the same will happen in America and sooner or later this, opposition will grow formidable and the anti-War people   .,. find Revolutionaries will take advantage of the situation.
I would also submit that If once we get a rule of force&quot;&quot; pure and simple permanently established in &quot;Ireland we shall have a very evil thing introduced into the United Kingdom which will make its influence felt during the period of demobilisation   That will be a period of great unrest and great relaxation of discipline, if we have an Ireland only held by brute force at the period when brute force is being broken up we shall be as people in an inflammable dwelling situated near a bonfire on a windy day.I have heard iwny military men talk of the ease of enforcing conscription, of a price of 5000 casualties, etc 5 etc, but I am sure these views are distorted and based upon wrong ideas.   Military people always believe in the effects of terrorism, and yet if this war has shown one thing above another it is that terrorism fails in the long run, and that even those who believe in it as a right policy as the Prussians do, and those who proceed to the extreme length-of extermination as the Turks do,, do not really succeeds   There is a limit to man1 s power of massacre, and a limit to a ffiili-tary machine&quot;s power of terrorism, both in the end fail not through the resistance of the weaker side, but through the loss of resolution on the aggressive side.   In our case you know that our troops are not Turks and our military machine is not Prussian, and from this I infer that we are really morally incapable of seeing a policy of terrorism out to any extreme length.     My forecast would be that we should only make a certain number of martyrs and then begin to talk and see if we could not find some way out.If violence ?;onJt succeed what other course can weadopt?It is manifest that we cannot pass a Home Bule Bill and force it on Ulster without applying conscription to Ireland. Obviously the Ulster case would carry all England with it.   We cannot assume that Ulster will accept Home Rule without resis-tanoe, and that meanwhile the effects of a free Home Hule will produce an Irish Army.     If Ulster would accept Home Rule readily 1 believe that we could get a voluntary contribution from Ireland and once that was forthcoming the Irish Parliament would vote conscription.   But Ulster cannot be expected to do that.     In this quandary it behoves one to try and work out some plan.   I will therefore submit one but before doing so it is best to rehearse the positions of the various Irish parties and factors,1.      Ulster has had apparently a double pledge not to be submitted to Home Rule and stands by them as far as the British Government is concerned, .      The Irish Nationalists have lost influence and are trying to get it back by increasing their demands for pure Dominion independence,,3.      The Catholic clorgy in Ireland have plunged with the Nationalists abviously to retain their power and if possible keep the revolutionary movement in passive channels. -4*      Sinn Fein is for tht?.   movement dominant because (a) Constitutional Nationalism has failed and Larne methods have succeeded,&apos; (b) because there is always an irreconcilable physical force minority in Ireland (c) because it has got into its net the Bolshevik element which exists in every country (d) because many
mm f*a&amp; tvnvy oeiia^fcum *hlti type 4b wwntltiegtwish to avoid trench service without dishonour, and by being a Sinn Feiher a subconscious shirker feels &amp; con-scious hero.Slow those are the elements with ?/hich we have to deal sad there are only two that I think we need consider - Ulster and the Nationalists,    be church m such may be ignored in the initial stages, clerics of all denominations are bad politicians, and in any event we should not consider the church except in matters strictly pertaining to it,     Indeed I never understood why the Bishops were included in the Convention except as advisory-members on educational or cognate questions.   However on both sides in Ireland the Clergy take a part in politics, but we Should not recognise them except as citizens save on special matters.   The Sinn Feiners as a body I think we cannot take into consideration either, normally they are a minority they only form a majority through special circumstances, if Constitutional nationalism could be rehabilitated Sinn Fein would lose much support, if enthusiasm for the war could be aroused Sinn Fein would become negligible,go this brings me to nationalism-and Ulster,,     Both have their quarrel with the Government, but so far      I do not know how they stand with each other,   They have both relied on Bnglish parties for support, and both have won after a fashion and both have been let down.The future yawns before them, before Nationalists there A is a prospect of ruin and bloodshed and desperate courses, before Ulster what hope of peace and settlement, with a dis-orderly Ireland and an eventually disorderly England, it is inconceivable that Ulster can expact to hold the position in English party affairs after the war that it did before the war.      English party backing apart, I believe that Nationalists and Ulstermeii might settle their differences between themselves, Would it be impossible to get Devlin and Carson to meet and con-sider the situation.     I could if they would be willing to act either as mediator or as witness or.as a third party on behalf of the Government,      I suggest myself for this reason, although I have no Knowledge as to the source of the rumours of my big Chief Secretary, on one occasion Devlin asked me (shout three months ago on the   occasion of his coming over to discuss the deadlock with the P*M*) whether I would take the office if offered it, I said &quot;If there was a settlement arising out of th* Convention certainly,&quot; to which he replied &quot;But would yo&quot; ;.,v accept the office if there was no settlement, it might    *     .1. while,&quot; we then went on to talk of other things, on another occasion Devlin asked ms to ask Carson what terms he would take, that was I think during the negotiations after the Dublin out-break..   In any event I offer myself for this purpose.   I would urge the two to come to terms as between themselves, and if they would so do I should suggest the following course.A*      Bring in a provisional Government of Ireland Bill, setting up a provisional Government to take over the government of Ireland from the Chief Secretary and the Castle, retaining the ViceroyiB,      Appoint a Committee of Nationalists and Ulstermen to prepare a proper Home Rule Bill, subject to certain instructions on the head of Federalism, Finance, and Military control.Cr      Bring in this Bill when ready.If this course were followed I believe that we should&apos; be en route (i) to a final settlement (ii) to getting men.It would not be undignified for the Government on this basis to withdraw or repeal the application of conscription to Ireland on the understanding that-&apos;the Imperial Parliament did not forego its right to re-enact the measure,   I believe under such circumstances that Nationalism of the Constitutional kind would be re-habilitated and that recruiting on the basis of my previous suggestion could be immediately begun.    The Home
- 4 -*Rule Bill need not then be hurried unnecessarily as the Irish -people would have adequate guarantees that the measure must inevitably become law, as the provisional administration set up under the proposal A, would have abolished the Castle and Chief Secretary system.I suggest this method4toyou as one worth considering. I have as you know no objeeT^prompts me to write except a desire to come to a solution.Yours sincerely, (Signed)     MASK SYKSS.
COPY OP A. MINUTE FPOM SIR M.HAE3HEY TOOFFXCKS OP THE (EAR CABINET, fls gardens, s.w.April SO, 1918.gp^ine MinistersI have had a long and very Interesting conversation today with Mark Sykes on the subject of Ireland.   Mark Sykes is quite oon-vinoed that the enforcement of Compulsory Military Service on Ire-land, without the most elaborate safeguards, will prove a very great danger,   lie does not believe that the ,resulting trouble can be suppressed in two or three months, and he is convinced that it will produce a lasting chasm between the two countries which it will not be possible to bridge. AHe is equally convinced that, it the situation Is rightly handled, we can get the men from Ireland.   I pressed him very minutely as to the methods which he would employ, and the scheme which he adum-brated appears worthy of consideration.In the first place, he would not apply conscription until an Irish Legislature has been set up in Ireland.His method of procedure would be to introduce the Home Rule Bill, which must be a very genuine measure of Home Rule, provid-ing, of course, safeguards for Ulster, at the earliest possible moment,   In introducing it lie would not ask the Irish to accept the principle at First Reading.   He would say that the Government were absolutely pledged to force the Bill through, just as they forced through the Military Service Bill, and would stand or fall by it.   He would, howevert have the Government spokesmen say that, in view of all the disappointments that Ireland has had about Home Rules we did not ask the Irish to vote for the First Reading. All that he would ask was that they would not vote against it. Their- abstention would not be regarded as neoessarily indicating hostility to the Bill.   At this stage he would say nothing about recruiting,I should add that Mark Sykes has some reason to believe that the Irish will themselves take up a non-commital attitude on the First Reading.He would take very careful precautions to ensure that the Bill was in the Irish Partyf s hands immediately after the First Reading, and he would then allow one or two days for the Irish Party to form their opinion on the Bill before the Second Reading.On the Second Reading, of course, it would be essential that the Irish should take part, and a&quot;sympathetic part.   In moving the Second Reading he would have the Government spokesmen take up the question of recruiting.   He would then announce a decision by the Government not to apply compulsion until the Legislature had been set up.   He would then explain that we must have the men, aid he would make an appeal to the Irish to carry out Devlin&apos;s offer to try and obtain recruits.   He believes that such an appeal, if
properly put by yourself with all your fire and eloquence, would evoke a real response.   In the appeal he would explain the method -by which recruiting should be put in operation, and this I will now come to, as I think it is very important.Mark Sykes attaches the utmost Importance to the War Office not having control of the recruiting.   Ultimately he thinks it should be under the Irish Legislature.   Even at first, however, he thinks it should be under some form of Irish oontroi..   His pro-posals, which appear to have been largely suggested to hia pri-vately in a conversation with Mr McVeagh, are that recruiting should be opened in three categories:   that is to say, men should be permitted to enlist:-(1) For the old Irish Regiments whose recruiting campaign should be conducts finder regimental auspices, playing on local enthusiasm and the . great reputations of the Regiments:or( ) For an Irish Army composed of Irish Divisions. To this proposal I add the personal suggestion that the Irish Army might be put into General FqcI^s General Reserve, and that General Poch should be able to place it either under Sir Douglas Haig or some French or American C cm-ma nder and withdraw it again to some other Commander:or(3) For the American Army..   This proviso, of course, is to give a chance to those like the Sinn-Feiners who profess to love freedom but to hate England.Mark Sykes la convinced that with such provisions a very large number of men could be produced voluntarily, I suggested 50,000; he said 80,000.(Signed) M.P.A,Hankey.B, Whitehall Gardens, S.We. April 27, 1918.
