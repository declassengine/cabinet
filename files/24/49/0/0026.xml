M2^ ^Q^.lii^lli^g-JJLInland djrrin^^tho^wsok ^^^.-^1^.^ April t m 1918,UNDUE SBCKDTaBY.Public feeling in the Provinces during the past week has boon in a state of extreme tension, and it would-&quot;bo difficult to exaggerate the gravity of the situation.     This is entirely due to tho proposed extension of the last Military Service Act to Ireland.All sections of the Nationalist Party, Sinn tfcinerg, and men who have hitherto taken no part In polities are solidly united against the Government, and there has never been such wholesale opposition to any proposal.     This has meant an enormous&apos; accession to the power of Sinn  ein, and the whole country with the exception of Unionist U1stor has now practically adopted the policy of that party.During the week the Nationalist members arrived in Ireland from Westminster ond will, it is understood, not return, but remain here to organise thoir Constitueacios.A Conference of tho loaders representing Sinn Jfoln, Nationalists, and Labour was hold in Dublin on 16th and 19th inst*, and a deputation from this Conference visited the Roman Catholic Bishops^ who wore In convocation at Kaynooth..    The Bishops have, issued a communication informing the people that they will be justified in resisting conscription, by every moans not transgressing the laws of 3od.It is not yet known what orders will issue as a rosult of the Conference In Dublin, raid tho country is waiting for the so in a most anxious and alarming state *Ovor 300 anti-oonscription meetings were hold in the Provinces during tho week.    At voyy many of those tho R.C.Clergy presided, while sen hitherto moderate In thoir views listened from the same platform to violent speeches from Sto Foin leaders in- whoso company thoy would not have previously been soon.These meetings ranged from 159000 people at Cork, vhon tho R.C.Bishop presided and prominent Sinn Joiners spoko; Belfast, 6,000, Mullfngar, 10,000, N&amp;van, 7,000, Oarlow, 5,000, Tuam. 5,000, Ballina, 5,000, to small meetings outside E.6.Churches after l&amp;es.At Belfast, Joseph Devlin, and Denis UoCuiloughspoke from the same platform- over which hung tho Sinn jfcin flag,   bom very violent speeches have boon made but as a rule the people have been advised to keep quiet and await^ developments and the orders of their leaders.The Roman Catholio Church is whole hcartedly supporting the anti-Conscription movement, and it may therefore be hoped that the Church will be a-bio to exorcise a restraining influence.   This seems likely in the North and Midlands, but it is to be feared that tho Sinn i?oin or revolutionary spirit in the South and *&quot;&apos;o.st may bo beyond control.A
- 2 -A solemn pledge of passive resistance is being 3igned everywhere but it has come under the notice of the police in some places that the Sinn Fein Volunteers have refused to sign this&apos;pledge as restricting their right to use arms.In Unionist Ulster matters are quiet and work is going or as usual, but a very uneasy feeling prevails.     The Home Rule promise is apparently alone discussed here.     In all other localities it is not even mentioned, being $ver-shadowed by conscription.     In Ulster it has revived the bitter party feeling which has been dormant since the War, and this feeling is reperte to be daily intensifying and will ultimately lead to serious trouble.In the South ?;.rd West tho fear of conscription has completely unsettled monfs minds, and reports from various localities show that farm work is being neglected or abandoned, The young men are wandering about the roads and congregating in the villages in the evenings.     A very slight disturbance in thes areas might precipitate matters.It is dif4cult now to estimate the strength of the Sinn Fein organization.     Last Week about 1,230 Clubs *dth an approximate membership of between 82 and 83 thousand were known to the police in the Provinces.Believing that this organization f$ ms the surest defence against oonscription it is certain that the membership hae increased enormously.On lOth inst. Dr. Patk. McCartan, a fugitive rebel in America, was returned unopposed ae member for North King&apos;s Co. Drilling has increased to nearly double its extent and it is probable that there were 200 cases in the Provinces during the Week,     A disquieting feature is that, whereas arms were not previously carried, this is now being openly don** in ftorth Tipperary.     In this locality it is believed that people have handed all their guns to the local Volunteers.     Other Volunteer corps are being served out Trith hurleys.The prevailing state of affairs has also led to further outbreaks of raids for arms and explosives.There were 30 raids for arms during the Week in one district alone in Co. Kerry,     In Clare 2 police were held up an robbed of theis? carbines.     In West Cork 10 raids are kno*m t$ the police to have taken place and there are believed to have been more.     In Westmeath 2 guns and 21 lbs of Gelignite were seized by Sinn Feiners,     In Roscommon 10 lbs of G&amp;lignite, and &amp; gun were secured.     In Co, Wexfftrd the County Surveyor on hie way t* a quarry was held up by 4 armed and disguised men and robbed of 25$ 1^8 Gelignite.     Raids also took place at Fermoy and Mitchelstown and revolvers and ammunition are believed to have beet) issued in Cork.In Tyrone, Wexford, Kerry and probably in Other localities ^omen are enrolling ae nurses and procuring supplies *.ef bandages and dressings,It would be difficult to exaggerate the difficult and dangerous position in which the police are now placed.   They are exposed to hostility everywhere in the belief that they will be therreal means availed of by Government, and the only effective means, of enforcing the hated proposals.(Signed)   J. BtfRNEINSPECTOR GENERAL,22nd April. 1918
