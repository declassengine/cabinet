^.....il,.....m,./       0[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;g Government.]CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,&quot; Foreign Office. -[April 18, 1918.]f^cllJSW , Germany /002.j      !      7 V 1 THE LICHNOWSKY MEMOEANDUM.ANY&apos;&quot; estimate of the effect produced in Germany by the publication of Prince Lichnbwsky&apos;s memorandum has necessarily to be based for the moment upon th$ comments in the German press, the. private utterances of a not very representative German, the debate on the 16th March in the Main Committee of the Reichstag, and the reply of Herr von Jagow as sent from Munich to the &quot; Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.&quot; Bv &quot;publication&quot; is meant the reproduction of the memorandum in various German newspapers, including the organ of the Majority Socialists, the &quot; Vorwarts,&quot; about a week after it had appeared in the Stockholm (Socialist) &apos;-&apos; Politiken &quot; in serial form in the second week in March.2. There had been publication in another form at an earlier date. The document was composed in August 19 L 6 and was typewritten in five or six copies. Three of these, were given bv Prince Lichnowsky to Bailin, manager of the Ham burg-America Line; G winner, manager of the Deutsche Bank; and Theodor Wolff, editor of the (Radical) &quot; Berliner Tageblatt.&quot; Each of these persons, according to Theodor Wolffs account, put his copy under lock and ke)r and did not reveal its contents. A fourth recipient of the document was not so prudent. He gave it to an officer &quot; of ancient family,&quot; attached to the General Start&apos; in Berlin, Captain von Beerfelde, who had returned from the front a convert to pacifism, and who is described by Theodor Wolff as being something of a &quot; mystic:&apos; and an enthusiast. Captain von Beerfelde must have been a rara avis in the General Staff. It is stated that he took part in the organisation of the strikes last January. At the end of March the police searched his house and found letters from leading Socialists, including the Independent leader, Haase.This officer, on his own initiative and without asking Lichnowsky&apos;s permission, had the memorandum reduplicated and distributed it to various leading officials and politicians. Among others, a Socialist or Socialists belonging to the Minority section, must have obtained the text. By the agency, doubtless of the Minority Socialists, it was printed on poor paper as a three-penny pamphlet, with an appendix drawing the obvious conclusions, and was more or less secretly circulated from hand to hand.In Prince Lichnowsky&apos;s letter of the 5th March last to Count Hertling, he mentions that he had communicated to Herr Michaelis, when Chancellor, his explanation of the unauthorised circulation of his memorandum &quot; when he had heard of the mischief done.&quot; This only indicates that during Michaelis&apos;s Chancellorship (i.e., some time between July and October 1917), Lichnowsky had heard of the unauthorised circulation. It had probably taken place during the summer&apos;of 1917 and it may not have been without influence upon the shaping of the Reichstag&apos;s so-called Peace Resolution of the 19th July. There was no evidence at the time of the strikes, for example, that the masses had airy knowledge of the indictment of the German Government and the military party which the memorandum contains. On the other hand, the Minority Socialist leaders, Haase, Bernstein, and Dittmann, must have become acquainted with it ; Haase once and again hurled at the Government in his Reichstag speeches the accusation that it was Germany who had provoked the war.3. After the publication in the Stockholm &quot; Politiken &quot; in the second m-eek of March, it became necessary for the Government to take such steps as were possible to counteract the effect of the memorandum in enemvand neutral countries and the reflex effect, which it was calculated to produce upon the mass of German opinion. At first the Government seems to have favoured a full public discussion of the matter in the Reichstag. The Minority Socialist, Ledebour. has revealed that Kiihlmann had declared himself at the &quot; Seniorenkonvent,&quot; or meeting of heads of parties, in favour of an open discussion. But the party leaders felt that the situation on the eve of the great offensive was such that a debate on the origins of the war would have been most inopportune. It was decided to discuss the memorandum in the Main Committee of the Reichstag, the proceedings of which, unlike those of the full House, are reported only in a carefuliy revised and greatly abbreviated form. The debate in the Main Committee[367 4] B
2took place on the 16th March, but the report of it was not published until the 19th March-a delay which showed how gravely concerned the Government and its supporters were about the form in which this parliamentary report should reach the public at home and abroad. As regards the memorandum itself, the Government seems to have come to the conclusion that it was now better that it should be only published than that it should continue to circulate clnndestinely. On the morrow of the debate various Berlin journals published the bulk of the memorandum itself, and no proceedings were instituted against them. On the other hand. Captain von Beerfelde and various other persons connected with the clandestine circulation have been arrested.4. The report of the debate, even in its carefuhV censored form, is a revelation of the mind of German politicians. The Vice-Chancellor, the veteran Wiirttemberg Radical, Payer, was put up to make a statement on behalf of the Government. Hertling may have been ill or may not have wanted to give the matter enhanced importance by pronouncing upon it in person. Payer, too, would make a stronger appeal to the whole Left than Hertling. Another consideration is that Payer has been a professional advocate all his life, and was doubtless regarded as qualified to deal with the case in an effective forensic manner. This was the line which he actually took : he spoke like a practised pleader in jury cases. He had no difficulty in discrediting Lichnowskj&apos;- with the Reichstag so far as the Ambassadors personal characteristics self-esteem, vanity, and excessive regard for the good opinion of foreign personages were concerned. He also challenged Lichnowsky&apos;s political judgment in regard to the importance of the Serajevo murders, and thereby opened the door for the usual flood of Reichstag criticism on the efficiency of the German diplomatic service, and the methods of recruiting it and of filling its most important posts.Payer denied Lichnowsky!s statement about the then Chief of the General Staff, Count Moltke&apos;s, having pressed for war; he denied his statement about the Potsdam Crown Council of the 5th July; he likewise denied his statement about the report of this Council which was sent to Count Mensdorff, then Austro-Hungarian Ambassador in London, with the appended comment: &quot; There will be no harm if it leads to a war with Russia.&quot; (Presumably Lichnowsky knew from his Austrian colleague in London what had actually been communicated to him by his Government.)In the course of his speech Payer further referred to a memorandum which had been circulated by Dr. Miihlon, former director of Krupps, now resident in Switzerland. Miihlons memorandum, it will be remembered, fixed upon the Kaiser, on the authority of Helffericb, the main responsibility of having encouraged Austria to press her ultimatum upon Serbia and of having adopted an attitude towards Russia which was bound to lead to war. Helfferich and Krupp von Bohlen-Hallbach, he stated, had shared his (Miihloifs) views of the rashness of the Kaiser s policy. Payer proceeded to discredit Miihlon as neurasthenic and added that Helfferich and Krupp von Bohien had described Miihlon&apos;s declarations as those of a man mentally afflicted. (There is plenty of other evidence that these descriptions of Miihloifs condition are untrue and that he is in full possession of his faculties. He is, by the way, about to publish a book on these and kindred matters.)The report of the debate shows us the Majority Socialist leader, Scheiclemann declaring that Lichnowsky&apos;s pamphlet could, in his opinion, &quot;only make an impression upon those who are known as &apos; pure, pacifists&apos; (&quot;sogenanute Nurpazifisten&apos;).&quot; He cast ridicule, upon Liohnowsky&apos;s vanity and his inaccuracy, and went off on the usual tack of criticising the German diplomatic service. On these lines the South German Radical leader. Herr Miiller. Deputy for Meiningen, followed him. But Miiller made the interesting confession : &quot; It is a blessing that this poison-bomb lias now been exploded by us ; other-wise it would have done much damage. In foreign countries the material was available, and they were awaiting the psychological moment for springing both the documents (Lichnowsky and Miihlon) upon the world as a surprise.&quot;Miiller-Meiningen was &quot; firmly convinced, in spite of Lichnowsky and Miihlon, that the overwhelming majority (sic) in the Foreign Office and that above all, the German Emperor, had always wanted peace and had always been against war with England. Bethmann-Hollweg had done what he could in Vienna to prevent the war: the English Blue Book was the best evidence of this.&quot;Such being the Socialist and Radical views, it is hardly necessary to refer at length to what was said by Conservatives, National Liberals, and Centre spokesmen.   A Free
3Conservative wanted a prosecution of Lichnowsky to be instituted, but the reply on behalf of the Government was that no existing law, not even the emergency &quot; Amim paragraph &quot; applied to Lichnowsky&apos;s case. His resignation of his rank as Ambassador had been accepted, and he had been forbidden to write for the newspapers. (Lichnowsky has been contributing occasional signed attacks to the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt.&quot;&apos;) The Vice-Chancellor, Payer, had previously stated that the Government regarded the publication of the memorandum as &quot;the result of imprudence rather than of evil intention.&quot;The opinion having been expressed that the Government had been altogether too sparing in the publication of evidence with regard to the origin of the war, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Baron von Stumm, replied : &quot; He must confess that the German White Book was not very voluminous. It had been very rapidly compiled in order to give the Reichstag, when it assembled, a clear view of the question where the blame lay. The White Books of other States were much more comprehensive, but the German White Book had the advantage over them of containing no forgeries. For the rest, a new White Book was being prepared for issue.&quot;5. Herr von Jagow, who had been Secretary for Foreign Affairs at the outbreak of war, also entered the lists. In his first communication, which appeared in the semi-official &quot; Norddeutsche Allffemeine Zeituug&quot; on the 23rd March, he o-ave a verv detailed criticism of Lichno\vsky&apos;s memorandum, denying, perhaps with some reason, Lichnowsky;s contention that Germairy had placed herself at the service of Austrian ambitions, but also denying that Germany had urged Austria into war or that she had not clone everything in her power to prevent Austria from forcing the Serbian situation to a European crisis. Like all the German official apologists, he endeavoured to make out that the disclosures at the Sukhomlinof trial concerning the circumstances of the Russian mobilisation furnished a crowning proof that the immediate responsibility for the outbreak of war lay with Russia. Was Germany to wait until the Russian troops had poured over her frontier &apos;?From the British point of view, an important passage in Jagow&apos;s defence of German policy is the following :--&quot; I do not intend to adopt the theory, now widespread among us, that England was the originator of all the intrigues leading to the war; on the contrary, I believe in Sir Edward Grey&apos;s love of peace and in his earnest desire to arrive at an understanding with us. But he had allowed himself to become too deeply entangled in the network of Franco-Russian policy ; he could find no way out, and failed to do that which had been in his power -to prevent the world war.&quot;6. But there is a still more important statement of Jagow&apos;s in some further explanations which he has publishea in the form of an interview in the &quot; Miinchener Neueste Nachrichten &quot; (4th April, Evening Edition, No. 169). He had said in his first statement that he had pursued a policy directed towards an understanding with England, because he was of opinion that this was &quot; the only way out of the unfavourable situation into which we had been brought by the unequal division of power and by the weekness of the Triple Alliance.&quot; In his second statement he referred back to the more or less informal arrangements which Bismarck had made in 1887 with Austria-Hungary, Italy and England, in order to supplement the Triple Alliance and the &quot;Reinsurance Treaty &quot; with Russia. The object of these arrangements was &quot; to bring England into closer relations with the Central European Alliance, and to make her share in its burdens.&quot; Bismarck regarded these arrangements as involving &quot;a relief of Germany from the obligations which it [the Triple Alliance] imposed upon us ; for Austria-Hungary, supported by Italy and England, thus held the balance against Russia.&quot; It was this Bismarckian policy which Jagow had endeavoured to emulate ; he ungratefully omits all reference to his own chief, Bethmann-Hollweg : &quot; The combination of England would have relieved us from the necessity of entering the lists alone, if the case arose, for Austria-Hungary against Russia. As was secured by the agreements of 1887, a portion of our obligations would have been laid on other shoulders.&quot;And again : &quot;I never believed that the agreements about Bagdad and the colonies would signify an immediate change of England&apos;s attitude in European policy. They were intended (o prepare for such a change.&quot;i 367-4] B 2
4Jagow, it may be remarked, is by no means the first German Secretary for Foreign Affairs who tried his hand at inveigling England into taking a share of Germany&apos;s obligations. Baron Marschall von Bieberstein told the writer of this report in the spring of 1896, a few months after theKriiger telegram, that &quot; so long as England stood with Austria-Hungary for the defence of the Straits [the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles], Germany knew that she could count upon her as an adjunct to the Triple xAlliance.&quot; In other words, Germany, who till late in the nineties disclaimed as Bismarck invariably had disclaimed all direct interest in the Near Eastern question, avas really interesting herself in it,, probably on the initiative of William II, who first visited the Sultan, against Bismarck&apos;s wish, in 1889 but she desired that England should continue the policy of the Crimean War, and thus enable Germany to reap both the advantage of the British defence of the Straits and the various advantages of German friendship and of British friction with Russia.7. Jagow ends his first statement with a reference to a memorandum of 1879 by Bismarck, which&apos; he apparently cites in order to vindicate the policy of backing Austria-Hungary through thick and thin. He must know that, apart from countless utterances, inspired by Bismarck after he- left office and published in such journals as the &quot; Ham-burger Nachrichten &quot; and the &quot; Zukunft,&quot; there is a very memorable one in the &quot; Gedanken und Erinnerungen&quot; (&apos;: Reflections and Recollections&quot;) on the necessity of keeping on terms with Russia and not becoming identified with Austria-Hungai y&apos;s ambitions in the Near East.   Bismarck wrote: &quot; If a rupture or even an estrangement between us and Russia appeared to be irremediable, the demands which Austria&quot; (&quot; man in Wien &quot;) &quot; would think she could make upon the services of her German ally would increase first, in the extensionof the casus fcederis.....and, secondly, in the desire to substitute the advocacyof Austrian interests in the Balkans and the Near East for the said casus feeder is. It is not the business of the German Empire to stake the life of its subjects for the realisation of its neighbours&apos; wishes !&quot;8. The effect of the Lichnowsky publication upon the Germans in general can only be judged from casual indications in their press. It is noteworthy that the extreme Junker section find themselves in agreement with him on various points, though, doubtless, not in his desire for a rapprochement with England. What they, like him, would condemn in the past conduct of German policy is the failure to &quot; maintain the wires &quot; of understanding with autocratic Russia. In the Radical and the Majority Socialist-Press, there are a few indications of a revision of opinion regarding England&apos;s attitude in July-August 1914, and these are all the more striking because they occur as obiter dicta. Thus Theodor Wolff, in introducing an article in the Berliner Tageblatt&quot; on another subject, incidentally remarks, without any explicit reference to Lichnowsky, that the generally accepted story of British responsibility for the outbreak of war is now known not to he true. In the same journal Captain Persius, its naval expert, dealing with the unlikelihood of starving England by the U-boat campaign, advocates a peace by agreement and observes : &quot;An understanding ought to be easier now that we have heard from Jagow and Lichnowsky that England was not responsible for the war, as hitherto had been believed in vide circles in German v.&apos;&apos;The Majority-Socialist &quot; Vorwiirts &quot; cannot but admit that the view that &quot; England laid ail the mines which caused the war&quot; is a view which the Secretary of State (Jao;ow). in accordance with the evidence of the Ambassador (Lichnowsky), has now-declared to be false.   The journal continues : &quot; It is, however, by this false view that the whole war policy of the German Empire has been directed from the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare, which brought us war with America, down to those Chancellor speeches which say that Belgium must not again become England&apos;s area of military concentration.&quot;But these utterances are far outweighed by the chorus of condemnation and abuse of the Ambassador and those who approve of his views. As Haase (Independent Socialist) remarked in the Main Committee, the debate was mostly conceited with the person of Liehnowsky to the neglect of weightier matters. * The publication, moreover, came at an unpropitious moment, on the eve of the great offensive. The successes of that offensive, as well as the anxieties with which it is still attended, have thrown the* -Not reported in the Socialist &quot; Vorwarte.&quot;
disclosures and the controversy which they excited into the background. It is clear that whatever impression the revelations may have produced upon the official leaders of German Socialism, they do not mean to let it impair what Germans call their &quot; will-to-victory.&quot; The &quot; Vorwarts,&quot; after recalling that the Socialists had condemned the foreign policy of the Government before the war, says that the subsequent agreement of the majority with the Government did not refer to the past, but only to the future. It meant &quot; the will not to be defeated in this war.&quot;   The article goes on: &quot; No disclosure in the world can shake this will.....   The world-war is nota romantic ooera in which a Lohengrin enters the lists for the innocence of an Elsa; and the innumerable company of those who have shed their blood did not shed it in order to testify to the accuracy of semi-official newspaper articles, but in order to defend the German people against the most terrible menace that has ever threatened a nation.&quot;   (&quot; Vorwarts,&quot; 16th March, 1918.)The same journal in another article says that criticisms of German policy before the war, which are not confined to the Social Democrats, ought to convince foreigners that &quot;the German conscience is not asleep.&quot;   &quot;But,&quot; it continues  &quot; Foreign countries would make a mistake it the)7 expected a collapse of the general moral (&quot; Stimmung &quot;) as a. result of this publication. Lichnowsky&apos;s pamphlet needs to be critically examined in many points, but in Germany even those who consider much that it contains to be true, will not be shaken in their determination to preserve the country from a defeat.&quot;The only private utterance hy a German with regard to Lichnowsky&apos;s disclosures which has been reported is that of the economist, Professor Edgar Jaffe, who frequently discourses to friends and acquaintances in Switzerland on every subject connected with the war. He is known to be in touch with the German Foreign Office, although he seems to beat liberty to recommend his utterances to non-German listeners by frequent denunciations of German policy and German personages. In one of Jaffe&apos;s latest conversations he declared : &quot; The   Lichnowsky memorandum.....has   created  a more  profoundimpression in Germany than any document published since the outbreak of war. It is admitted that the Prince is not oiffced with a large amount of intelligence, and that the memorandum contains evidence of his vanity and foolishness : but, stripped of these, the facts stand out and are believed.&quot;Jaffe himself admitted that, up to the publication of the memorandum, he had not believed the Allied statements with respect to the events immediately preceding the war. His faith in the German statement of the case has been shaken. He added that if it were possible to obtain irrefutable evidence of the alleged meeting (the so-called Crown Council) of the 5th July, this, following on the Lichnowsky memorandum would, he believed, shatter the faith of the German people in the honesty of their rulers.(Jaffe added, by the way, that &quot; the Muhlon revelations were not taken seriously, as the Government have declared that Miihlons friends s&amp;y he is not responsible for his statement and acts.&quot; There is, on the contraiw, evidence that Muhlon is in full possession of his faculties, and the &quot; Leipziger Yolkszeitung &quot; (Minority Socialist) of the 28th March, 1918, confirms his statement that Herr Krupp von Bohlen-Hallbach was alarmed at the Emperor Williaufs encouragement of the Austro-Serbian conflict. That journal states that the Krupp press, as well as the Social Democrats, &quot;raised a warning voice during the critical days of July 1914.&quot;)Professor Jaffe may desire his confessions to be believed, but it seems doubtful whether, even if Bismarck himself rose from the dead to denounce German pre-war policy, he would make any practical impression, unless and until the German armies were beaten in the field.It is hardly necessary to add that although the Junker party may, as has been mentioned, find much that is true in Lichnowsky&apos;s indictment of Gernian3T&apos;s policy, their public attitude towards him is one of unqualified reprobation. It is reported that in the Prussian Herrenhaus (Upper House of the Diet), of which Lichnowsky is a hereditary member, a committee has been appointed to sit in judgment upon him. He has been requested to appear before it, but it is believed that he will decline. According to further reports, he is now living in Berlin under a kind of surveillance, though not under arrest.
