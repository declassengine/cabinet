llf;i (This Document is the Property of( f ! r-.    p- !B oardof Agriculture and Pi she ri e s.Re-port for the week ended 23rd Anril. 1918*Flax Production Branch-General 2z2.  SmSL&apos;It is now possible to report on the work on which this Beard has been engaged during the first three months of its existence *     It will be remembered that the Branch was formed in December last at the instigation of the Flax Control Board who pointed out that the oomplete cessation of the arrival of raw material from Russian ports added to the already severe shortage due to the occupation of Belgium and to other war conditions, rendered it imperative that urgent steps should be taken to conserve our seed supply for future sowing and to increase the production of fibre within the Empire*     Energetic steps to the same end had been taken in Germany, and these in conjunction with the Russian supplies now obtainable must render the position in enemy countries very much more favourable than that of the allied nations? The task submitted to the Board of Agriculture was to arrange for the growth of ten thousand acres of flax, to deal with the resulting crop in such a manner that the seed should be available for sowing in the spring of 1919, and to manufacture the straw into fibre suitable for aeroplane cloth and other military requirements. This task would have been more easy of achievement had the campaign been inaugurated some months earlier, since by the time sufficient enquiries had been made to enable a final selection of districts most suitable for operation to be made, it was already within a few weeks of the spring sowing season, and most farmers had decided upon their cropping programme.     The immediate response to the appeal to grow flax was in consequence so slow that at first any land offered was taken, if suitable, without giving very great consideration to future transport difficulties.     By means of meetings with farmers and personal visits, however, the initial reluctance was overcome, and land soon began to be more freely offered.    These circumstances are mentioned since they indicate the reason why the land taken is in some districts very scattered, thus adding difficulties of transport which need not otherwise have existed and which could in future years be largely reduced.The terms offered to farmers were  8. 10. 0. per ton total crop (seed and straw) with free seed and a minimum payment of  14 per acre whatever the orop.     This latter clause was inserted to give growers the necessary confidenoe in embarking on an entirely new crop, and one moreover with none too good a reputation as regards its effect on the land, and its requirements as to labour. The Flax Production Branch also undertook to supply the labour for weeding and harvesting if requested to do so, and to charge a fixed rate of  1 per acre for weeding and  3 per acre for harvesting (farmer providing horses and horsemen) whatever the actual cost might be.     Thus by fixing a minimum gross return of  14 per acre and a maximum cost of  4 per acre for what was to him the unknown factor of the special labour peculiar to this crop, a balance of  10 per acre was available for the ordinary operations of ploughing and preparation of the land, sowing, harvesting, loading and stacking the crop, rent and taxes, and profit.     The terms offered were based on- careful calculations of the returns obtainable from the cultivation of other crops in the particular districts chosen most of which were in highly productive areas of the country.     The offer of a guaranteed minimum price per acre, however, made it necessary that all land offered for flax should be inspected and passed as being likely to produce a full crop, and it was found that about one-third of the land offered had to be rejected as unsuitable.
The total area of land finally contracted f approximately as follows:-ac *Yeovil Centre   ...... 3460Selby      *      ....... 3800. Peterboro* tt   ....... 3820Suffolk      &quot;    .....;. 1763Fifeshire   &quot;   ....... 140013643With the exoeption of 1,000 acres in Yorkshire which has &quot;been contracted for with a private firm of flax merohants - the only firm of growers still in active &quot;business - the whole of this crop has been contracted for direotly by the Branoh for treatment at their own factories.    Most of the seed necessary has been obtained from Holland, and this is now in the hands of all growers and in the southern counties has already &quot;been sown.    A few special seed drills and a large supply of sowing fiddles which are especially useful for this crop have &quot;been obtained and been distributed to each centre where they are lent free of oharge to growers.    A limited supply of sulphate of ammonia and flax dust has also been forwarded to each centre and this is supplied at cost price,    A minor operation of the Branch has been the examination and classification of the samplesof all seed grown in England and Wales in 1917,    These samples were oollected by the British Flax and Hemp Growers&apos; Society, and on the absorption of the latter body by the new-Branchy this work was taken over.    Only some 30 lots (in all 1,000 bags) were found to be suitable for growing for fibre.    These were purchased at prices similar to those offered to Irish growers (an allowance being made for cleaning and transport), and have been forwarded to Belfast to relieve the shortage of Irish seed.Local Organisation,     The management of each of the five areas is in the hands of a local director, under whom are three chief officers (a) an agricultural superintendent responsible for inspection of land, the sowing, cultivation and harvesting of the crop;   (b) a factory superintendent, responsible for the various factories and de-seeding stations being set up to deal with the crop;   and (c) a camp superintendent in charge of the camps and settlements of labour imported for weeding and harvesting.    The agricultural superintendents have under them assistants to the maximum number of three per thousand acres, each assistant being assigned a particular district.    The factory superintendents will have under them managers or foreman   . &quot; &quot; &quot; or each factoryor de-seeding station.    The camp superintendenteare temporary officers whofle duties will cease on the completion of harvest. They will have under them, and for each camp, a commandant during the time the camps are actually in existence.Factories.     The acquirement of premises suitable for conversion into factories has been a difficult matter.    Every endeavour is being made to avoid as far as possible the necessity of building, and to this end several premises are being utilised which will by no means provide the most convenient or economic lay-out of machinery and plant.    The necessity for an adequate supply of water of a suitable kind and for the satisfactory disposal of the effluent, and the desirability of reducing the reduction of transport of the crop to a minimum are all faotors which tend to restrict the number of premises available.
Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.Meetings ^ere held at Sheffield, Harrington and Castle Cary,-Somerset, and there was a good attendance of farmers at each;   the present position as regards the arrangements made &quot;by the Board and the Ministry of Food to help farmers to obtain feeding stuffs was explained and useful discussions took place.    A conference of the County and Local Representatives of the Joint Committee was held in London, and it was unanimously decided to hold a similar conference each month for the next three months.A special appeal by letter was made, by the Joint Committee, to over two thousand clergyi to bring to the notice of their congregations the urgent necessity for increasing potato cultivation,-The response has been most satisfactory.     County War Agricultural Executive Committees are beginning to assist the Committee by arranging conferences and meetings.    Requests have also been received from some of them for information on different points arising out of Government Orders and Regulations,Land Division.Small Holding Colonies.Patrington.    The weather during the past week stopped all work on the land.    The opportunity has been taken to carry chalk for the repair of the different farmyards, and to sorape and clean the staok*yard3.    Lambing is still in progress, and up to date 311 lambs are alive.    Thirty additional bullocks have arrived, and the produce and stock sold during the week included 200 qrs, oats, 137 qrs, barley, 130 qrs. wheat, 35 tons oat straw, 7 qrs, peas, 38^- lbs, butter, and 1,688 eggs.Holbeach.    The weather has been very changeable, and only fair progreaa has been made with the different field operations on the Colony,    Another settler has arrived, making a total ofi 13 ex-Servipe men now working on the Colony.    The planting of the early potatoes has been completed on two of the farms, and it is hoped to finish this week on the other two farms,Kelham Estate.Most of the spring com has been sown and ie looking wsil. The total sown has exceeded the maximum amount aimed at under the most favourable conditions, namely 441 aores.    This Estate only came in hand on April 6th, and therefore special arrangements had to be made prior to that date to commence the cultivations according to the Committee^ programme.    The cattle are also in good condition, and are doing well.    The hedge trimming machine is at work, with satisfactory results.    The full staff for farming operations has now been engaged.    The arrangements with regard to the plots for the production of sugar beet seed are in hand, and the best available * advice in this country is being obtained for dealing with the cropi and for the testing of the roots for ougar beet content.Tithe. Commons. Copyhold and Survey Branoh.During the past week two applications for altered apportion-ment, four for merger, four for the redemption of tithe rentoharge, and six for the enfranchisement of copyhold lands have been reoeived, fhile three altered apportionments, seven mergers and eight enfran-chisements have been completed.    Many enquiries regarding tithe, copyhold and commons, and a number of proposals for the amendment of
the Tithe Acts in respect of redemption have also been received and dealt with.     It is understood that the Committee appointed by the Council of the Surveyors Institution on the tithe question held theirf final meeting on the 19th inst. when they settled their report.    TheJ principal recommendation will be that free bargaining as &apos;to the terms! of redemption shall in all cases be permitted between tithe owners and tithe payers, subject, in the case of tithe rentcharge attached to a benefice, to the approval of the terms by the Board and by either Queen Anness Bounty or the Ecclesiastical Commission.     The report will, it is understood, also recommend that in cases where^no agreement * can be arrived at by free bargaining, the provisions of Section 45 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, 1881, shall be made applicable.Ordnance Survey.During the week ended 24th April 146,807 maps were sent to [ France and 16,015 to the Admiralty.    26 relief models were sent to France.     1 draft of Royal Engineers for the Field Survey Companies weifc. sent to France,Commercial Contro 1LJBranch,3?he work of the Branch during the week, in addition to enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of rural transport 1 and extended commercial control after the war, has consisted principally of correspondence as to railway facilities for agricul-fcural and dairying machinery and the transit of empty potato barrels to Jersey, the approval of Barnes for margarine and correspondence on 1 Blatters arising in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act,Publi cations Branch,The number of applications for ordinary issues of the Leaflets was 2,507, in response to which 8,516 copies of Leaflets  ere despatched.     In addition 19,650 copies of Leaflets were dispatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution. During the week Food Production Leaflets No. 29 (Suggestions to Dairy Farmers on the Breaking and Cropping of Grass Land), Noa 33 (Fertilisers for Farm Crops in 1918) and Ko, 35 (Varieties of Oats for Spring Sowing) were issued, copies being distributed to 10,200, 10,200 and 10,400 persons respectively.IEducation Branch.The future of agricultural research has been under consideration and the Directors of the Research Institutes supported by the Board have been invited to submit schemes of reconstruction and to formulate plans of work.    As the whole outlook of agriculture has been profoundly altered by the War, it is natural to expect that scientific effort is likely to be diverted not only into new channels,f %\xt also towards the broadening of the stream of .pre-war endeavour, it is expected for example that one of the most prominent developments will be the production of improved varieties of food plants through the agency of the new methods of plant breeding which recent scientific advances have made possible.    The problems connected with the education of the farmer and the farmer*s son have also been under review.     In this arena it is hoped that the new Education Bill when it becanes effective will be a powerful aid to the cause of Agricultural Education, not only by raising the general standard of general education in the farming class, but also by creating a demand for specialised or technioal education in the agricultural industries.
&quot;In this connection it may &quot;be mentioned that a deputation comprising repre sen-cative3 of th3 Agricultural College and Uo\ntty Mncational Committee5 was received during vhe week &quot;by the President of the Boarder of Edaoaoioii and the Secretary of the B-i-avd jointly., in order to diecuss sorae features of the Bill which affect the future of Agricultural Education.Satisfactory reports are being reoeived as to the working of the BoardJs scheme for encouraging the substitution of improved strains of   utility poultry for the many \urp.co stable &quot;birda maintained &quot;by famars and cottagers.     Some anxiety ha a &quot;j*en caused to many poultry keepers as to their ability bo maintain their stocks with the small quantities of concentrated foods now available, and a number of enquiries as to suitable substitutes and supplementary rations have been dealt with,Arrangements for the provision of Travelling and Co-operative Cheese Schools to encourage the increase in the productinn of cheese are-being rapidly advanced.     Up to date it has been arranged that there will be in operation from the beginning of May onwards 49 travelling cheese schools, and 18 co-operative cheese schools.     These *rill be distributed over 37 counties in England and Wales and will be worked in conjunction with the respective County Education Authorities and negotiations are in progress for the establishment of a still further number of such schools.    Already, there has been a considerable increase over the provision made in previous years,    A special course designed to qualify persons experienced in dairying to become factory managers or assistants in dairy factories is now in progress, and it has met with success.     The course is arranged in consequence of the somewhat serious shortage of expert dairy factory managers.Under the scheme devised for the establishment of milk depots in areas where milk is produced in considerable quantities but which is not ordinarily available for human consumption, the Board, acting in accordance with the recommendation made by the Committee on the Production and Distribution of Milk have, with the assistance of the Agricultural Organisation Society, established 9 milk depots, several of which have- been in operation since the beginning of April, and all of which are expected to be in working order in May,     Taken collectively these&apos;depots will (it is expected) deal with over 8,000 gallons of milk per day from the outset, and it is anticipated that their daily turnover will increase rapidly.    They are being eouipped for the production ef cheese during the summer period, and for the sale of milk during the winter season,fisheries Division.Administrative Section.      An Inspector specially appointed for the, purpose nas visited the Teify Fishery District with a view to the settlement of long-standing differences between the net fishermen in the lower and upper reaches of the River, and also to enquire as to certain relaxations of local fishing regulations which have been proposed.    His visit has proved&apos;ve^ successful, and the recommendations in his report are under consideration.In exercise of powers recently conferred upon tha Boarq\ by the Pood Controller they have issued Orders extending the fishing, season for oysters, and for the purocse cf giving eifect to certain&apos; recommendations of the Freshwater 2?ish Ccuaitl-se with regara To the taking of eels, pike and kelts.     Trie Board have also under consfuer-ation an application for the regUxa lions under the Defence of the . Realm Acts giving them further power with regard to fisheries in inland and tidal waters,
The agitation in some parts of the country for &quot;free fishing11 has caused a considerable am rant of c^^spsndence, and the noticeable i:if.*jc*ost wnioh is        sJiotm In fisheries aa a national food supply has led to a vasrSaty of question being put to the Department. In addition, pr^bi^es connected with the reconstruction period are receiving careful attention:,Fishermen\s Reg&apos;1s ^g^ioa^ag^Re^jitlng ,Se^tion.1. Fishermen and Nsval Service.     The Admiralty has opened Section iiyii for fvsHeimen within the new military age limits.     The Inspectorate has been informed of&quot;this, and an instruction will shortly be sent to all fisheries officers of the Board on the coast urging them to explain the position to the fishermen, and advising the latter to enrol in Section &quot;Ytt or, if rejected for this, in F.125,2, Fishermen, Fish Trade and Military Service.    Grave alarm has been caused at certain of the ports by the operations of the Ministry of National Service Order No. 49, especially in extension of the call notices to men in the preserving trades.    Ministry of National Service have denied intention to call men in this trade, and are considering the matter at the instance of the Board.    They have approved the principle of the Board referring to them really important cases, even although the men called come legitimately under the Order in question.    The position of men coming under the new Military Service Act (No,2) of 1918 is under consideration.Fish Food Committee.The Trade Branch are eoouring the country for wood turnings I for the North Shields fishing.    The supply is very scarce, but it is believed that sufficient have been found for the. purpose of this Committee.   Large quantities are wanted in Scotland for the summer&apos; fishing, at Peterhead, Fraeerburgh, and the suggestion of Joint action by this Committee and the Saottiaih Fishery Board for the purpose generally of procuring turnings for the trade is under consideration.    Negotiations are in progress with the Forage Department and the Salvage Department of the War Office for the purchase of old sacks.    So many are lost in transit that it is inadvisable to go to the expense of new sacks if old ones can be had.Freshwater Fish Committee.The sale of elvera for stocking purposes continues. Aboutj 800,000 have so far been disposed of, and orders are still coming in very well. As the work has started on an entirely new field and a month late, these results are satisfactory as the German output at its best ms but 3,000,000 a year. It is believed that as the scheme becomes better ftnown very satisfactory results will be achieved. Designs for several eel traps are under way and a pamphlet on the Capture of the Bel by various methods is finished and 1 is in the printer1 s Jsands,The normal work of the Board proceeds on lines indicated in previous reports.25th April, 1918,Secretary.
