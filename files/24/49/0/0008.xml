Secret &quot;G.&apos;f.&quot;3508.(This document is the Property of His Britannic 3 ajesty*aGovernment).The Effect of the Royal Proclamation of April 20th upon AgriculturalLahoor and To od Pro due t i o n.War Cabinet%Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.I recognise and accept the imperative and immediate need of men for the Army.   I assume that the War Cabinet&quot;has considered the probable effect of the proclamation upon the production of food.   But as no adequate opportunity has been afforded to me of stating the case from that point of view, I desire to put it on record.Tho Proclamation sanctioned by the War Cabinet on April 19th (War cabinet 395, Minute 12) reverses one of the main features in the Government policy of encouraging food production at home.   It does so in spite of the success of that policy, for which, during the last few months, the Government has claimed some credit.   Agriculture now ceases to be a protected industry.   That is the meaning and the object of the Proclamation.   The protection afforded to men below Grade 1 is rather formal than real.   Medical Boards will no doubt be instructed to reduce the standard of physical efficiency required for Grade 1 to the lowest possible limit. If the cabinet adopts the definition of indispensability which is given in the Memorandum of the Minister of National Service (G.T. 4264) - &quot;a highly skilled whole time agricultural worker, who is irreplaceable and essential to the cultivation of a farm&quot; - every farm worker can, and will, be sent into the Army. It is obvious that the present demand on agricultural labour is only the first instalment of further calls in indefinite numbers.The Proclamation seriously affects the largest industry in the Kingdom and the food supplies of the nation. I  In bringing a question of this gravity before the Cabinet, i  the element of surprise should have been studiously avoided.The first intimation which the Board of Agriculture received of the proposals of the Minister of National Service was on the evening of the 17th April, when an official of his Department handed me a memorandum (copy annexed, Appendix A) stating that it was intended to submit a draft Proclamation to the War Cabinet early on the next morning.   The official further stated that he was instructed not to discuss details, but only to give notice of the intention to submit a Proclamation on the lines indicated to the Cabinet next day.The memorandum differs materially from the final form of the Proclamation.   It restricts the proposal to men born in the years 1398 and 1899, and excepts skilled ploughmen.Late in the evening of April 18th, the Proclamation in its published form was sent to me with an aocompanying Memorandum (G.T. 4264).   I had no opportunity for consultation
with my colleagues of the Pood Production Department, and no time to prepare and circulate a statement of the case for agriculture.The issue of the Proclamation destroys the carefully restored confidence of the agricultural community, prevents any further increase in production, and threatens a large reduction in the output of food.   It breaks the pledges on the strength of which landowners and farmers have been induced to plough up not less than two and a half million acres of grass. This polioy of increasing the arable area has involved land-owners in possible loss cf capital.   It has forced upon farmers greater riskb, anxieties and expenses, and heavier labour bills, with the prospect, in the immediate future, of smaller net profits.   These liabilities have not been concealed from the agricultural community.   But mon have been throughout asked, and sometimes compelled, to make the sacrifices on national grounds. They have made them.   As agents of the Governme::t. the Board and the ^ood Production Department have brought about the addition of at lea3t 2-y- million acres to the arable area of England and Wales for the harvest of 1918,What this large addition to the arable acreage of the United Kingdom may mean in increased security of our food supplies and in relief of the strain on finance and tonnage is^. set out in the accompanying Memorandum from Sir Arthur Lee (Appendix b).Neither the agricultural community nor the Departments concerned would have attempted to make this increase without definite promises from the Government that the requisite labour for its cultivation would be provided.   An adequate supply of labour was at every stage guaranteed by successive Cabinet decisions.Before the war, agriculture in England and wales was undermanned.   Sinoe the war, the industry has, it is e^iraated, contributed to the National Servioe one-third of the total number of men originally composing its already inadequate staff. The increase in the arable acreage necessitates an addition of at least 70,000 men.   The Board acknowledges with gratitude ths great help which it has received from the War Office.   The Army has fulfilled its obligations   and from time to time,, for temporary purposes, exceeded them.   But the Board is still very far short of the minimum requirements recognised and sanctioned by the cabinet.   On December 13th, 1917, (War cabinet 2Q7J the Minister of National Service indicated to the Cabinet further sources of supply which, he hoped, would yield 26,000 men.   From these sources we have at present obtained 150 men.As grass, the land which has been ploughed on the Government instructions was producing food.   As arable land, without men to till, sow. and harvest, it can produce nothing. The reversal of policy, therefore, wastes the work that ha3 been done, and causes it to i-e^lt in less food production instead of more.   On tiie land fohat is dcreliot the Government is exposed to heary olaims for compensation.A further consideration has to be weighed.   Much of the old arable area cannot continue to produce corn without a rest.   Unless the crops are grown elsewhere, the cerea-ls produced in 1919 must show a marked decrease on the harvest of
2 i1918, entailing an added strain on finanoe and tonnage.   For this reason, a further addition of one million acres under the plough is proposed for 1918-19, and the programme, is readjr for presentation to the Cabinet.   It is obvious that the addition of this relief land cannot now be attempted.Under stress of oiroumstanoes, pledges involving loss of human life have had to be broken.   No claim is here made for the greater sanctity of pledges involving loss of money. But it is necessary that the facts should be stated.I assume that these agricultural considerations have been duly weighed 03&apos; the Cabinet on some occasion or occasions prior to the brief discussion of the Proclamation on April 19th.   I assume also that they have been discounted in visw of the paramount and immediate necessity for menc   But -1 submit that every possible step consistent with the provision of reinforcements should be at once taken to mitigate The heavy losses^ moral as well as material, which the issue of the Proclamation inflicts on the agricultural community.I therefore make the following suggestions1,     That an appeal should be issued by the Government to the agricultural oommunitj&apos;&quot; to accept the situation and make the best of it.2.     That a definite figure should be named beyond whioh the depletion of agricultural labour shall not be oarried, and that the Ministry of Itfational service should furnish the Board with monthly returns of the number of men withdrawn, together with, their occupations, on the farms,3.     That it should ue made absolutely clear that it is not- the intention to reconstitute the Appeal Tribunals in such a way as to prevent agriculturists from receiving due consideration.4.     That the impracticable definition of indispensability suggested in the Memorandum. of-the Director of National Servioe should not be adopted.5,    That a definition should be oarofully framed which will secure the maintenance cf arable cultivation without opening the. doorof escape too wide.6.     That the definition so framed should be issued to the Appeal Tribunals as a definite instruction to be oarried out in their decisions,7.     That-an assurance should be given that men of the new military age, whole^time engaged in agriculture, will be left on the land in whatever grade they happen to be plaoed.8.     That notice should be given as soon as possible of the definite steps that the Government proposes to take, in order to replace some of the skilled and experienced labour which agriculture is to lose.9.     That the withdrawal of agricultural labourers for aerodrome construction, or timber felling, or any other similar purpose, should be expressly prohibited and the prohibition, if possible, enforced by a penalty.
I submit that immediate aotion in the directions indicated is urgent, unless the paralysis of the agricultural industry is to result from the issue of the Proclamation, i If suoh suggestions as the cabinet may approve were made Cabinet deoisions, there would be no difficulty in carrying them into effect by consultation between the Departments affected.(Sgd.)

APP3HDIX AaIt       intended to Tend to the War Cabinet to-morrow early a draft proclamation under Clause 3 of the new Bill, with-drawing certificates from men born in 1898 and 1S99, if in Grade 1 or Grade 2.The   proclamation deals only with Tribunal exemptions, but at the same time the Minister wishes to is^ue instructions cancelling the administrative certificates of protection held by;-(a) men under the H.A.R.0, scheme born in the years 1898 and1899, except under Section A and any other occupations, which are protected as to the age of 19 in the Schedule(b) men holding Agricultural vouchers in Grade 1 with theprovision that any man who is whole time employed as a skilled ploughman on a farm in farm work, may apply to a Tribunal for exemption upon occupational groundsBAs regards men coming under (a) it will be nece^ary for R. 1 to see the Ministry of Munitions this afternooncAs regards men under (b) it will be necessary for E. 3 to see the President of the Board of Agriculture and Sir Arthur Lee thi^ afternoon.R.17. 4, 18
appendix!.RBCRftllTOEFT OF AGRICULTURAL LABOUR.Memorandum for the War Cabinet by the Director-General of Pood Production.The Cabinet decided (on April 19th W.C.395 K. 12) that not less than 25,000 able-bodied men should at once he drafted from Agriculture to the Army and that this must he considered as a first instalment only.     The necessary Royal Proclamation having &quot;*ince &quot;been issued, the decision must, presumably, he taken as irrevocable.Under these circumstances the Footf Production Department will do everything in its power loyally to carry out the decision and without doubt the men will he forthcoming.It seems unfortunate, however, that before this decision was taken no opportunity was given to the Food Production Department either to discuss with the National Service Department the proposals to be put forward or to submit to the Cabinet any representations with regard to them.     Such procedure is scarcely fair to the Department affected, nor can it conduce to a clear perception &quot;by the Cabinet of the issues which are at stake.The object of this memorandum is to make those issues clear and to supply the Cabinet with the main considerations which have to he weighed before the policy of taking labour from the land is carried any further.     The need of the Army for more men is patent and unquestionable but the highly critical position of Food Production at home, and the extent of the contribution which it is making to the War, is perhaps not fully realised.First, as regards the magnitude of the effort that is being made and which has now reached its most critical stage.The Governments Tar agricultural policy, as announced by the Prime Minister and recorded in the Report of the War Cabinet, contemplated an increase in the tillage area of Great Britain of 3,000,000 acres as compared with the year 1916,     This vast programme which,      most people, seemed so impossible of accomplishment has already been nearly completed (to far ajrrit could be at this season of the year) and, up to a week ago, there was even a good prospect of its being exceeded.     Ho complete or precise figures can yet be given but the results of a compulsory official return by all farmers in Eng3anr- and Walei should be available in les^ tban a^ionth and it is anticipated, with ^ome confidence, that the total tillage area of the Vniy^.J^nf^m in 1918 will show an increase of not 3e^s than 4,00&apos;6Voo6HauTeVas compared with 1916.     In other words the position of the &apos;80s&apos; will have been regained in IS months.     What this addition will mean in the way of extra food must depend upon a variety of circumstances, but mainly upon the weather and a sufficient supply of labour to bring the crops through to harvest.A rough preliminary estimate may, however, be of interest. It in calculated that, after deducting seed and li.ght corn and utilising only one-sixth Of the oat crop and one-quarte-r of the potato crop for conversion into meal or flour, the United Kingdomharvest
harvest of 1918 should produce sufficient breads tuffs for about 40 weeks1 supply, or nearly four-fifths of the total required. If this forecast is realised, or anything like it, the peril of famine, or even of scarcity, need trouble the Government no more   ; v and the worst aspect of the submarine menace will have been definitely defeated.This is the extent of the nationa3. interest which is now being put to the hazard&quot;&quot;and it is for the Cabinet to decide whether it is necessary, or worth while, to take the risk of running this ship on the rocks, with all its precious freight&apos;, just within sight of port.. This suggestion obviously requires explanation.     The work on the food production programme is very well advanced, but   -by ns means yet completed, and the fact that the p3oughing is done . will not produce a crop unless an adequate supply of labour is available throughout the agricultural year.     On the other hand if the labour should now be withdrawn the winter and spring cultivations would be productive of little food and the ploughing up of grassland would have been merely destructive.Tf there were a surplus of labour on the land the case for combing it out would not be contested by agriculturists, but it can be established beyond question that no such surplus&quot;exists. On the. contrary there is a serious shortage.It is necessary to remind the Cabinet at this point that its promises and orders with regard to labour for agriculture have been only partially carried out and that, at the present moment, farmers are 30,000 short of the extra hands promised in December last.     That this deficiency has not gravely checked the programme is solely due to the abnormally fine weather of the first three months of the year which enabled the work to be spread over an unusually long period.     The shortage still remains, however, and was becoming very acute before the present man-power * crisis arose.ii&apos;iNow 25,000 at least of the most active men   on the farms are to be called to the Army and the existing deficiency will be i. increased to&quot;55,000.     Anything and everything that can be done to. mitigate this oalamity is, of course, being -attempted, and a special effort to recruit more women (of whom some 270,000 are already employed on the land) is being made throughout the country. Some of the shortage of unskilled labour may be made up from this source but the skilled hands cannot be replaced.     The damage that will result to this yearfs food production is impossible to estimate but the effect on the Potato campaign must be immediate and disastrous..     No crop needs so much extra labour and one of the chief obstacles to persuading farmers to respond more actively to the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal has been the shortage of the necessary hands.iThis is a question not merely of numbers but of confidence and morale and if, as has been suggested, the recruiting   p problem is largely one of psychology it is important to recognise; that no member of the community is more subject to waves of depression and demoralisation than the British agriculturist.     In this case, however, he has the justification of reason and facts, and despite his utmost endeavours (and no one has worked harder or deserved better of his country during the past 12 months) there is an impossible whicb he cannot achieve.He
He will, I trust and believe, continue to do his best but the loss of output is inevitable and irr*tfievable.     How far it is to be Ql3owed to extend the Cabinet alone ?an decide3     If the present Proclamation were to be the last of the dsmands upon agriculture sufficient confidence might be restored, and sufficient scratch labour devised to enable the 19IS programme to just stumble through until harvest.     I leave out of account the enlarged programme for 1919 which was about to be submitted tc the Cabinet but which must now be abandoned.     But if this dtaft iaj only an instalment then disaster will hove to be faced, so far as production is concerned, and the responsibility will have to be transferred from the administrative Department, which Irnowa only the one side of the man-power problem, to the Cabinet which ie seized of every aspect of it.The object of this Memorandum is merely to ensure that so grave a decision sha31 not be come to without its consequence being fully appreciated.(Signed)   A.
