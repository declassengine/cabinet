REPUBLICAN MOVEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA.

..........

The attached copies of telegrams I have received from General Botha will interest the War Cabinet, as showing that General Botha feels no anxiety in connection with the Republican movement which the Nationalist Party is promoting, chiefly, in my opinion, for gaining votes among old Republicans in the Transvaal and Orange Free State Provinces.

(i).CABLE.From        GlaJHUBAL BOTHA,23rd April, 1918.To GLUSRAL SLUTS.T. ?6,     &quot;Thank yon for your 33. 88.     War news has given me courage.Position here difficult especially on account of extreme bitterness though I have it vail in hand. Irresponsible persons continue holding night gather-ings and administer oaths of allegiance to Republic.Socialists are now teaching Mine natives in Johannesburg that they.should demand higher wages. Thereby serious unrest is being caused and %f I rightly understand Republican movement idea is to make use of native strike in order to obtain arms and so realise their object.     I have ordered quietly one regiment of S.A, i,R, from Pietermaritsburg and one from South r&apos;est Africa to Pretoria,     Our attitude in House of Assembly has had particularly ealming^&quot;influence. General Hertzog thereafter clearly stated that no Republic could be established here without both races and without consent of H*fcu the 2ing,    We are doing everything possible and am quite assured I shall succeed either in preventing or suppressing any trouble. Relations between national Party and Unionists very strained and on both sides have foolish things been said and done,You are at liberty to show this to His 2 ije8tyTs Government,Can you find out whether National Party perhaps have tried to obtain arms and ammunition from the Portuguese.Am quite convinced it will be foolish for me to leave Union Just now,.
(il).Frew        GLILKAL BOTHA.S3rd April, 1918.To GEKBEAI SMUTS.T. 77.     In continuation of my cable T. 76,Position is much improved in my opinion.     Result of bitter debate in Assembly altogether favourable to us* Everything now depends on whether the Nationalists can con-trol their excited followers.    Nationalist M.P,s of the Capo came to see me and told me they did not desire Republic which is to be established by force of arms.   Am taking all possible precautions.     Session is drawing to an end.    Hope to finish next week.     Greetings,
