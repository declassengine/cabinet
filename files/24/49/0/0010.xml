13y ^Grtrt, /w^^ISOmm OF HIS mmmiQ JLLUES2YlS QOTBSHEIW)TO. gramfoffl-jjfc letter......S^fej^ltor  on,? to the  rime Minis tor.I8th-Aprll^L9a^My dear Irtoe Minister,She discussioxLS connected with the preparation of the Bill aye ]pnxs0&amp;&amp;iJ3g very well, and our progress has been more rapid than I should haw expected, haying regard, to the Very serious difficulties with which we are confronted,&apos;   But I think I aa Justified in saying that the further wo go? the more clear it becom&amp;sit $fc  e^w^  cake a oexmenjccment towards tht oslj&amp;hlisbmextt of a Federal system for the United  ing&amp;em, we should make the passage of ths Bill much easier in the House of Commons, make it far more &amp;ccrptahle to the mass of people in Sreet Britain, and I believe , ma&amp;e it easier for Nationalist Ireland to accent pro-visions which, if intended solely for an Irish Bxrliamesit, might seem to them not to he sufficient for the purpose, and eertalnly it would make the position of Ulster infinitely easier.    I think: that If this policy could be agreed upon, it would be possible to * devise a title for the Bill which would get rid of the&quot;words &quot;Home Rule for Ireland^    Shis say seem a small thing, but it would he of immejase importance to all the opponents ox Home Suite, especially in Ulster.    Xt would get rid of the cry and you Imow i how much value there is in a popular description of policy, and the words *Ho Home B&amp;le*l have become a sort of sacred creed in Ulster,Of course it is not be &amp;e contemplated that we should proceed now to set up Parliaments In the rest of the United Kingdomf but we can, X think appoint a Commission, or strong Committee - I hope Tory limited in numbers - and charge them with the duty of preparing, schemes for Bngland, Wales and Scotland,    So far as X am able to Judge from the correspondence in the newspapers and from the reports which reach mo from the House of Commons- where I have had very careful enquiries made, the adoption of this policy by the Gcvern-ment would be very popular,    It would, I think, be regarded as a legitimate and proper reformf and I gather there is a growing feeling that the maintenance of the pledge about no controversial legislation during the War is impossible, and a good many men both in and out of the House of Commons, havo assured me that they think it essential that this change should be made before the after-war conditions come*    Austen Chamberlain cordially agrees with me, and we are both of opinion that it is very desirable that this question should be considered by the Cabinet on an early day next week.    It is not necessary for the decision to be arrived at to-day, because we have dosidod that the Bill is to be so drawn as not to be in any way inconsistent with a  federal system, so that as regards the Bill, no delay will he caused by the Cabinet discussing the matter next woefc, and there is indeed some advantage, as by that time I shall toow hotter than I do now what the general opinion of the House of Commons is, -Shore is no doubt that opinion among members of the Committee has hardened in the direction of a Federal system, and the further one goes in the preparation of the Bill, the more evident it is that once you adopt the Federal system, the drafting of the Billvbeccmes much easier.iiiiiiiiihiiiihiihiiimh1        &apos;l i
In these circumstances I very much.hope that you may be willing to give us a day in the Cabinet to discuss the question as I have suggested.Very sincerely I ours j(Signed). IJiLIER H. LOHG.
