95&apos;Copy of letter dated 24th April, 1918, from the Secretary. faruaoinetV&apos; &apos;tro- Secretary of state for go-reign Affairs.Itear Mr. Balfour,With reference to War Cabinet 397, Minute 5, I have now heard from Sir Sam Pay in regard to the previous arrangements for replacing Belgian railway materials-    He writes that the understanding with the Belgians is that any rolling-stock taken over by the Allies for general use in France shall be returned to the Belgians at the end of the War, or earlier in the event of Belgian territory being freed from the enemy%     This, he says, implies that if any rolling-stock is destroyed it is re-placed,&apos;    The usual rates of tire are paid to the Belgians for these locomotives and wagons, and so far as Sir Sam Pay is aware they arc satisfied with the rates.As the arrangement appears to be a standing one with regard to all rolling-stock taken, I suggest it will not be necessary to make any specific allusion to it in the new request to be made to the Belgian Government.     I suggest4 therefore, that the foreign Office should now act on the ?-rar Cabinet Minute and make representations to the Belgian Government in accord-anco with the recommendations contained in Joint Uote 23 xf of whioh I enclose a copy for convenience of reference.     You will remember that you were to ask the French Government to make similar representations.Yours sincerely,(Signed). II.l.A.MjmY.-&quot;Utilization of Belgian Railway So sources&quot;. Circulated 22nd April, 1918.
