fiUSTifliis doopment is the property of Hig BritanniMa .1esty1 a Government^WAR CABTMIT.&apos;**^khs&amp;^ ?HE jM CONSCRIPTION CAMPAIGN III IBBIMD.( Note by Mr.H.S.Duke.  )G.T.430E.After the conference between the Nationalist, Sinn Fein,and Labour leaders, and the Irish Roman. Catholic bishops at Maynoothon Thursday the bishops issued a public statement signed by all ofthem, the material parts of which were as follows:-&quot;The Bishops direct the Clergy to celebrate a public mass of intercession on nesrfc Sunday in every church in Ireland to avert the soour53 of conscription with which Ireland is threatened.&quot;They further direct that an announcement be made at every public mass on Sunday ner.t of a public meeting to be held on that day at a?i hour and place to be specified in the ersiovzaonent for the purpose of administering the following; pledge against compulsory conscription in Ireland;- -&quot;Denying the right of the British Government to enforce compulsory service in this country, r.e. pledge ourselves solemnly to one another to resist Conscrption by the most effective means at our disposal&quot;.&quot;The Clergy are also requested by the Bishops to announce on Sunday next that a collection will be held at an early suitable date outside the Church gates for the purpose of supplying moans to resist the imposition of compulsory military service.&quot;The Bishops also request the Priests in their respective dioceses to taho the publication of these resolutions in the press as sufficient notification for them to act on.&quot;The politicians assembled again on Friday and on Saturday and made arrangements for addressing meetings in their respective constituencies on Sunday - the meetings presumably which were anticipated in the address of the Bishops-.     They also announced oh Saturday that they would remain in Ireland to prevent the enforcement of conscription.The Labour men have tahen steps for a general stoppage of work next Tuesday, by way of securing on that day signatures of
work people to the Anti-Conscription Pledge.Police reports sho\7, in addition to the generals-c^ntliiiianoa^ of public meetings at which language of great violence is being generally used, the assembling in various parts of the country of the railway men employed by the various Irish Companies and the taking from them of a pledge to discontinue wording the railways so soon   as trains are used for the conveyance of conscripted men.Prom some parts of the rural districts there are reports that agricultural operations are being a good deal impeded by the withdrawal of men from regular work.Students in secondary schools and colleges in the various districts are reported to have been sent to their homes.The Attorney-General imformed me on Saturday that he thought all members of the executive of Sinn Fein should be arrested and deported from Ireland.     The Assistant Under Secretary Sir Edward 01 Parrell, an Irishman of long official experience, wrote me by the same post on the same toric, but thought arrests on a large scale in the existing circumstances would be a mistake and would aggravate rather than improve the situation.     Cn the whole I took Sir Edward 01ParrellTs view, in the absence of evidence of any new action on the part of these men except their participation in the common policy agreed noon with the Roman Catholic Bishops.Sir Edward 07warroll says in his letter - &quot;the arrests would be considered a further stop towards the immediate enforce-ment of conscript,Ion:    they would in&apos;&apos;.lame the minds of the people and render more difficult the compromise on the question of which I think there is still a possibility.     The question, the arresof Be Valera requires more consideration now than before he had entered into a quasi alliance with the Bishops and the Parliament men.     In the absence of some compromise and agreement it will be impossible in the teeth of the opposition of Bishops and Politi-cians to enforce c02:scription so as to produce a practical result commensurate with the other result of the attempt.     Then the Nationalist will be very stiff about the Home Rule Bill and disposed to resent it unless liberal.     On the other hand the
sleaders recognise the difficulties of their political position/and no doubt would &quot;be anxious to compromise, so I hope ultimately there may &quot;be agreement on notli questions.     There are very many thousands of young men in the country naturally disposed to join the fighters if the question could be put to them in a way that appealed to sentiment but I donlt think thejr can be successfully coerced or bullied.&quot;The nature of the contemplated proceedings of the various opponents of conscription in Ireland and the association of the Roman Catholic Bishops and senior Clergy in the agitation appear to me and other Irishmen with whom I have talked, to make any sudden or violent outbreak unlikely.     I apprehend rather refusal of supplies and transport for troops and police, holding up of agricultural produce, slackening or serious reduction of tillage, and systematic- overtures on religious grounds to the men of the constabulary forces who are mostly Romair Catholics and may be sfcaken by such advances under the critical conditions which ezist.(signed) H.E.DUK3.21.4.18.
