In the case of the smaller Departments both the number of employees and their rates of pay require specific Treasury approval and the total numbers authorised could therefore have been compiled from the Treasury records; but in the case of most of the Departments which come within our terms of reference, discretion has been given during the war to engage clerical staff as re -quired,  subject to the observance of approved rates of pay: and in the case of several of the larger Departments His Majesty1s Government has extended this discretionary power to the rates of pay, as &quot;well as the numbers, of the sub-ordinate staff.     The ordinary Treasury records, therefore, were necessarily incorar-lete: and the only information beyond them was in the form of returns obtained from time to time in response to specific inquiries,     for example,  in May last, a return was obtained of the number of employees within various limits of remuneration in response to a request from the Conciliation and arbitration Board: and recently certain particulars of the higher administrative staff have been compiled for the statement of the expenditure from the Vote of Credit, which is to be presented to Parlia-ment.     There has, however, been no special organisation created either at the Treasury or elsewhere to keep full and up-to-date statistics of the staff throughout the Govern-ment service and to watch and control the growth of that staff from a general standpoint,     xxt a later stage of our inquiry we may have to consider v. he the r some special central organisation should not be instituted for this purpose, atleast
The method of KeoruTF-li^nt ^consid-lered separate-- 2 -least for the period during and immediately after the war -hen Departmental arrangements are unsettled- but in the present condition of affairs, we felt it necessary   before we oould proceed with the main subject of our inquiry -viz, the examination of the numbers, organisation and cost of temporary staffs -to obtain comprehensive particulars from the Departments with whioh we are concerned   of the numbers of thair staff, the rates of pay, the system of grading, and the nature of the duties on which they are engaged.     In a considerable number of cases these particulars have not yet been received,3*     In tho meantime, we have considered a general question which can to a certain extent be treated independently, viz, tho possibility of centralising, or otherwise co-ordinating, the system of recruitment of the classes of temporary employees common to all Departments.     Even assuming that staff demands are carefully checked and that the numbers required and the rates of pay offered are no more than adequate, considerable waste and inefficiency may be caused by competition between Departments, in the actual recruitment of this staff, particularly in London, where the demands are of course heaviest.     We have heard evidence on this subject from representatives of the Civil Service Commission, Ministry of Munitions, Admiralty, War Office, Ministry of Tensions, Air Ministry, foreign Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of National Service, Ministry o*f Labour, Post Office (Savings Bank Department), Inland Revenue, and the Office of Works; and as the vast majority of the temporary staff engaged during the war have been women, we also called as witnesses two Lady Superintendents who are in charge of large female staffs in the Post Office, and National Health Insurance Commission respectively. As the result of this evidence, we have arrived at certain conclusions on this subject which we think it desirable to report forthwith.!The Civil oervicej Oornmission I-lachinery.4,     Before the war, temporary staffs were comparatively small and their selection and engagement was generally left to the Department concerned,   Early in the war, it became evident that the large demands made by the London Departments for substitutes for the men released for military service made it desirable to establish a central bureau, which should be responsible for selecting suit-able candidates and passing them on to the Departments which required them.     Accordingly in May 1915 the Treasu: arranged with the Civil Service Commission that the Commission should keep a register of applicants for the various grades of subordinate clerical posts, and Bepart-ments were notified that they could indent on the Civil Service Commission for their requirements. The arrangemen-has been as follows      applicants are registered at the Great Marlborough Street Employment Exchange (or are pass; on to that Exchange from other Exchanges) and the Exchange carries out the preliminary work of taking up the referen-ces of all candidates who appear prima facie suitable. When this has been done, they summon the candidates to an interview at the Civil Service Commission before a Selection Board to whom the records and references are sent.   The Selection Board consists of a representative of the Civil Servioo Commission and of the Employment Department aud (if they attend) of the Departments requiring staff, The candidates are not subjected to any written examination but are questioned by the Selection Board, who recommend on their judgment of tho canaiaa.es,&apos;7supplemented by the records of their previous won references etc, whether /
0whcthor their general educational capacity makes them suitable for employmeht.    If so, they aro allocated &amp; once to anyDepartment which has indentedforib followed generally in regard to candid;staff.   L similar courseother sources,tes obtained fromthe Headmistresses Association, whioh hasprovided a considerable number of candidates from girls leaving the secondary schools but in this particular case, the system of interview was supplemented by a test examination conducted by the Association.   These arrangements have worked satisfactorily and tho requirements of most of the small Departments and a large proportion of some of the most important Departments (especially the War Office) have been successfully met by the Civil Service Commission, the total number of candidates allocated to posts through the Commission up to th* end of last year being over 21,500 viz. ^,7gl men and 18,1??   women.ijeotlons FprTncipl ei fTthe use j this5. Under this arrangement, however, it remained optional whether any Department should engage candidates through the Civil Service Commission or should recruit independently, and a considerable number of Departments - especially the new EFoMjiory by    War Ministries - have adopted the latter method ?nd express a fl Dopartmenta decided preference for it.    The main reason they give for thisis that direct recruitment enables the immediate employer to ,) Closer        select the candidate most suitable for the precise duties for $lection which he or she is required, instead of having to fit in anym&amp;i-oandidate who may be allocated for the post by the CivilItes required. Service Commission.1-2froj Personal Gommenda-ons pre-rred.This argument has great weight so far as the administrative and technical staffs aro concerned: it is obviously necessary for the Head of the   department concerned to satisfy himself that the officers required for such purposes are carefuliy selected for the particular duties on which they are to be employed, and have suitable experience for these duties.   But the bulk of the staff in most Govern-m^nt Departments consists of Clerks engaged on more or less routine work,  ?o, which a respectable standard of education is a more useful qualification than any specialised experience: and in regard to these standardised classes of clerks, although there was some difference of opinion among the witnesses we have hoard, the Departments which have tried both systems anpear to have found recruitment through the Civil Service Commission on the whole quite as satisfactory as direct selection.Another argument advanced in favour of Departmental recruiting is that most of the candidates are obtained en the personal recommendation of persons already employed in the Department, who thus mak9 themselves responsible to a certain extent for their good character.   On the other hand, the system of recruitment on person-l recommendations was admitted by several witnesses to be open to abuse which required checking and. one witness expressed the opinion that, in a minority of oases, it had led to abuse.    It is, no doubt, important to keep open this avenue of selection but this can, we think, be secured without leaving the engage-ment Of the candidates to the sole discretion of the Department concerned.    On all grounds, it appears to us undoubtedly desirable, that candidates put forward on personal recommendations should be tested by some independent autnority to secure that the standard both of qualifications ana of grading is not relaxed on personal grounds.
We have( *i Ivantages 60     The arguments, in favour ox the principle ofcentral      direct recruitment for the standard clerical classes appear oruitment.    to us therefore to he questionable;    the arguments against it are much stronger.     In the first place, it necessarily involves competition between Departments for the available-supply of labour.     At a time when one office has been short of labour, other Departments have had waiting lists of more or less suitable candidates,     Even when waiting lists-are not kept, appliaants who go to one Department0 and find no vacancy there cannot be expected to go the round of all other Departments and it is only natural thatthey should take up private posts and their services bo lost to the Government..     In the next place, the system of direct recruitment and of appointment &quot;on personal recem-mendations has resulted in some cases at any rate of in-efficient and poorly trained candidates being taken on by Departments.     Gases have occurred where applicants who have been interviewed by the Civil Service&quot;Commission and who have not been recommended for appointment, have sub-sequently obtained employment in Departments which recruit independent^     Other cases have occurred in which clerks discharged for inefficiency or insubordination by one Department have promptly secured appointment in other Departments - sometimes at higher rates of pay,     Further, this system of recruiting, combined with different rates of pay, has given rise to cases in which employees of one Department have been attracted away to similar posts in other Departments:   and although our inquiries lead us to think that the actual number of such cases has been exaggerated, a few cases cause a great deal of unsettlement and a wholly unnecessary dislocation of work.     Such cam-petition would be materially reduced if all Departments observed the rule that no appointment should be offered to persons who are actually employed or who have been employed within three months by another Department:    but this rule itself may give rise to cases of hardship which require to be provided for,     It is clear that no completely satis--actory solution can be found as long as the method of in-dependent recruiting is countenanced:    and as the shortage of qualified candidates becomes more accentuated,, the c-^-ordination of recruitment in the hands of a single inde-pendent authority, becomes more and more necessary.     We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that whatever the advantages which direct recruitment may have for individual Departments, the disadvantages from the point of view of the service as a whole clearly outweigh them:    and we think that recruitment for all London Departments should, as far as practicable, be centralised in the hands of one author-ity at the earliest possible date,cctical - 7. &apos;There remain, however, several practical diffi-fficulties. ! cullies which require to be considered.     The most important effecting .of these is the difficulty of securing an adequate supply ^trails-      &apos;of candidates.     Several Departments which were favourable Ion (1) to the principle of centralised recruitment complained thatortage of the Civil Service Commission had not been able to supply pply. their requisitions and that they had therefore been com-pelled to recruit independently.     This difficulty has arisen chief 17/ when a Department has made a sudden demand for a large addition of staff and it has not been cxperienc-ed to any considerable extent when due notice of prospective requirements was given.     But the shortage of qualified clerks is now so great that, even if notice is given, large demands cannot readily be met by the present machinery...
Priority between Depart-ments.We have tried to ascertain the cause of this and we are Inclined to think that It is chiefly due to the competition of the Departments that recruit independently i.e, the available supply is tapped by so many Departments independ-ently that the general pool available for the Civil Service Commission to allocate is correspondingly diminished.   If this is the case, the supply should be improved as soon as it is made clear that the only method of recruitment is through the Commission *   But we think that special steps are required to sirengihen their machinery on this point . Hitherto, although the new Departments and private employers have freely advertised their requirements, the Civil Service Commission has not undertaken any advertising and it is doubtful whether their machinery is fully known to the public.   We think that the fullest publicity should be given to any new arrangements which may be adopted and that except in the special cases referred to in paragraph 14 the Civil Service Commission alone should be allowed to incur expenditure on advertisement.   Further, in order to keep alive the supply of candidates at present obtained through direct application to the different Departments or through the personal recommendations of existing employees, a standardised form of application should be d&amp;^&amp;wn up and made available at all Departments, such forms being sent to any applicants who apply direct, or are known to officers of the Department with instructions to fill them up and return them to the central recruiting agency.   The candi-dates could state on this form the Department in^Siich they would prefer to be employed, and such preferences should, so far as practicable, be complied with. Similarly a Department which is reducing its staff should report to the Civil Service Commission any employees whom it can recommend for transfer elsewhere, and the Commission should take steps to arrange such transfers to Departments which are expanding.   In addition, a special effort should be made to bring the Civil Service Commission into touch with outside sources of supply e*g* by making arrangements with schools and technical instititions which train girls for commercial situationsoIt would also be desirable, we think, for ths Civil Service Commission to have a special interviewing office.   Up to the present, the main channel of recruitment has been the Employment Exchanges: and though the figures show that the Exchanges have dosie extremely valuable work, some of the witnesses suggested that candidates were lost by this requirement.   We think therefore that a special, office should be opened at the present Civil Service Commission premises in Burlington Gardens (where, we under-stand, accommodation could be made available) to which candidates could apply direct, either in person cr in writingsWe consider that these steps should result in the Civil Service Commission obtaining as good a supply of candidates- as the situation admits.   Provided the supply is improved? we do not see any considerable difficulty in arranging priority between Departments: the settlement of priority in other more important matters has been arranged, with goodwill, and we see no reason why this should not &quot;c-s done in the case of staff.
9.   But it has also been swrested that avoidable delays were produced by the present machinery of recruitment and we have considered whether the system could be improved, without impairing the proper consideration of the Qualifications of canaidatss.   under the present system, oandidates who apply at the-  ^change are asked to fill up a form and save references, and they are not summoned to interview until these references have been taken up;   and it is probable that a considerable proportion of prospective candidates is lost in the interval, we strongly reconneud that the applicants should be interviewed when they present themselves in the first instance, in order that a provisional contract may he settled at once subject to the references proving satisfactory.   This could be arranged if tne proposed oilice at the Civil Service Commission were avail-able; tand we surest that applicants at this office should net only fill up the &quot;present form but should at once be interviewed eitner by a Selection Board or by a single interviewer, (as experience may show to be desirable)   and if they are found satisfactory/they should definitely be informed&quot;at the inter-view that they will be riven an appointment subject to their references proving satisfactory.   This procedure would speed up the present machinery but we think it might be desirable to combine with the present method of interview some simple test examination such as has been conducted by the Head Mistresses Association; if this examination were carried out while appli-cants Tie re awaiting interview, it should not entail delay and it would assist the&quot;interviewers to arrive at their decision. Apart from this suggestion, we are of opinion that no rigid standard of educational qualifications heed be insisted&quot;upon and that the candidates should be judged mainly by the general standard of capacity they display.   It should be added that the personnel of the present Selection Beard appears to us unduly small and we think that it should be expanded either by the addition of ether full time interviewers or   by calling in part time assistance   Departmental representatives being also added, if they desire to attend.Different       10.   The other main practical difficulty in the way of os of       instituting a centralised system of recruiting is the fact that &apos;-&apos;her-       varying rates of pay are in force in different Departments and on. in some cases the rates of pay are not fixed but vary betweendiscretionary limits.    These differences of rates are. in part due to the adaption by some of the new Departments^ t winchi were given discretion in such matters, of rates of pay higher than those generally authorised by the Treasury, ana in part, to the adoption of different conditions of service:   for instance, tne Ministry of Munitions and other new Departments require a minimum attendance of 48 hours a wee1-: (including luncheon inter vals) and do not pay overtime for extra attendance:   other Departments require a minimum&quot; attendance of 44 hours a week (including luncheon interoal), in some cases paying overtime and3) Del aynvolvea. d.   ^ven  however, if the supply were adequate, somecomplaint has been made that recruitment through a central authority would involve delay.   If Departments&apos;&quot;do not give previous notice of their requirements some delay is unavoidable m assigning candidates: &quot; bur, so think that in many cases notice of prospective requirements jouid be given if due fore-sight were exercised.   There will still remain eases in which a sudden decision of policy necessitates the recruitment of a large staff immediately and we think that in such exceptional cases special arrpjisrements must be made (see para,.   14 below) *
xn s^e-^aa^ got:   while in the permanent Departments, the zmpor^y staffs hare generally heen engaged on the same $&amp;xM X6ss as apply to the pemanent staff, viz;   s nunimum p teaateace jt &apos;-4  houra. tr-week (including liino&amp;Km^^ mth regular overtime pay for extra attendance,     In so fat as ths conditions of service differ in this my, differences of pay are inevitable, but the differences of pay have in tho paat not boon wholly justified by the difference of conditions .   they oreate a considerable amount of &amp;i s-satIsfaction among- the various staffs (who in many cases, are not aware of the differences in the conditions of services) ass! they appear to bo the main cause of competition between l&amp;epartments 9    We understand that the treasury recently attempted to secure unifonnity on the basis of a minimum attendance of 44 hours and no overtime;   but various objections were raised to this proposal and for the present it has been decided to leave the conditions of service unaltereds but to attempt (by adjustment of a recent increase of War bonus) to bring the various rates of pay Into correlation, having regard to these conditions.     Such an arrangement vail not entirely obviate the difficulties to which the Select Committee on national Expenditure have drawn attention (Second Kepcrt, paragraphs II -55) and we shall have to consider tho possibility of securing greater uniformity at a later date.&quot;11*     At ths present time, we are only coneernad with th^bst&amp;clos which such differences present to the centrali-sation of recruitment,     Hitherto, the Civil Service Commis-sion has felt bound to notify candidates merely of tho mirdsnns rato of peys although in fact tho actual rate in the majority of eases is considerably higher,     In view of their position, this was, no doubt, the correct/ course;   but wo think that as soon as the revision of rates now being effected by the treasury has been completed, a statement should be drawn up of the hours of duty, rates of pay and conditions of service in each of tho various groups of Departments and that this statement should be given to applicants, in place of the present notice, so that they may know tho facts and state-any preference they have.     If this were done, wo see no substantial difficulty, so far as the rates of pay are concerned, in appointment being made for all Departments through a central agency, though a complete standardisation would undoubtedly simplify its task*Power 12*     Some witnesses have also expressed objection toismissal, recruitment through the Civil Service Commission on theground that they have greater difficulty in dismissing clerks obtained in this way than those whom they recruit indepen&amp;ent-ly.     We see no ground for this objection.     The Civil Service Commission can only express a provisional approval Of candidates and cannot guarantee their efficiency:   and it should be clearly understood that, although tho candidates assigned should in all cases be given a trial, it is for the Department in each case to decide, as soon as a reasonable period of probation, lias elapsed, whether their   capacity justifies their retention, and, if not, there should bo no greater hesitation in discharging such clerks than those recruited independently,     The decision thus arrived at should, however, be notified fully and accurately to the Civil.c..

Thi-e is clearly necessary to enable the central authority to keep control of the candidates,trails- 13.     Subject to the adoption of these proposals, weon of re-    think that the centralisation through the Civil Service itmerrjhJ^r   Coimmiasion of all recruiting for the standard clerical iidard deiypluses in London is not only desirable, but practicable, 1 olassee    except in quite speoial eases which u,re dealt vdth in the amended,     next paragraph,,     This course .;ould enable the Comission to control the supply anci distribute it to Departments -without the present competition and overlapping.     The Commission would not normally entertain applications from persons  .ho are already employed or ..ho have been employed within three months in the Government service,   but they would be in a position to exeroise a reasonable discretion in the operation of this rule.     Tor example,   they might consider applications from Girl ueasengars for transfers to junior clerical post3, and if they were satisfied as to their fitness for such poate, they could, after consulting the Department concernedj arrange transfers without creat-ing competition.     Similarly, they could consider on their merits applications for re-employment from persons *ho have resigned in oircumotanoee which could not be regarded as a sufficient ground for debarring them from further employment.   The desirability of using the material avail-able to the best advantage appears to us a strong reoommen-dation for a central authority.lotions.. 14.     The only exceptions which ..e would regard asnecessary are the cases in which, owing to a decision of policy, a new Department or a large addition to an existing Department has to be created, as a matter of urgency, in a few days.   In a good many oases it appears la us   that-such emergencies could be avoided.     decisions of policy are frequently delayed for v.eeke or months, but, as soon ae they are taken, the administrative machinery ie expected to be created in a few hours,     Tho arrangements thus made are naturally defective and we think that in many oases extravagance and inefficiency would, bo avoided if a reason-able period were given for the organisation of the neeess-ary machinery on properly thought-out-lines,     But there will still remain a minority of c^ses in which urgency ie vital in the national interests and in such cases a staff may require to be collected at vury short notice.   Ho central recruiting machinery can be adapted to meet such demands: and during such emergencies we think that Departments must be left to make such arrangements as they can to supple-men t the supply obtainable from the Civil Service Commission, without regard to the usual etandard3 of qualifications, provided that certain rules are strictly observed viz:(1) That all appointments are made solely by a properly organised Establishment Branch, to which a representative of the Civil Service Commission should be attached.(2)   That no appointment is offered to an applicant who is actually employed, or who has been employed within three months, by another Department without the consent of that Department or of the Civil Service Commission,  (This rule should in our opinion be rigidly observed by Departments which recruit independently, discretion being allowed only to the Civil -Service Commissioners under the procedure suggested in paragraph le,)
(3)     That the recioyds of all candidates ai^olnted are-sent to the Civil Service Cnnmtaaicn to he noted in thoir Re glairs,(4)     That no advertisements for classes recruited onro-ugh the Civil Service Ooimiil&amp;aion are Issued exoept with the concurrence of the Commission;   and(5)     That this procedure should he confined to cases of emergency and should he discontinued us soon as the period of emergency ia over, the normal method of recruitment being then reverted, to and the staff engaged during the emergency being reviewed in accord; standards.withthe normalonlyIruitmentThesystem juatiiformed that conditions (1) and (&apos;Department at present where we think such a b] e is the Ministry of Food vvhers m are in-1) and U) are adopted?   but some arrangement on similar lines will probably be required in the case of the other Departments v.hich at present reoruit directly, during the transitional period which must elapse until the Civil Service Commission has established the -new machinery and can undertake the work*   Such arrangements can be left to be settled by the Civil Service Commission,15,     The above pi-oposals relate mainly to the stand nv*\c olasaaa of routine clerks, s   we have oor^ri/iarsd whether it is neceaaary or desirable that they should be extandad to typists. Hithertoj the Civil -Service Cormmiaaion has supplied typists and Shorthand-typists, as well as Clerks, eo far as -they were ables   but the supply has recently been totally inoA^-Quate to meet the demand.     Their machinery at present is also not very effective in that they do not pa&amp;a applicBats through a technical test and leave the Departments to do this and to settle the rate of pay accordingly.     So long as this is the case, the Civil Service Commission act merely ae a Post Office and their intervention cIoob not appear to be of any practicalfecruitment LHigher pde Clerks1fanistrat-O Assis-ad vantage;e think that, on the same general groundsButas in the case of Clerks, it is clearly preferable that the recruitment of typist staff should also be directed by a single authority?   and we recommend that, as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, the Civil Service Commi&amp;s-ion should be responsible for putting applicants through a technical test and that they should be given power to recommend, on the result of this test, the rate of pay which they oon-sider suitable in each case, subject to the maximum limits prescribed by the Treasury.16.     VTe have oXbq considered whether the Civil Service Commission ahould recruit for any of the higher grades,   &quot;or the reasons stated in paragraph 5, we do not think this is possible for any of the specialised aclmiiiiBtrative or technical appointments.     But the Civil Service Commission have actually, under a further arrangement made by the Treasury, undertaken the supply of a standard class of Higher Grade Women Clerks mho were required for the junior administrative posts, in substitution for the junior Class I.,   Intermediate and similar permanent officers.     Candidates for such posts were obtained from i&quot;.omen with University or other good eduaational qualifications but, *a a rule without much, previous experience:   and the supply thus secured has proved very useful.   But the best qualified candidates have, recently;, at least, found it easier to obtain appointments from Depart-ments direct and ourattention
imaryRecommenpV^ruitraentbside idon.ons.17,   The Civil Service Commission machinery is only appropriate for dealing with the recruitment of staffs in London and It v;ould not appear practicable to extend its scope to the recruitment of staffs for provincial offices. V*&apos;e have not yet taken evidence in regard to the staff arrangements of those offices, but it is obviously desirable that the rule proposed in paragraph 14 above in regard to the appointment of persons actually or recently employed in another office should be adopted throughout the service and that some working arrangement s*hould be effected in large centres, where several l^partments have jrovinoial offices, to prevent competition and overlapping,g. by making available for all Departments any waiting .ist or direct applications which come to any one $tepartment.^LQ,   We recommend therefore(l)   That, save in certain exceptional cases, where very large staffs have to be collected as a matter of. extreme urgency, the recruitment of the standard classes&apos; of clerks and typists for all London Departments should be centralised in t,he hands of the Civil Service Commission.(2)   That to make their machinery adequate for this purpose, the Civil Service Commission (a) should open a special office in their present, premises,  (b) take further steps to secure candidates from all available iources, (oj extend the personnel of their Selection Boards and (d) improve the method of selection by the institution of suitable test examinations or otherwise.(3)   That in the exceptional cases where very large staffs are required in an emergency, independent recruiting should continue subject to the strict observance of the rules stated in paragraph 14.(4)   That the Civil Servioe Commission should continue to supply Higher Grade V/omen Clerks but that it should be open to Departments to nominate applicants whom they desire to appoint to suoh posts for the approval of the Commission.We have the honour to be,Your Lordships1 humble obedient Servants,(Signed).

( Secretary 5*attention has been drawn to the fact that Departments adopt very varying standards of the class of work which should be regarded as appropriate to this grade, and proportionately varying estimates of the qualifications reouired. It appears desirable that some attempt should be made &quot;&quot;to secure uniformity in this matter and we consider therefore that in so far as Higher Grade Clerks or Junior Administrative assistants are not obtained through the Civil Service Commission but are selected (either from the existing staff or from direct applicants) by the Departments concerned, they should be nominated to the Civil Service Commission and interviewed by them, in the presence of a representative of their Department, and their appointment should only be oonfirmed with the approval of the Commission.   This procedure is already in force in many Departments and we consider that it should be applied in all cases.
