1 CTiiiis Document is the Property ^ Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1918.SHIPYARD LABOUR.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the following minute on the Admiralty proposals about Shipyard Labour, which has been sent to me by Sir Stephenson Kent.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.April 17, 1918.The proposals of the Admiralty for the reconstruction of their Labour Depart-ment only concern the Ministry of Munitions so far as the reorganisation affects the work of the Ministry and the labour within its control.The Admiralty&apos;s proposals for all practical purposes abolish their Labour Department; the production departments are now to deal direct with the employers and labour without the centralisation of policy and regulation that have been found essential in the past.To deal seriatim with the points that affect the Ministry: Labour Supply. It is not too clear from the memorandum and the chart how co-ordination and investigation of demand are to be effected. In regard to shipyards and engine-marine works, co-ordination may, perhaps, be secured, but the Admiralty&apos;s supply functions do not begin and end in these industries. Their activities are coextensive with those of the Ministry of Munitions in the production of guns, shells, explosives, scientific instruments, optical glass, &amp;c, though on a smaller scale. Apart from marine engines and shipbuilding, no machinery for co-ordination would appear to be proposed, and, indeed, no machinery is put forward for the investigation of labour demand in any sphere of production.It has been the unfortunate experience of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions that labour demands emanating from the employers on investigation are only too often found to be grossly exaggerated.It is observed that the Labour Priority Branch are subordinated to produc-tion departments, and may not negotiate with employers or employees, either personally or by letter, except by permission of the production department concerned. Under these circumstances, it is submitted that dilution and the economic use of labour generally will inevitably be for all practical purposes ignored. It must be remembered that the interest of the employer, looking to the post-war period, is to retain his full complement of skilled men. The presence in his works at the end of the war of diluted labour must retard his reversion to peace industry, and will almost certainly give him labour difficulties. On the other hand, and, perhaps, even more particularly at this moment, the less selfish employer will find his task in effecting dilution and substitution without Government pressure and intervention even more difficult in view of the fact that such procedure will inevitably lead to recruitment of the men affected by the scheme. The existence in any area of even a single Admiralty firm where dilution is not pressed and man-power is wasted enormously increases the difficulty of carrying out dilution in munitions firms in the area,How can the Ministry of Munitions justify pressure in regard to the economic-use of man-power and dilution in munitions firms if no similar pressure is exerted on Admiralty firms? The whole activities of the Ministry of Munitions in this regard will inevitably tend to the benefit of Admiralty work, for not only will the Admiralty firms be practically immune from recruiting, and from forced economy of man-power, but the labour which the Ministry of Munitions release for the Colours or displace by dilution and substitution will inevitably find a safe haven in Admiralty firms.At this moment, when the greatest possible activity should be shown by the Government and its responsible officials in enforcing dilution and the economic use of man-power, it would appear incredible that this most difficult task should be left to employers and labour in an industry which is notorious for having effected the least possible dilution, controlled only by production departments whose main pre-possession and responsibility are the supply of material, and who have since the
commencement of the war resisted dilution on Admiralty work with great zeal and success.Labour Regulation. Under the Admiralty proposals, the only reference to labour regulation is contained in the statement, which occurs twice, that the Labour Priority Branch may only intervene in disputes when asked to do so by the pro-duction departments. This system gives no security that any co-ordinated policy will be pursued among the various production departments, or&quot;as between them and other Government Departments concerned. A decision might be given by an Admiralty production department which, though on the face of it trivial, might affect a series of Ministry establishments. In matters of this kind, it is essential that there should be a uniform, central, comprehensive, labour policy. It has been difficult enough to secure uniformity when there have been several competing labour departments, but the difficulty will be intensified a hundredfold if in addition to competing labour departments there are a number of production departments in the Admiralty, each having its own labour problems and policy.Again, there is the question of wages, to which no reference is made in the memorandum. It is assumed that large wage questions will be referred to the Ministry of Labour following on the War Cabinefs decision. It must, however, be remera-bered that wage questions of a very complicated and difficult kind, involving broad issues, arise on individual and apparently trivial cases, even after the policy has been laid down. It is extremely difficult even for employers and labour in a given shop or district to realise what may be the effect of a decision in an individual case. Beyond this, it must be borne in mind that, even if it be the intention to follow the Committee on Production or Ministry of Labour decisions generally, these decisions do not apply to individual cases of alterations of premium bonus systems, or bonuses on output. It should not be forgotten that by a very simple and, on the face of it, innocuous alteration in bonus systems it is possible completely to alter the wages conditions in a district. It is assumed that the Admiralty have not overlooked the provisions of Section 4 (2) of the Munitions of War Act, 1915.90 per cent, of disputes arise on wages, and therefore to leave disputes either to production departments or to employers and employed is obviously liable to cause serious trouble. The ordinary inducements to employers to pay an economic wage have been largely removed during the war, and the necessity for State control over the administration of wages is instanced, in the most glaring way, in the case of the sheet metal industry. There employers, by competition amongst themselves, had within six weeks raised the standard rate&apos;for sheet metal workers in the London district from 10-M. to Is. Id. per hour, i.e., an advance of 23 per cent, in the rate in question. The Ministry of Munitions have been forced to step in to stop a further uprush, and even while they have been endeavouring to obtain the agreement of other Government Departments in carrying through an absolutely necessary measure, they find that employers have been sending up the rate to extraordinary heights, e.g., 2s. 4-d. per hour. It must be remembered that this has all taken place within the sphere of the Committee on Production awards, by means of individual advances which have ultimately forced up the district rate. There is nothing in the Admiralty scheme which is likely to prevent such procedure, and everything which is likely to secure it.Quite apart from these aspects of the matter, the object of the Munitions of War Acts was to establish a general Government control of labour conditions, and it should be noted that the industry in which it is proposed to hand back the settlement of disputes to masters and men is the industry which above all has been subject to prolonged and difficult strikes, and in which Government intervention has been most eagerly demanded by employers. Further, it was the pressure from the shipyards, owing to their failure to settle their own difficulties and to get rid of demarcation difficulties, that primarily led to the Treasury Agreement, and which may, therefore, be taken to be the fundamental cause of the Munitions Act and the second schedule.The final argument advanced for handing back to masters and men the control of their own labour affairs is that the present system has failed to produce ships. This is no doubt the fact, but it should be pointed out that the Ministry of Munitions has exercised far greater control than the Admiralty in regard to the firms within its orbit, and, as the Prime Minister has recently pointed out in the House, the Ministry has not failed to produce munitions.S.
