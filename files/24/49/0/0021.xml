AIR MINISTRY,

16th April, 1918?.

Dear Colonel Sir Maurice Hankey,

Is it worth while replying to General Trenehard&apos;s memorandum? As Chief of the Air Staff he was perfectly impossible. He is entirely without imagination, and although he had been in this office for three months he had prepared no strategic plans of any kind whatsoever. If there ever was a case of a square peg in a round hole, it is to be found in the appointment of General Trenchard as Chief of the Air Staff.

I wish to make quite clear that General Trenchard was not my selection.

The first day I came here Sir William Weir, Director-General of Aircraft Production, pointed out to me that it was essential that General Trenchard should be located in London as so long as he was in France no one in London could understand from him what aeroplanes were required. He told me the confusion was increasing and there was grave risk, unless General Trenchard was brought to London, of the aircraft programme being entirely behind what was required.
On this I asked General Irenohard to come to London to have a talk: with mo*   ifrom the first he assumed that he web indispensable.   He would only come to London on terms.   Among these terms was the right to appoint all the military members of the Air Council.    I refused this in writing, although being constantly urged by Sir -Till i am Weir and Major Baird to bring him by any end every means.   Eventually he came to London as Chief of the Air Staff on the condition that he should remain Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force in France, an arrangement to which Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig consented.   This arrangement had not been in existence more than a. fortnight when it was abruptly terminated by General Sir ^illiam Robertson,    General Trenchard&apos;s sole appointment then was Chief of the Air Staff*Although I considered him in everything and gave way on every possible occasion;  I found that nothing would satisfy General Trenchard.   On his staff ift London he had Major Sir John Simon, Lieut, Lord Hngh Cecil,and I understand that at en early date Major the Rt, Hon. Harold Baker was to join him.   He was building up a &quot;Praetorian Guard&quot; of politicians.For the Gentlemen I have mentioned I entertain great respeot but they are not the  ind of staff appointments Which should be made by c Chief of Staff,    They derogate from the  -position of a Secretary of State and they spread a falsa and wrong atmosphere,I am not   incorporating these points in my reply to General Trenchard because they are somewhat personal in character, but if you think fit you can show end road this letter to the Prime Minister or any other Member of the Jar Cabinet,Yours very faithfully,Lieut, Col, Sir a uric a Hankey, IC.C.B.
B.MORM from the SECRETARY .QF STATE FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORQB.I will reply to General Trenohard&apos;8 memorandumcategorically.,1.    It is not true that there was any interference with General Trenchard in his work.     I have shewn his memorandum to several people here and they know of none.   The only instance to which I think he can be referring is the following:- .Sir William Weir, the Director-General of Aircraft production, received an order some months ago for quite a large number of seaplanes.   Re thought it was inadvisable to place the order.    On his Technical staff was Captain Groves, R.N., a very distinguished Naval officer, who pointed out to Sir William Weir that for submarine work aeroplanes were in a large number of cases much more useful than seaplanes.   On this statement Sir William Weir asked Captain Groves to elaborate hie views, which he did in a most excellent memorandum, copies of which were sent by Sir William Weir to the Minister of Munitions, General Trenchard, and myself.   This memorandum was of such importance that I placed myself in communication with the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Munitions anil we held a conference on the matter.General TeBchard took a strong objection to th* ^ whole incident but my experience of General Trenchard is that as he was only reluctantly induced to countenance the bombing of German towns so he was equally reluotant to adopt any suggestion of any kind that was put before him which was in any way an elaboration of hiB own experience of the employment of aircraft.2. General Trenchard resigned on the 19th Maroh, twelve day8 before the date arranged for the fusion of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps.When I got his resignation I was dumbfounded, I knew perfectly well that the mere rumour of his resignation twelve days before these two Forces were being amalgamated might have a most disastrous consequence.It was well known in this offioe that I was not in the beet state of health.   The death of my eldest son five weeks before after a lingering illness of over two months had caused me great distress of mind and body.   About the 1st March I told not only General Trenchard but Major Baird and Sir William Weir that acting on medical advice it might be essential for me to surrender ray appointment, but I said that under no circumstances wottld I go until some days after the 1st April when the fusion would take place.I told General Trenchard that his resignation would embarrass me greatly and I urged him to delay his request for an immediate reply until some time not later than 20th April. This he reluctantly agreed to do.I frankly told him that under no circumstances would I continue in the sane office with him and that if my health allowed me to remain the question of chonsing between myself and himself would be a-matter for the War Cabinet.
In my opinion no language is too harsh in which to stigmatizo the conduct of General Crenchard in reaigning twelve days before the fusion.    After such action, battle or no battle, it was imperative in my opinion that General Trenehard should not remain here.On General Smuts1 suggestion I offered General Trenchard the command in Franee, the intention being to replace him here by General Salmond.     He refused, saying that be ?/ould place his services at the disposal of PieId-Marshal Sir Douglas Eaig.I might mention that on the day General Trenchard resigned it wsb understood in this Office that a great German attack was imminentc     I received his letter on the Tuesday and the attack begazi*/early dawn on Thursday morning.General Trenchard refused to supply the Air Council with any statement as to what he was doing to meet the present emergency.     He did not think they should be the recipients of any information.      The little information I received was doled out in small morsels, and I was really unaware of what was going on.     As an illustration I may mention that papers have come before me to-day showing that General Trenchard was appointing with the rank Of Major-General an officer to overlook the Air Commands in Salonika, Egypt, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.   (The qualifications of tho officer in question were not discussed with me and I was entirely unaware that any such appointment was being made.In conclusion I should like to reiterato what I said in the memorandum I submitted to the War Cabinet.   &quot;As a coramat ding officer he has doubtless exhibited great qualities. As a Chief of the Air Staff he has not the outlook, the ability to study scientifically theoretical problems, the readiness to advance young officers of merit, or the willingness to associate others with his work, which in my opinion are indespensable in a man filling this poste&quot;(Signed)     H0TH3RMERE.Secretary of State, Royal Air Force *16th April, 1918.0.Copy of letter dated 15th April 1918, from Secretary, War Cabinet, t&apos;o**Xord Kothermere.Bear Lord Hothermere,I enclose copy of a Memorandum sent to the War Cabinet by General Trenchard, who has asked that it may be submitted to the War Cabinet and placed on recordc     The Prime minister thinks that, if the Memorandum and oorrespondence is circulated, you ought to have an opportunity, if you wish&apos;, to circulate a reply with it.Yours sincerely,(Signed)     M.PpAoHANKEY.The Kight Hon0Lord Rothermere, &amp;c.

Whitehall Gardens, St\V, *************Sir,I would ask, if you think fit, that the attached memorandum may be submitted to the irar Cabinet and placed on record,I have the honour to be Sir,Your obedient Servant (Signed) H.-TH3HOHAED.Major General,***a*te*a*R.A.F,D. i,1,     I would like to record in writing the reasons I resigned from the position of Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal Air Foroe, and to submit the correspondence which has passed between the Secretary of State for Air and myself on the subject.As will be scon I ventured to point out the Chief of the Staff was not allowed to carry out his work unfettered and with-out outside interference, and that the Secretary of State ha-b encouraged the intervention of various people without responsi-bility in decisions concerning operations and the means of carry^^. ing them out.2*     I would also like to record that 1 resigned on ths 19th March, tv/o days before wo knew the battle in France had started. On handing my resignation to Lord Rothermere he told me that he himself was going to resign before ^pril SOth and he wanted to know if that would make any difference,     I said of course it would make a difference, in as much as it would be for his -successor to decide whether to accept my resignation or not. He then asked me if I would defer my resignation so as not to crab ari*as s him or the Government and I stated I had no wish ts embarrass him or tho Government,   He also asked me if I would give him further time before my resignation became effectivo. This of course I agreed to do, and eventually April 20th was settlod as the date.The battle began on the 21st iforoh, and so just before I went to France on ^pril 5th I informed him that I had not pressed the appointment of a Deputy as in the event of my resignation my successor mighty want to appoint another man.On April 10th, in the afternoon the Secretary&apos; of State sent for me and told me the War Cabinet had accepted my resignation and had offered me the command of the Air Foroe in France,   This was repeated two or three times,    It seemed to me that it was out of the question to think I could turn out General Salmond to make room for me, for I felt very strongly it would have undoubt-edly lost me the respect and confidence of tho whole of the Air Service,     Still loss could I do this in the middle of the battle,I had no wish to take any action during the battle and I deeply regret that the Secretary of State has considered it necessary to do so.^Signed) ,H * TESJHGHARD,   lia $.

3fflCLOSURES *to D.i.(i)Copy of letter from G-eneral Trenohard to kord Hothermere.AIR MINISTRY, STRAND, V.C.18th March, 1918,The Secretary of State for Air, Air Ministry.I have written thia letter on the functions of the Chief of the Air Staff which I would ask you to consider *It seems to have been the case in the paat that when questions which arose which required careful considers-tion by the Heads of the Service oonosrhed, officials belonging to other Departments consulted one another on these questions and devised numerous and different plans for their solution.The responsible officials were working on one plan but subordinate or other officials who were not immediately responsible for this particular phase of operations were also working separately on the same plantNow the Air service has corns into being three Separt-ments are attempting to do its work instead of only one.  he Chief of the Air Staff was appointed primarily to deal with these questions,        the system of the past seeme to continue regardless of his appointment,This situation has become increasingly serious.   ?or instance, a senior official in the Munitions Branch sent a paper from a French Supplies Liaison officer direct to you; you in your turn sent it direct to the   ar Cabinet without the Chief of the Air Staff knowing anything about the matter until the paper came back to him from the War Cabinet.   This paper was on the subject of whether it is preferable to use aeroplanes or seaplanes scain&amp;t submarines, a question which the C.A.8t with his advisers and the Air Force Liaison Officer with the Mmi/aity and their Operation Officer have been dealing with almost daily for the lest two months-,.     Various changes were and are being made in this matter which is being continually threshed out.Since then a meeting hvs taken plaoe between the three political Heads of Departments;   the Admiralty, the Munitions and Air Ministry, who disoussec1 this same subject and proposed to draw up a further memorandum, a.;.a in without the being informed.     The first he heard of the meeting was two days afterwards from a paoer which came bsck to him from the Secretary of the &quot;;,ar Cabinet.Again, you seat for the ivi,G.Pe on Saturday and asked him if aeroplanes oouid not be used to a greater extant instead of seaplanes, c-nd told him to investigate the matter,.   The C*A.S. was not informed of this step.
Again, a senior officer in the Technical Department of munitions visited the Training Division and asked for data with regard to the amount of flying, etc. done by the various sa^o&amp;drons along the Coast with &amp; view to seeing if training machines could be usec for airfri-eubmarine work. He stated he had come from the Air kinistry, and this again was without the knowledge Qf tne C*.A*G,This system seems to have been going on for many, months with regard to various matters *I .vould now point out that the failures and short-comings and delays of the past vere supposed to be due to these very methods, and there is no doubt that this is the case.   I would further point out that as I was appointed Chief of the Air Staff, and as I am responsible to you, I am-your adviser on those matters and X am able and willing to obtain for you all the information you desire*   I am far from denying that you have a perfect right to see whom you like, but at the same time if you have not sufficient con-fldnnce in me even to tell me what is happening in the branches of my own d -partment I consider, and I feel sure that you will agree with me, that the situation created is an impossible one.(Signed)     H.

Copy,. .0^&apos; letter from Lord Rothermere tg General Trenohard.ALA MINISTRY. Strand, l^th March, V-j18,My dear General,Replying to your letter of yesterday1s date, I hope you will pardon me If I describe it as unnecessary,There has never been any question here as to what your position isr   You are Chief of the Air Staff and are my principal, not necessarily sole, advisor in all matters pertaining to the employment of personnel and material in all the various theatres of war, and at home in association with the Baval forces end the foroos of the Home Defences.I have shewn great confidence in you.   Por instanoe in regard to the approaching vacancy kn the post of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff I have told you I am prepared to accept your nominee.   For this post you have selected Captain Yyvyan, R.N..From conversation with you, I do not think you have a very clear conception of what the duties of a Deputy Chief of the Air Staff are.   You say that Capt. Yyvyan will do admirably to &quot;devil&quot; for you.   The Deputy Chief of the Air Staffs relation to you should be very much the relation between two ICG.1a who are both appearing on the same side in a case..   One is the leader;    the other is there to give independent advice to his leader and to supplement his efforts whenever necessary.Personally, I regard Captain Yyvyan as an unfor-tunate selection. I think a much better selection can be made.You have here Captain Groves, ?:.!!* a most distin-quished officer, who apart from being an airman has a broad outlook on the whole aerial strategy of the wart   I have pointed, out to you that I should much prefer that he should be selected but, in view of my personnel statement a few weeks ago that I would allow you on this occasion to nomi-nate a successor to Admiral Mark  err, I cannot do more than bring his mime before you.I think you will agree that in allowing you to nominate a member of the Air Council, I have allowed you a unique privilege.   You are probably the only Chief of Staff in this country to whom such a privilege has been eztendedcAnother point that I do not wish unnecessarily to dwell upon is that I cannot regard the advice of any of the members of the Air Council as pontifical.     I will give you an illustration.   A few days ago-a letter was forwarded to your Department from my office in which the statement was made that the writer had heard a Cotha over his house a few nights before.   The reply from your Depart-ment was a suggestion that it was no more easy to hear than it was to smell a particular type of aeroplane.   I asked you if this was so, and you said that the writer, ColonelDavidson,
Davidson, was quite accurate.   -Yitliourt^nieTition^ circumstances, the matter was referred to the Home Defence authorities, who staled that it was quite easy to deteot by hearing certain types of aeroplanes.   A certain number of young practical airman were asked, who returned exactly the same reply.You and Colonel Davidson may be right, but what I wish t* make clear-is that in view of a grave conflict of opinion on sueh a matter as this, it is impossible in the early day3 of a new Service, for a Secretary of State to accept the advice of any professional adviser entirely w ith out - demur.My otrioeplfcm of the work of your Department is that I should  e the recipient, at not infrequent intervals, of all kinds of plamfc for the employment of aeroplanes strategically and otherwise.   These I am hoping to receive.In regard to the various matters mentioned in your letter, I must tell you that it is al?*fays *pen to the Political Heads of any Departments to confer at any time they like with whomsoever they please without consultation with their Chiefs of Staff or anyone else.As to Sir Godfrey Paine coming to see me on Saturday, it was with reference to the casualties in Train-ing Aerodromes and the question of the employment of aircraft for the convoying of merchantmen, if raised was not the subject on whioh he oame to see me.I am writing yo*u this memorandum so that there may be no mi^undijrai^nding in the future.   I had at first intended uot to reply to your letter, but on further oon-sideration I can see it is naoessary I should doYours very faithfully,fSd). BOTESRMSEE.Major General Sir H.M.Trenchard, K.C.B., Chief of Air Staff, ;    Air Ministry.
6(119th. March, 1918,Secretary of State for Air, Air Ministry.I have been Chief of the Air Staff for nearly three months now, and during that time I have felt it is almost impossible to carry on at many times, and as you knew I have seen you on various matters which have been,serious at the time*I -fully realise the difficulties of makine this Department of State, and I have done my best to nelp put it on a sound footing, but all through I have felt and do feel that you would rather take outside opinion than my own.Under these circismstances it is plainly, my duty to ask to be relieved of my appointment as Chief of the Air Staff as early as possible.I have not done this without considering the matter for some time, but I feel that I cannot work under these conditions, and it is therefore my duty to resign so that you can appoint another officer.I sincerely regret having to take this step(Signed)   H. TRENCHARD.Major General, Chief of the Air Staff.(iv)AIH MINISTRY,STRAND, W.C. 2.13th April, 1916.Dear General Trenchard,I now accept your resignation tendered to me on the 19th March.I cannot say I do so with any particular reluctance.. Every man is the best judge of what he does but I believe our act in resigning your, post of Chief of the Air Staff welve days before myself and the large staff here were going&apos;into action to accomplish the gigantic task of the fusion onf the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corp^ isH^^^all^l-M incident in the public lite of this country. &apos;
Tworesignation when ^nroStarod and It is true.    I could do nothing edays ago yourepryourprofound anxiety lest your resignation might become public! end rianour with its thousand tongues might&apos; allege you hao resigned in protest against some &quot;policy &quot;of mine^ftuch woi be disastrous to the interests of the *5,000 Officers and 14Q,000 men who were just going to become the Royal Air Force.Under such circumstances your resignation might have jeopardised the whole scheme of amalgamation on which I and many others had been working night and day for some months.   I can only attribute it to instability of purpose, which I have observed in you on several occasions recently and which, in my opinion is due to the overstrain and work of the last three years.For anyfciing you have done since I have been here I wish most cordially to thank you.Yours very faithfully,(Signed)SecreMaj*Genl* Sir Hugh Trenchard,K.C.B.
