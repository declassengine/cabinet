SECRET.Extract from Despatch from the Government of India, Army Department, No. 57, dated 3rd August 1917.25. The difficult question now before us has been examined by the Commander-in-Chief with a fall appreciation of the delicacy of the varioiis issues involved, of the need for caution which those issues demand and of the serious consequences which might result from any hasty or ill-considered decision. Oar colleague lays great stress on the importance of maintaining the popularity of service in the Indian Army, so that there may be no falling off in the class of British officer electing for an Indian career. The Indian soldier is a shrewd judge of character, and Sir Charles Monro holds that, in a service in which leadership and personal influence count for so much, it is essential that the British officers should be representative of the best type of English gentlemen. Consequently, it is, he thinks, of the highest importance that the changes now contemplated should be effected very gradually and in such a manner as will not deter the sons of officers from following their fathers&apos;calling, or break that hereditary connection with the Indian Army which in many families has become traditional and which experience has proved to be of the highest benefit to the State. Provided, however, that our proposals are accepted, we do not anticipate that the effect of these changes will be to render Indian service less popular among military families than it has been in the past. Our colleague considers that the fighting classes of India&apos;:;:&apos; have, by the loyalty and gallantry displayed by them in a war which has tested these qualities as they have never been tested before, established claims which can no longer be deferred. He therefore recognises that the time has come for granting King&apos;s commissions to a limited number of carefully selected representatives of these classes, who, by their character, upbringing and family traditions are likely to develop, with training, into officers of a type capable of associating with English gentlemen on terms of social equality.26. We entirely concur in the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s views, and consider that we should now gradually open oat to Indians of warlike races careers in the army, giving them, as far as circumstances permit, opportunities of advancement equal to those enjoyed by Indians of non-fighting classes in the various branches of the civil administration. We consider that the objections to such a policy which were advanced by Lord Roberts and his contemporaries in 1888 were based largely on Mutiny experience and have considerably less force now than they had a quarter of a century ago, while the expectations aroused at.the inauguration in 1901:of the Imperial Cadet Corps call urgent^ for fulfilment. The legitimate aspirations of Indian gentlemen for a military career have not been satisfied by the grant of commissions in the Native Indian Land Forces. We are accordingly of opinion that selected Indian subjects of His Majesty who have qualified by the prescribed tests should be held eligible for appointment as second lieutenants, with the same status, authority, and power of command as is enjoyed by British officers.27. We recommend that British commissioned rank should be obtainable by Indians in the following ways :-( ) by qualifying for the same either as a cadet through the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, or under the regulation prescribed for British University candidates, through a University which has established a suitable course of military instruction and been approved by the Army Council;.(ii) by the selection of specially capable and deserving Indian officers or non-commissioned officers of Indian regiments, who have either been promoted from the ranks or joined their regiments on direct appointment as jemadars, and who have gone through a course of instruction at a military school in India;* By fighting classes we mean those classes which are or may be included in the authorised class composition of the Indian Army.ms 5s3 A
(in) by the bestowal of honorary British commissions on Indian officers wno have rendered distinguished service, but whose age and -t   lack of education preclude their being considered for King&apos;s commissions under [ii).We hope, in this way, to meet the legitimate aspirations of the three classes whose claims to higher rank in the army should, we think, be admitted.(i) Commissions through Sandhurst and the Universities.28. It has been suggested that Indian aspirants to commissions might be trained at a military college in India instead of being sent to Sandhurst. We have carefully considered this suggestion and unhesitatingly reject it. When the question of granting. commissions to Indians was discussed in Calcutta in 1911, Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, who represented the WTar Office at a conference held there immediately after the Imperial Darbar, stated definitely that the outstanding feature of the War Office attitude towards the proposal was that, to qualify ail Indian for command over British officers and soldiers, a course of study at Sandhurst was essential. He explained that the military authorities at home could not accept training at a military school in India, even with a passing out examination similar to that prescribed for Sandhurst, as a suitable or adequate preparation for an Indian officer who is to command British troops. We are of opinion that the War Office was fully justified in insisting on this condition, as the best guarantee for the elimination of racial prejudice on the part of British officers and men, and for the reception of Indian second-lieutenants hj their brother officers in a spirit of real camaraderie, is to give them such a training as will enable them to start on their regimental careers with the manners and ideas of English gentlemen. We consider that the nearer we approach to this ideal the greater will be the prospect of success, and, as a con-dition of its attainment, we regard it as indispensable that these Indian lads should complete their elementary military training in an English environ-ment. We are aware that it may be objected that residence in England at an impressionable age, and deprivation of parental control are apt to have a bad effect on Indian youths. We consider, however, that this disadvantage would be more than compensated for by the military discipline which these lads would be subjected to as cadets. Special arrangements would have, of course, to be made for their accommodation and supervision during the vacations^while we understand that, as in the case of; other cadets, strict limitations would be&apos; placed on their visits to London in term time. We may add that in our opinion the. Sandhurst course should be extended to two years, and that such an extension is specially desirable in the case of Indian cadets. ... .29. We are opposed to the idea of having military colleges in India similar to Sandhurst or Woolwich. We have been compelled to start the schools at Quetta and Wellington in order to provide for special needs created by the war; but we do not advocate the continuance of these institutions when circumstances permit of a reversion to normal conditions of training, as an Indian environment is not favourable to the education of English lads, and their parents would naturally object to sending their sons out to India as cadets at an earlier age than is permitted in the case of private soldiers. &apos; We are aware that these objections apply mutatis mutandis to the case of the Indian parents who, under our proposals, will have to send their sons to Sandhurst; but as they are -already accustomed to send the latter to England for university, medical, engineering, and legal training, they cannot reasonably object to their being sent to Sandhurst, where they would be kept under wholesome control Moreover, even if the course were extended to two years, this would generally entail for these cadets a shorter period of separation from their friends than would be necessary in the case of young men studying for other professions.30. It was our original suggestion! that all Indian candidates for Sandhurst should sit for the entrance examination in England, as. this coudition is insisted on in the case of Indian candidates for the Civil Service.
We realise, however, that there are political, domestic and social objections to such a course, and that it might limit the field of selection and act as a deterrent to lads of the class we particularly desire to attract. We accordingly recommend that the examination of Indian nominees for cadet-ships, other than those educated in England, should be held in India and that it should be a qualifying test, entirely distinct from the examination held in London, though of the same standard as the latter. We are of opinion that an English public school education is the best preparation possible for the Sandhurst course, but we realise that it would not be practicable to insist upon it in the case of all Indian candidates. We are, therefore, prepared to accept selected Indian schools as its equivalent, provided that arrangements can be made for the periodical inspection of these approved institutions by the military authorities, and that the school education in India of Indian nominees for Sandhurst is supplemented, as proposed below, by a course of training designed to accustom these lads to European modes of life, develop their manly qualities and inculcate a high sense of honour and loyalty. We would further desire to retain a discretion to select, in special cases, candidates educated privately in India. These candidates also would be required to undergo supplementary training of the special character referred to.      .31. Candidates for Sandhurst would be recruited from youths of from 15 to 18 years of age, nominated by Local Governments, preference being given to those educated at certain approved schools (among which would be included the Chiefs&apos; Colleges at Ajmer, Lahore, Indore and Hajkot), which would be accepted as the equivalents of English public schools. The names of those nominated would be submitted to the Commander-in-Chief, who would select them, somewhat on the lines adopted for the selection of naval cadets, up to the number required for training, the actual establishment being slightly in excess of the latter so as to allow for casualties, failures in examination, &amp;c. The names of the nominees selected would then be submitted to the Viceroy for approval. On their nominations being approved, these youths would join a school to be established at Dehra Dun in the buildings formerly occupied by the Imperial Cadet Corps, now in abeyance. The school would consist of from 20 to 25 pupils, who would there undergo a two years&apos; course of training with a view to their qualifying for entrance into Sandhurst. The school would be under the personal inspec-tion and control of the Commander-in-Chief, and the Principal would hold military rank. In the selection of the latter the personal influence which he would exercise over his pupils would be our first consideration. He would be assisted by a suitable staff.The education given would be of a general character, and would be designed to replace that given in the Army Class of an English public school, there being no corresponding institution in the Chiefs&apos; and other schools in India. It would thus include elementary military instruction up to the standard prescribed for the Junior Contingents of the Officers&apos; Training-Corps in England. The educational course would be graduated so as to cover in the period of two years the obligatory subjects prescribed for the Sandhurst entrance examination. It would, however, in our opinion, be desirable to permit the substitution of either Science or an Oriental but non-Indian language, such as Persian or Arabic, for French or German as an obligatory subject in the case of Indian candidates. Periodical examinations would be held, mainly with a view to test progress. Students, who did not give promise of attaining the required standard, would be required to withdraw, as is the practice at most English public schools.Special attention would be paid to the teaching of English, so as to ensure that those selected for admission to Sandhurst would be able to speak, read and write English with facility before leaving India. Games and manly sports of every kind would be encouraged, as apart from their value in aiding physical development, skill in athletics would go far to popularise Indian cadets with their British comrades. Pains would also be taken to instruct these lads in English ways and habits, and they would be required to take their meals together in European fashion, so that by the time that they were ready to go to Sandhurst, they would have assimilated English ideas and personal habits sufficiently to take their place amidst English environments
without feeling at a social disadvantage. We have not yet fixed the tuition fees to be paid at Dehra Dun, but our intention is that the cost of their education should be defrayed by the parents or guardians of the pupils.32. The claims of Indian lads educated at English public schools would be met by providing for their admission to Sandhurst on the recommendation of headmasters, under the conditions prescribed in paragraphs 30 to 40 of the &quot; Regulations for Admission to the Royal Military College,&quot; subject to their having been nominated by Local Governments and to these nominations having been accepted by the Commander-in-Chief and approved by the Viceroy.33. The total number of Indian candidates for admission to Sandhurst, whether from Dehra Dan or from English public schools, or qualifying for commissions as University candidates, would be limited to 10 a year. If in any one year the aggregate number of Indian cadets admitted to Sandhurst and of Indian University candidates granted commissions fell short of that total, a proportionate increase would be made in the number admitted or commissioned in the following year. In order that disappointment should not be caused to pupils at the Dehra Dun school, after undergoing two years&apos; instruction, by being excluded from the final examination owing to the prior selection of candidates for Sandhurst or for University commissions in England, the numbers of the latter would be ascertained well in advance and the number of admissions to the Dehra Dun school would be regulated accordingly.34, We consider that the terms of payment for Indian cadets, while under instruction at Sandhurst, might be regulated on the general lines of articles 707 to 716 of the &quot; Royal Warrant for Pay,&quot; and the &quot; Regulations for Admission to the Royal Military College.&quot; In the case of cadets whose fathers had been killed in action or died of wounds, or of disease contracted on service, or had rendered specially good service to the State, King&apos;s cadet-ships might be granted on the Viceroy&apos;s nomination, carrying with them remission of the sum usually paid for uniform, books, &amp;c, and an outfit allowance of 65L on their obtaining their commissions. The passages from India to England of cadets selected for admission to Sandhurst would be defrayed by Government, and instead of their appointment to the Unattached List being dependent upon the place they take when passing out of Sandhurst, Indian cadets would, provided that they had qualified for commissions, have the same right of electing for appointment to the Indian Army as is now enjoyed by King&apos;s cadets. If given this privilege they would know, before entering Sandhurst, that their admission to the Indian Army was assured, provided that they satisfied the prescribed tests. It is conceivable&apos; that a few cadets belonging to princely families might prefer to serve in British regiments, and in such cases we consider that they should be allowed to exercise their choice ; but the large majority would, we believe elect for an Indian career. Our proposals have accordingly been framed on this assumption, our intention being that young Indian officers should, on being commissioned as second lieutenants, be attached to a British unit, either in England or in India, but preferably in the former country, preparatory to joining an Indian regiment. Their training would thus be assimilated in every respect to that of their British comrades.(ii) Commissions through the Ranks.35. We have now to explain our proposals in regard to Class (ii). We are most anxious that concurrently with the opening out of a career in the army to young Indians commissioned through Sandhurst or approved Univer-sities, we should create opportunities for the higher advancement of specially deserving and capable Indian officers of Indian regiments who have proved their soldierly qualities in the field and possess the general and professional education requisite to fit them for the position of a British officer. We attach great importance to this proposal, as to grant commissions to young Indians of good family, without at the same time providing for the advance-ment of those who have risen from the ranks, would be calculated, as Lord Roberts has pointed out, to .&quot; offend and alienate the bulk of our best fighting
material,&quot; and so have a prejudicial effect on the discipline and contentment of the army.36. In order, therefore, to maintain the popularity of military service and dispel any idea that, the interests of the classes now serving in the army were being sacrificed or their services overlooked, it is of the highest im-portance that we should improve the prospects of our Indian officers by rendering them eligible under certain conditions for King&apos;s commissions. The obstacle, hitherto, to any such concession, has been that these jfficers lacked the general and professional education requisite to fit them - for any higher position than that of a troop or platoon commander.. The spread of education during the last 20 years has, however, altered the situation eon-siderably. There are now among our Indian officers, especially among those who.have received direct appointments as jemadars, a number who have received a fair education and who know a little English, but who lack the professional training which higher responsibilities demand, besides being generally too old to assume the latter with any prospect of success.37. To make good these defects, we propose to establish military schools at which the most promising of the non-commissioned officers who in ordinary course would be selected for promotion to jemadar, as well as young men of good family who have been selected for direct appointments as jemadars,&apos;:;:&apos; would receive a; practical professional training somewhat on the model of the French Ecole de Sous-Officiers at Saint Maxent. The object of this instruction would be to render them thoroughly efficient as troop or platoon commanders, and to train them to take, in an emergency, the place of their British officers in the command of squadrons and companies. Experience has shown that the heavy casualties which may occur in the course of a few minutes&apos; fighting, may leave an Indian unit entirely without British officers. It is therefore essential that our Indian officers should be trained to assume the responsibilities apper-taming to higher rank, as their failure to do so on various occasions in the present war may be ascribed in great measure to lack of proper training and want of opportunity in peace time. The large majority of the graduates of these schools would never rise above, the grade of risaldar or subadar. But we believe that among them would be found an increasing proportion qualified to hold King&apos;s commissions, and we anticipate that very efficient officers would eventually be obtainable from this source, Indian officers of this.&quot;class would probably command the confidence of their men in a higher degree than those recruited from Sandhurst; moreover, the knowledge that the sepoy might aspire to attain full commissioned rank if he possessed the necessary qualifications, which must include.a good knowledge of English, would have a most stimulating effect on recruiting,, for it would open out to ambitious youths of fighting classes avenues of advancement and distinction which have hitherto been denied them.38. The officers and non-commissioned officers selected for King&apos;s commissions in this manner would be additional to the ten young men commissioned annually, either from Sandhurst or the Universities. We do not propose to limit their number at present, as the total must necessarily be small to begin with, though it may be expected to increase as larger numbers of qualified candidates become available for selection. Eventually it will no doubt be possible to fix the proportion that should be maintained between Indian officers of Classes (i)-and (ii) respectively. This, however, cannot be determined untiL we have had some practical experience of their comparative merits as regimental officers. We consider that the selection of a qualified Indian officer or non-commissioned officer for a King&apos;s corn-mission should be subject to the recommendation of the three senior British officers of his regiment and should be conditional on the latter being prepared to accept the nominee as a second lieutenant in their own regiment. This would ensure care in selection, fix responsibility for the same, and restrict the grant of this concession to the most capable and deserving; for no officers would recommend an Indian officer or non-commissioned officer* A large proportion of these young men would have been educated at the proposed Kitchener. College for the sons of Indian officers, referred to in paragraph 15 of cur despatch Ko. 17 (Home), dated 24th November 1916.
for promotion to bmish commissioned rank in their own regiment unless they were thoroughly satisfied as to his efficiency and suitability for such advancement.(iii) Honorary Commissions. -39. The proposals outlined above would provide for the grant of a limited number of King&apos;s commissions to qualified candidates from the ranks. We consider it necessary, however, that some concession should be made to Class (iii), i.e., to those officers of Indian regiments who are insufficiently educated or too old to be granted King&apos;s corn-missions, but who are deserving of advancement to higher rank on account of their distinguished services. For them we would recommend the grant of honorary commissions, on the principle referred to in paragraph 14. Excluding Indian princes and officers extra-regimentally employed, conferment of the honorary rank of captain or lieutenant is at present restricted to officers who, at the time of their retirement, are members of the 1st or 2nd class of the Order of British India. This restriction deprives the privilege of much of its value, and we accordingly recommend that the Government of India should be authorised to confer the honorary rank of captain or lieutenant, subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval, on specially meritorious Indian officers still on the active list, reserving the honorary rank of major or lieutenant-colonel for bestowal in exceptional cases, on retirement. As honorary rank confers no power of command, officers selected for this distinction, which would carry with it a small increase of pay and pension, would have no authority over British soldiers, while their authority over Indian ranks would, as before, be that conferred on them by section 7 (2) of the Indian Army Act. Thus though the conferment of honorary rank as proposed would not alter their power of command, it would raise the social status of these officers and would be highly esteemed by them as an honourable recognition of their services.40. In conclusion, wre would explain that our object in formulating these proposals has been to place Indians of the fighting classes on a footing oil equality with other subjects of His Majesty, in the spirit and letter of the Queen&apos;s Proclamation of 1858. The ideal which we have placed before us is the evolution of an Imperial Army which will include all the military elements of the Empire in one great comradeship of arms. The elements must be moulded together on the basis of mutual regard for each others traditions, customs and prejudices. Some may regard these proposals as conceding too much, others as not going far enough. The Commander-in-Chief is of opinion, however, that they mark the extreme limit to which we can. with safety proceed.   In this opinion we entirely concur.

&amp;281,   Your despatch Noe 57 dated 3rd August,     With a view to expediting consideration of these matters and obviating long correspondence with ths War Office, we have arranged that despatch should be considered by Conferences between Heads of War Office and ourselves.    A preliminary Conference was held this wealth     It was found that the War Office was strongly opposed to any consideration of proposals to grant Xing&apos;s Commissions in any but the Indian Army alone.   I see no prospect of obtaining at this stage any solution of the question unless we accept this objection of the War Office, for alto? all the real demand in India is to be allowed to fond and fight for their^Bountry, and with their fellow-country-men for the Empire to vhieh they belong.       The subsequent discussion after the provisional admission of this limitation was satisfactory.     Ths 17ar Office were prepared to accept your recommendations as to promotion from the Banks.As regards the rest of your proposals, there was much discussion about Dehra Dun, for it was held by the War Office, and I think it must be admitted, that a boy would have s much better chance at Sandhurst if ha had been at an English PublicSchool, and that the small size of Dehra Dun in itself would always preclude it from being a substitute for a ptiblie school.It was pointed out by us that a boy who went to Dehra Dun would have bees t  school before, that a public school was not essential for as English boy going to Sandhurst and that to. limit the avenue to the public school was politically quite impossible.   It wss provisionally agreed before adjourning that it was essential in order to give an Indian Officer a good chance of getting on with his British fellow officers that they should be trained together, and that therefore whatever avenues into the Indian Army were open to a British officer should also be open to an Indian Officer,    This would imply-that Sandhurst after preferably a Public School or Dehra Dun would be the general rule, but it was agreed that if it were deemed advisable and possible on other grounds to keep Wellington or Quoits in existence after the war for the training of English officers, or if the regulations for University candidates remained, they should be applicable also to Indians *   I send you this account of this preliminary conference In case you may have any remarks to make.17,124*    Your telegraa So. 228?,   As regards War Office opposition to granting King5 b Commission to Indians except is the Xndiaa Artsy, v?e consider that this limitation would b$ regarded ae imposing a colour bar, would be much resented, and would be as impolitic as it is we bsliovo unnecessary.   Ss^a in ths case of the B*A.H.C. we understand that no such limitation exists at present, though the Army Council exercises the right to refuse any application without assigning a reason.    The exercise of this right gives the tfar Office ample discretionary authority, and in view of the
* S mserious political objections to emphasising racial distinctions,deprecate any formal exclusion of Indians from dommissicnes ranks of the British Service.   Such exclusion would be contsary to the trend of military policy which, aias at assimilation of the Forces of the Empire rather than to the maintenance Of local differences.   We must also point tut that the grant of King5 a Commission to Indians will place the latter in precisely the same position in regard to rank and file and their juniors in rank in the British Service as if they were serving in a British unit.2.   w$ agree that, from purely military point of view, it vould b* preferable that all Indian candidates for Sandhurst should be educated at an English school.   Our suggestion in regard to Dehra pun was put forward to meet political, domestic and social objections, referred to in your telegram 646, dated 29th March, 191?.   We agree that Dahra &quot;dim will not be a sub-stitute for a public school.   All we claim for it is that, pending the development of secondary ?s due at ion in Inlia on public, school lines, Dun will serve ths same purpose as the Axky .$lass of an English school and provide ths means of accustoming Indian youths,, whose parents object to their being sent to England at an early age, to Buropean.habits and id$a$.3*   A.s regards University candidates for commissions, it will be seen from paragraphs 27 and 33.of our despatch Ko. 5?. of 191?, that Indians are,not debarred provided that they come from approved universities, and that this nomination and selection have been approved by Viceroy, as in the case of Sandhurat candidates/828.. Conference held uitta &quot;far office on 14th March- subject King-s commis.si.bns for Indians.  &quot;Lord Islington, Sir T* Koldernee and Sir H* Cox represented this&apos;Offics.   following conclusions provisionally arrived ati(1)   General Staff ask us to agree to be bound by governing condition for permanent, commission which holds good in case *f British Army during the war, namely competitive examination between certain&apos; ages through &quot;Sandhurst, or by nomination after service in the ranks, or in an Officers Training Corps, and through Sandhurst,   We agreed generally to these conditions for Indian candidates during the war, it being understood that the ten Indian eandidates per annum do not enter the open competitive examination but are nominated either by the: War office nomination beard or similar board in Indiar   Ws think tse should confine ourselves to candiA&amp;ns who have seen service in the field,   War Office intimated there will be no difficulty in arranging for accommodation of ten Indian candidates per annum at Sandhurst provided due notice is given,(2)   Question-whether Indians are to have commissions in both British and Indian Armies or only in the latter.   Agreed that while no official pronouncement on the subject was to be mads Cadets of Indian nationality and any ether Indians who may bs giren King*s commissions should always be posted in practice by War Office to Indian Amy.----------r-^-
(3)    question put &quot;by India Office as to whether War Office insist on Sandhurst as sine qua non for a British commission after the war.   War office intimated that so long as whole matter is in its present experimental stage conditions must remain as they are and Sandhurst or the corresponding Cadet Training Schools at Quetta and Wellington, so Ion.? as these are maintained, he regarded as sine qua non.But War Office recognise that eventually it may he desira-ble to establish a military training school in India under canditionr? ensuring free interchange with Sandhurst of students and staff but are not in favour of present scheme for preparatory college at Dehra Dun for reasons given in my telegram 2287 dated 19th October, 1917.    It is thought improvement of Chiefs Colleges and other special schools might be mere hopeful solution.(4)   The War Office are not opposed in principle to commissions through the ranks videjpara.&apos; 35 of your despatch No. 57 dated 3rd August,  1917,(5)   proposed grant of honorary commissions, para. 39 of same document.

From Viceroy, Army Department., 22nd April J9IS.5176. Your telegram of the 5th instant, 828. Commissions for Indians. Wecoucur generally in conclusions arrived at, but in order to give recruiting the stimulus required to meet the demands created by the present&quot;situation, it is essential that we should have authority to make at- once a comprehensive statement, detailing various ways in which King&apos;s commissions may be obtained by Indians.2. We consider that during the war there should bo three avenues to British commissioned rank, viz. :  (a) Permanent Commissions. These to a minimum number of 10 yearly would be obtained through Sandhurst as indicated in paragraph 1 of your telegram. We consider it essential, however, that selected Indian officers who have specially distinguished themselves in the war should be commissioned as second lieutenants at once up to a maximum of 20. Apart from the desirability of rewarding their services in this manner, it would strengthen our hands, should a critical situation arise, if we could show that British commissioned rank was being conferred on Indians with reasonable liberality. Moreover, if commissions are to be granted through Sandhurst, immediate grant, of a certain number of commissions from the ranks will be essential to contentment of the army for reasons given in paragraphs 35 and 36 of our Despatch No. 57, dated 3rd August 1917.(/&apos;) Temporary Commissions. These would be granted during the&quot; war up to a maximum number of 200. Conditions of appointment would be same, generally, as those prescribed for British candidates for temporary commissions in Indian Army.(c) Honorary Commissions. -These would be given to Risaldars and Subadars on Active List who have rendered distinguished service during the war. They would be awarded at the rate approximately of one per infantry battalion and to other arms in proportion.Category (a), besides satisfying, immediate requirements, would provide for future by assuring a supply of carefully selected and wrell educated Indian candidates for permanent commissions. Category (b) would meet the abnormal demands arising from the present and prospective expansion of Indian Army and satisfy aspirations of soldiers too old to go to Sandhurst and of civilians who desire to limit their service to the period of the war.Category (c) would enable us to reward and make the best use of the selected Risaldars and Subadars whose distinguished services justify their special advancement, but who, through age or lack of education, are not likely to be fit for permanent King&apos;s commissions.3. Conditions of entry for categories (a) and (c) call for no remarks as they have already been discussed. Candidates for category (b) would be drawn partly from civil life and partly from Army. They would be nominated by Local Governments and by General Officers Coramanding-in-India and overseas. From these nominations Commander-in-Chief would select names and submit them to Viceroy. Approved candidates would then be given temporary commissions subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval. Age limit would be 30, except in special cases. In selection of civilian candi-dates, preference would fie shown to those whose families have shown zeal in recruiting. In selection of military candidates, preference would be shown to those who have special qualifications as leaders and instructors.A fair standard of education and some knowledge of English would bo demanded, and all nominees would undergo preliminary instruction at an officers&apos; training school. While under such instruction they would be graded and paid as cadets. This would enable candidates to be tested before they were commissioned, thereby avoiding necessity of subsequently cancelling commissions should thev be found unsuitable.
Daring the war these temporary officers would be entitled to the pay, promotion, and other advantages under same rules as officers of the Indian Army. On the termination of the war, they would if considered in every way suitable, be eligible for permanent commissions, their seniority being determined by their original temporary rank, Those considered unsuitable for retention would be discharged on a suitable pension or gratuity &quot;with permission to retain their rank and uniform.4. The gazetting of nine Indians to King&apos;s commissions last year excited lively anticipations which have not materialised owing to protracted con-sideration of the proposals put forward in our Despatch No. 57 of 3rd August 1917. It will be difficult for us to provide for expansion of Army to extent contemplated unless a liberal policy is adopted in respect of grant of corn-missions. If full advantage is to be derived from enthusiasm aroused by Prime Minister s message, it is essential that discussion should be promptly translated into, action. We therefore ask for telegraphic sanction to these proposals, and that we may be permitted to settle details without further reference.In view of Conference assembling at Delhi1 on the 27th to discuss fndia&apos;s further help in war, it is of highest importance that we receive your answer to this telegram with as little delay as possible, as decision reached will have vital bearing on the discussions at Conference.1 Extract from private telegram from Viceroy, dated 18/7/ April 1918.Conference representative of all India is being convened at Delhi to be opened by Yieeroj-on 27th April. Object of meeting is to invite co-operation of all classes, (1) in sinking domestic discussions and bringing about cessation of political propaganda during ibis great crisis, (2) in securing active support of all classes in measures necessary for prosecution of war with special reference to man-power and development of Indians resources, and (3) in cheerfully bearing sacrifices which may be necessary to achieve victory.
