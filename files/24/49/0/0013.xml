Confidential.Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office.22nd April, 1918.AUSTRIA/003.MemorandumCZERNIH   AMD   THE   CHSCIIS.onOn December 20, 1916, Count Clam-Martinic was appointed , Austrian Prime Minister.     Two days J^ater followed the appointment of Count C&amp;ernin to the Foreign Office. &apos; Rumours spread in Western Europe of a &quot;new orientation&quot; in Austria, the two new ministers being described as &quot;Czech aristocrats&quot;.     They are both indeed Bohemian feudal lords, but by no means Czechs,     They belong to that peculiar class, the Bohemian landed nobility, whose nationality is territorial and not linguistic    As a clast these men feel to some extent with the Czechs, because they imagine themselves to be the rightful owners of the land which thatnationality &quot;happens to inhabit&quot;, but first and foremost they arethe pillars of the Austrian State edifice and servants of the Austrian Empire,     All that the Czechs have to hope for from them is that under their regime they would be oppressed and persecuted only in so far as would be found necessary for the good and strength of the Habsburg State, but not to the extent which the Pan^German3 or Magyars vsould desire.     To put it in Austrian terminology, war would be made on their Bohemian &quot;Staatsidee&quot;, but not directly or deliberately on their Czech &quot;Volkstum&quot; (national species); speeches would be delivered against the &quot;wretched, miserable Masaryks&quot; and praise would be bestowed on the non-existent &quot;treue Stihne des braven bohmischen Volkes&quot; (&quot;faithful sons of the good Czech people&quot;) who are alleged to be &quot;fighting enthusiastically wlhhin the ranks of&apos;the Austrian army&quot;.
About the middle of the 19th   century the Czech feudal aristo-cracy frequently championed the Bohemian &quot;Staatsidee&quot;, to which they attached however a meaning very different from the one which it is given by the real leaders of the Czech people.     It was with them a kind oi feudal tradition; they would have preferred to be regull at Prague to bein/; courtiers at Vienna.     They disliked and despised the low-born centralist bureaucracy and pleaded in favour of Bohemian provincial self-government in the spirit in which, the Fronde of the French nobility championed the rights of provincial assemblies against the centralising bureaucracy of a Richelieu and Louis XIV.     But their idea of the Bohemian Provincial Assembly differed from the Constituent Assembly now demanded by the Czech nation as much as those old French provincial assemblies did :from the National Convention of 1795.     The growth of social radicalism which during the last half century has become dominant among the Czechs, has clone much to estrange the Bohemian, aristocracy from the Czech national movement.     The history of the relations between them has best been summed up by Prince Alfred Windisch-G-raetz in an article published in December 1916: &quot;The party of the Conservative big landowners in Bohemia has for a long time remained in close touch with the representatives of the Bohemian people whereverthey considered these demands justified.......*. Also after allsympathy for the big landowners had disappeared from among the democratically elected deputies, the party of the Conservative big landowners persisted in its desire to champion that which it considered just and fair........&quot;     Bat in view of the attitudeadopted by the Czechs during the present war some members of the chief committee of the party on December 12, 1910 moved a resolution condemning the Czech national movement and:, finding themselves in a minority within their own party, left the committee.     It can be gathered by looking at their names how little in reality these men had in common with the Czechs and with Slavdom - Count H. Clam-Martinic, Count N. Des-Fours, Count A.

oAbout the middle of the 19th   century the Czech feudal aristo-oracy frequently championed th.e Bohemian &quot;Btaatsidee^, to which they attached however a meaning very different from the one which it is given by the real leaders of the Czech people.

Mensdorff-Pouilly, Count
J. Nostitz, Baron 0. Parish and Prince A. Windisch-Graetz.Thus Count H. Clam-Martinic had qualified for office by breaking openly with the Czech national movement      Count Czernin never needed to do so, because he for one had never ta:.-::en any part even in that most moderate advocacy of Czech claims for which his fellow nobles claim to have stood      &quot;In home politics Czernin has a loir, time ao risen to that conception which is to re-juvenate the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, strengthen its position as a Great Power and add new force to its old glory,&quot; wrote the Vienna &quot;Iieue Freie Presse;! on December 23, .1916.     The sexse was said on that clay by the Vienna correspondent of the &quot;Kc-lnische Zeitun/V&apos; though in clearer and less flowery language: &quot;Czernin is a Bohemian feudal lord and belongs to its German Centralist wing.fiCount Czernin&apos;s attach against the Czechs in his  speech of April 2, 1918 can therefore hardly be described as something surprisingly new or unexpected, or his resignation as a loss to the non-German nationalities of Austria-Hungary.22.4.18.
