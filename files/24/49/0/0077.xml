w d jApril 25th, 1918.2-fPolitical Intelligence Department, Foreign Office, Spain 00/2.M S M ORAOU M onSPAINNo change of importance has occurred in the political situationin Spain since the last Report issued April 3rd.     The King&apos;s re-/markable experiment of a Cabinet of &apos;all the talents&apos; - and all theex-Prime Ministers - has passed successfully through its first monthof life.     Political Spain renoses in the sensation of a great escape.It feels that on the 21st of March it was on the edge of a kind ofcoup d&apos;etat on the part of Senor La Cierva, perhaps with GeneralI Weyler, of ominous reputation, in the background:   and that this 1I must have had one or other of two results, either the successful suppression of the Spanish Constitution and the substitution of a regime of force:   or a violent rising of the revolutionary democratic element which might have led to anything except to a quiet life to which it would certainly not have led..     And as that is just what most Spaniards - especially the politicians - wish for, the King v/as enabled to force the statesmen to put aside their rivalries and even for the moment such serious differences of opinion as, for instance, those arising out of Senor Cambofs Regionalist projects; and the public is able to rejoice, to rest and be thankful, and to applaud King and statesmen alike.So all the domes-ic signs point for the moment to peace and quiet The newspapers preach harmon  and goodwill:   extreme Liberals like Unamuno praise the high character of the Prime Minister:   the Cabinet approves an Amnesty Bill and restores the Constitutional Guarantees which had been suspended at Barcelona.     The least pleasant feature in the; situation is the growing saarcity of bread, meat and other kinds of food which has led to Senor Ventosa, the new Commissioner of Supply, being called into consultation by the Cabinet, and to.,    .-.-&apos;.v,.-- ...   -    f.&apos;:-
hints at the introduction of a system of rationing.The Germans and pro-rGermans are not pleased at the new Govern-ment.     It is stronger than they like;   and they would have preferred that Maura1s Strong-will and sense of dignity should have been neutralised by a Cabinet taken from his own little party who are nearly all pro-Germans.     It is significant that his newspaper, the Ageion, with which his relations have always been a little mysterious, has abandoned its former Germanophil tone.     The&apos; present Cabinet will almost certainly be more satisfactory from an Allied point Of view than fits predecessor.     Senor Besada is almost the only man in it who is believed to be strongly pro-German, and his German proclivities are doubted in some very well-informed quarters. The Minister who matters most for us after the Prime Minister is of course the Foreign Minister;   and he is an avowed friend of ours,, Senor Dato.     Romanones, of course, and probably the Regionalist Cambo may also be counted among our decided friends:   Senor Alba is now once more working with Romanones and therefore with us&apos;.; and the others are either Moderates of no particular opinions in foreign affairs&apos;, like Marina, or weak men like the-la^e Prime Minister, the Marquis of Alhucemas, who would never resist his colleagues and cannot love the Germans who have treated him very Cbajly.-    Maura is himself the dark horse of the team but it is never to be forgotten that he was the author of the Carthagena Agreement, or that even in his disagreable Bull Ring speech last summer, he went out of his way to lay stress on his view that Spain&apos;s inter-ests, both commercial and intellectual, linked her with the Western Powers.At present there has been no very great opportunity for the Government to prove its sympathies by very definite action.     But almost directly Dato took office he replied very firmly to a German protest on the subject of the Commercial Treaties with France and
America, saying definitely that they would be carried out and the credits for Prance arranged.     And this has actually been done4 or is being done.     And the Government has given us strong assurances that effectual measures will be taken to see that the latest refugee German submarine does not escape like its predecessor.     On the other hand it is threatening to hamper exports to Great Britain by duties on exported oil, potatoes, etc     The food difficulties of Spain may perhaps provide some excuse for this:   but it is almost certainly due in part to the supposed necessity of meeting pro-German asser-tions that Spain is starved to feed the Allies.     Hapoily it admits, if necessary and desirable, of a comparatively easy retort;   Spain needs what she gets from us at least as much as we need what we get from her.     It will be interesting to watch the way in which theMaura Cabinet solves this question, as well as another matter on u-MGermanwhich we are in negotiations with them, the large number of/native troops who are allowed to remain in Fernando Po under German officers. and possibly in touch with the German submarines who are known to have appeared off the West African coast.A larger question has been making Its appearance lately, not one that is likely to lead to any definite action from any quarter at the present moment, but one that arouses a good deal of feeling both in Spain and elsewhere, the question of Morocco.     It is the most important question in Spanish Foreign politics and has been the centre of most of Spainfs diplomatic activities for a good many years.     By a succession of treaties and arrangements following upon the gradual collapse of the authority of the Sultan of Morocco, that country has now been divided into a French zone, much the largest, a Spanish zone, which consists of not much more than a long strip of coast opposite Spain, and a small international territory consisting of the town of Tangier and its immediate neighbourhood.     Spain has never been satisfied with this arrangement which in its final shape is due to the Franco-German Convention made by I.\ Caillaux with
Germany in 1911 and the subsequent treaty of 1912 between France find Spain.     By the first of these Germany acknowledged the protec-torate of France over the whole of Morocco.     By the second a Spanish zone was created in which Spain has the same powers as France in the rest of Morocco,.     The international district of Tangier re-mained as created by the Algeciras Conference but the statute for its government had not been aoproved by Spain when the war broke out and the matter has since stood over.This situation obviously offered material which has not been neglected for German intrigue.     The Spaniards have not succeeded in establishing $rder in their zone and the Germans have taken every advantage of its condition to intrigue among the natives, urge them to start a &apos;holy war&apos;, massacre the French and &quot;set free&apos; Morocco. , Agitation of this sort has been going on all through the war but as the Germans have never been able to fulfil their promises as to landing troops or arms its success has been dubious except in increasing disorder.But Germany has now begun to use the whole Moroccan question as a move in the diplomatic offensive with which she accompanies her military offensive in France.     An interview is given by Count Andrassy to a Spanish correspondent, an elaborate article appears in the Ctlogne Gazette and many wireless communications are sent to Spain, all with the object of convincing Spain that Germany is her friend, that she sees the injustice of England retaining Gibraltar and France casting envious eyes on Tangier and hopes to see Spain play an important part at the international peace con-ference (if one takes place, which is described as uuoertaifl) in which Germany, asserting the principles of the &quot;freedom of the Seas&apos;, will&quot;find a means of excluding the abuse of sovereignty over Straits, especially in the Mediterranean&quot;,     This has all, of course, been echoed in the pro-German papers of Spain:    and Maura&apos;s allusion to Gibraltar in his Bull Ring speech last spmmer inevitably
makes the discussion rather more real than it otherwise would he.There is no doubt that there is a strong sentimental Seeling about Gibraltar in Spairf as is natural enough.     About Morocco the country is much more divided.     The governing classes cling to a footing there very strongly as a matter of Spanish dignity:    they have the great Spanish past in^their minds and do not like accepting the confession that Spain has ceased to have any remnant of an Erjipire.     The mass of the oeoele on the other hand, and especially the.parties of the Left, are indifferent on the subject or even hostile to the Moroccan adventure as having cost the lives of so mrny of their sons and brothers to very little apparent advantage. Only a few days ago a Socialist, speaking in the Cortes about Morocco said &quot;let us get out before we are driven out&quot;;    and last year a General was dismissed for advocating the abandonment of Spanish Morocco in a public speech.     Certainly the Reformists and Republicans would gladly give the Sconish zone to England in ex-change for Gibraltar.    They are much less inclined to make it over to France, which country, Spaniards feel, has behaved rather un-gencrously to Spain in the whole of the North African negotiations.The German incursion into this question has been somewhat helped by the propaganda of Mr. Harris, the Times correspondent at Tangier^ in favour of the Spanish zone being surrendered to France and by his attacks on Spanish administration.     His arguments have not unnaturally been quoted and echoed in Frrnce: and recently an article of this kind in M.demenceau!s own paper 1,&apos;Homrne Libre has been the subject of complaint on the part of the Spanish Government.But in spite of everything the whole campaign is said to have fallen rather flat.     The&apos; bulk of the Spanish public showed little interest in the German premises:   and Spaniards who think seriously about politics oould not fail to be impressed by the easterly answer to the German arguments given by Count Roraanones&apos; paper the piario which insisted that Spain must take a Latin not a German point of
tview in European polities * frankly pointed out the difference be-jjrwoen the English control of the seas, and the probably !harsh and inflexible&apos; character German moral supremacy would take in accordance with the national character and German behaviour in Alsace, Poland and elsewhere.     It further reminded Spaniards and Germans that in the past Germany, far from protecting Spanish interests in H. Africa, was the first to give France, by the Convention of 1911, the position, which the Algeciras Treaty had not given her, of the sole protecting Power for the whole of Morocco, a position only modified the next year by the action of France herself without any pressure fromAGermany who had paid no attention to Spanish protests:   and indeed had bound herself not to do so by the Convention.Perhaps this crushing reply may have made the Germans wish they had not spoken.      In any case the discussion seems to have died out. But the question is sure to come up again:    for it is one that cannot be left as it is for ever,P.S.    Since this was written we have heard that the Spanish Government has withdrawn the export duty on potatoes mentioned above,  though not that on oil:    and in the other matter about which we were anxious has promised to bring the German officers from Fernando Po to Spain and send the natives to the mainland.     These signs of good-will seem, so far c^s they go, to confirm the im-pression that the Maura Cabinet will be as friendly as it can.
