(1). .&apos;7&apos;-Z.: ;;;;;;; : *.;;,/-.,...:y ^ 24th April, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 23rd AprilThe Weather.1  r-----     11  -   1 - - 1  mi   1    1111Extremely unfavourable weather has been experienced throughout the country during the past week;   heavy rains, a low temperature, and in some cases considerable snow storms, being prevalent.    Floods are out in most counties, and, unless warmer and drier weather soon sets in, it seems inevitable that this year!s crops must suffer serious damage.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Cheshire.   Some months ago Halton Park, which is 90 acres in extent, was inspected and the turf found to be practically all dead, and, therefore, useless for grazing purposes.     Seventy acres have since been ploughed and cultivated for potatoes., The work is being carried out,on behalf of the Executive Committee, and there is every prospect of an excellent crop of potatoes being lifted next October.Thirty-seven acres of pasture land at Moore, occupied by a lady were surveyed in June last, and 8 acres scheduled to be ploughed.     On being served with an Order to this effect the occupier, who possessed no implements for arable cultivation, decided to hand over voluntarily the whole of her land to a neighbouring farmer to put under a corn crop.     The whole 37 acres have since been ploughed and sown with oats under the most
promising conditions.     This lady has also, on her own initiative, planted the whole of her grass lawns with potatoes. Lancashire.   The golf clubs in the neighbourhood of Manchester have agreed with the Executive Committee (1) to lime and manure at least a quarter of eaoh course, (2) to reduce the area of mown fairways, and (5) to stock the land thoroughly with sheep. The Committee consider that this measure will tend to increase the food supply far more than the ploughing up of small portions of each course.Oxfordshire.     The Committee have taken   possession of, ploughed, and are now sowing with wheat 20 acres of land at Handborough, owned and occupied by the Duke of Maryborough, who was served with an order to cultivate this land, but declined to do so.Sussex East.    The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 75 acres of derelict land and poor seeds forming part of a farm near Ha11sham.   The land will be ploughed for summer fallowing by a gang of prisoners of war already in the district.Carnarvonshire. The following is an extract from a reportmade by the Cultivation Officer for South Carnarvonshire:-&quot;Hot sinoe the repeal of the Corn Laws has the cultivation of land been so general, and certainly not within the memory of anyone living&quot;. Drainage of Land.     The Cheshire Committee have, by the employment of prisoners of war, cleaned out 8l&quot;miles of the River Birkett and its tributaries the Fender and the Arrowe in the Wirrall Peninsula, and 6 miles of main drains and qditches forming part of the same system.     Short lengths of the three rivers still remain to be cleared.    Many of the
fields in this district require under-draining which was impracticable while the main channels were uncleared. This scheme, when completed, will free 1,500 acres from water-logging.Damage by.Game.   Reports of systematic action taken with regard to rookeries continue to be received.    The Devon, Gloucestershire, West Sussex and Birmingham Committees have reported action of this kind during the present week. Prosecutions.      A farmer at Lackford In West Suffolk has been fined  50 and 10 guineas costs for failure to cultivate 40 acres of derelict land.     The defendant, who farms, 1,200 acres, said in his defence that the land was unproductive and that he was short of labour,    A farmer has been fined  50 in Carmarthenshire for a similar offence. Determination of Tenancies.       During the week 9 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming In respect of 273 acres, and 11 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 7S5 acres,HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Horticultural Organisation.     Reports have been received from 15 Agricultural Executive Committees during the week stating that Horticultural Sub-Committees have been, or are being, formed.     The present position with regard to the constitution of Horticultural Sub-Committees is therefore, as follows(a)- Counties where the formation of a Horticultural Sub-Committee is complete..........37
(b) Counties in which a Horticultural Sub*Committeeis in course of formation ....... 13(c) Counties from which no reporthas yet been received.......... 11Provision,of Land, for Allotments.      Reports received from 1,149 districts show that 296,474 applications have been made for plots under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, (No. 2) and that 269,097 plots, containing 19,515 acres have been provided.During the week 10 Local Authorities have agreed to take steps to acquire, in addition to the area mentioned above 135 acres (2,099 allotments) including 100 acres at Sheffield.The Military Authorities are in possession of the Ranelagh Polo Ground at Barnes, and the Commanding Officer has agreed to have approximately 6 acres dug up at once and planted with potatoes.Messrs. Karrods have also agreed to provide 12 allotments of 10 poles each on their football ground at B&amp;rnes.Y.M.C.A. Allotments. Good progress has been made with the schemes for cultivating land adjacent to the Y.M.C.A.Camps, and so far about 50 acres have been brought under cultivation.Pot a, toe.s * A special campaign has been inaugurated with a view to increaing the area under potatoes. The Agricultural
19k1 IrJ OExecutive Committees are lending every assistance, and appeals are being made to farmers and allotment holders to increase their acreage of potatoes.Fruit Section.   Since January 1st orders have been received for 108 Home Canners and 485 gross of cans.The total number of orders for glass jars received from retailers by the Glassware Supply Department of the Ministry of Munitions now amounts to 5,403,852,Sixteen demonstrations in fruit bottling and canning have been given during the week.Market Empties.    An improvement in the situation with regard to the conveyance of empty baskets is evident from the fact that the Great Eastern Railway have recently accepted 18,260 baskets from Holland for one London firm.    Empties to the Channel Islands are being accepted at the rate of 20 trucks per week (an increase of 15 trucks per week). Supply of Osiers and Willows for Basket Making.     Reports show that the greater part of the osier crop has been cut in the Trent Valley and Cambridge areas owing to the abundance of woman labour and the provision of soldier labour for the purpose, The unusually fine season helped to advance the cutting in the Somerset area, but labour has been scarce.Osiers have been in great demand and prices have advanced;   green crops have made up to  16, and brown from  5 to  15 per ton.    White crops have been scarce and made up to  80 per ton and buff to  90 per ton.TECHNICAL DIVISION.Swattisfield Hall Farm, Thornham, East Suffolk, has been inspected in connection with a proposal for its reclamation submitted by the Exeoutive Committee,     The greater part of the land scheduled is barren, scrub-covered waste, which for the past 30 or 40 years has been used as a game preserve.    The land,
as a whole, is wet, and needs draining.     As regards most of the area, the chances of a crop at all commensurate with the Aexpenditure involved in clearing the land, cultivating, summer fallowing, fencing, draining, etc., would be extremely remote. It is suggested, thereforethat the Committee would not be justified in proceeding with en extensive scheme of reclamation so long as better land is available for breaking, and the supplies of men and machinery can be employed to advantage on existing arable land.Trial of Plough.     A demonstration has been held of a one-furrow Oliver Sulky riding plough, recently introduced into this country. The plough did extremely good work in cross-ploughing light land.. It is light in draught, and easy to handle, and could be manipulated by women, old or disabled men, or boys.     Further tests on different classes of land are desirable.Seed Testing Station.     The total cash receipts during the season amount to  746, of which about  80 is still held on deposit.     The number of samples received up to date is 7,211, of which reports have been issued in respect of 7,016.LABOUR DIVISION.The proclamation withdrawing the Agricultural vouchers issued by Agricultural Executive Committees to whole-time farm workers who are between 18 and 23 and in Grade I or in Category &quot;A&quot; creates a serious situation which has been explained to the Cabinet and need not be dealt with further here.The Department are receiving numerous enquiries from Executive Committees and farmers as to the steps they should take to secure a right to appeal, and what provision, If any, has been made for substitutes for any men who may be called to the Colours.   In-structions are being prepared for issue to all Agricultural Executive Committees stating the steps to be taken so that appeal^ may be made in the case of a &quot;highly skilled agricultural worker whole-time employed on a farm in farm work, irreplacable and essential to the cultivation of the farm.&quot;
Salaler Labour,   The total number of soldiers M/t&amp;chei to depots by the Military Auth*rtttes fcr the 1913 programme is now 42,220 (31,823 skilled and 10,3*7 unskilled).   Of these, 39,623 (30,63* skilled and 8,887 unskilled) are tut en farms.Ineluded in the above figures are 3,t33 soldiers sent out tw training as tractor drivers, including 134 men sent out during the week.Hersea;    Instructions for the issue of 737 nerses were given during the week, making a total of 7,938 horses supplied tc Agricultural Executive Committees to date.   The Department have alss 1,178 horses on loan from the Military Authorities.Prisoners of War.    An additional 3,000 prisoners of war were votedto the Department at the meeting of the Prisoners of War EmploymentCommittee held on the 19th instant,    This allocation enables theDepartment to proceed with, and forward to the War Offlee, a furthernumber of schemes that have been prepared for the employment ofGerman prisoners on agricultural work.   The proposed schemes willbring the total number of schemes for the establishment of prisonerof war oamps now with the Wail Offioe up to 139, providing for theemployment of 7,600 additional prisoners already voted foragricultural wortt.   It is important that these men should beavailable at an early date, in view of the large number oi men it isproposed to reoruit from agriculture during the next few weeks.   Thedelay experienced in opening the camps is solely due to tke difficultyexperienced by the Military Authorities in adapting the premisessuggested and arranging for the provision of guards.The nvtnber of additional prisoner oamps opened during ^heweek was 6, (four prisoner ploughmen camps and two ordinaryagricultural oamps). making the total number of prisoners nowemployed on farm work as followst-Prom 58 ordinary agricultural oamps............6,152n   108 Prisoner ploughmen oamps............... 3,950Employed from other oamps......................1,00810,110Released aliens employed In agriculture ......* * -*?9?11,916A report received from the Kesteven Division of Lincoln states:- HThe German prisoners of war who have recently arrived at the Agricultural Camp at Morton, Kesteven, are men of good
physique.   One of them is a farmer who has French and Russian %prisoners of war working on his o:?n land in Germany&quot;.WO^EI^S SRABOfl.Recruiting has continued during the week on similar lines to those already reported, culminating in the procession and demonstration held in London on Saturday.   The ground to be covered by the procession was thoroughly worked beforehand, and the crowds which greeted the procession as it marched through Regent Street and Oxford Street justified this preparation.   In spite of the unfavourable weather large crowds watched the progress of the procession, and listened to the speeches made in Kyde Park.     It is too early to give many definite results.     150 women signed the enrolment form during the meeting, and over 5,000 copies of the &quot;Landswoman&quot; were sold.Other activities in London during the week have included a large number of recruiting speeches at munition factories ffcom which women are being discharged, and at theatres and picture palaces. Leaflets have been distributed at restaurants and railway stations. In spite of the bad weather, 410 -enrolment forms were received at the offices of the Middlesex and London Selection Committees.   395 women were interviewed, and 307 finally selected.   This is the highest percentage of selections yet obtained.The demand for skilled women workers is still greater than the available supply, but the number of applications for gangs for seasonal workers has decreased.   This is probably due to the bad weather and to the uncertainty prevailing in regard to the retention of soldier labour.   Meanwhile plans are being completed for dealing quickly with the demands as they may arise.Excellent reports have been received of the work done by women tractor drivers in Flintshire.   Two women driving a Titan tractor ploughed 23 acres, thus breaking the ploughing record for the county of 21 acres per week.It has been reported from Holland (Lincoln) that two of the tractors have been worked entirely by woman labour supplied by the ^ Department, and that the farmers have expressed great satisfaction with the efficient manner in which the work has been done.
piling&apos;the past week the opening of 35 training centres a practice farms has been sanctioned, thus providing further training for 164 women.     Boundary House, Ightham, Kent, has been lent for the duration of the war by Miss Brook, and Lady Wernher has put one of her houses at the disposal of the Bedfordshire Committee. Women1s Institutes.      Increased interest is being taken by Women1s Institutes in food preservation, several having invested in home canners.     Twenty-two new Institutes have been formed during this week.CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors owned by the Department:-Consigned to County Committees and Tractor Schools up to and including 16th April.......   3,237 -Consigning Instructions given during the -week................................. 226Less tractors withdrawn............92 134On offer to counties.&apos;..,......................      100Consigned to Scotland.................13211 Ireland................... 146 278.., .. 3,749The following types of machinery and implements foruse with tractors have been issued to the counties:-Cultivators 9/11 tine..............   1,190660 196Trailer Boxes.............H &quot;     Stones patent&quot; Disc pattern...

SUPPLIES DIVISION. \Fertilisers,   The Government has now decided that the prices cf sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate during the coming season     J shall be kept at the same level as at present.     In the case of basic slag a small addition to the current price has been made in order to cover the increased costs of manufacture.     All slag will be sold at a delivered price as in the case of the other two fertilisers.     Purchasers of these three fertilisers will, as from the beginning of June, be able to obtain supplies at uniform price regardless of their distance from producers&apos; works.In order to economise railway transport and to&apos; ensure an equitable distribution of supplies, a provision has been inserted in the Order prohibiting sales by makers for delivery by rail or water except by licence.     An increase of staff will be necessary to operate this lioensing system, but it is hoped thereby to save railway transport during the next season to the extent of several millions of ton-miles.    No licences will be required by merchants, co-operative societies, or other purchasers.Approved Agents for distribution of fertilisers will be appointed on an extended scale for the coming season, and it is hoped that substantially increased quantities of fertilisers will be stored locally.     This will minimise the congestion In the railway traffic at the seasons of the year when the fertilisers are actually required. - - Special care will be taken to see that Approved Agents undertake in every way to meet the needs of allotment holders and small growers in their districts.The Compound Fertilisers Order is also undergoing, revision and it is proposed to bring under the terms of this Order all compound fertilisers, including those which were specially excepted last year under the definition &quot;Horticultural Fertiliser&quot;, in order to prevent undue dislocation of an established trade.     This exception has enabled a trade to be maintained in inferior (Ifertilisers which are retailed at excessive prices. Stable Manure. Deliveries from&quot; the Eelmoor Dump near Aldershot
continue to be made by barge -to- various, jslaoes ^on- the Basingstoke Canal, )   both in Surrey and Hampshire, and there is every prospect of this work being continued steadily throughout the summer.     There is evidence also that the recent Instruction issued at the request of this Department by the Army Council as to delivery from remount depots, is having ai-beneficial effect.     The attention of allotment holders has been drawn to this, source of supply.Seed Oats. Orders for the Department1s seed oats are coming in slowly. The Department still have large stocks of Irish Black Tartarian and some White &quot;Scottish.     The Manx oats lying at Grimsby (2,500 quarters), originally intended for Prance, have been disposed of to the Landed Grain Committee at Hull through the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies. Seed Maize. The demand for this continues to be fairly brisk, but there have been serious delays In dispatch from Liverpool, and the Railway Executive Committee have been approached in the matter.     At Portishead 1,000 quarters are available and are being offered to buyers in the &quot;western counties.Seed Potato Supply. The last cargo from Ireland has arrived at Cardiff and consists of 1,500 tons.     Deliveries of seed potatoes now amount to about 23,000 tons, and all orders received up to date have been placed. Wart Diseasec Applications for licences to plant potatoes in land scheduled for Wart Disease are still being received in considerable numbers.     Last week, 1,556 were received.     In many instances growers *   desire to plant potatoes supplied by neighbours or others who are not* &apos;   on the list of approved dealers, and in these cases enquiry is made by the Inspectors Into the stocks of the intended supplier before the potatoes are passed for planting.The lectures on Potatoes and Wart Disease, which are being given by Inspectors to Allotment Associations, will be useful in securing the support of such Associations in connection with the % application of the new Wart Disease Order to various districts where the disease is prevalent.
%%Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P. President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.Potato Spraying.   Over 1,175 lectures have been given to date.A meeting for school children in the Town Hall, Dover, was attended by over 500 boys, who displayed a most intelligent interest in the lecture.The sales of sulphate of copper up to the end of March amounted to 7,250 tons, of which about 4,600 tons had been delivered. These quantities compare favourably with sales in the same period last year. It is very necessary that buyers should place orders without delay, so as to ensure obtaining supplies in time.   The attention of Executive Committees is being drawn to this question with a view to their urging merchants to make early provision for the potato spraying season.Seed Control. Special efforts are now being made to compile a list of the names of indispensable men employed in the Seed Trade, as required under the arrangement recently made with the Ministry of National Service regarding the exemption from Military Service of Seed Experts. This list is to be completed by the end of May, and necessitates a visit by an Inspector to every Seed Firm in the country.Reports received from Inspectors during the past week indicate that in some parts of Wales the requirements of the Testing of Seeds Order are not being carried out in a satisfactory manner. The dealers at fault have been asked for an explanation and they will be visited at an early date. . . tI am, aSir,Your obedient Servant,
