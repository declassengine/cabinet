[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.] CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,[April 18, 1918.] ( foreign office.If &apos; Norway /001.;      ... . -:, MEMORANDUM&apos;%/r\ t \* % ON.    ! ./(5/ -   \ .  NORWEGIAN BOLSHEVISM.THE&apos;&apos;victory of the Extremists in the Socialist party marks a further stage in the progress of Bolshevism in Norway.Its first appearance in definite shape was at a Workmen&apos;s Council meeting in Stavanger at the beginning of this year. At about the same time Soldiers&apos; Councils were set up at Trondhjem and legal proceedings were taken against certain Socialists because of this action and revolutionary agitation generally.At the beginning of March a demonstration of about 1 6,000 people took place in Christiania, and a resolution was passed demanding the abolition of military service. This resolution was handed to the President of the Storting in the Storting Hall, who promised that it would be given consideration, and a &quot;petition&quot; was also presented declaring that unless bread and work were provided trouble would ensue.The formation of both Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Councils proceeded steadily until, on the 25th March, a general meeting of the former met to consider the introduction of certain measures and the means of securing their execution (vide infra).The general conference of the Norwegian Socialist party, held in Christiania in the Easter holidays, resolved itself into a trial of strength between the Moderates, in whose hands the party management had been up to then, and the Extremists, who aspired to displace them.As might be expected, a resolution in favour of disarmament and obligatory arbitration was passed unanimously. Following on this, a proposal of the then minority (i.e.. the Extremists) on the executive in favour of collaboration with the Left Socialists in Sweden and association with the Zimmerwald International was passed by a majority so large that it was not considered necessary to count the votes. Finally, the party management passed from the hands of the Moderates. Kyrre Grepp, editor of the weekly &quot; Vor Tid,&quot; was chosen President; Tranmael, of Trondhjem, Secretary. Jacob Viclnes, editor in-chief of &quot; Social-Demokraten,&quot; handed in his resignation, and was succeeded by Olaf Scheflo, formerly editor of &apos;: Arbeidet&quot; in Bergen. The official party organ thus becomes Bolshevik.The majority favouring Syndicalism and Zimmerwaldian principles was 158 against 126.In order to understand the exact aims and objectives of the new leaders it is necessary to give details of the proceedings at the general meeting of the Workmen&apos;s Councils held on the 15th March above alluded to.At this general meeting it was decided not to lay down a definite programme, but to instruct the Councils to work for the introduction of certain measures for the amelioration of present economic conditions, such as -----The general census of all articles of food with a view to complete rationing and, if n e cess: \ r y, requisitio riing Increased rations for workers.Energy of the nation to be concentrated on increase of production. No production of luxury articles nor of war material.Abolition of military training and the reduction to a police force of the forces necessarv for the maintenance of neutrality.Introduction of maximum prices with their regulation controlled by members of the Workmen&apos;s Councils.Eight-hours working day and six-hour shifts working continuously with the retention of full wages.In addition to the above, various measures for the betterment of the condition of the small landowner.Certain resolutions were passed with a view to attaining these ends. It was decided 1. That unless all potatoes were confiscated by the Government and their rationing-introduced by the 6th April the Workmeirs Councils would take no responsibility if the general rationing is not respected. [367-6]
22. That unless an eight-hours working day at the full rate of present wages beintroduced by the 1st May the workmen will themselves introduce aneight-hours working clay on the 2nd Maj^.Opposition to this will be met by stoppage or strike. 3. The Conference will arrange for a general strike on political grounds, unlessmeans are found and introduced within a reasonable time to reduce thepresent high cost of living. 4. The Workmen&apos;s Councils are to establish the closest co-operation with  theSoldiers&apos; Councils, and should there be a general refusal to submit tomilitary service, or should a military strike be engineered, the WorkmeiVsCouncils pledge the soldiers their solid support.With regard to (1), it would appear that the Workmens Councils are not prepared definitely to advise the workers to refuse to abide by the present rationing arrange-ments, but with regard to (2), (3), and (4), the threat to use extra-parliamentary methods and to defy the Government is definite.The situation is undoubtedly serious, yet there appears to be no reason to anticipate that Norway is on the brink of revolution.The Moderates still remain leaders of the Trades Unions, and consequently retain considerable influence in the country. No party split has actually taken place. This is plain from the proceedings at the end of the General Party Conference, when Tranmael, in the name of the new Executive, thanked those now laying down office for the disinterested work they had carried on for so many years, and Knudsen, replying for the old Executive, while stating that no one could deny to its members the right to work for what seemed good to them within the framework of the party, called for concerted action of all forces in the furtherance of the cause of Socialism. &quot; It is only Social Democracy which can save land and nation.&quot; It would seem that there is some hope, that the party will hold together, and that the old leaven will prevent social upheaval.Most of the new men, too, belong to the intellectual school of Sjmdicalism. They are neither uneducated visionaries nor wild anarchists. Some of them, it is interesting to note, belong to families up to now traditionally Conservative. They are hardly likely to go to extremes, despite all their loud talk, if the Government shows its determination to maintain law and order at all costs. The question is whether the Government will have the courage to make a firm stand. Their past record is not encouraging, and a prominent Norwegian in this country, who believes that a determined Governmental attitude, in conjunction with a judicious use of the police and military, would suffice to ensure the maintenance of order, has expressed himself as very anxious as to the course of events in the next few weeks.The Government seems to be alive to the danger. On the one hand, rations for the workmen have been increased, and large sums have been voted for the relief of the necessitous, including 1,000,000 crowns by the Storting for the unemployed. On the other, a new law has been drafted permitting military intervention in the case of strikes, and to prevent rioting, and the General in Command has issued a proclamation to the effect that no conscripts or soldiers in uniform shall attend meetings of associations with objects inimical to the defence of the country.It is of some interest to speculate ay to whether the victory of the Extremists in the Socialist party will or will not be on the whole of advantage to the Allied cause in Norway. Up to now the policy of the Norwegian Socialists during- the. war has been pro-German in effect, though not in intention. The part)&apos; Executive has stood for disarmament and peace-at -any-price, thereby paralysing any action the Norwegian Government might have had the courage to take vis-d-vis Germany. It was pacifist to the point, that it cared not to what humiliation Norway might be subjected, provided she was not drawn into the war.The Syndicalists are likely to take up a much less passive attitude. They will, of course, be antagonistic to all &quot; bourgeois&quot; Governments, but we shall not go far wrong in assuming that at the present time, the Imperial German Government will be regarded by them as the most dangerous enemy, especially since her alliance with Finland, which brings the danger right up to the Norwegian frontier. It is not inconceivable that, as against this chief foe, the new leaders will encourage schemes of defence which the former Socialist leaders sought to cross by all means in their power.
