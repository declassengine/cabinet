//THIS  aSSBSlfcjS  SI ^HOPIOTY OF HIS BRXTA1TOC IJAJSSTx^ GOVEift^T*.lECU B T,AH     C i B I H !,RUSSXAII MISSION (Jfote by General Smuts)She War Cabinet has asked me to consider the question of % mission to Russia to discuss the whole situation with Trotski, a mission important cncnjh to place a Cabinet Minister ftt the head of it,     I summarioe some of the c onsi derations which I think ought to be borne in mind in this connection.,&apos;/e have so far hesitate 1 - for very good reasons - to recognise the Soviet Republic formally.   If a member of the British Government goes on a mission to Trotski, he might be placed in a very embarrassing position, as Trutski may at once press him to recognise the Republic and thus give the Bolsheviks an enormous advantage over the other parties.     If this is declined, the mission will be both foolish and futile. If Trotski falls in with our. proposals on condition that we recognise his Republic, are we prepared to do so?   Have we sufficient faith in Trotski and his associates to take such a far-reaching step, and would it not be advisable and even necessary to consult our Allies before embarking on a course which muet necessarily confront us with a very grave choice?I assume, however, that these difficulties ere overcome, and that an important mission goes to Trotski,     What proposals is it to lay before him?   In ray opinion it would be necessary before such a mission proceeds to Russia that we agree to definite plans of Allied action in Russia, plans which if agreed to by the Russian Government would mean action by the Allies and no longer bandying oi telegrams between Grsat Britain,the United States of America and Japan, such as have been passing for months past.   If Allied (principally Japanese) military intervention in Russia is pressed on Trotski and he agrees under certain conditions, ws ought tc be assured in advance that the proposed intervention will reallj take place, that -japan is prepared to send a large Army across Siberia to meet the Germans in Russia.      It may be assumed that Trotski will want to know that the Allied Army will be large and powerful enough really to deal with the Germans, and not merely such as to invite further defeats and dismemberment for Russia.My opinion is, therefore, that an important british mission tt Trotski at present is prematrre, and may do more harm than geod.     The correspondence now proceeding through Lockhart should continue, and if Trotski agrees to the principles of Allied intervention, we should obtain the definite and detailed adhesion of America and Japan to specific proposals for an Allied army to proceed to the Russian front.     If they agree to such proposals the time will be ripe to send a mission to Russia to press them on the Russian Government, and we should then be prepared to recognise the Soviet Republic.   A mission under those circimstances might mean a complete transformation of the military situation in 1919 and may therefore become a most important affair.     I would not spoil that prospect by apremature/
premature mission no?/ when, everything, even our own ideas, are still hazy and ujof orated.   In a month or two a definite course of action may be both clear and possible, and may have to be pressed on Russia with all the influence at our command.In the meantime the necessary pr^LuiLlnary preparations could be pushed, both diplomatically and otherwise.(Initialled) J.C.S.2* Whitehall Gardens, S.W, 24th April, 1918,
