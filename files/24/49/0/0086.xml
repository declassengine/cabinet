EMIGRATION BILL, lomorandum by tho Minister of Reconstruction^(1)     In accordance v/ith the decision of the War Cabinet on April 11th. (Minutes 369, No, 10) I submit the fallowing observations on the Emigration Bill nhich has been presented by the Colonial Office  ( A4061)(2)     I agree v/ith Mr. Long&quot;s observations that the proposal to establish a Central Emigration Authority may bo regarded as a measure of reconstruction and I sympathise with the general objects of the Mil, but in an appendix I call attention to certain points raised by my legal adviser, vrhich might well be considered by the Departments primarily concerned.-((3)     As Mnistcr of Reconstruction, however, I-have no desire to see emigration.&apos; encouraged at the expense of&quot; the Mother country, and it is therefore important that the Board should not be constituted in such a way as to render lft probable that pressure -will be exercised in the direction of emigration regardless of home requirements and possibilities.     I am bound to say that having this in mind I cannot think&quot; it desirable that the Agents-General should have seats on the Board,,     I think rather that the Board should&apos;be so constituted that the Colonial Secretary should have the advice of men who would have, as far as possible, general regard to the best openings for applicants whether at home or in the Dominions.
-* 2 -1-4)     If, as contomplated by the EmjdJ^-Bettlemeiot Committee,  (Cd,0S72 paras. IOTP - 10), information as to opportunities of settlement is to be distributed to the troops between the cessation of hostilities and the. grant of furlough previous to discharge,. it becomes of added importance that this should be done by a b-ody willing and able to give.equal prominence to opportunities in the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire,     I doubt whether the constitution of the proposed authority would tend to this result.Christopher Addison, 20th April, 1917.,
APPENDIX. IFotes on the Em ?,rat-i qn^Bill,1* All the Regulations proposed to be made (&quot;see clauses1 ft,), 2 fl) (b), 9 fl) (c), and 10 ((1) ), should be laid be fere Parliament, instead of .. only those mentioned in clause 2.2. She Authority is to &quot;advise and assist&quot; intendingemigrants (clause 2 ((1) ((h):: does this include Financial assistance?    Expenses generally aro provided for- by clauso 1 (5).3. TShe last part of clause 3 (6) is intended to get ridof the decision in Norris v, Howdenj   there is some doubt whether it does and it is suggested that the wcrds--Hnte .decL to be or is&quot; should be inserted before &quot;ultimately&quot; on page 4 line 2,4.   - The proposed powers of the Authority as to cancellation!and suspension  clause 7), and refusal to renew ((clauses 4 and 5), off brokers&quot; licenses and agents1 appointments aro very drastic.     Both are annual only and the Authority might refuse to renew either, er cancel or suspend either during its year of currency, without cause assigned or right of appeal.     Tender the existing law the licenses of brokers are grafted by local bodies, who are bound to hear and determine the application according to law.     Agents * appointments have to be countersigned, by emigration officers of the Board of Trade, which is, it is believed, mainly forml.     TIhe Bill should provide a form of judicial enquiry, with perhaps some right of appeal, before a license can be refused, cancelled or- suspended,,except in caso of .
conviction.     Similar remarks apply to clause lo CD with regard to emigration societies.5. It might &quot;be considered whether the receipt of acommission from any person or body other than the steamship company represented by the broker should not be forbidden. It is believed that emigration is enrxruraged-jji..par^culaa? directions by bonuses to agents,  (see clauses 8 (1) and S CD) Cd) ). -        .6. She policy of clause 9, which proposes to give theAuthority the power of &quot;&quot;felack-listing&quot; particular--countries is very doubtful.     The proposal in clause 9 (1) (b) might be achieved by an alteration in the form of ticket to be prescribed by the Boasd of Trade under Section 320 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, without which it would not, a? it stands, be of much use.     Clause 9  D M might be made- of.jseneral application in a modified fomn, forbidding the issue (nestmerely to an &quot;intending emigrant&quot;, which is not much use, but generally) of any literature inciting to emigration unless copies of it have previously been deposited with tho Authority.     Clause 9 (1) (d) :might also be general In connection with the suggestion In the previous paragraph.7. In clause 10 (2) it is essential to provide thatknowledge should be a necessary element of the offence, whether the onus of proof is put on the prosecution or the defence.     Otherwise no prudent person would serve on the Committee of an emigration society.
