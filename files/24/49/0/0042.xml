The proposal we made was put forward by the 0. in C* himself with full sense of responsibility and its rejection will gravely hamper our efforts.(2)   The alternative you surgest* would in no way satisfy the influential classes whose services we are seeking to enlist in recruiting large numbers.   We already have power to give temporary commissions in Indian Land forces and are doing so as a ereward for recruiting work.     Such commissions possess no novelty, and are not sufficiently attractive for present needs.(3)   If we are&apos;not empowered to give temporary    ingTs Commissions on scale recommended, we shall be compelled to press for a larger number of permanent King5 s Commissions for Indians. This will involve obvious difficulties when we reduce establish-ment at the end of the war.(4)   Your private telegram of April 23rd just received. Conference of 27th will break up into Committees at once to deal with Man-power &amp;o., and will resume as a Conference on 29th.
