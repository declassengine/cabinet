IT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS ^^^El^MMIIll^I^^^Qj.&apos;S E 0 R E T*,G.T. 4364.WAR CABINET.EEELIHG- IF ULSTER..Fote by Chief Secretary f o r^ Ire], an &amp; . coy e rin^letter from Sir .geriry Kobinson.I think it necessary to circulate to the War Cabinet without delay the appended letter from Sir Henry. Robinson, Vice President of the Irish local Cover:orient Beard,    Sir Henry&apos;s judgment has been so trustworthy in all my experience ?f him that I am much impressed by his observation that ,the &quot;public occurrences of the past few weeks have entirely altered the mind of Ulster with regard to Irish self-government.You may perhaps remember my giving you my opinion that -the opposition Ulster to Home Rule would not be intractable/ long lived, or a- serious danger.In case you do remember it I want to say that I withdraw that opinion now * as the situation, has entirely changed.-The linking up of the R.C. Hierarchy with the Sinn Pein Rebels and their joint refusal to allow the Irish Catholics to&apos; help win the war by agreeing to conscription&quot;has had such an-effect upon the Protestants of the North and of Belfast,&apos; that they seem tc have gone mad.They are beside:themselves at the idea of being placed under such a parliament&apos;,- a Popish and Rebel parliament as they call it and I truly believe that as matters stand&apos; the introduction of a Home Rule Parliament would be accompanied by serious religious riots in the North which would react pn the. Protestants cf the South, and that ship-building and munitions work in Belfast would be to a very- serious extent, shut down,Over here the consensus of opinion seeas to be to let tilings *eool down, and drop both conscription and Home Rule till after the war.(Sgd.)   H..E. DUKE.27th April, 1918.Copy of letter from the Rt-. Hon. Sir Henry Robinson, K.C .B :   &apos;      to the Chief&quot;Secretary&quot;?or Ireland.Dear Mr. Duke,Local Government Board,, Dublin.26th April,  1918.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)   H. A, ROBINSON.
