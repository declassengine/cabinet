&apos;TEJ3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIA MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).EGRET. T.4322WAR CABINET. RUSSIAN SITUATION ,(Note by General SmutsV)1 have had an interesting conversation with General Nieffel, head of  he French Military Mission just returned from Russia.   His statement may be summarised as follows?-1,     In his opinion there is no hope of the military regeneration cf Russia or the formation cf a fighting army in the immediate future, even with the assistance of * Allied officers and Instructors.   If he had seen any such prospects, he would net have left Russia.   The most that could be expected was the formation of Red Guards which might prove an embarresiment to the Germans and induce them to keep some of thoir forces In the Easto2C      Division and feeling between the Bolsheviks and ether parties Is most acute and bitter,   If we favour the one tho rest will go over wholesale to the Germans. Ee therefore advises that we should maintain an attitude of neutrality for the present and await events.   He expects developments in a few months which might make our future course cleareraZ,       No Japanese intervention should be countenanced without the consent or approval of the Bolsheviks because of the serious risk of driving the latter into the arms of the Germans.   If the Bolsheviks would agree to Japanese intervention; and the Japanese would agree to move an army/ to meet the Germans in Russia (as distinguished from Eastern Siberia), a new Russian army might be constituted in co-operation with the Japanese forces, and an entirely new situation, arise for Germany,4.      In his opinion the holding of Murmansk and Archangel against the ensmy may in the summer require larger land forces than we have hitherto contemplated,5,      Trotski he considers a consummate scoundrel who may not be pro-German, but Is thoroughly pro-Trotskl and pro-revolutionary and cannot in any way be trusted *   His influence is shown by the way he has come to dominate Lockhart; Robins, and the French representativee   He counsels&apos;great prudence In dealing with Trotski, who he admits is the only really able man in Russia,(Intd) J.C.S.2, Whitehall Gardens,   S.W.I.24th April, 1918c
