mmJLJLUS MMML J*&amp;lHjLil!&amp;g^ OF HIS. BR1TAITHIC MAJI3 C RET.1B In connection with Labour supply there is just now003210 little friction and still sbxoa wasta of skilled labour,   Munitions hav&apos;3 for a long time consistently followed a course of yielding up men, and creating a vacuum to be filled up by leooesr skilled or unskilled labour.   By that means a good many have been produced for the Amy,     X wonTt give figures beeaus3 they only confuse.   But the principle of dilution has been very considerably applied, and with good results-,2*  he Admiralty on the other hand, have dons littlein that direction.   It is true that the Admiralty work does not lend itself so freely to dilution as the muni-tions. because there is less work of a repetition char-acter,- but still more could be $one.   Of that I feed eonvinced.   The Admiralty are under obligation to pro** duce 12s500 men and have been for some considerable time.   They have produced as yet barely 1,000.3, Sir Alan Anderson and Lord Pirrie have adopted aplan of leaving employers and workman to settle their differences with regard to&quot; everything, except general advances of wages,- with the proviso only that having failed to adjust anything to their mutual satisfaction, employers and workmen may then report to a new body eat up by the Controller of Shipbuilding/call 3d the Labour Priority Branch - this Labour Priority Branch to absorb the functions, as X understand, of the Shipyard Labour Department recently presided ov.-r by Sir Lynden Maoassoy*4, This Labour Priority Branch is, X&apos;gather, to beunder the control of the Director of Materials and Priority, who has not, X surmise, had previous experience in dealing with labour problems.   It is also worthy of note that under the proposed arrangements employers and workmen are being given a status which they have net hitheri* held,- This may or may not ba a good thing; it is at any rate an innovation^5, X think thera is some little danger in this newdeparturei and I suggested a fortnight ago that there should be consultations with Labour and Munitions about it.   In principle, it seems right, and as a matter of fact, it is what we have always said employers and work-men were free to do. - But at the eama time, it was in practice safeguarded by the fact that Sir Lynden Macassey^ officers were always on the spot and ready to advise in regard to any changes even of a detailed character, that might, if carried out result in bringing
m general changes;     and I think much good has be$n done &quot;by Sir Lyndon hacassoy and his off icer$4* and probably danger averted.That employers and workmen may do things, or fail to do things, which they ought not or ought to do as tho case may be, is proved by experience.   &quot;Ihen we were engaged in adjusting wages some time ago, we learnt of detailed advances having been given to woodworkers which brought their general rate up by about 3d. or 4d, per hour, and then the Committee on Production was faced with the demand to stand-ardise that rvbe - with of course the inevitable consequence that demands were made by other bodies of workmen for like advances,   Neither employers nor workpeople law:, any great inducement now to keep wages at a steady level.Similarly, we now know through the reports of various people that dilution is not being carried outin Admiralty shops, because neither employers nor workmen want it to be carried out.     The Admiralty employ in $,A&apos;! firms, somewhere about half a million of workpeoplej and I believe there are less women workers in those workshops now than there were a few months ago, and practically no dilution has taken place.If, therefore, dilution is to proceed as in the munitions shops, obviously someone ought to be pushing it on the employers and. workmen.   The Admiralty won!t do that, and it seems to me the next best thing would be to get Munitions to do it, or to set up a new body to deal with labour supply generally.   The position for Munitions will be more difficult in the near future, &quot;because they have undertaken to foster and encourage dilution by the new scheme of mobile labour. The men concerned have to work side by side with Admiralty men, who are not being diluted.Kay X suggest that Sir Lyndon hacassey be asked to put in a report on his work, as I am sure that it would be of value to the Cabinet in. coming to a con-elusion, on tho matter?-(XITT,)    Crs xi, B.2?
