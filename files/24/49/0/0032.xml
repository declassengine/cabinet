This Document Is the Property or .H&apos;;s Brlmnnlc Government)k 0 3 A S B U Mon     the BILLfor   improving   the  $Aftj   BOARDS   ACS, 1909.From2he liinistr? of Labour 24th April 1916.
This Bill is framed with a view to improving and perfecting the machinery set up by the Trade Boards Act, 1909, for dealing with wages in badly paid trades in order that its more rapid extension to other trades may be possible when the need for it is found to exist.     The Trade boards Act was admittedly an experiment when it was first passed, and it was far from certain whether the principle of Trade Boards would prove suitable to the industrial conditions of this country.     In 7 years, however, they have established themselves as an integral and valuable part of our industrial system.     They are now established in eight industries, and their effect has been not,,only to raise con-siderably the wages of some three hundredfninety thousand of badly paid workers, but to promote b^ttereorganisation and better feeling among both employers and employed.     In other words, the Trade Board system may now be regarded as having passed out of the experimental stage, and the present Bill aims at simplifying the procedure required both for setting up new Boards and for the fixing of minimum rates of wages by the Boards, and also increasing the actual powers of the Boards themselves.     Most of the. principal changes embodied in the Bill are based on the recommenda-tions of the Sub-Qommittee of the Reconstruction Committee on the Employment of Women.     The gub-Conaittee consider that in view of the dislocation of industry that rail follow the c-lkose of the War it is particularly necessary that rapidly adjustable machinery should be available for setting up Trade Boards in industries where a large influx of women might be expected with the result that wages will be seriously depreciated unless prompt steps are taken to regulate them.     It is on this ground that the Bi^l is now submitted, and urgency claimed for it as a War measure.The principal features of the Bill may be briefly summarized.1. It gives the Minister of Labour power to set up Trade Boards by Special Orders after giving proper opportunity for objections and enquiry, instead of proceeding by means of a Provisional Order Bill. . It allows him to set up a Trade Board in any industry having regard to the rate of wages, and not only in those industries where wages can be shown to bir &quot;exceptionally low.&quot;3. It accelerates the machinery for the fixing of a compulsory minimum rate of wages, so that it will be possible to bring a new rate into operation within three months of its being proposed, instead of nine months under the existing Act.4. It gives the Boards additional power in regard to the fixing of wages and the controlling of the conditions under which particular classes of workers are employed, especially learners.The other amendments are principally directed to remedying the shortcomings of the existing Act which have been discovered in course of administration, and do not raise any controversial question.It will be observed that the Bill does not prop&amp;se theimmediate extension of the Trade Boards system to any^ particular industries and is not therefore calculated to provoke the opposition of any particular group of manufacturers.     It is not anticipated that any serious degree of opposition will be encountered.
