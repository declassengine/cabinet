THISJOgSSS       THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC L AJ1]STY8S GOVERNMENT).WAR CABINET. ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE POLICY. Note by the Secretary *I have received from Lord Har&amp;inge a letter dated, April 25th containing a suggestion.&quot;that a valuable impression would be caused in neutral &quot;circles if we were to let it be known that we are now &quot;arranging our financial policy for after the war, that &quot;the question of apportionment of raw materials would be &quot;one of the main items in any such consideration, and *that the principle on which such apportionment will be &quot;decided will be to place the Allies first, neutrals &quot;next, and enemies last.   The implication would be, of &quot;course, that any country that desires to come in on a &quot;better footing must lose no time in placing herself in * the former category,nLord Hardinge further asks me whether the Cabinet themselves have already pronounced on the subject, but I find that no such pronouncement has been made and I am therefore answering Lord Hardinge to that effect,It will be seen that Lord Kardinge* s letter raises once more the important question that has long remained waiting for an answer, but is still unanswered.It may be convenient here to record some of the steps that have been taken in connection with this Question,   on November 27th, 1917, (War Cabinet 263, Minute 17), the War Cabinet had before them Interim Report No* 5, dealing with the control of raw materials presented by the Economic Offensive Committee (paper 0.175) which, Inter alia, urged the necessity of legislation of a similar character being introduced in this country, in the Dominions, and among the Allies, and especially in the United States, with the object of controlling the volume, direction, and priority of the exports and imports by licence. Tlse War Cabinet decided to approve the Interim Report, and to request the Foreign Office to forward it to the Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairs, with a view to Mr, Balfour bringing it to the notice of Colonel House in Paris,On January 21st, 1918, Sir Edward Carson, Chairman of the Economic Offensive Committee,  submitted a Memorandum (Paper G.190) in which he recommended that there should be an early public state-men t of the general lines of the Government Economic Policy.   In his words&quot;By far the most urgent need at the present moment &quot;is that the Government should agree among themselves, . &quot;and formulate the broad general principles of their &quot;Economic Policy, and that, having done so, they should &quot;make a clearly reasoned and temperately worded state-&quot;ment of their intentions, for the benefit of our own &quot;peoples of our Allies,  of neutrals, and last, but not &quot;least, of the enemy.&quot;JLJLJLft E- T-*G.T. 4588.
On February 23rd, Mr. Barnes reported to the Cabinet (paper G.196) that the Committee agreed with Sir Edward Carson&apos;3 recommendation^, in their opinion an early public statement &quot;is &quot;rf great importance and urgency and they desire forthwith t* &quot;bring the matter to the notice of the War Cabinet&quot;.Mr. Barnes&apos;s report came to the War Cabinet on March 8th (War Cabinet 362, Minute 10).   Upon that occasion the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that in reply to a question in the Kouse of Commons on the previous day he had expressed the hope that an opportunity for making a general statement of the Government&apos;e policy might be afforded in connection with the introduction of the Imports and Exports (Temporary Control) Bill. Sir Albert Stanley was preparing such a statement.There the matter stands.In view of the continued inquiries on the subject and pressure from mar/7 sides for a Government pronouncement, I am circulating this note with a view to discussion by the War Cabinet at an early date.(Sgd.)   M.P.A. HAMKEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. 27th April, 1918.
