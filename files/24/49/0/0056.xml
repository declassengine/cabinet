SUMMARY OF BLOCKADE INFORMATION

19th - 25th April, 1918.

G.T.4356

S1. DENMARK

The Danish Government have notified the United States Government that they desire to continue the negotiations for a General Agreement.

S2. Norway.

We noted last week the Norwegians were raising now objections to certain clauses in the draft Agreement with the United States. The War Trade Board have refused to consider the Norwegian counter-proposals and have in ormed Dr. Nansen that the Norwegian Government by its delay in ratifying proposals which have been already considered in every detail is causing the Allied Governments to doubt whether they really desire to conclude an Agreement. Sir M. Findlay believes that Mr. Ihlen is genuinely anxious for an Agreement but opinion-in Norway inclines more and more towards a policy of piece-meal exchanges with the Allies, cargo for cargo.

The Norwegian food position is becoming serious. It may be neccessary for the Government to prohibit the consumption of potatoes until the planting season is over, otherwise there may be a shortage of potatoes for seed. The bread ration may have to be reduced to 150 grammes per head per day in August unless supplies of cereals arrive from overseas. The Government apprehend serious disturbances in May. They have temporarily increased the rations for workmen and have organised extensive relief for the unemployed. The Military Authorities have been given the necessary powers to deal with any disturbances which may arise

S3. SWEDEN

The Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs is anxious to come to an agreement with the Allies and will probably resign, with several of his colleagues, if the present negotiations should break down. A Conservative Government would then be formed which would play into the hands of the pro-German Whites in Finland.






Sir K* Howard accordingly suggests that, if wo cannot accept the Swedish counter-proposals for a General Agreement, we should tide over the present oriole try conducing another provisional Agreement, under v&amp;ieh Swedes should receive cereals end other commodities in return for further cessions of tonnage *The Germans have agreed to a reduction of their imports of Swedish iron ore to 5,800,000 torn end are prepared to sanction the chartering of 400*000 tons of Swedish shipping to the Allies.   The Swedish Government are prepared to prohibit altogether the export o * carbide but not of molybdenum, ferro-silioon or pyrites, to Germany,gHTinifoABpBS.   The Dutch Government are feeing a serious crisis in their negotiations with the German Government.   The German Govermant have asked the Dutch Government to assent to the unrestricted tran-sit of sand and gravel from Germany to Belgium over Butch territory and to authorise tho export of further quantities from Holland . nr. London has been officially notified of this demand among other demands of less importance.   The German Minister at the Hague has been instructed by his Government to present an even more serious claim namely that the Butch shall allow the passage of German troops and   munitions over tho &quot;imburg Hallway,   He has t^ken on himself to postpone the formal noti Cioatlon of this demant, though he has commun-ieated it by word of mouth to the Dutch Government,   It is reported that he would resiga if the Military Party at Berlin insisted or. this last concession, Kr* London admits that the position is serious, but he hopes for a satisfactory settlement.   H.K. Government consider that, if the Germans are determined to force on issue, it would not be fair to encourage the Dutch to run the rislr of war.   It is strategically of importance thc:t Holland should not be overrun by tho German armies, and more particularly that mo Scheldt should not come under German control.   But we are at present unable to afford Holland any effective military assistance*    In the last resort wo shall Inform tho tut oh that we ssmst regard their submit-
u9eion to the German demands as made under duroes and therefore not a breach of neutrality.    Heam&amp;ile we shell refuse to reloaee the Butch from tholr engagements as to transit facilities end Insist that I tho German demands are inadmissible.The Butch have offiolally notified their willingness to reopen negotiations for a General Agreement with tho Allies, which nr. London conoidere a necessity.   Mr. Van Vollenhoven win probably receive full powers to negotiate the Agreement in London,She Dutch Government &amp;*ve cencelled all licences granted and outstanding for the export of foodstuffs to the United IClngiiom. rr. Posthuma is apparently responsible for this decision, which was taken by the Dutch Cabinet in the absence of rr* Soudon.   S!he produce affec-tod by the order includes 1,023 tons of milk, 66 tons of cheese and il9350 tons of sugar.    A consignment of flax was else detainee on the ground that no yarns or cotton goods hud boon delivered from the United KlngClom in exchange.   This difficulty, however, ir in process of settlement.* --Vhile the Allies were negotiating for a further restrictionof the Swiss cotton exports to Germany several Swiss exporters eb-tained an abnormal number Of licences for embroideries owing to the temporary suspension of the ration.   She cotton exports in the period ?eb.4th to Harsh 15th alone amounted to 690 tone (the proposed annual ration for embroideries is 1,000 tons).    Oho ration will now be re-vised in order that these abnormal exports may bo balanced.2ho German delegates at Berne are pressing their demands Tor a further restriction on the use of Gormen eeal in the Swiss factories which manufacture munitions for the Allies.   Eheir attitude throughout these negotiations has been extremely unaccommodating,   2hey are aek-iwz the Swiss to pay fiouble the present prices for German coal and on those terms they are   willing to forego any further credits in Swit-serlend.?he Germane hare mE.de no definite offer o &apos; groin to Swltserland since February when they drew the attention o&quot; the federal Government to the possibility of obtaining grain from the Ukraine, but intimated that any agreement between Switzerland mid the Ukraine should be maae
 through the mediation of Germany and Austria. She Swiss at one time thought of obtaining wheat from the Ukraine independently of the Central Empires, but they abandoned tho idea when it was realised that the German  Government would have to be a party to the negotiations. The Swiss are extremely reluctant to accept supplies from Germany and will only do so in the last resort.

Two possible solutions of the Swiss shipping difficulty have been offered. The Germans may allow the Dutch ships requisitioned in the United States to carry grain to Switzerland provided they flythe Swiss flag side by side with the American flag. The Germans justify their refusal to pass these ships under the American flag by pointing out that it woulti be difficult to distinguish them from American vessels carrying supplies for the  Allies. Alternatively the Swiss might be authorised to purchase the enemy ships now In Spain. The Swiss Government understand that no difficulty would be raised either by the German Government or by the owners of the vessels.

SOUTH &amp; CENTRAL AMERICA.

The United States Government have sanctioned the transfer to the Argentine flag of three enemy ships in Chile on the understanding they will be used to transport nitrates to the United States and will carry no crews, officers or passengers of enemy nationality. H.M. Government have concurred in this arrangement.
