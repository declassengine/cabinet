LXDL    Redistribution of Allied Naval Forces in the Mediterranean..The Council having carefully considered the existing position in the Mediterranean, and the re-arrangements that will be necessary in the near future if the situation as regards the Russian Black Sea Fleet and its acquisition by Germany develops in accordance with the intelligence which is now in their possession, the Members representing France, Great Britain, Japan, and the United States of America decided   to adopt the following conclusions(a) It is agreed that it is possible9 and evenprobable, that in the near future Germany may acquire, man and utilise for operations in the Mediterranean at least the more modern and efficient units of the Russian Black Sea-Fleet.       It is therefore essential that the counter measures that are necessary to meet this contingency, including an attempt to effect a junction with the Austrian Adriatic forces, shall now be decided upon, and that such of these measures shall at once be put into force as are not capable of quickly being adopted when and if the emergency arises,(b) It is agreed that the Allied Naval forces in the Mediterranean are sufficient and that only
a redistribution and a re-arrangement of these forces is necessary,It is decided that the position requires that the Aegean Squadron shall be reinforced by 6 French Battleships., and that these capital ships together with the &quot;LORD NELSON&quot; and &quot;AGAMEMNON&quot; shall be stationed at a base in the Aegean.It, is also agreed that, consequent on the above reinforcement, of the Aegean Squadron, it is necessary in oi^der to enable the main Battle Fleet of the Allies in the Mediterranean to encounter the Austrian main Fleet with decisive force in all eventualities, that 4 of * the Dreadnought type Battleships of Italy now stationed at Taranto shall at the earliest possible moment be permanently attached to and incorporated in the Fleet under the AlliedCommander-in-Chief at Corfu,It is agreed that the Italian Battleships shall not be detached to Corfu until arrange-ments satisfactory to the Italian Commander-in-Chief have been male by the Allies to, ensure their sufficient supply of coal and fuel as required, and provision has been made for workshops either ashore or afloat to cope with their current small repairs at Corfu. Furthermore, it is understood that the exist-ing arrangements whereby these Battleships are docked at least once in every six months shall be continued, and that one ship at a time shall
;be absent as necessary for this purpose.France and Great Britain undertake to assist-in every possible way in raking the arrange-ments as regards the supply of coal and fueland the repair facilities above mentioned,(e) It is also agreed that plans shall now be drawn out and all the necessary arrangements made whereby sufficient destroyers (other than Italian destroyers, which are continuously required for escort service and operations in the Adriatic) shall now be allocated for the reinforcement of the Aegean Squadron and for operation with the combined French and Italian Fleet at Corfu,.   But that the destroyers so allocated shall not be detached from their present stations and duties until the Allied Gommander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean is of opinion that the emergency is imminent,(f) A sufficient force of submarines shall similarlybe allocated for service with the Aegean Squadron.(g) It is agreed that plans shall at once be drawn up for additional mine-fields at the mouth of theDardanelles and in the vicinity, and also for the employment of anti-submarine nets and cther anti-submarine devices In the approaches to the Dardanelles   and in the various channels leading from the Aegean, and that the necessary materials in accordance with these plans shall be provided as soon as practicable,(h) The permanent mine-fields and anti-submarine defences will be laid as soon as the necessarymaterials are provided,, and the Allied Commander&apos;--r-   *&apos;&quot;    \ /in
. The Members representing    Italy on the Council do not concur In tho general conclusions reached by the Members representing the other countriesBThey consider that in principle, and apart from the question of maintenance and supplies, the transfer to Corfu of Italian Dreadnoughts would be desirable, as in this way they would already be joined to the French Fleet so as to engage the Austrian Fleet in csse the latter should leave the Adriatic,,    However, such assembly should not be considered as a fusion of the Italian Squadron with the French Fleet, since the former must keep intact their character of distinct grouping and be always ready to transfer themselves and intervene anywhere that it would appear desirable with regard to the Adriatic situation,,The principle of subordinating the sending to the Aegean of some of the French units now at Corfu to the arrival at Corfu of the Italian Dreadnoughts is not acceptable; the advisability of such a movement is exclusive-ly dependent upon events in the Adriatic, which cannot be foreseen and may not be related to those in the Aegean.Since the participation cf Italy in the war, the Naval situation In the Adriatic has undergone no such changes as to&apos; justify a reduction of the Allied Naval forces which were then deemed necessary to oppose the Austrian Fleet.    If now such events in the Aegean are expected as to call for an increase of the Naval forces inin Chief will make the necessary arrangements far the additional emergency nine-fields and various anti-subFarine measures that will be required if the enemy forces emerge from the Dardanelles,
those waters, these forces might by supplied by the other Allies, more especially since at the present time there is not in the Mediterranean a single Allied ship having a speed greater than or equal to that of one of the one my1 s battle-cruisers   (&quot;Goeben&quot;),,No unanimous conclusions having been reached it was not possible to forward to the Supreme War Council any report upon these matters from the Council as a ?fhole0    It was therefore decided that the Membersof each Country should inform their respective C-overnments accordingly.
