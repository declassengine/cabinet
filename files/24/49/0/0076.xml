lirfiumnent is the Property..of His Britannic Majestrs Government^CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,Foreign Office. .5 [April 25, 1918.JItaly /001.MEMORANDUMonITALY.(a.) T//c Congress of Oppressed Nationalities,THE Congress held in Rome on the 8th, 9th, 10th April* gives, an international publicity and importance to the movement in favour of Italian solidarity with the oppressed subject-races of Austria-Hungary. The idea of an Italo-Slav entente is, of course, as oJd as Mazzini, but the present movement originates with the withdrawal of Russia and the consequent isolation of Italy in the struggle against Austria. A final incentive to action was provided by the New Year speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson, and the reports of negotiations being carried on in Switzerland by the Western Powers in the hope of detaching Austria-Hungary from Germany. Italians saw in these manifestations (t) an adequate realisation by the Western Governments of the &quot;impossibility&quot; of Austria-Hungary and the insincerity of its promises of amendment; (2) quasi-abandonment of the cause of the victims of Austrian misrule and aggression in the Balkans and of the principle of national self-determination ; (3) neglect of a vital interest of the whole Entente in establishing a solid barrier against the Germanic Drang nach Osten; (4) readiness to whittle down the aspirations and needs of Italy to the barest minimum of &quot; irredentist&apos;&quot;&apos; claims. The alarm was therefore universal, and affected all political groups. Hence the rapid success of the movement which has led up to the Congress and the surprising degree of unanimity produced in Italy. Nationalists recognised the necessity for reinforcing Italy&apos;s military effort by a &quot; political offensivewithin the Dual Monarchy,j and the danger of alienating Allied sympathies by perseverance in their imperialistic anti-Jugo-Slav campaign. They accordingly support the general aim of the movement though they apparently hope to secure the advantages which it promises to Italy without paying for them in &apos;: concessions,&quot; and they deprecate any immediate discussion of territorial adjustments. The Rome Committee &quot; for the Liberation of the Oppressed Nationalities of Austria-Hungary &quot; on which Nationalists and Conservatives formed the preponderant element, organised the Congress and seeni to have insisted on the exclusion of any concrete and particular discussion of territorial problems. On the other &apos;hand the democratic Committee &quot;for an understanding between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs &quot; frankly advocates the abandonment of Italy &apos;s claim to part of the mainland of Dalmatia and would like to see the nettle grasped at once. &quot; L;Unita,&quot; the Radical weekly of De Vittide Marco, and Salvemini- both members of the democratic &quot; Italo- J ugo-Slav Committee&apos;&quot;&apos; contends (23rd March) that any accord reached only by shirking the territorial question would be insincere and might prove as fallacious and disastrous as that on which the Balkan League of 1912 was founded. Whether any concrete agreement was reached in the conversation which Signor Torre had with Dr. Trumbic in London we do not know. If so, it was not embodied in the &quot;articles&quot; voted by the Congress, which therefore represents not agreement in a definite proposed solution of territorial questions but merely a promise of such agreement. Within these limits, however, the Congress, which was organised primarily with the purpose of affording the Allies on either side of the Atlantic convincing proof (I) of the reality and sincerity of the movement against Austria-Hungary on the part of the subject peoples, and (2) of the possibility of harmonising their claims on a basis of liberty and justice, has been a remarkable success. It has also, no doubt, been of considerable value in promoting personal intimacy and mutual understanding between the leaders of the different, national movements and in convincing Italy&apos;s guests of the changed attitude of Italian public opinion. But the doubt expressed by M. Gauvain in the &quot;Journal des Debats &quot; (to the extreme annoyance of the Italian Nationalist organ) as to the value of the Congress in relation to its secondary object, of producing such a* An account of its proceedings is annexed to this report. [367-7] . B
stirring of the disruptive forces within Austria-Hungary as may have consequences of military importance, is probably well founded. As M. Gauvain points out, this result is unlikely to follow until the Italian Government gives clear expression of its intention(b.) Position of the Government.If, as seems to be the case, the Left wing of the Italian Government is convinced of the importance, both to the Entente and to Italy, of the movement represented by the Congress and intends to make it into an effective weapon against Austria, the concrete questions which will have to be raised and settled territorial adjustments employment of Czech and Slav troops with a view to propaganda, &amp;c are likelv to accentuate divergences within the Cabinet and make advisable the replacement of Baron Sonnino by some less obstinate conservative statesman, less hostile to democracy and all its works, and having fuller sympathy with its new policy. Signor Nitti is credited with the desire to take over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is the strongest man in the Government and was pointed to, at the time when the present Ministry was formed, as eventual Prime Minister. It seems to be doubtful, however, whether he wTould command the necessary following. He is said to be unpopular with the League of National Defence, on whose support in Parliament the Government has chiefly to rely. The League comprises members of nearly all political groups, but the Ria ;ht and Centre seem to form the preponderant element, and Signor Nitti&apos;s unpopu-larity is probably accounted for partly by his Radicalism, partly by his ambitious temperament, and partly by his energetic action in regard to the contraband trade, in which a number of the richest industrialists in Italy are involved. As things stand at present,. Signor Nitti undoubtedly stands for energetic prosecution of the war and full co-operation with the Allies, as the only hope for the future economic prosperity of Italy, which is, and has been throughout his career, his first and dearest object.Further grounds for expecting changes in the Government may. perhaps, be found in the strong feeling aroused in the country by the cotton scandals. People found it hard to believe that men of such high standing, respected character, and great wealth, as are many of the.persons accused, should have acted as they have without countenance of some sort from Ministers members at any rate of earlier Administrations. The question of Ministerial responsibility in this matter is to be brought up in the Chamber (which reassembled on the L8th April) on a motion given notice of by the leaders of the official Socialist party.On the other hand, the fear lest the reins of power should be captured by &quot;neutralists&quot; is as strong as ever, and will probably secure a majority on a vote of confidence for the Government, which is unlikely at a critical period like the present to undertake a spontaneous readjustment. Such a readjustment seems at least to have been discussed (so much leaked out through the press in spite of a rigorous censorship) on the occasion of General Alfieri&apos;s retirement from the post of Minister of War.(c.) Food and Supplies.The scarcity of coal is obviously felt as a great danger by Italian Ministers. There are no stocks to draw upon, says the-Minister of Munitions, and, unless supplies from abroad can be regularly maintained, munitions factories will have to be shut down, and the anticipated Austrian offensive cannot be met.Signor Nitti is also reported as having expressed himself as follows to the correspondent of the   Daily Telegraph &quot; (12th April) :-&quot; If Italv receives the minimum of coal, corn, steel and war material she will hold out. We must hold out. 1 have talked with all our generals. ^ They all have the same belief in, our powers of resistance. Even the Socialists, after Bussia&apos;s example, realise the German menace. But Italys resistance depends upon the unity of the Allies.   To leave Italy short of coal, steelcrime. As things stand it would be dangerous to remove a single division, from the Italian front! and not to send Allied reinforcements in case of an offensive would be culpable. Between loyal friends one should speak the language of sincerity.&quot;There has been great outcry recently about the shortage of meat, and decrees have been approved by the Cabinet making provision for (l) requisitioning of stocks; (2) rationing by provinces ; (3.) limitation of consumption by ordering three meatless days instead of two ; (4) a reorganisation on a broader basis of the Gram Committees
whose functions are to. be enlarged, and which are to be rechristened Provincial Provisioning Committees (&quot; Consorzi provinciali di Approvigionamento &quot;); (5) checking of speculation, hoarding and favouritism.(d.) Moral of Army and People.Rumours of an immediate peace, spread abroad with the object of relaxing the public moral, and generally attributed, by the press to enemy agents, became so persistent in the first half of March that the Ministry of the Interior thought it necessary to issue an official denial, and to instruct prefects to search out, and proceed against the authors. Advantage was taken of the silence imposed with regard to the subjects under discussion by the Conference of Allied Ministers in London. The subsequent publication of the Allied Manifesto regarding the peace imposed upon Russia and Yon Hertling&apos;s speech helped greatly to clear the air, and was welcomed by the Italian press, which had done its utmost to combat the &quot; peace offensive.&quot; The loss of ground on the Western front seems lately to have produced a recrudescence of &quot; disfattismo,&quot; and recent reports from private sources hardly bear out the very optimistic views regarding the moral of the army expressed by Signor Oriando on his return from a visit to the front on the 7th April; nor do they justify any very sanguine estimate of the &quot; resistenza&quot; of the civil population. Events, however, on the Western front are being anxiously watched in Italy, and the improved position of affairs will doubtless have its beneficial effect.APPENDIX.Congress of Oppressed Nationalities.The Congress organised by the Committee formed at Rome &quot; for the liberation of the oppressed nationalities of Austria-Hungary,&quot; was held at the Capitol on the 8th, 9th, and 10th April. Only official reports of the proceedings were published. The organising Committee had the adherence of a long list of other Committees recently formed in support of the movement and of other political organisations. The list included the &quot; Political Association among Italian Irredenti&quot; (which differentiates itself from the &quot; Democrazia Sociale Irredenta&quot; in much the same way as the organising Committee is differentiated from the Democratic Committee &quot;for an understanding with the Jugo-Slavs,&quot; and contains a strong &quot;nationalist element&quot;), the &quot;Parliamentary League of National Defence,&quot; representing several hundred Senators and Deputies, the &quot;Dante Alighieri &quot; Society (nationalist in tendency), the &quot; Committee for an Under-standing between Italy and the Jugo-Slavs &quot; (pronouncedly democratic and in favour of repudiating the claim to part of the Dalmatian mainland), the &quot; Italo-Czech Com-mittee,&quot;the &quot; Italian Republican Party,&quot; the &quot;Independent Jugo-Slav Democracy.&quot;the &quot; Deniocrazia, Sociale Irredenta&quot; (which was represented at the International Labour Congress at London and took a leading part in the formation of the Socialist Committee which has its headquarters in Paris and is presided over by M. Albert Thomas), the &quot; Union of Constitutional Liberal Associations of Rome,&quot; and several other bodies. Signori Bissolati and Comandini had also signified their adherence. Expressions of cordial sympathy had likewise been received from Czech, Jugo-Slav, Polish, and Roumanian prisoners of war. The Czechs sent a telegram in which the hope was expressed that they might soon be in a position to avenge with arms the vulgar insults launched by Czernin against Professor Masaryk. A party of Jugo-Slav officers belonging to a Serbian division which had fought in Russia, came to &quot; testify in Rome the concrete will of their people to take part actively in the struggle against Austria.&quot;All the people, directly concerned (except the Italian Irredenti) were represented; viz., Italians (of tire Kingdom), Czecho-Slovaks, Rumanians, Poles, Jugo-Slavs, Serbes. while the interest and sympathy of the Allies was testified by the presence of MM. Franklin Bouillon, A. Thomas, Fournon, and De Quirielle for France, Mr. Wickham Steed and Dr. Seton Watson for this country, and Mr. Nelson Gay for the United States.The meeting on the 8th was taken up with election of officers, settling of the order of business. &amp;c. The Senator and ex Minister Signor Ruffini was elected President with Signor A, Torre and others as Vice-Presidents, Signor Amendola (of the &quot; Corriere della. Sera&quot;) as Secretary-General.[387-7] B 2
tThe second day was given up to discussions of which no detailed report was published.On the last and third day, after the various Commissions had reported the results of their deliberations, a plenary sitting was held, attended by a number of invited guests-publicists, journalists, and Jugo-Slav volunteers from the Saloniki front-to hear read aloud (by Signor A. Torre): (1) a solemn protest of the Rumanians against the peace imposed on their country by the Central Empires;&apos; (2) a manifesto on the part of the Congress, stating very forcibly the case against Austria and the reason and aims of the united action agreed upon, and serving as introduction to (3) the formal articles forming the basis of the accord reached in the Congress ; (4) a. special declara-tion by the Polish delegates-adhering to the general resolution-further defining in relation to Germany (which the Polish nation regards as the principal enemy of Poland) the case of Poland.The full text of (2) and (3) is as follows : &quot; The Delegates who have accepted the invitation of the Italian Committee for an Accord between the peoples subject to Austria-Hungary Czecho-Slovaks, Poles, Rumanians, and Jugo-Slavs (Serbs, Croatians,and Slovenes) as well as the representatives of the Allied nations, met together on the 8th April in Conference in the Capitol at Rome and unanimously voted the following declarations &quot; The war which was not provoked and not willed but which has had to be accepted by the peoples which to-day are throughout the world resisting the overbearing ambition and violence of an aggressive Imperialism has made more evident than ever before the profound opposition existing between the designs of high policy (&quot; disegni Statali&quot;) which demand the subjection of nationalities to the policy of domination and war and the needs of peoples to constitute themselves free national and State units in order to attain pacific control of their own destinies. Either ethnical and civil liberty will triumph in this struggle, or Imperial dictatorship ; either the regime which finds in peace the guarantee of right, or the regime which in order to impose its schemes of hegemony requires the iron s57-stem of military and political absolutism, a ceaseless condition of internal unrest and perpetual menace of war.&quot; The whole world is involved in this struggle, and it is not only the fate of States but the fate of civilisation which hangs on the issue of the conflict. On the peoples is laid the duty of defending themselves with clear consciousness of the significance of this war and of the consequences it involves, the duty of defending themselves in order to preserve their heritage of culture and their ideals of life, in order to assure possession of their own resources and control of their own organisation. It is not the nation which, should be subservient to the State but the State which should be the instrument of the nation, and only in so far as it is such does it justify its right to existence.&quot;To-day the most imposing phenomenon connected with German and Magyar Imperialism is not the awakening of the various oppressed nationalities to consciousness - for that consciousness has always existed and has lived through such sufferings and sacrifices as are known only to those who have endured them but the activity which they have initiated outside and in opposition to the States to which they are attached and in collaboration with the people aud States which are fighting against the political power which holds them in its power. And it is this revolt against Imperial arrogance and this pledge of co-operation between peoples actually forming part at the time of States at war with one another which constitutes the reason and purpose of the union which we to-day proclaim and consecrate from the Capitol at Rome.&quot; The fundamental aim of Austro-Hungarian policy has been to create division and opposition between the nationalities comprised within the Monarchy, and only by this means has the maintenance been found possible of a political system under which ^ a minority of little more than 20 millions of German and Magyars governs and holds in subjection a majority of more than 30 millions of Slavs and Latins. Germany has need of this political system in order to be able to make of Austria-Hungary a State capable of subserving her imperialistic programme, and the, Germans and Magyars of the Hapsburg Monarchy know that without the support of Germany they would neither have been able to preserve the existence of the State, which alone^ can assure their unjust dominion, nor to resist the pressure of the Slav and Latin majority which aspires to emancipation and to its organisation in national and State units.&quot; Only an accord between the subject peoples and a common formation are able to create a new situation under which, in defiance of the empire of violence^ the edifice of right and liberty, and justice for the nations shall be restored.   It is this accord and
othis common action of the nations which constitute the will of the Congress. Like the peoples of the Entente, so the oppressed nations are convinced that they are not only-defending their own cause, but, at the same time, doing homage to the cause of all peoples friendly, neutral, and enemy who on respect for the rights of nationality intend to base their own right to existence, development, and influence in the world.&quot;The Entente of Rome- Avhich has this day achieved its consummation following upon a long labour of preparation in London and Paris, carried out with international solidarity which should not and will not die does not only aim at a political accord but at an association in spirit and in work, in culture and in, commerce, destined to survive the war, to maintain among us permanent union, and to keep alive, by feelings and actions of reciprocal loyalty, common faith in our mission of-progress and human civilisation. To be united, firmly united, in common action will constitute the force which we shall have to oppose to the imperialism of our oppressors. Nations live and triumph if they preserve the consciousness of their aims and if their will is adequate to the needs which impel them and to the ideals which justify those aims.&quot; The following are the resolutions unanimously voted :- &quot; The representatives of the nationalities wholly or partly subject to the domina-tion of Austria-Hungary ^Italians, Poles, Roumanians, Czechs, Jugo-Slavs have united in affirming as follows the principles by which their common action shall be guided : &quot; 1. Each of these peoples proclaims its right to establish its own nationality and . State unity, to complete this unity, and to attain full political and economc independence.&quot; 2. Each of these peoples recognises in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy the instrument of Germanic domination and the fundamental obstacle to the realisation of its aspirations and its rights.&quot;3. The assembly consequently recognises the necessitj&apos; foj; a common struggle against the common oppressors, in order that each people may attain its complete liberation and complete natioual unity as a single free State.&quot; The representatives of the Italian people and the Jugo-Slav people are agreed in particular as follows :-&quot;1. As regards the relations between the Italian nation and the nation of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes known also under the name of the Jugo-Slav nation -the representatives of the two peoples recognise that the unity and independence of the Jugo-Slav nation is a vital interest of Italy, just as the completion of Italian nationality is a vital interest of the Jugo-Slav nation. And therefore the representatives of the two peoples pledge them-selves to use their utmost effort to the end that during the war and at the moment of peace these aims of the two peoples may be fully attained in their entirety.&quot; 2. They affirm that the liberation of the Adriatic Sea and its defence against every actual and eventual enemy is a vital interest of the two peoples.&quot; 3. They pledge themselves to resolve amicably, in the interest of future good and sincere relations between the two peoples, the various territorial controversies on the basis of nationality, and the rights of peoples to decide their own fate, and in such a manner as not to injure the vital interests of the two nations, to be defined at the moment of peace.&quot; 4. The nuclei of-one people which may have to be included within the frontiers of the other shall be guaranteed the right to have their own language, culture, and moral and economic interests respected.&quot;Speeches from Dr. Benes (General Secretary of the Czecho-Slovak Committee), Dr. Trumbic (President of the Jugo-Slav Committee), M. Dragicescu (Member of the Senate of lloumania), M. Zamorski (Polish Member of the Reichstag), M. Franklin Bouillon, Mr. Wickham Steed, Signor Kuffini, and Signor Barzilai followed.On the 11th April all the Delegations (not as was first announced by &quot; Stefaui,&quot; the Jugo-Slav Delegation only) were received by Signor Orlando, who in very eloquent and col-dial terms expressed the sympathy felt by the Italian Government and people for the cause which the Congress had been held to promote, their approval of the work of the Congress, and satisfaction at the agreement so happily reached.
