79/London/95.WAR   CABINET.Air Raids and the Defence of London. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.4lf37/f       &apos;/        With reference to G.T. 4168, I circulate a noteprepared by hajor General Ashmore, Commanding the London Air Defence Area,MILKER.26th April, 1918.NOTE OK THE AIR DEFENCES OF LONDON.       15th April, 1918..1,     The principles of defence remain as set forth in F.M. Lord French *s report of 17th Jan, 1918.   The present note supplement that rteport, and brings it to the present date.jOPLANE       2. .   Greater freedom of action has been given to the night FROLS.&apos; aeroplane patrols by moving guns from the area between InnerLondon and the Outer London Barrage.* Both close to London and in Kent and Essex, patrol lines have been re-arranged to I cross the areas of highest frequency of German machines.The ten squadrons authorised are now formed and are organised in three wings - one close to London, one in Kent and one in Essex.   Their equipment has been delayed by causes connected with manufacture; twelve tfamels have been sent to reinforce the B.E.F, in France,A squadron establishment of 24 machines has been lai* down; of the total of 240 machines, we have today 139; last night there were 111 first class machines fit for flying. These machines comprise, S.E.5. A&apos;s, Sopwith Camels, Bristol&quot;&apos; Fighters and a few B,E. 12 Bfs,it GUI? 3,     The move of guns from the aeroplane patrol areas has[jNCES.        allowed a considerable thickening up of the Outer LondonBarrage. This is now organised in five commands; it is com-plete in guns according to the authorised programme. Total, 66 3&quot; 20 cwt.guns and 33 18 pounders.It has been deoided to replace 20 of the above 3&quot; 20 cwt. guns by IS pounders, in &quot;order to provide defence against Zeppelins in the Midlands and North,   The 18 pounders are suitable for night aeroplane barrage, but are not so efficient as the 3&quot; 20 cwt. in other respects.The guns about London itself are reorganised in two c ommands:Central 22 3&quot; 20 cwt. guns. West        16 3&quot; 20 cwt. guns.Outside the Outer Barrage lines of mobile guns have been established across lines of high frequency.In Kent In Essex.1st Mobiles, 2nd Mobiles,The
The Thames and Ledway Defences have &quot;been augmented by increasing the number of guns for the protection of Sheerness,   Valuable help has been given by the Admiralty in this respect.To summarize, the guns as disposed in the new organ!sa--,1,8 pdrs.       13 pdrs.332 630 183&quot; 20 cwtiLondon 38Outer Barrage 66Thames &amp; Medway 42Harwich 11Dover 20 1st Mobile 2nd Mobile1773554KTS.In all 266 guns,4o     All patrol lines are provided with searchlights, whose first duty is to turn on towards any hostile machine heard; even if the target is not illuminated, the concentration ox-beams is found in practice to give valuable assistance to our machines.During the later Gotha raids, the lights and machines had marked success in finding hostile machines.rICAT0RS.-.        &apos;.1J(1The present 60 cm,, and 90 cm., lights are gradually being replaced by 120 cm, lights which will give better lighting.   This replacement is only progressing slowly and is considerably behind its programme.

We are trying the French type. *6,     Listening posts with large sound mirrors have given   . good restuls at Dover and the North Foreland; four otherb are being built at suitable placese7.     Progress ha3 been made with the Balloon Aprons round the East of London, we have 7 Aprons in Action, and an eighth will be ready in a few dajrs.The Balloon Aprons are having the desired effect of keeping the enemy machines to a comparatively high and narrow zone, and in this way they help in our aeroplane patrol work.We have at last succeeded in finding a good form of streamline balloon, larger than the ordinary Caquot,Our
Our system is more economical than the French system of small &quot;balloons, &quot;both in personnel and gas expenditure with reference to given length of wire obstacle in the air.With the new &quot;balloons the advantage of our system should be more marked.We have tried experiments with small balloons, to go up in important places where an apron would not be possible. A suit-able type and wire have been found and small balloons are being installed,8.    Three hundred Lewis guns have been allotted in anticipa-tion of a possible low flying attack.   Some of these were installed in gun and light stations, in order tp have them ready early.   As personnel becomes available, the guns are being conc-entrated on vulnerable and important points.9.    Wireless telephony will shortly form a valuable adjunct to defence, and every effort is being made to push it forward.I propose to use the system as follows:-During night raids machines will be fitted with receivers ranging 20 miles; they can then receive information and direction from their Squadron Headquarters who themselves will have all available information.Certain machines fitted with transmitters will give information to the ground.By day, leaders in the air can receive orders etc, from the greund and can manoeuvre their formations by word of mouth.   Their flying officers will b* provided with receivers.10,   I attach a letter written on 5th February 1918, in which IgMBHTS the problem of an attack by 80 machines was discussed.I put requirements at:-(l) 300, 120 c,m. searchlights, additional to the replacements not in progress,(2) A total of 12 squadrons with 20 machines each, and 4 additional flights for wireless work (24 machines) 264 machines in alls(3) 100 additional guns of larger calibre than 3W(4) Aprons and small balloons - a total establishment in men of between 3,000 and 4,000, as already authorised.1The above was in answer to a concrete question, and would I consider give a reasonable assurance   that such an attack! would be generally unsuccessful.   Xt was written from the point  1 of view of London  Defences only and without regard to other necessities or requirements,(Sgd.)  t, B.

L.A.D.A./10GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, WM FORCES.1. In reply to H.F.C.R.13788 (A.A.I.) dated Slat Jan,1918, I take the problem of a maximum aeroplane   attack as set, that is to say, 80 German machines may make a simultaneous attack on this country by day or may be used to make an attack during any one night.   A form of attack of this mobile character necessitates defences on a large scale.The proposals I make would give, I think a reason-able assurance that either form of attack would be generally unsuccessful.   It is impossible for any defences, however strong, to ensure that no enemy machine will drop bombs over London, but we should be able to make the attack so expensive to the enemy as to be not worth his while.   In such a case, the enemy losses should have an actively good effect on moral in this country.The figures given below ar* in rae$e^en$y of the present London Air Defence Area.   Increased r^ngt o:C machines will make it necessary to consider Improved defenoes in oth-ir parts of the Kingdom, particularly in the matter of suns and limits, which are more or less immcbila.sarchlighta,2. 1 consider that defence against night raiding depends,in the first place, on an efficient searchlight service, and this will remain the case whether guns or aeroplanes become the more effeotive means of defence.Certain 60 cm, projectors are now in process of being replaced by 120 cm, projectors.   I think that an additional 300, 120 cm, lights will be required.oplanes.3. We should require in all 12 Aeroplane Squadrons (ten areauthorised at present) of 20 machines each, and 4 additional flights for wireless work (24 machines), say 264 machines in all, Making due allowance for machines unserviceable at any given time, this will allow of two reliefs, each superior in number to any possible German formation.The same number of machines would provide adeqy^t-s patrols for night work,Eia      4. For the defence of the London Air Defence Area anaddition should, I think, be made of 100 guns of a calibre larger than 3M, most of these to be disposed oo as to increase the power of the Outer London Barrage,Hen of good physique would be required as loading numbers in the detachments.Borne oontrol arrangement, such as the Brocq or the instrument now under discussion with Lt, Hon,L.Guest,3.$,V.R,f would &quot;be useful in connection with these guns.loon Aprons.5. Aprons and other balloon defences are now in process ofdevelopment.   The establishment already authorised for the 7th Balloon Wing should suffice,A new value of the aprons haB recently come to lightheavy
heavy machines like the Gotha oan, by putting their noses slightly down, get up a high rate of speed.   They cannot, aui4 do not, do this until they think they are olear of the Aprons,   They have to fly level, and therefore slowly, over London,6*    Summary of requirements in order of importance(1)   300, 120 o,m. Searchlights, additional to the replacements now in progress,(2)   A total of 12 Squadrons with 20 machines each, and 4 additional flights for Wireless work, (24 machines) 264 machines in all,(3)   100 additional guns of larger calibre than 3&quot;.(4)   Aprons and email balloons - a total establish-ment in men of between 3,000 and 4,000,(5)   The telephone communications, as required for the above,(Sgd.)
