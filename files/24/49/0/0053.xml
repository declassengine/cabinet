WAR WAGES TO RAILWAYHEN.A3 1 71Mote &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade. i xWhen the last increase in the war wage of Railwayman was negociated on the 30th November last between the Railway Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Government, and the   National Union of Railwayman, it was agreed as part of the settlement that the&apos; increased wages then granted should remain in operation until the 31st tfarch, 1918, and that they should then he subiect to revision only if there should have been a considerable alteration in tne cost of living as shown by the Board of Trade Beturns.Although the Board of Trade Returns do not indicate that an increase has taken place in the cost of living since November last, the position has been altered by the fact that the Munition Worker^ Bonus of 13J- per cent to men employed on time rates and 7  per cent to men on piece rates has been granted to the Engineers employed-in the Railway shops and that this advance has been ex-tended by an award of the Committee of Production even to artisans and labourers employed in such shops.    This circumstance makes it very difficult to resist the claim; of other branches of railway labour to be granted corres-ponding advances in wages.Prolonged associations have as a result of this situation been taking place between the Railway Executive Committee and the National Union of Iiailwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers &amp; Firemen, As a result of these negociations a settlement has been arrived at with both Unions, under which the present war wage of 21/- a week granted to men has been raised to 25/ a week witn corresponding increases to women workers and to boys.As a result of this advance the total wages paid to Railwaymen will exceed by about 45 million pounds a year those paid before the war*(Sgd) A.H. STANLEY.26th April, 1918.
