-^SECRET.MINISTEY   OF   FOOD.! I  u1-   Report for Week ending Wednesday, April 24, 1918.Allied Requirements. Lord Reading cabled that there was considerable misappre-hensiou and criticism in the United States as regards the use of grain for alcoholic liquors in the United Kingdom, and asking for figures dealing with the extent to which this prevails.Cablegrams from Mr. Owen Smith state that owing to increased requirements of the United States Army and Navy there will be difficulty in securing the. amount of frozen beef required for the United Kingdom.Mr. Owen Smith has been notified that it is desirable to send foodstuffs in as large quantities as possible to London. At the present moment tonnage from New York is mainly coming to Liverpool.Sir Hardman Lever has telegraphed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Sir Thomas White has arrived in Newr York and is engaged on questions of Canadian finance. It is expected that the Canadian Government will arrange for the purchase of cheese. This does not, however, satisfy the whole demand of the Ministry of Food who require further finance immediately for frozen meat in order to fill refrigerated tonnage unexpectedly available owing to diversion of ships from North America.Sir Guy Granet has relieved Mr. Owen Smith as representative of the Ministry of Food in the United States, and as chairman of the Allied Provisions Export Commission.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. The continued representations of the wholesale trade against the proposal to tie the retailer to one wholesaler under the revised Distribution Scheme have been, met to some extent by the concession permitting any retailer requiring more than 5 cwts. a week of bacon and ham combined to obtain his supplies from two suppliers altogether, wholesalers or importers.The prices fixed by the Bacon, Ham, and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, Amendment Order, 1918, dated the 17th April, have proved generally acceptable, no protest having been received.Curers of home-grown bacon are now receiving allocations of imported bacon in order that they may have sufficient stock to meet applications made to them. This arrangement is proceeding satisfactorily.There is no ground for the widespread suggestion that the considerable supplies of bacon now in the country will be allowed to go to waste. The Ministry have the situation well in hand, and adequate measures will be taken to ensure the preservation of these supplies against a leaner time.Butter. 620 tons of butter have recently arrived from the United States of America, 998 tons from Australia, 25 tons from Canada, and 35 tons from South Africa. On 20th April the stocks of butter in hand were 6,416 tons and 20,669 tons were on passage. Further purchases of 344 tons of butter has been made in the United States of America at 381 to 46 cents per lb. f.a.s., Newr York. On Monday, 29th April, butter to the amoant of 25 per cent, of the April applications wall be distributed to the trade.Cheese. 107 tons of cheese have arrived from Australia, 61 tons from Canada, and 705 tons from the United States. There are now on the way to this country 6,771 tons from New Zealand, 1,464 tons from Australia, 77 tons of old season cheese from Canada, and 489 tons from the United States of America, where contracts have also been placed amounting to 9,392 tons.Cold Storage. The Cold Storage Section has recently undergone re-organisation as a result of which a new feature has been introduced in the form of a Cold Store Control.   The intention of this control is to ascertain each morning the vacanta   (33)5483-4.   Pkl   325   4/18   e&amp;S &apos; A -PART I. ACTION TAKEN.Supplies and Prices.
accommodation available at the principal cold stores throughout the country with a view to its immediate allocation by the various sections of the Ministry.The works for increasing-the cold-storage-capacity at various ports are pro-gressing and much of the accommodation is expected to be available for the summer.Negotia.tion&amp;:,are,in.prpgresswith a, view to increasing,further the. cold, storage capacity at Glasgow, &quot;Liverpool, and other primary ports as the existing accommodation will be overtaxed by the large imports of bacon.   -The prevention of food wastage at the London Docks has fully justified the appointment of an inspector to.deal with the subject.   .-:Intoxicating Liquors-Kw increase in the tax on spirits from 14s. 9d. to 30s. a gallon was announced in the Budget speech, and the Food Controller simultaneously issued the Spirits (Prices and Description) Order, 1918. This Order fixes as from May lstmaximimi prices for whisky, rum, British gin, and British brandy, and lays down-rules and restrictions on certain sales in licensed premises. These fixed prices settle the incidence of the new taxation as between the trade arid the public,and while leaving a full margin of profit to the retailer curtail somewhat drastically&apos;the excessive profits which all branches of the trade have been making during the past few months. The consumer will still have to pay about twice as much as in pre-war days for spirits, the alcoholic strength of \vhich is reduced by from&apos; 12J to 40 percent. With a view to ensuring the clearance from bond of the 50 per cent, of clearances now permitted and am equitable distribution of that 50 per cent., the Food Controller proposes shortly to issue another Order on the lines of the Output of Beer Restriction Order.: Meat.-Supplies of meat have recently been easier and from the absence of complaints of shortage it may be assumed that the population is receiving the full amount of the prescribed ration; possibly an amount&apos; in excess of the ration is available in some districts, indicating the necessity for adjusting the scheme by means of&apos; checking the amount consumed. With this object it is intended to tie farmers to the markets at which they may obtain live stock in order that no purchases may be made by butchers in excess of their buying permits.The deliveries of imported meat continue to be satisfactory and equal to the demands made upon them. The bulk of this supply now comes from North Ainerica, but the quality gives some ground for complaint from butchers and con-suiners who have hitherto, been accustomed to home-killed meat or the best quality of frozen meat from Australasia or South America. It would appear that much of the meat which has been made available by Mr. Hoover&apos;s conservation scheme has been in store for a considerable time and is of a quality which wrould not formerly have been considered suitable for export. There is no need for anxiety as to further supplies of meat iu the immediate future, especially as after May 5th only two coupons per week will be available for butchers&apos; meat.1 Oils and Fats-Definite provision is now being made for the issue of edible oils and oil and fat compounds^ to biscuit makers, cake makers, and bakers, and also for the provision of suitable fats for fish and potato frying, an industry which is very largely increasing at present owing to the diminution of meat supplies.The Department is undertaking the control of home-melt tallow. The tallow melters of the United Kingdom have been asked to form themselves into an Assoeia-tion for the purpose of controlling the output and price of all forms of fat rendered in this country, i.e., tallows edible and technical, drippings, melted stuffs, bone and skin greases whether benzine extracted or otherwise, and any other animal fats and greases. The Tallow Melters Association are, submitting to- the Ministry of Food, for criticism, a scheme of control.. ,;- The Oil and Fat^Compound (Licensing of Manufacturers and Requisition) Order, 1918, dated 17th April, 1918, prohibits as from April 22nd, the manufacture for sale for purposes of human consumption of any mixtures or compounds of any of the oils or fats scheduled, such as margarine, compound lard, compound dripping, or beef suets, except under license by the Food Controller., The Order also provides for the requisition of certain.oil.and fuel-compounds, and for the making of returns. ,&quot; -: Potatoes and Other Vegetables. The Potatoes (Amendment) Order, 1918, dated 17th April 1918, provides that for potatoes delivered between April. 15 and May. 14, the.maximum price which may be charged by.the grower shall be 71. a ton. After May 14 the price is to be 11. 10s. a ton. A clause also provides that on every sale of potatoes, except to consumers, the seller must, after April 30, furnish the buyer with full particulars of quantities sold and prices paid or payable.

Treasury sanction has now been given for the completion of the agreement with the British Farina Mills, Ltd., in respect oi the four mills to be set up at Boston, Hull, Kiug&apos;s Lynn, and Monikie.   The machinery for these mills has been ordered.The terms of contract for the manufacture of potato flour have now been settled by. the Ministry of Food. As the manufacture is a novelty, and a speculative venture in regard to the post-war period, it is proposed to obtain Treasury sanction to guarantee the firms that the rate of depreciation shall be such as to wipe but the cost of the plant in five years. In the event of the rate of depreciation allowed by the Inland Revenue Authorities not being sufficient, the Ministry of Food will make up balance by means of a grant to the firms. Publicity must now be given to the programme of the Department in order to (a) bring forward firms to undertake the manufacture, and (6) bring the matter to the notice of the farmers, who will be encouraged to grow more potatoes. -Investigations are being conducted as to the possibility, of adapting oast houses and other buildings in purely agricultural districts for drying roots for use as a basis of a cattle feeding mixture. It appears that a cattle mixture of higher food value than Middlings can be produced at, a cost of lol. 5s. per ton. :This consists of dried vegetables, brewery b,y-ptoducts, dried blood, fish offals, aud other waste products. If commercially sound, this should become a valuable addition to the supplies of feeding stuffs in the country. The experiment must, however, be tried out before active steps are taken for production.Sugar. The Sugar Commission have notified that in consequence of the*changes in the sugar duties the &quot;prices of sugar and syrup have been revised. The retail prices of sugar will be as follows : -ClassI., 7-frZ. ; Class II., Id. ; and Class ILL, 6fd. These prices should obtain generally and should not be exceeded except, as heretofore, in localities unfavourably situated in respect of cost of carriage.The question of instituting a flat rate for sales of sugar by retail in all localities, irrespective of the cost of, carriage, was discussed by the Consumers&apos; Council on 24th xApril. Mr. Rewcastle, the Secretary of the Commission, was opposed to any change mainly on the ground that the additional expense involved in the increase of staff and requisition of fresh premises, necessary for adequate clearing-house arrange-ments are wholly out of proportion to the advantages which the consumer would derive from the change. The Council, by a majority of seven to three, expressed themselves in favour of a flat rate.Organised Distribution.The Towers of Food Control Committees [Interpretation) Orders, 1918, dated 5th April 1918, defines for the; purposes of the Food Control Committees (Local Distribution) Orders, and the Food Control Committees (Requisitioning) Order, 1918, the words &quot; article of food &quot; and &quot; foodstuffs &quot; to mean every article which is used for food by man, and every article which ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or preparation of human food, including tea, coffee, and cocoa.Food Queues. The following figures show the estimated number of persons attending food queues in the Metropolitan area for the last two weeks, and for the week preceding the introduction of rationing : 
part being smoothed away. The principal source of difficulty, indeed in most cases the only difficulty, is the disinclination of the public to give coupons for offal.In the North Western district where on the whole reports of shortage were most frequent in the first week there is a marked improvement in the second week.In one particular district (Yorkshire) for which full figures are given, out of 177 Committees, all but 12 report that rationing has improved the distribution of meat and all report that the Scheme is working smoothly on the whole.Reports from the Ministry of Labour confirm the impression that the National Meat Rationing Scheme is working throughout the country as smoothly as the more limited scheme on which it was based worked in London and the Home Counties. Some criticism has been levelled at the dilatory methods of certain local Food Committees, which caused the postponement of the scheme in some districts; and there is no doubt that the restricted ration of meat bears hardly upon heavy workers who have been accustomed to consume considerable quantities. But the whole attitude of the Labour Press has changed from hostility to appreciation since the scheme was introduced.Supplies appear to have been fairly satisfactory. There has been some shortage of meat in the North-West of England and North Wales, while in the Eastern Counties the supplies both of meat and butter were in excess of requirements. Offals were sold free of coupons in many places to avoid waste, and it is possible that the coupon value may have to be increased. Even in Lancashire, where tripe is a popular dish, the public refused to expend coupons in its purchase.Shortage of supplies of cheese is complained of, more especially among certain classes of agricultural labourers and miners. In some districts there is a feeling in favour of the rationing of cheese.Supplementary Rations. In several of the large centres outside London and the Home Counties there has been some delay in getting the scheme for supplementary rations under weigh, and in one case, Weirside, the introduction of the scheme has been postponed by permission of the Ministry for a fortnight. Elsewhere good progress has been made with the issue of cards, and the scheme appears to be working normally, so far at least as men are concerned. The Consumers&apos; Council has adopted a resolution to the effect that all women engaged on work similar to that of men in Class D should themselves be graded in Class D. This proposal has been discussed with the scientific advisers to the Ministry and Mr. dynes will consult the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the matter before any decision is reached.The scheme of supplementary rations for adolescent boys does not come into operation for a fortnight, and no questions have as yet been raised upon it, beyond a general protest from various women&apos;s societies against the exclusion of adolescent girls....  Food Survey Board.Mr. Gerald France, M.P., has been appointed a member of the Board.The Board have made arrangements for the licensing of canteens and hostels and have recommended the curtailment of the facilities at present available for conscientious objectors to supplement their prescribed rations. They propose to prohibit the sweetening with sugar of any beverages served in collective feeding centres. They have declined to guarantee priority of fish supplies to the Army in view of the fact that fish at the present time is the principal, means by which civilians can supplement its very meagre allowance of human food.Enforcement of Orders.The following table shows the number of prosecutions which have been instituted since April 1st, 1918, for profiteering in connection with some of the most essential foodstuffs: Bacon, ham, and lard     -     -      -   704 prosecutions   681 successful.

The second reading was opposed only by Mr. Lough.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.The following paragraphs and the tables point to a distinct improvement in the import position during April, as compared with recent months. The increase, however, is far from compensating for the low level of arrivals during the winter, and in cereals particularly the need of replenishing stock still gives rise to anxiety. The sugar imports and stocks would be quite satisfactory were it not that the sources from which imports can be obtained are seriously curtailed, and unless a heavy stock is in reserve in the autumn, enough sugar may not be available to maintain even the present limited ration in the early spring of 1919.The decrease in the arrivals of foreign meat is to be regretted because of the desirability of deferring the slaughter of home cattle till these are in better condition. Two or three months&apos; postponement means a considerable increase in the yield of meat. While the heavy imports of bacon and ham have led to. an improvement in the stocks, the average weekly arrival during the first three weeks of April does not leave much surplus over the weekly consumption estimated for after May 5th.Imports.Owing to increased importations of cereals and sugar the aggregate weight of principal foodstuffs received in the week ending April 20th was 211,000 tons or 41,000- tons more than in the previous week (Table A). Arrivals were at almost the same level as a year ago.Wheat and flour together were 88,500 tons, a total in grain tons of 104,500 tons, which shows an.improvement of 25,000 tons on the week. Other cereals (including rice) were lower, with the exception of maize, the imports of which were double the average of the previous weeks of the year. The proportion of maize in the cereals used for dilution of flour is steadily growing.Sugar at 48,700 tons was well up to requirements even allowing for the high reserve that has to be stored up by the autumn. Receipts of bacon, although large, were more than 7,000 tons lower than in the week before and represent less than one week&apos;s consumption on the new rationing scale to be introduced in May.Imports of meat have steadily fallen for the past five weeks. The weekly figures for meat and bacon since the commencement of the year are set out below :--		Meat (including Beef, Mutton and Meat nnenumerated).			Week ending		Bacon and Hams.			Tods.	Tons.

Total arrivals so far this year have been for meat 12,200 tons more and for bacon, 10,3,00 tons less than in the corresponding period of 1917., Good imports of both are required in view of the necessary economy in the use of home-fed meat.r.   .    .    ,      ,     Consumption.Meat. Supplies of home-fed meat at the Central Markets, London, and at Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool increased 2 per cent, in the week ending April 13th over the week before. There was, however, a fall of 13 per cent, in imported supplies, with the remit.that the aggregate amount of meat entered was 472 tons lower. Compared with a year&quot; ago home supplies were down by 60 per cent, and foreign up by 17 per cent.; the net drop, taking both kinds together, was 29 per cent., or 2,160 tons (Table B.).At the Central Market supplies for the weekending April 20th were about the same as during the preceding week, totalling.4,080 tons. Compared with a year ago there was a falling off of 32 per cent. 7      &apos;The publication of the table giving, the supplies of fat stock at 59 markets in Great Britain has been discontinued in view of the markets therein comprised being-no&apos;longer reliable as an index for comparison between 1918 and 1917, owing to the disturbance of the normal trading channels. At the more typical markets from which returns are now received, the number of cattle and sheep stalled in the week ending April 20th were both 41 per cent, below the number for the corresponding week of last year.
