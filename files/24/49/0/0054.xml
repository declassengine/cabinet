r*/&apos;f&apos; T kJfMj ^This Document is the Property of        172\&amp;rl5Iil5^ &apos;   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; -    ^CONSUMPTION OF PAPER ON ,PERTAIN.PERIODICALS. /Reply of the National War Aims Committee,, To the. Memorandum of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association^fThe National War.Aims Committee is aware of the scarcity of paper.   It has, therefore /agreed to. aocept a ration of 150 tons a month.PRESS WORK OP THE POHMITTEE.The opinion of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association as to the inferior nature of the matter issued to the Press, does not appear to &quot;be shared by the Editors of Papers to which the matter is sent.   The Publicity Department supplies leading articles to some 400 papers a week in one service;; leading articles and London letters to about 250 more in another&quot;    s-ecial War Notes daily to 33 Provincial Evening papers; a special War Supplement to 71 of the smallervprovincial Weeklies with a oombined circulation .of 270,000, and occasional articles at the rate of about 30 a week, to an average of over 100 Papers weekly,&quot;REALITY&quot;, &quot;WELCOME&quot; ASP THE WAR SUPPLEMENT.The publications of the National War Aims Committee most strongly^ohflIlftn&amp;a&amp;,--are the periodicals &quot;Reality&quot;, &quot;Welcome&quot; and the Special War Supplement.1*     &quot;Reality&quot; is not a ne?/spaper at all, but a four-page quarto leaflet,, which is published weekly and distributed gratis on1a carefully considered plan.     It affords a neans of circulating broadcast the most telling cartoons of the week, the most striking passages from speeches, books and British or Foreign papers, and records.of German &quot;violence and cunning&quot;.     It haB a circulation of 750,000 copies,and the consumption of paper is 7&quot;! tons.2.     &quot;Welcome&quot;    is a 12-page illustrated weekly, designed to be given away to soldiers and sailors returning home on leave or wounded.     Although only trree numbers have as yet appeared, it is highly appreciated by those concerned with the welfare of the. forces, such as the Y.M.G.A., Church Army, Motor . Transport Volunteers, the Red. Oror-s, . etc. as numerous letters received by the Editor show.     It gives useful information to the men, and is further designed to be carried by them to their homes, where it will serve for propaganda among their relatives.     If it be fairly established now, it will serve a most useful purpose when the tire for demobilization comes. The circulation&apos;is strictlv limited to 50,000 and the consumption of paper per week is l  tons.3.     The War Supplement is designed to reach especially the cottages of the country dwellers, who are in the habit of taking in the small local weekly paper:, reading that from end to end and reading little else.     This class of paper is worse hit than any other by the reduction of the paper supply, and no increased allowance could be of the smallest use since labour is not available for production.   The letters received by us amply support this assertion.     These reapers before the
War were generally 8-page sheets, of which one-half consisted of general matter supplied either printed or in stereo- and the rest, local news and advertisements.     xhey are now cut down in size to one-half and little appears in them except the local news and advertisements.     If there is any war news&quot; at all, it usually takes the form of local casualty lists, cancellations of exemption certificates by the local Tribunal, and prosecutions under the Defence of the pLealm regulations.     To these papers, a ready printed sheet containing pictures, a leading article written in simple language, war stories and news cannot fail to be a boon.   These papers have as much right as their larger contemporaries to be considered a part of the Press, and from the point of view of&apos; Propaganda, they are a most important part. If they are not assisted, they are in danger of being starved to death.     There is no other effective form of assistance possible than that adopted by the N.W.A.C., while, from the propaganda point of view, there is no other machinery for getting into the country districts, half so effective.   The Weekly circulation of the War Supplement is now 270,000 copies, and the consumption of paper 4 tons.3a.     We have letters from 37 of the 71 Editors now using the Supplement which abundantly show their opinion of its value.The following are fair specimensGlamorgan County Times.I am sure that you will be pleased to hear that the War Supplement which you supply, is* very much appreciated in this district.   I think it is a very fine idea and I know it is doing a lot of good in the way of causing people to see the War in its true perspective and also in stirring up local patriotism, I don&apos;t think the Press has been sufficiently utilized in connection with this War, and whoever is responsible for the idea of this Supplement, has hit upon a rattling good thing in the way of propaganda.Brecon County Times.We all think the War Supplement a very good thing, and that it does fill a useful place, sent out with such a paper as ours which has a very large number of readers in country districts, who do not see daily or Sunday papers to any extent.   We cannot touch war questions for lack of man power as well as space.Birkenhead Advertiser.Your War Supplement is doing excellent Hational Service in the large portion of Cheshire covered by our three newspapers, as it enables us to give much interesting matter of a national character which we would be unable to find room for otherwise in view of the paper shortage.Oolne &amp; Nelson Times.I must say that I think the Vlar Supplement is of National Service, especially when our ordinary s^ace is so limited, and so many demands -national and local - are made upon it.Shepton Mallet Journal, Wells Reporter.We like the wholesome tone pervading the various subjects treated in last week&apos;s sheet, and the attractive form in which loyalty,patriotism and service are presented.   Circulation of such matter must be beneficial, for it can scarcely reach country
districts such as this in any other way.   Ours is only half of our pre-war sheet and could not possibly give a tithe of that which your Supplement provides.Andover Adve rtiser.   The people in the villages especially have taken to the Supplement.   It supplies items of War interest to those who have husbands or sons at one or ether of the Fronts, that they do not get in Lloyds which is the popular general paper with the country folk.     The Supplement as it now appears fills up a want for the provincial papers.The Hants &amp; Berks Gazette.   We think that the War Supplement answers a most valuable purpose in the dissemination of valuable information of a national character, which otherwise we should be quite unable to givo through lack of space.     In our view, it is of great value in National Service, as great numbers of people in the country district which we serve, do not take daily papers, and the only means they have of becoming acquainted with the War Aims of this Country, is through the medium of the Gazette.The Scarborough Post.   X do not know a better method of -&quot;&quot;getting&quot; at the British public than the one you have adopted.     The central aim is very cruxmAxxgXy camouflaged^- -  the &quot;pill&quot; is daintily sugared, and to my mind, it should be of real nat-Lmal s^rvlc-e.Barrow Guardian.   Viewed from a strictly propaganda proposition, such a sheet is the first really effective step that haB been taken to get right at the workers regularly.     The only fault I have to .md with it, is that it .is two years late.Nuneaton Observer. We have had many commendations of the Supplement, and believe it to be of great value in keeping up the morale of the people. It is supplying a class of news which we were unable to give, owing to our reduced size.Bridlington Chronicle.   We think the War Supplement is excellent.   How that the Weekly Press in the country districts is so handicapped in the matter of men and material,  it cannot give anything like the quantity of War news it used to;   a supplement like this giving a complete, concise and interesting epitome of war news* is decidedly of national importance.     The articles and pictures and also other items appertaining to the War, are very interesting, and will do much to hearten and encourage our readers, who appear to greatly appreciate the Supplements.lorthahta County Press Ltd.     The War Supplement you ars supp.i.y&quot;ing to us is fulfilling a very useful purpose. Several local public men have congratulated us upon what they think 1,3 an excellent production.   In the limits of our greatly reduced paper, we were unable to deal with war a?rl the Supplement furnishes whatwould otherwise ho mi^sxng.     The tone of the Supplement is jit-c &quot;Cijt \5 :io-ie3&apos;ia::-y in this district to put life and energy i-ito the people to help in War work, and from this point of view, it will do a great deal of good.USB BY gGggRJIgi? DEPARTMENTS.The Ministry of Food is already using the War Supplement for the publication of its matter, while
the Ministry of national Service and the Rational War Savings Committee have intimated their intention to do so.   In this way, it is hoped that this publication will assist to co-ordinate the dissemination of information and thus effect a saving in the use of paper.The War Supplement is valuable &quot;because it enables the National War Aims Committee to utilize the agency of the papers supplied with it, for distribution, otherwise a very difficult question in country districts.     Those we reach by its means are the relatives of the men who are fighting in the County Regiments, which are the very backbone of our Armies.PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE PRESS SCHEME.In order that there should be no unfair discrimination between paper and paper the Kational War Aims Committee is prepared to supply every paper which is unable to give an adequate War Sews Service with a Supplement, subject to the limitations of the paper supply;   or similar pictures and articles in blocks and stereo to those papers which would prefer to receive them in this form.THE PRESS SCHEME SAVES PAPER.It should be observed that if all our periodical publications were stopped, it would not result in saving the 13 tons of paper now consumed weekly by their production.     The work would have to be done in another manner. We reach over 1,000,000 readers a week by means of our period-icals, with a varied assortment of matter and without waste. A million pamphlets and leaflets of our average size require about 15 tons of paper.   We submit, therefore, that our Press work tends to economy of paper.Appended is a full list of the papers which take the War Supplement.
