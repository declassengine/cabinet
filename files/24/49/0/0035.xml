FIFTEENTH&apos; REPORT BY THS BOAR17;&apos;0F TRADE fr33i)gfP( \&apos; m IMPORTS MB- IUDDSTST&apos;IN&quot; RJUTIOK TOSHIPPING. . April, 1918.This Report is divided into three parts, (1) a brief account; of imports, entrances and clearances, shipping losses, employment of ships and new construction in the last month for which figures are available, (2) a brief discussion of the new man-power situation in relation to unemployment, and (3j a comment upon exports.A.H.STANHI.23rd April, 1916.I.THEMMm OF MARCH 1918.1. In March total imports into the United Kingdom amounted to 2,772,000 tons, a decrease of 8&amp; on March 1917, and of 2S  on March, 1913.2.       For particular imports the following points may be noted.    In the first quarter of 1918 imports of grain and flour were down 35^ as compared with the same period in 1917:   imports of rav; cotton were 4  down, of wool 2% down, and oi oil seeds 29^ down:   while imports of timber and. of paper making materials respectively, were up by 13f0 and 33 .     Of the minor imports it would seem that rosin is still much below the necessary monthlv minimum.-   Only 2,300 tons were imported in Marcli and 5,bOC tons in the quarter, whereas 5&quot;,000 tons a month was demanded by the Departments concerned.    In considering- the bearing of any comparison between imports in the first; quarter of this year and the first quarter of 1917 it is essential to recollect that imports generally were much affected in that period by the disturbance due to the beginning of the new \ submarine campaign.3.       ^hile imports in March were down 29 , on 1913. the entrances of British and Foreign vessels^with cargo] were down 5G ;   and while imports v;ere down .6^ on 1917 tonnage -entrances were up 11$;.    Thus, as against 193,3 the loading factor is 41  greater and as against 1917 Vty less. v4.       In March, British entrances with cargo (other than requisitioned vessels) amounted to 1,5 7.00C -net tons - 11  more than in March 1917.    In February there had been a percentage fall of 10f0 on 1917.    The March figure is thus a remailcably good one, though it must be rememDered that British entrances in March jl91y were still affected in an abnormal manner by, the beginning of the submarine
campaign.  British clearances (ether than requisitioned vessels) were 995,000 tons - 23j4 less than in inarch 191? compared with a decrease of 17?. in February,  foreign entrances aaaouatedto 327,000 tons, 12% more than in March 1917 - as against a decline of 3;*, in the previous month - and foreign clearances of 677,000 tons, 4% more than in March 1917. &apos; &apos;  15.      In March total losses of British ehip-oing, of over 500 O.T. amounted to 227,000 gross tons of SSicE 198,000 tons were due to war risL    The figures for war losses during January and February were 18o,00u tons and 225,000 tons respectively;   so that the total war losses for the quarter are well under the forecast of 225,OuO tons a month.As regards gains, the position is different. She Viatson-Ulderton estimate of October 30th. 1917 allowed for gains through building at home and purchase of ne*and 162,000 in March.   In spite oi the good March figure the total for the quarter (337,000 tons) falls short of the forecast by 25$.6.      War losses of the Allies (other than British) in March were 84,000 tons as against 55,000 in February and of neutrals 47,000 as against 36,00u in February,Oompariu^ the three months October-December with January-March we find that total world losses have fallen roughly 200,000 tons from 1 147,000 to 945 000 of which the decrease in British Sinkings accounts for almost exactly half.   The percentage of British to total loss has risen from 61^ in February-April 1917 to 64/* in J anuary-March, 1918.7.       On February 28th. - the figure for aiarch31st. is not yet available - as compared with January 31st. the employment of the British Mercantile steam ileet over 500 .50ns nad changed as followsowm m m $mm&quot;&apos;&apos;       %m*Vessels repairing and surveying / 53,000Launched but not completed -  9,000Total of the above / 44,000Army and Navy - 98,000Oolonies        / - 3,000,nussia ,/ K.0O0AlliesPermanently abroad - si GOOOilersHemsinder available for British trade.. , ^other than oilers      f 61,000Total ready for use:- -194,000Grand to tal ;- -15o7ooOIt
It thus appears-that during February in spite of a fall of 194,000 tons in the total of tonnage&quot;fit for service, the part available for U.K. trade has actually risen by 61,000 tons, thanks to&apos; a reduction in the amount employed by the Services and the Allies and the Colonies and in the tonnage permanently abroad.&quot;  This increase of 61;000 tons follows upon an increase of 38,000 tons, which took place during January.   On Feb-ruary 28th. the tonnage of vessels repairing or survey-ing in dry-dock amounted to no less than 841,000 tons.8.The table below gives the absolute and the per-eentage increases and decreases of vessels over 500 tons that nave taken place between February 28th 1917 and February 28th 1918 .in the several employments ofTons     Percentage.Repairing and Surveying I 491,000  -   /  140Launched but not completed      / 215,000&apos;      ?   134 ../ 706,000 &quot;   7&quot;&quot;l3S&quot;&quot;^Army and Navy                        - 736,000 - 17Colonies                               . - 499,000. - 44(Russia - 69,000- - 77 Allies     U.S.A.                     /  10,000(Other                      - 436,000 - 25Permanently abroad                  - 357.000 - 24Oilers                                   /   48,000 / 5Remainder available for U.E.-., trcide other than, oilers       - 802,000 . - 11Total ready for use	.:   -2,791,000	-  16Grand total:-	-2,085,000	-  12These figures cover practically-the. first year of the intensified submarine war, and include vesselsbetween 500 and 1,600 tons as well as vessels over 1,600 tons.    It will be noticed that, owing to theregiifit for service&apos; of as much as 16 .    -Owing to the with-drawal of vessels in the service of the Army and Kavy, Allies, Colonies .and permanent trade abroad,, it has been found possible to keep down the reduction in the tonnage available&apos;&apos; for British trade (other than oilers) to roughly800,000 tons out of a total effective reduction of nearly 2,800.000 tons. ;This reduction of 800,000 is eouivalent to about 11% on a total which already in February 1917  when our comparison begins, was enormously diminished below the figure for normal times.. vij;   &apos;   The following table shows the position of British shipbuilding as reported, during the r/eek ending 4th April 1918:    &quot; -

Of the tonnage of &quot;v,*VCr merchant vessels&quot;, 95,000 tons are ships for carrying mee/i: and fruit. iho total    tonnage under construction is some 22.000 tons less than a month before:   but the tonnage of standard ships has increased by 70,000 tons.During the last week of iiarch 141 merchant vessels of 510,000 tons were being repaired in dry dock, and 234 of 769,000 tons in all were being repaired afloat.   Thus the total tonnage undergoing repair was just over It million gross tons, or nearly the same as a month ago.    This figure does not correspond with that given in the Table g7 and^gS, taken from the Ministry of Shipping Returns, which include, only vessels requiring more serious repair.IIthe mi mt-mim situation and mwEWYmv.In recent months there have been indications that the shortage of raw materials was beginning to threaten certain industries with unemployment.   In s^ite of the large demands for labour in shipbuilding, on the land and elsewhere, people- displaced from their previous occupations were not immediately absorbed.    This was partly because most of the new demand was for strong men while the workpeople displaced were largely women, and partly because many.oi those now&quot;displaced could-Jiot easily move away from the,district in-which they were living.     The position was most serious in the Cotton Industry where special arrangements had to be made for providing a fund for unemployed workpeople by means of a levy on the industry. The Trade Union percentage of unemployment in this industry in January was 9.4, and in February 7.9.     In the woollen and worsted industry a similar, though less tense, situation was met by a general reduction in the hours of labour instead of in the quantity of machinery at work.   In the Jute indus-try at a conference between employers and employees held on February 27th it was agreed that &quot;over and above the reduction in consumption of iut already affected by the stoppage of machinery a further reduction is to be effected by a cessation of work in the spinning mills from 6 p.m. on Friday, of each week to 6.a.m. on the Tuesday following, thus-reducing the working nours-from 55 to 40 per week1&apos;.    In addition to these tendencies m the textile trades the Ministry of Munitions, having agreed to* a diminution in the quantity of materials to be imported for its us3, had dismissed a considerable number of women workpeople and anticipated the need for dismissing others.    The reappearanceunemploymen
unemployment problem, to which these things seemed to be pointing was a serious matter and attention was called to it in previous Beports.     It is desirable to consider in what way it has been affected by the new military situation and its consequences.It does not appear that the Ministry of Munitions will obtain further tonnage for the shipment of munition materials in consequence of what has happened;   but it is probable that they will retain a certain number of women en-gaged in the manufacture of small arms, ammunition whom they might otherwise have dismissed.    This, however, is relative-ly a small matter.    The - strain upon shipping      due to a speed-ing up in the transportation of the American Army to Burope may make more difficult the import of materials generally and so somewhat increase the tendency towards unemployment;   but this too is probably a subordinate influence.    The main change is the decision to&apos; call to the army a greatly increased,, number of men including many men in the later forties,    On the face of things it would seem that the withdrawal of these men from the labour market must go a long way towards counteiv acting any tendency towards unemployment that might otherwise make itself felt;   must act in fact, in the same way that the heavy call to the colours at the beginning of the war acted. Ho doubt it will do this to some extent.    There are, however, several qualifying considerations to be borne in mind.    Pirst at the stage which things have now reached, there is a far smaller proportion of mobile workpeople in industry than there used to be,    Nearly all the young men have already gone from other than war service aid old men can much less readily turn to new jobs.Consequently, even though an opening for work is created at one place and in one occupation to balance e with-drawal of demand at another place and in another occupation, it is likely to prove a slow and difficult business to trans-fer the unemployed men to the unoccupied vacancies.    The difficulty of doing this will not be lessened by arrange-ments for organised short time and special levies to ease the situation of those who find themselves unable to obtain full work.    Secondly, many of the older men on whom the call for military service is now coining will be pivotal men in a stricter sense than many of those who have already gone.    Their departure, unless great care is taken in selection and exemption, may, instead of creating openings for employment, actually make impossible the continuance in work of a number of other people whose employment was dependent on theirs,    Uo doubt, it may prove feasible to leave really pivotal men free from the call to military service, but great care will be necessary. Thirdly and lastly, it has to be remembered that the threatening of unemployment, which has been observed hitherto, affected principally women, and was present in spite of the fact tliat, the demand for the service of strong men was very great.     In view of this experience it would be unsafe to assume that the creation of a further -demand for men by withdrawal to the army will to a large extent bring about the absorption of the unemployed women, though there is   good hope that it will tend in this direction.
