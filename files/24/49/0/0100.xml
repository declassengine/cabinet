[This Document is the Property-of His Britannic Msjesty&apos;s Government.]fl CA6//yPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 191S//SECRET.MINISTRY OF HEALTH BILL.Memorandum by the Minister oe Reconstruction.- 1. I CIRCULATE herewith a draft Bill providing for the establishment of a Ministry of Health for England and Wales.2. This proposal was submitted to the War Cabinet in Lord Rhonrlda&apos;s memorandum (G.T. 361) dated the 27th March, 1917, on &quot; The Urgent Need for a Ministry of Health.&quot; The matter has since that date been continuously under consideration by Ministers and others, and has aroused great public interest. $- 3. On the 11th October, 1917, the Prime Minister received a deputation from representatives of Health Insurance Organisations, introduced by Mr. J. H. Thomas, which urged the establishment of a Ministry of &quot;Health. In replying to the deputation on this point, the Prime Minister emphasised the necessity of making fifll enquiry into the relations between the various Departments concerned before a Bill for the establishment of the Ministry could &quot;be introduced in Parliament.On the ISth October Mr. Bonar Law stated, in reply to a question by Mr. Dillon in the House of Commons, that the various difficulties needing to be provided for in the establishment of a Ministry had not reached any widely agreed solution, and that so long as this was so, it was not possible to undertake to introduce a Bill. He added, however, that steps were being taken which would, it was hoped, secure substantial agreement among those who were actively engaged in the work of National Health.The duty of communicating with the Departments and other bodies concerned was entrusted to me, and I am now in a position to report that substantial agreement with the terms of the draft Bill has been secured between (a.) The Ministers concerned, namely, the Lord President of the Council, the President of the Local Government Board (subject to the reservations stated in paragraph 5 below), the Chairman of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee, the President of the Board of Education, the Secretary for Scotland (subject to paragraph 9 below), the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.(b.) The representatives of the four Associations of Local Authorities, namely, the County Councils&apos; Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Urban District Councils&apos; Association, and the Rural District Councils&apos; Association.(c.) The Special Committee of representatives of Health Insurance organisations, including both Insurance Committees and Approved Societies, formed for the purpose of discussing the establishment of a Ministry of Health. -(d.) The representatives of the British Medical Association, who formed a Ministry of Health Committee to give special consideration to these proposals.4. I believe that there is a widespread recognition of the urgent need for a measure framed, on these lines,  which  will [355]
concentrate in a single central Department the responsibility for the main health services of the country, and will enable further services to be transferred to the Department in due course. Without such a Ministry we are fighting with divided forces against the evils which menace the nation;s health, some of them already upon us, others certain to arise as a result of the War. We have to repair the ravages of battle, and the diminished resistance to disease caused by excessive work and strain among non-combatants; we are faced already by.a grave shortage of hospital accommodation even for men discharged from His Majesty&apos;s forces ; we ought to provide for the harmonious development of extended health services for mothers and infants; we ought to be forearmed against the spread of dysentery and malaria and other diseases which may follow the return on demobilisation of the millions who have been exposed to such infections.5. There are three points of which the War Cabinet should be informed in regard to which reservations have been made by the President of the Local Government Board.   These points are : (a.) The title of the Bill.(6.) The proposal in Clause 4 to establish a Consultative Counciloi the Ministry of Health, (c.) The provision in paragraph 1 of the First Schedule relatingto the Poor Law.6. As to (a), the original title of the Bill was &quot;A Bill for establishing a Ministry of Health and Local Government for England and Wales and for purposes connected therewith.&apos;&apos; It subsequently appeared that the&quot; name &quot; Ministry of Health,&quot; together with the explanatory words now included in the title, would be sufficient for Parliamentary purposes, and on other grounds I would strongly urge that the new Ministry should be known as the Ministry of Health. This view has been pressed upon me both by the British Medical Association and the representatives of Health Insurance organisa-tions, and it is in accordance with the Resolution passed by the Conference of the Labour party held at Nottingham in January. The representatives of local authorities and the President of the Local Government Board would, however, prefer that the Department should be known as the Ministry of Health and Local Government; but Mr. Hayes Fisher does not desire to press the point &quot; if the shorter title will make for peace.&quot;7. As to (6), the establishment of a Consultative Council of the Ministry of Health is an indispensable condition of the agreement of the British Medical Association and the Health Insurance organisa-tions to the Bill. It is regarded by the latter in part as a safeguard compensating for the abolition of Commissionerships in England and Wales; in part as replacing the existing Advisory Committees. The County Councils&apos; Association are also in agreement with the proposal; the other three Associations of local authorities, while they were unwilling to see this provision included in the Bill, recognised that it is essential for the purpose of securing general agreement, and have undertaken not to oppose the provision. The President of the Local Government Board is inclined to doubt whether the clause should be inserted in the Bill as introduced, and has expressed to me some apprehension that the Council may under-mine the responsibility of the Minister. I feel confident, after conducting lengthy negotiations as to the powers and procedure of the Council with many of those who are parties to the agreement as to the Bill, that the clause is necessary and that the Council should be of real value to the Minister of Health. The representatives of local authorities, of the medical profession, and of the Health Insurauce Organisations have all concurred in proposals as to the Councils procedure which will be embodied in an Order in Council and laid before Parliament, so that any objections to its provisions can then be expressed by Parliament and the public.
8. As to (c), I wish to urge upon the War Cabinet that the time has come when the Government should decide to adopt the principles of the report of the Local Government Committee presided over by Sir Donald Maclean (on which Lord George Hamilton, the Chairman of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law, sat), on the transfer of functions of Poor Law authorities in Enorland and Wales, at least so far as health services are concerned. 1 think that the Minister in charge of the Bill should be authorised to state on its introduction that the Government accept the recommendations of the Committee that services relating to the care and treatment of the sick and infirm should not be administered as a part of the Poor Law, but should be made a part of the general health services of the community, and that they regard it as a matter of urgency that effect should be given to these recommendations as soon as possible.I need not enter at length upon the arguments in favour of this course, but there is one point of increasing importance which cannot, I believe, be met unless a decision in this sense is taken without delay. There is throughout the country a most serious shortage of accommodation in institutions for discharged sailors and soldiers who require institutional treatment. The Ministry of Pensions^ have recently been surveying the whole institutional accommodation of the country, and the figures relating to six typical counties, three in the north of an industrial character, and three in the south of a rural character, clearly showed how large a part the Poor Law hospitals played in the general hospital provision of the country, the number of beds in general, special, and cottage hospitals being-only one-sixth of the total. fThe Ministry of Pensions are aware that there is a strung-public feeling against subjecting these men to any taint of pauperism. The suggestion that this can be avoided by the Ministry of Pensions taking over selected Poor Law Hospitals does not seem to me to be adequate to meet the * situation, and I believe that the bolder measure which I would suggest will be generally welcomed.The President of the Local Government Board urges that paragraph L of the First Schedule to the Bill should be omitted on the ground that it will excite controversy ; but I may point out that the publication of the report of Sir Donald Macleans Committee has already excited the apprehension of the Poor Law Authorities, and I do not believe that Parliamentary opposition on their behalf would be so serious that it should for a moment be set against the positive advantages of the policy which I suggest.9. The Secretary for Scotland, while not objecting in principle to the proposals as to Scotland in clause 3, is submitting an alternative proposal for amalgamating the Scottish Local Government Board with the Scottish Insurance Commission, and appointing a Parlia-mentary Uncler-Secretary to the Scottish Office. This proposal seems to me to involve a constitutional change which is not essential to the main purpose of the Bill, and I should prefer to leave the clause as it stands.10. The position, therefore, is that the substantial measure of agreement between those concerned, which was the condition of the introduction of the Ministry of Health Bill, has been - secured, and I submit that the War Cabinet should authorise the introduction of the Bill without delay.C.

Ministry of Health Bill.MEMORANDUM.The Bill consists of nine clauses and three schedules^ and its objects may be briefly summarised as follows :-Clause 1, Clause 2 (1), Eirst Schedule.These clauses provide for the establishment of a Ministry of Health for England and Wales, which from the date of its establishment will&apos; exercise all the powers and duties of the Local Government Board, and of the English and Welsh Insur-ance Commissions (which will cease to exist); also certain powers and duties of the Board of Education in relation to the health of. young children, determined on the lines of the agree-ment made by Mr. Herbert Eisher and. Lord Rhonddaj and the powers and duties of the Privy Council in relation to midwives. ;The Eirst Schedule contains: -(1) A paragraph which has the effect of an undertaking by the Government that any measure of poor laAV reform will, on the one hand, leave those parts of the poor law which are in the nature of general health services within the Ministry of Health, and will, on the other hand, assign the rest of the work included in the term &quot;Poor Law&quot; as Parliament may determine:(2) A paragraph enabling the Medical Research Committee to be re-constituted under the Committee of the Privy Council already constituted for the purposes of Scientific and Industrial Research:(3) A paragraph providing for the future exercise of the judicial powers and duties of the English and Welsh Insurance Commissions, these powers and duties being the matters in which the Commis-sioners are at present not subject to Ministerial directions.Clause 2 (2), (3), (4), (5); Second Schedule.Subclause (2) enables the Minister of Health to take over health powers from other Departments.

Ministry of Health Bill.MEMORANDUM.The Bill consists of nine clauses and three schedules j and its objects may be briefly summarised as follows :-Clause 1, Clause 2 (1), Eirst Schedule.These clauses provide for the establishment of a Ministry of Health for England and Wales, which from the date of its establishment will exercise all the powers and duties of the Local Government Board, and of the English and Welsh Insur-ance Commissions (which will cease to exist); also certain powers and duties of the Board of Education in relation to the health of. young children, determined on the lines of the agree-ment made by Mr. Herbert Eisher and- Lord Rhondda, and the powers and duties of the Privy Council in relation to mid wives.   ;The Eirst Schedule contains :  (1) A paragraph which has the effect of an undertaking by the Government that any measure of poor law reform will, on the one hand, leave those parts of the poor law which are in the nature of general health services within the Ministry of Health, and will, on the other hand, assign the rest of the work included in the term &quot; Poor Law&quot; as Parliament may determine:(2) A paragraph enabling the Medical Research Committee to be re-constituted under the Committee of the Privy Council already constituted for the purposes of Scientific and Industrial Research:(3) A paragraph providing for the future exercise of the judicial powers and duties of the English and Welsh Insurance Commissions, these powers and duties being the matters in which the Commis-sioners are at present not subject to Ministerial directions.   .Clause 2 (2), (3), (4), (5); Second Schedule.Subclause (2) enables the Minister of Health to take over health powers from other Departments.   On the introduction of 3-7 a
the Bill I think that a statement should be presented to Parlia-ment explaining the inconveniences which arise from the present division of health powers between a large number of Departments, and indicating that certain branches of health work, such as the medical treatment of discharged members of H.M. Forces, and the care of the mentally deficient, are particularly suitable for early discussion between the Minister of Health and the Depart-ments at present entrusted with these matters.It would overload the Ministry to transfer these additional duties now. The proposals in the Bill equip the Ministry as the Central Department of Health with wide powers, and the wiser course, I think, is to give it time and opportunity to adjust arrangements for taking over additional duties in the future.Subclause (3) enables the Minister of Health to arrange the transfer of subsidiary parts of his work to other Departments more appropriate to perform them.Subclauses (4) and (5) and the Second Schedule deal with the arrangements for transferring powers to or from the Minister.Clause 3.&apos; This clause provides for the modifications in the present position of the Scottish and Irish Insurance Commissions and of the National Health Insurance Joint Committee which will be necessary on the establishment of the Ministry. The clause is drafted with due regard to the existing position of the members/of these bodies, and it is intended that the relations of the Chairman of the Commissions to their responsible Minister should be maintained.Clause 4.This clause provides for the appointment of a Consultative Council of the Ministry of Health, and follows in principle section 4 of the Board of Education Act, 1899, and section 58 of the National Insurance Act, 1911, under which a Consulta-tiye Committee to the Board of Education, and Advisory Committees on Health Insurance, were established.Clause 5.&apos; ^This&apos; clause makes provision for the establishment of an office of the Ministry of Health in Wales, and for the delegation
of the present powers and duties of the Welsh Insurance Com-missionefs under the National Insurance Acts to the officials of the Ministry in the Principality. A provision of this kind is required in view of the existing position of the Welsh Insurance Commission.Clause 6.This clause provides for the payment to the Minister of Health of an annual salary of 5,000Z. (now provided as the salary of the President of the Local Government Board), and makes other provisions in common form in regard to staff transferred to the Ministry from the Departments mentioned in clause 1, or subsequently employed by the Minister.Clause 7.This clause provides that the Minister of Health shall not have to the seek re-election on his transfer to that office from another office, and makes other provisions in common form for the transaction of the business of the Ministry, including the appointment of one Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry.&quot;Clause 8.This clause provides for the submission of the drafts of any Orders in Council prepared under the Act to both Houses of Parliament, for giving publicity to the drafts, and for the revocation or variation of such Orders.Clause 9.This clause provides for the Act to come into operation at various dates as regards its various purposes, and makes other incidental provisions in common form,C.
