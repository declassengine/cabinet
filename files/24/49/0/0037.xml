(THIS DQQUi&amp;KT. IS TKxj fRQIBBffY Oi? HIS BEITiS E 0 P B T,13S, Ti337,Copy of letter from the 10  rime alnTster-law Room,Dublin Castle.19th April, 19J.8.My dear  rirao Minister,I think it is very neceefg&amp;ry that we should, at the earliest possible moment, have a statement made here as to the methods of application of conscription to Ireland. I know there is a very groat doal of anxiety about it amongst men who are thoroughly loyal and are anxious to serve, but who will have to make family and business arrangements.     Many of them are in middle life; others of * thom are young, but are married and have children, and must make arrangements.livery sort of misrepresentation is, of course, being actively spread in the country, and there are no official statements at present being made which would allay misapprehensions.   If I were permitted, I would take an opportunity af making a War Aims speech hers nor give an interview&quot; within tho next few days stating the linos of the application of the intended Order-in-Council to Ireland.   If the heads of this could bo given, providing that in tho first instance all Englishmen who had come to Ireland since tho war with the intention of evading service should be called up immediately; that secondly, young unmarried men up to 25 would bo called upon, and so on specifying the various grades that may be intended&quot;, and that provision will be made for securing agriculture, food supply, and war work industries from doplotion, it would be a gioat public advantage,   I think that time is urgent in this matter, as, notwithstanding the organised campaign which is now being instituted, there are a very large number of people who will desire to help.   There are also very largo numbers of young men in Government employment here of military age whose places could be very well, filled by women.   X think that an authoritative announcement of the intentions of tho Government would have a very good effect.Sincerely yours,( Signed).ARTHUR 17. SAMUELS.The Rt*Hon, David Lloyd George., i?.C, La.1, r I rime Minister, 10, Downing btreet, London.
