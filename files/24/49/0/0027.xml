The War Cabinet is already aware that the shortage of metallic currency in the possession of the Government of India is the cause of much difficulty and danger.    It has been suggested by the Government of India and also by Lord Reading (whose negotiations in America have been extraordinarily helpful to the Government of India, in currency matters) that sovereigns should be shipped from London or elsewhere to supplement the resources of the   Government of India,   Sovereigns so shipped would be paid . for from the sterling credits at the disposal of the Secretary of State in London,   The India Office is aware of the objections to any such scheme; buts aa important Imperial as well as Indian interests are concerned, it is thought that the decision of the far Cabinet should be obtained.   The main facts are as fellows:-A, It is possible that the Government of India may very shortly or at a later stage have to declare their Currency &amp;otes inconvertible.   On 15th April they had, against a note circulation of  68,000,000, a metallic reserve as follows;-Silver coin and bullion in India-.,.      ... 5,7 00 ,.$00.Silver bullion in America and in transit ,. 2,600,000. Gold (of which  2,867,000 was in fullweight sovereigns) . .*     .15,558,000.gyrsoevooo.During the fortnight ended 15th April the silver and gold which passed from the metallic reserve into the hands cf the public amounted to:-   Rupees  8,840,000, Sovereigns  2-^362,000.     It is obvious that, failing large and rapid replenishment, inconvertibility may at any time become necessary,   The chief ho.pe of replenishment is that, in consequence of American legislation just passeds  30,000,000 in silver may be obtained in the course of the present financial year from the American Government for coinage into rupees.   But, if absorption by the public proceeds at anything like the rate of the last fortnight, even this large help from America would not necessarily enable convertibility to be maintained,B. Additional help in the form of Sovereigns from &quot;London (or from any other part of the British Empire) would lessen, or at least postpone, the risk of inconvertibility and, even if inconvertibility were deolared, would enable some purchases of the first importance to be made nevertheless by payment in metallic currency-    The payments of greatest Imperial importance to be made in  ndia are for exports of commodities required for the purposes of the war, such as wheat, other grains, jute, fodder, timber, tea,  seeds, hides, wool and cotton (for Italy).   The value of such exports has recently averaged about  6,000,000 a month.   The Government of India believe that the purchase of these articles on the scale required for the purposes of the United Kingdom and the Allies may be impossible unless a considerable portion.of the payments is made in metal.    In this belief, they are coining, from the bullion included in thefigures
* &amp; *figures above, gold 15 Rup^e pieces for the purchase of wheat pending the opening of the proposed Branch Mint for the coinage of sovereigns in Bombay *2*     It ia submitted that the War Cabinet should decide whether (1) sovereigns shall be shipped to India from any part of the Empire in which there may be a stock at the disposal of the British Government, (2) a part of the money of the Secretary of State for India at the Bank of England shall be withdrawn in sovereigns for shipment to India by instalments.   It is suggested that, if such action is taken, the amoun$uto be sent to India in sovereigns should not be less than  5,000,000. It is recognised that this would not necessarily suffice to avoid inconvertibility or the reduction of war exports; but it would provide for a substantial mitigation of both risks.It should be mentioned that what is possible in the way of obtaining sovereigns from Australia in exchange for gold bullion for India is already being discussed with the Common-wealth Government, which will no doubt do without farther intervention whatever it can in thJs respect.   What is now suggested ill a net addition (in the form of sovereigns) to the gold at the disposal of the Government of India, not an exchange5.     In view of the possibility that currency difficulties may render impossible in due course purchases in India up to the full requirements of the various Imperial Departments (e.g. Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies., War Office, Ministry o Munitions, Food Controller) the War Cabine-o may wish to order now an investigation as to the reduction which each Department should be called upon to make in its requirements if reduction becomes necessary,India Office.23rd April, 1918-*
