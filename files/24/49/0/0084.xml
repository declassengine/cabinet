I ---:&quot;--------------I enclose for the information of the War Gabinot (l) a copy cf the Regulations and Circular Letter issued to Tribunals in connection with the reosnt Military Service Act, and (8) a copy of the Regulations and Circular Letter issued to Appeal Tribunals in connection with tho recent Proclamation.The principal changes effected by the new Regulations, in addition to the change as to the appointment of Local Tribunals, are that only one original application may in future be made;   that all the grounds on which exemption is claimed must be stated in the one application; that applications may be made to Tribunals only on personal grounds by coal miners, dock workers, munition workers from whom Protection Certificates have been withdrawn, and others for whom these are special arrangements for dealing with their occupational claims;    that exemptions on ths ground of occupation or of serious hardship must not be for more than 6 months;   that generally application for the renewal of certificates may be made only with the leave of the Tribunal and only on one or more of the grounds on which tho previous Certificate was granted;    that professional advocates are not allowed to appear before Tribunals;   and that late applications may he allowed and oases reheard only if the previous consent of the Minister of National.Service has been obtained.     Attested men are placed in the sane position as un&amp;ttested men.Power is taken to appoint special Tribunals and, where desirable, to transfer cases to Appeal Tribunals.Applications for men.now rendered liable to Military Service for the first time are to be made within 7 days of their being medically examined and graded;    or, if they are grade 3 men (whom it is sot at present intended generally to call up for service) within V days of their being called up or of the issue of a publio notice that they are going to be called up,Other provisions have been made in order to accelerate ths decision of cases.The Regulations in connection with the Proclama-tion provide that all applications (not only those of agricultural workers) which are permitted by the Proclama-tion shall be made directly to the Appeal Tribunals.     This provision was made in order that these oases may be decided as quickly a3 possible.W. HAYES FISHER.Local Government Board, Whitehall,39th April, 1918
R. 181.Circular.Appeal Tribunals. Central Tribunal.Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. i.23rd April, 1918.PROCLAMATION WITHDRAWING CERTIFICATESOF  EXEMPTION.Sir,1. I am desired by Mr. Ha3?es Fisher to enclose a copy of a Proclama-tion which has been issued withdrawing certificates of exemption held by men born in the years 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, and 1899, with certain exceptions.&quot;Provision is made in the Proclamation that applications for exemption may be made by certain classes of men coming within the terms of the Proclamation. The classes are specified in the second schedule to the Proclamation and are on the ground of occupation, agricultural workers who comply with certain conditions ; on the ground of serious hardship, the only sons of widows who have lost one or more sons in the present war ; on the ground of conscientious objection, men who hold certificates granted on that ground as well as on the ground of occupation or of hardship.The only men in agriculture whose certificates are withdrawn by the Proclamation are men in medical grade 1 or category A, or men who have not been medically graded or classified.As regards other classes, the Proclamation withdraws the certificates of men in medical grades 1 or 2 or in categories A, B i, B ii, or C i, or men who have not been medically graded or classified.2. It is imperative that any applications made under the Proclama-tion shall be dealt with immediately. Regulations have therefore been prepared (copies are enclosed) under which any application in respect of a man coming within the second schedule of the Proclamation shall be made direct to the appropriate Appeal Tribunal, and shall be dealt with by that Tribunal in the same manner as applications made direct to them.Applications concerning the sons of widows or on the ground of conscientious objection have to be delivered not later than the 8th May next, and concerning agricultural workers not later than the 15th May. Mr. Hayes Fisher hopes that the Appeal Tribunals will make arrangements for deciding any such applications within fourteen days of their receipt. He will be glad to receive not later than the.8th June a statement, respecting the cases in the form which is enclosed.3. It will be observed fromthe second schedule that, in the case of agricultural workers, an application may be made only in respect of a man who establishes to the satisfaction of the County Agricultural Executive Committee that he is a highly skilled agricultural worker, whole-time employed on a farm in farm work, and is irreplaceable and essential to the cultivation of the farm.(e 12441)   WUG13-896   12500   4/18   H&amp;S
An application of this kind will therefore not be valid and should-not be entertained unless it is accompanied by a statement or certificate from the Agricultural Executive Committee that they are satisfied that the&apos; conditions are fulfilled.Directions to the Agricultural Executive Committees will be issued by the Board of Agriculture.As to the interpretation of &quot;whole-time on a farm in farm work&quot; reference may be made to the following quotation from the Memorandum R. 144, of the 24th Jury last: &apos;* - &apos; - &quot; Employment &apos; whole time on a farm on farm work &apos; is intended to cover the production of essential food supplies, and therefore includes the work of men whole time employed on a market garden exclusively in production of food of a kind and quantity of national importance. It is not to include work on a poultry farm or on a market garden for the production of flowers or fruit.&quot;Farm work covers the employment of men in agriculture as thatchers or as drivers of engines or motor tractors (including tractor -   ploughmen); but these men, as others, must comply with the con-- ditions stated above   .   .   .&quot;. . Mr. Hayes Fisher suggests that, as regards the agricultural cases, the Tribunal (a small committee or committees of three to five members will be best) should first go through the cases with the National Service Representative and the Agricultural Representative. It will probably be found that in some cases exemption may be given, with the con-currence of the National Service Representative, without a hearing. In those cases which it is found necessary to hear, notice of hearing should be issued forthwith. No application can be refused without a hearing.   &apos;--4. In dealing with these cases it must be borne in mind that the general rule which the Government have adopted is that the men of the ages and medical standards covered by the Proclamation are to join the Colours ; that an exception to this rule is justified only if it can be shown that special conditions prevail; and that, therefore, it must be shown, in the case of an agricultural worker, that it is clearly in the national interest that he should be allowed to continue in his civil employment, taking due account of all other possible measures for carrying on the work which is done by him, and, in the case of the only son of a widow, that there would be such serious hardship if the man were called to the Colours as to justify an exception to the general rule.I am, Sir,Your obedient servant,H.

R. 184.Circular.Local Tribunals. Appeal Tribunals, f Central Tribunal.Local Government Board,Whitehall, S.W. i.2^th April, 1918.MILITARY SERVICE (No. 2) ACT, 1918.Sir,1. I am desired by Mr. Hayes Fisher to enclose copies of new Regu-lations which have been made in consequence of the passing of the Military Service (No. 2) Act, 1918.Under the new Act men are rendered liable to military service who have attained, or ,do attain, the age of 18 years, and had not, on the 18th April, attained the age of 51 years. For duly qualified medical practitioners the upper limit is 56 years. The limit may also, on an Address by both Houses of Parliament, be raised by Order in Council, generally or for specified classes, but not beyond 56 years.The exceptions to the previous Military Service Acts have been modified. British subjects &quot; resident in Great Britain for the purpose only of their education or for some other special purpose &quot; are no longer excepted; nor are men who have left the Army because they had reached the time for their discharge and had served for 12 years or more and had attained the age of 41 years ; nor are men who have been prisoners of war, captured or interned by the enemy, and have been released or exchanged, except the men who are covered by an undertaking, recognised by the Government and in force, under which released or exchanged prisoners are not to serve with the Forces.Provisions have been inserted excepting disabled men who have been discharged and who, by reason of the Review of Exceptions Act (now repealed), or of pledges given by the Minister of National Service, were not to be called up for service. Men in holy orders and regular ministers of any religious denomination are also excepted.The Act further provides that His Majesty may, by proclamation declaring that a national emergency has arisen, direct the cancelling of any certificates of exemption (other than those expressly and solely granted on the ground of ill-health or infirmity, or of conscientious objection) held by the class or classes of men specified in the proclamation. A copy of a Proclamation made on the 20th April is enclosed, togethei with a copy of the special Regulations relating to applications for exemption expressly permitted by the Proclamation. It is imperative that these applications be decided immediately, and it is provided therefore, that they shall be dealt with directly by the Appeal Tribunals.(b 12422)  Wt. 3775-902  20ir  4/18  E &amp; S
2.. Regulations-Under the Act, regulations for Tribunals in England and Wales are to be made by the Local Government Board. Larger powers are given for making regulations.The members of Local Tribunals in England and Wales are in future to be appointed by the Local Government Board; and the new regulations provide that the existing Tribunals and their members shall be deemed to have been appointed by the Local Government Board. Power is taken to amalgamate the areas of some of the Local Tribunals.Considerable changes of detail are made by the new regulations. The principal object of these changes is to accelerate the decision of cases^ It is imperative that there shall be no break in the flow of men for the Army, and that Tribunals should, therefore, deal with cases with the utmost despatch. Meetings should be arranged as frequently as is necessary for this purpose. A delay of days now may be more serious than a delay of weeks in the earlier stages.Three members are sufficient, for a quorum; and it is generally desirable that a meeting for deciding cases should not consist of more than five members. When Tribunals sit in separate committees or sections there should be special arrangements for securing uniformity of decisions, such as occasional full meetings of the Tribunal for general consideration of questions, and the appointment on more than one committee or section of the same members, who would thus form a bond between the committees or sections ; it is, of course, an advantage if the chairman of the Tribunal can sit on all the committees or sections.The following particulars give information as to the principal provi-sions in the new regulations, which come into force on the 2nd May next. Until then, the existing regulations continue in force, and pending cases should be decided as quickly as possible in accordance with then-pro visions.3. Grounds of Exemption.-The grounds on which exemption may be claimed remain as at present. The need for men, however, is now greater than ever, and the standard must therefore be stricter than ever. This is especially so in the case of men in medical grades 1 or 2 (or categories A, Bi or Ci).In dealing with cases Tribunals should, so far as is possible without delay, proceed on the principle of what is known as &quot; bulk claims &quot;; that is, they should consider together the claims of men in the same industry, trade, business, profession or occupation. In this way cases can be more quickly decided and more uniformity can be obtained, and, not less important, there are better opportunities for pressing forward co-operation and other measures for releasing the largest number of men for the Army.4. Excluded Classes of Applications. As Tribunals are well aware, *here are large classes of men outside the jurisdiction of Tribunals so far- as exemption on occupational grounds is concerned. It is provided in the regulations that, in cases where there are special arrangements for dealing with occupational claims otherwise than through the Tribunals, it shall not be permissible for an application on occupational grounds to be made to a Tribunal. These provisions will apply to coal miners, wrho are dealt with by the Colliery Recruiting Courts ; to tin workers int
Cornwall and the Tavistock Rural District of Devon, who are dealt with by the Metalliferous Mining Court; to dock workers and others who are dealt with by Port Labour Committees at the ports where such com-mittees have been established ; and to men in the service of Government Departments, munition workers and railway workers from whom cer-tificates have been withdrawn.Provision is made by which these men retain the right of applying to a Tribunal on personal grounds.The regulations also set out the restrictions on further applications for men whose certificates have been cancelled, or whose certificates would have been cancelled had the men held such certificates at the time, by an Order issued by the Minister of National Service under the Military Service Act, 1918, or by a proclamation issued under the Military Service (No. 2) Act, 19 r8.Special regulations will be issued relating to applications for qualified medical practitioners ; and the regulations now issued will not apply to any such applications. It is not necessary for any qualified medical practitioner who wishes to claim exemption to take any action until the special regulations are issued.5. Time for Application. It is clearly undesirable, as a rule, that an application should be dealt with until the man has been medically graded. It is therefore provided (subject to the provision mentioned later for men in grade 3) that for men who have not been medically examined before the 2nd May, application may be made not later than the seventh day after that on which they have been medically graded-or, if they have been summoned for medical examination and have failed to appear, not later than the seventh day after the day on which they were summoned to attend.For a man who has already been graded or placed in a medical category before the 2nd May, an application must be made not later than the 16th May (that is, the fourteenth day after the date on which these regulations come into force), or not later than the seventh dajr after the issue to him of a calling up notice, whichever is the earlier date.There is no intention at present of calling up grade 3 men who are rendered liable to military service by the new Act, unless they possess special qualifications for which there is a demand in the Army. There is no reason, therefore, why generally these grade 3 men should apply at present to Tribunals. It is provided that any such man may apply to a Tribunal within seven days of the issue to him of a notice calling him up for service with the Colours, or within seven days of the issue of a public notice by the Minister of National Service stating that men of his class or description will be called up.In order that Tribunals may not have to deal with cases until there is a real prospect of the man&apos;s being called up for service, provision is made that an application for a man who had not been graded, or summoned for examination, before the 2nd May will not be valid if made before the day from which the time limit begins to run ; for instance, in the first case mentioned (the man not medically examined before the 2nd May and later graded 1 or 2) the application must not be made before the day of medical grading or later than the seventh day after that day.In accordance with undertakings which have been given, it is provided that an application (which can be on personal grounds ony) may be
43entertained for a man from whom a Protection Certificate or a Railway Certificate has been withdrawn, not later than the seventh day after individual notice has been sent to him calling him up for service with the Colours. eCertificates held by miners, tin workers and dock workers from the Colliery Recruiting Courts, the Metalliferous Mining Court and the Port Labour Committees, respectively, are certificates of exemption ; and application for their renewal (on personal grounds only) may be made within the time specified for renewals.In future, late applications may be allowed, at the discretion of the Tribunal, only if the previous consent of the Minister of National Sendee or of an official authorised to act on his behalf has been obtained. Tribunals should not, therefore, entertain any request for leave to make a late application unless evidence is produced that the required consent has first been obtained by the applicant.It must be clearly understood that the new regulations do not, except in so far as is expressly specified, confer on any man who was liable to military service before the passing of the recent Act any right to apply for an exemption beyond that which he previously possessed.6. One Original Application. In future only one original application may be made for a man. If, therefore, an employer wishes to claim for a man on occupational grounds and the latter also desires to make a claim on personal grounds, all the grounds must be entered in the one applica-tion.If an application is made on behalf of a man he must also join in it and must sign the form.- 7. Procedure. The general procedure remains the same. The changes which have been made are for securing the speedier decision of cases. Decisions have to be announced orally at the hearing; cases may, of course, be adjourned for sufficient reason, but should always be . decided at the earliest possible time. Notice of appeal from the decision of a Local Tribunal has to be delivered not later than the second day after that on which the case was decided.Any request for leave to appeal from the decision of an Appeal Tribunal has to be made at the hearing; and, if leave is granted, the notice of appeal has to be delivered not later than the second day after the leave is granted.Exceptions may be allowed only with the previous consent of the National Service Representative.The urgent need of deciding cases with the utmost despatch cannot be too strongly emphasised, ^here must be no delay in sending forward appeal cases ; they should be sent within one day of their receipt, and the Clerk or Secretary to the Tribunal should be authorised to state the &quot; reasons &quot; required to be entered on the form.There is a provision that if a Local Tribunal has not decided a case within 12 days of the receipt by them of the statement of the National Service Representative whether he assents or objects to the application (or, in the case of a request for leave to apply for the renewal of a certificate, within 12 days of the receipt of the request), the National Service Repre-sentative may require that the case be transferred to and be determined by the Appeal Tribunal. It has to be remembered that any delay in the deciding of cases is tantamount to a temporary exemption to the man.
It has been decided that applicants may not in future employ professional representatives before Tribunals. Tribunals must be careful to elicit all the relevant facts in each case. If they consider that an applicant cannot state his case fairly, they may allow him to be represented by a relative or other person, but not to be represented professionally. An employer who is applying for a man in his service may be represented by a person in his employment.8. Exemptions. Exemptions may not in future be granted for more than six months, except where the National Service Representative otherwise agrees, and except in the cases of certificates on the ground of ill-health or infirmity or of conscientious objection.In order that cases may be periodically reviewed, it is suggested that as a rule exemption should be for not more than three months, except where a longer period is clearly desirable, as in cases where business arrangements have to be made a long time ahead and a less period than six months might be detrimental to the national interests, or cases where there is no doubt that, unless very exceptional circumstances arise, the exemption will be renewed.The temporary exemption may, and generally should, be conditional as well.9. Volunteer Force. It is important that the new conditions as to joining the Volunteer Force should be well known. Any man exempted by a Tribunal after the 30th April will, unless the Tribunal directs other-wise, be liable to join the Volunteer Force and perform such drills, training and military duties as may be prescribed.Tribunals must carefully consider any request to be relieved of the liability ; and must grant the relief if satisfied that it is unreasonable to require the man to undertake the services prescribed for volunteers, regard being had, for instance, to the nature of his occupation, the lack of facilities, or to some other condition imposed by the Tribunal.The general position, apart from this new provision, remains as stated in the memorandum R. 169, issued in January last. Only men for Section B are required. With the possible exception of some men in grade 3 who may be required for certain specific duties, the men must be up to the medical standard of grade 1 or 2 (or category A, B i or C i). Subject to the foregoing, therefore, men in grade 3 (or category B ii, C ii, B iii or C iii) will not be required, and this must be borne in mind by Tribunals in considering what conditions to impose in any exemption granted to such men.Tribunals may still impose, in the case of grade 1 or 2 (or category A or B i or C i) men as well as others, a, condition such as that the man must become a Special Constable, join a Fire Brigade, or help in the maintenance of the businesses of men who have joined the Forces or in the cultivation of allotments. When any such condition is imposed the Tribunal should obviously at the same time consider whether it is reasonable that the man should also join the Volunteer Force.10. Renewals. On and after the 2nd May, an application for the renewal of an exemption granted by a Tribunal, unless it has been granted on the ground of certified occupation, may be made only if leave is first obtained from the Tribunal which previously decided the case, or, if there was an appeal, the Tribunal which first gave the decision which became
6feffective (for example, the Local Tribunal, if their decision was confirmed by the Appeal Tribunal or, if there was a still further appeal, was confirmed by the Central Tribunal). There is no appeal from the refusal of leave.This provision applies to exemptions granted before the date mentioned, as well as to those subsequently granted.The request for leave to apply for the renewal of a certificate must be made in one of the ordinary application forms. &apos; It must be made (a) where the certificate is temporary, not later than the fourteenth dav before that on which it will expire ; (b) where the exemption is conditional and terminates because the condition is no longer fulfilled, or where it terminates because of an alteration in the- List of Certified Occupations, not later than the fourth day after that on which the exemption ceases to be in force. If a case should come under both (a) and (b) because the certificate is both temporary and conditional, the earlier date is that which counts.Another important provision is that an application for the renewal of a certificate granted or renewed on an application made on or after the 2nd May cannot be entertained (except with the consent of the National Service Representative), unless it is made on one or more of the grounds on which the certificate was granted or renewed. A man cannot, for instance, obtain exemption on the ground of his employment only, and&apos; then later apply for a renewal on the ground of serious hardship; he must disclose all his grounds in the application first made on or after the 2nd May (whether an original application or an application for renewal), and the Tribunal must consider and decide on all the grounds.It is most important, therefore, that care should be taken to enter all the grounds on which a certificate is granted (granted, not claimed) in the certificate of exemption.The restriction as to the grounds on which an application for a renewal may be made does not apply to an application concerning a man whose last certificate was granted on&apos; the ground of certified occupation or through a Colliery Recruiting Court, the Metalliferous Mining Court or a Port Labour Committee, or otherwise by a Government Department, or under the special schemes applicable to munition workers and railwaymen.Exemptions should be so timed that, so far as possible, the cases of men in the same industry, trade, business, profession or occupation, may be dealt with together on renewal just as on original applications.n. Subjects of Allied States, &amp;c. Applications for men liable to military service by virtue of the Military Service (Conventions with Allied States) Act, 1917, will be dealt with in the same way as applications for British subjects.It is to be noted that, for these men, original applications must be made before the thirtieth day after the date on which they come within the operation of the Military Service Acts, 1916 to 1918, or such other time (which would be communicated to Tribunals in due course) as may foi particular cases be specified by Order in Council.The Special Local Tribunal for London is retained.12. Rehearing of Cases. In future, cases may be reheard only if the consent of the Minister of National Service has first been obtained.
Application for that consent should be made by the party to the Director of National Service for the region, and should be accompanied by an ordinary application form duly completed. This provision should prevent Tribunals from being burdened with requests for rehearing for which there is no genuine justification.As with late applications, Tribunals should not deal with any request for the rehearing of a case unless the consent of the Minister of National Service has already been obtained by the applicant.13. Forms. Copies of a new form of application are enclosed, and of another form which has been prepared for the use of Tribunals. The principal facts as to the regulations which should be known by the applicant are set out on the form of application so that he may not be under any misapprehension as to his position.- Additional copies of the forms may be obtained on requisition from His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, Under-wood Street, London, N.i.A copy is also enclosed of a monthly statistical return, to be sent to the Local Government Board in the first week of the month succeeding that to which the statistics relate. The first return should be made for the month of May. A copy of this form will be sent to each Tribunal towards the close of each month, with a duplicate form for the use of the Tribunal; the information is such as is desirable for their work.14. Attested Men. The provisions of the regulations apply to attested men in the same manner as to unattested men.15. The alterations which are effected by the new regulations have been made in order the better to deal with the new conditions with which the country is now faced. The great struggle for democratic liberty has reached a critical stage. Our men in the field are making superlative efforts. Those who still remain at home must be ready with their full support, in men and material. Sacrifices greater than those hitherto undergone must be willingly endured if the supreme efforts of the enemy are to be defeated. It is for the Tribunals to deal with cases in the light of these conditions, looking steadfastly to the best national interests in these days of trial.Mr. Hayes Fisher would wish again, now that large changes are being made, to express the indebtedness of the country to the public-spirited work which has been done by members of Tribunals, work of great difficulty and responsibility, and often done under difficult con-ditions.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.
