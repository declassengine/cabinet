9   (lr-ia196Confidential,15HALI^^B0UE POSITION IN MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(24th April 1918.)I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.I.-STRIKES. Statistics of Strikes for the Week ending the 17th April.During the week ending the 17th April, 3,267 working days-or gVth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time were lost through strikes on munition work. The figures are almost identical with those of the preceding week. On the 17th April, no munition workers out of some 2-h millions employed under the Ministry of Munitions were on strike as compared with 620 on the 10th April.At the present crisis in the country&apos;s fortunes, the labour situation is very satisfactory. *II.-RECRUITING PROM MUNITION INDUSTRIES.In consequence of the decision of the War Cabinet to make a &quot; clean cut&quot;  or, at all events, as clean a cut as possible of fit men under the age of 231, a^ present working in the munition industries, with a view to their enrolment in the army, fresh machinery is being set up by the Ministry of Munitions to facilitate the selection and calling-up of these men.Men of these ages, with the exception of certain men in shipyards, shale oil mines and works who are still exempt, were of course already subject to recruiting under the Revised Schedule of Protected Occupations. Instructions are being sent to munitions area dilution officers to call up men of these ages by the prescribed dates (the 17th May for men born in 1898 or 1899, and the 17th June for men born in 1895, 1896, or 1897). Firms where recruiting is controlled by the Ministry of Munitions are being warned of the increased stringency of recruiting for men of these ages, and instructed, if they wish to apply for a temporary post-ponement of the calling up of any pivotal men on the more urgent kinds of war-work, to send with their application evidence as to the possibility of replacing them by women or ineligible men, by skilled men at present engaged on other work, or by other re-arrangement of work. Cases where the Ministry of Munitions exercise the discretion as to the temporary retention of men of these ages which has been given them by the War Cabinet, will be subject to review by a Committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Service, the War Office, and the Ministry of Munitions.The following are the figures of releases to the colours authorised for the last twTo weeks from firms where the recruiting is controlled by the Ministry of Munitions: Week ending the 12th April 1918 - 8,950Week ending the 19th April 1918 - 8,445III-SHEET-METAL WORK  ON AEROPLANES.With the advance towards standardization in aeroplane work, it is becoming possible to rely more on machinery and to reduce largely the number of hand processes. If the work is sectionalised, women will be able, after a course of training, to undertake many operations of a nature hitherto not performed by them. Employers have been favourably impressed by specimens of sheet-metal work done by women at the instructional factories of the Ministry, and are unlikely to raise any objection tou   (33)5662 .Pk 20   125   4/1S   E&amp;S
engaging women for this work. Two difficulties which remain to be dealt wirh are the opposition of the male workers to dilution, and the determination of the wages to be paid to women. No trade union has opposed dilution more steadily than that of the sheet-metal workers, but they do not object to the employment of women on machines, as distinct from hand-work. If, therefore, designs can be varied so as to put a greatly increased quantity of work on machines the opposition will to this extent be circumvented. Wage rates for women on sheet-metal work are to be provided for in a new Consolidated Order relating to women&apos;s wages which is now in preparation,
