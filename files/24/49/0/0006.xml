a-MOBILITY OF MUNITIONS LABOUR..which I desire to draw immediate attention.Since May last we have released from munitions for the army over .100,000 men; from the 1st January to the 13th April we have released in round figures 50,000 men, and we are endeavouring so to arrange the continuance of the release of munition workers as to comply with the War Cabinet instruction to release in all 95,000 between the 1st January and the end of June. 1 must.point out how very serious this drain is. Hitherto it has not prevented us from meeting all requirements, greatly though these have been expanded. But the effect of the withdrawal of skilled and efficient man-power is cumulative and progressive. We have had very heavy losses in material, which may conceivably be repeated. With every desire to help the army by releasing men, I now watch with some anxiety the effect of releases.If we are to succeed, as we hope to, in the double task of releasing the full quantity of men for the army and maintaining an ample supply of munitions, it is indispensable that without delay our powers over the remaining skilled labour should be sensibly increased. 1 propose practically to .urge every necessary workman to become either a War Munitions Volunteer or a War Work Volunteer in order to secure the greatest mobility to the remnant of labour which is left. This will enabie us to use our attenuated labour fund to the best possible effect, and to enforce dilution uniformly over the whole area. If a man will not become a War Munitions Volunteer he will be considered less indispensable and have more chance of having his protection removed. I propose, if the Cabinet, approve, to announce this in my speech on Thursday, as it is necessary that whatever action should be taken should be taken at once and &apos;&quot; while the iron is hot.&quot; The Trade Unions Advisory Committee, with whom I have discussed this matter, fully recognise the necessity for action of this kind, as will be seen from their resolution. On the other hand, care must be taken so far as possible to avoid the appearance of &quot; industrial conscription.&quot; A Cabinet decision on Tuesday or Wednesday is desired.WINSTON S.CHURCHILL.April 21, 1918.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]SECRET.MOBILITY OF MUNITIONS LABOUR.Minister,1. I HAVE recently laid before you a proposal which the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions had considered and discussed with the Ministry of Labour, and which, in their opinion, was necessary in view of to-day&apos;s position as to recruiting for the army.2. The proposal was that the trade unions should be asked to assist the Govern-ment in securing a wide extension of enrolments under the War Munitions Volunteer scheme, for it is essential not only that the mobility of the labour remaining in munitions factories should be increased, but that there should be a means of securing that labour when once placed on war work of extreme importance remains there. The Department also suggested that if on investigation of the labour in any firm it &quot; was found that workmen are surplus to the establishment, or their skill is not being fully utilised, or if, on other general grounds, their services were more urgently required elsewhere, and the men in question were not War Munitions Volunteers, they should be required to enrol as War Munitions Volunteers, with the alternative, if they refused, of being recruited if of military age, or of being dismissed if over military age. On the employers&apos; side, a very free use would be made of Defence of the Realm Regulation S, so that the employment of labour could be regulated and restricted in- any establishment, district, or generally in short, a comprehensive system of rationing labour of important types, of which there is a shortage, and of regulating and restricting the engagement of labour by firms who are using labour uneconomically. It should be noted that a scheme of this character is now being put into operation in regard to the sheet metal workers in the aircraft industry in the London district.3. The Trade Union Advisory Committee attached to the Ministry of Munitions were called together, and you explained to them very fully the present position on the Western Front and the country&apos;s urgent need in regard to man-power and the continued production of munitions. Having discussed these aspects of the situation, you then left it to me to explain to the Committee the proposals which the Department had made to you without in any way committing either the Government or yourself to the policy suggested.4. The meeting was of the most satisfactory nature, and the Advisory Committee passed the following resolution : &quot; That this Committee of Trade Union officials advising the Minister of Munitions, after hearing from Mr. Churchill a statement on the present military situation, and the consequent call on man-power both for the Army and Munitions industry, and particularly the following proposals: that in order to fill the gaps which will be created by the new and pressing call for recruits for the army steps must immediately be taken by the Government largely to increase the mobility of the men remaining available for the Munitions industry, with a view to securing that every man is used to the best possible national purpose, and that output so far from suffering be actually increased in spite of recruiting recognise that the Government have no alternative but immediately to prepare and submit a scheme which will achieve these purposes.&quot;5. The Committee then considered the Departments proposal, and a further resolution was passed : &quot; That this Committee, while not committing itself to an)?- details in the proposals outlined, agrees that the present position necessitates some such proposals being put into effect.&quot;6. In the course of the afternoon&apos;s discussion, the general concensus of opinion was that the Government should take immediate action to meet their needs.[408-1]
27. In view of these resolutions, I suggest that a communication should be made to the press and the widest possible publicity given to the Governments wishes and intentions in this matter, and I think it very necessary that the least possible delay should be allowed to occur, for not only do I feel that the measure proposed is essential if the armies in the field are to continue to be as well equipped as in the past, but I am also convinced that the moment is an ideal one for obtaining an immediate response from labour in this country.S. The communication I have in mind should, I think, run somewhat on the following lines: -&quot; The Army must be furnished both with man-power lit to stand in the battle front and with all the equipment and munitions of war. The necessity of releasing the greatest possible number of all those young men who have been assisting to produce munitions, which they will now be required to employ against the enemy, is paramount. Both employers and labour in the workshops must immediately take steps so to rearrange production as to ensure that output so far from diminishing is actually increased wherever increase is necessary.&quot; The Government appeal to (call upon) trade unionists and labour throughout the country, irrespective of age, to enrol as War Munitions Volunteers or War Work Volunteers, in such classes and for such work as may be needed, and as and when they are required to do so.&quot; If the continued, and in certain classes increased, production of munitions is to be obtained, the labour remaining on munitions work must be so mobile that it can be moved to the most urgent war work as the need of the Army may disclose from time to time, and when placed on this work stay there till such time as they may be required to transfer their services elsewhere. The Government have instructed their responsible officers that in allocating man-power as between the Army and munitions production, regard shall be had to whether the individual man has placed himself unreservedly at the disposal of the State.&quot; Employers wall be required to use in the most economic manner possible the skilled labour and man-power generally in their establishments, and the Government will use the powers they possess to prevent the uneconomic use of labour at a time like the present.&quot;S.
