(This Document is the property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government). RET 0 0,1 O T.Q,63(25). HOME AFFAIRS OOMMITTEE.SPT/TMAj^jiMemorandum by the Hone Secretary.HISTORY^In JJ?22 Sir Robert Newman introduced a Bill on this subject which contained certain objectionable features.      This Bill was read a second time.      The promoters agreed not to proceed with the Bill on Mr. Secretary Shortt undertaking to introduce a Government Bill..     This was done,  but it was too late for progress to be made.1^1925 Sir Robert Newman introduced a Bill in consulta-tion with the Home Office.      It passed the House of Commons--aand was read a first time in the House of Lords.      The Autumn dissolution prevented further progress.1.^1924 Sir Robert Newman again by arrangement introduced the Bill.      It passed the House of Commons in the course of which it was adopted by the Government and it passed the House of Lords.      The sudden Autumn dissolution prevented the House of Commons considering certain Government amendments made in the House of Lords,In the King&apos;s Speech last December,  legislation was promised.OBJECTS^The object of the Bill is to amend in certain respects the law relating to Maintenance and Separation Orders for married women made by Courts of Summary Jurisdiction.      The present Bill follows substantially the form which last year&apos;s Bill passed the   House of Lords, with the addition of a provision which has been inserted at the request of the National
Union of Societies for equal citizenship    that either a married woman or her husband may obtain an ordor against the other on the ground of persistent cruelty to the children. So far as applications by the wife are concerned this appears rather an extension of an existing principle than as a new principle since Courts have sometimes considered a husband&apos;s cruelty to the children as amounting to cruelty to the wife, which is already a ground for an ordor.lLajj.se.-i. abolishes the requirement that a married woman shall have left her husband before she applies for an Order on the ground of persistent cruelty or wilful neglect by her husband.      Tho Clause provides that an Order shall remain suspended so long as the married woman voluntarily resides with her husband.The Clause enacts two fresh grounds upon whioh an Order can be obtained, namely,   (i) the ground that the husband hasffi;: compelled the wife to submit herself to prostitution,  or has been guilty of such conduct as was likely to result, and has resulted,  in her so submitting herself, and (ii) the ground that the other party to tho marriage has been guilty of persistent cruelty to the children.Clause 2 alters the existing law under which a husband is entitled to have an Order discharged on proof that his wife has,  sutsequent to the making of the Order,  committed adultery by providing that if the adultery has been conduced to by his wilful failure to support his wife in accordance with the Order,  the Court may decline to discharge the Order.    The Clause allows the Court on discharging an Order for wife&apos; maintenance on the ground of adultery to make a fresh Order for payment towards the maintenance of the children of the marriage.Clause. 5 allows an Order to be obtained by a husband or wife against the other if she, or he,  is addicted to taking drugs within the meaning of the Dangerous Drugs Act,  i.e. habit forming drugs.      In other words the Clause extends the
Home Office,6th February,   1925.040-42existing provisions as to habitual drunkenness to include the habitual taking of dangerous drugs.Clauses 4 and 5 facilitate the means of enforcing orders. They are based on provisions in other Statutes.GENERAL^This Bill is desired specially by women,  it is non-controversial and non-party.      Certain organisations would no doubt desire the Bill extended, but it is not likely that they will press for any such extensions.W.J.H.
