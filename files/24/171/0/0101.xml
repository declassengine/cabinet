ELECTORSNote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Minute by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in regard to a proposal for a single Annual Register of Electors,      The case for effecting the saving involved is,  I think, a strong one and I therefore ask for a decision of the Cabinet in favour of the change.F.S.C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 18th.February, 1925.1 i
Chancellor of the Exchequer.I think we ought to obtain a decision of the Cabinet on the policy of introducing legislation to authorise the preparation of a single annual Register of electors in place of the two half-yearly Registers aA memorandum (CP. 10 (23)) dealing with this question was circulated to the last Conservative Cabinet on 10th January, 1923, together with the draft of a Bill embodying the single annual Register proposal; but, the Cabinet decided that the financial and other advantages to he obtained from the enaciment of the Measure were not sufficient to compensate for the opposition that would be aroused.It is estimated that the suppression of the Spring Register would now effect an annual saving of either  223,000 or  171,500 according to whether the present system of &quot;electors lists&quot; is continued or whether the more costly method of printing complete provisional Registers before the final Registers are issued,  is reverted to.    The saving would be shared equally between the Exchequer and Local Authorities and the latter would,  in these oircumstances, probably give the proposal their strong support.It should be noted that the Act of 1918 whioh introduced the two half-yearly Registers also trebled the electorate.    The value of each vote was therefore deoreased proportionally and there seems to be even less reason than with the former small electorate to spend so much money on continually changing lists.    If the suggestion which has been made to extend the franchise to women of 21 and over is translated into law the proportionate value of the vote
would be still further reduced; but the cost of preparing theRegister and the corresponding saving to be effected by the suppression of the Spring Register would be proportionallyincreased. &quot;It is interesting to note that there has been no general Election since 1900 between 15th April and 15th October which is the period covered by the Spring Register and that thelocal Government Elections all fall during the period of the Autumn Register,.The Conservative Central Office are in favour of thochange and express the opinion that the suppression of the Spring Register would give no advantage to any Political Party. It is understood, however, that Liberal and labour opposition may be aroused, especially from their party organisations..Such objection could probably be to some extent countered by a further proposal which has been put forward by the Conservative Central Office to shorten the qualifying period from six months to three months and to mitigate to that extent any hardship caused to electors by their having to wait an unduly long time before inclusion in the rogister.At present an elector who came of age on 16th December,  1924, has to wait for his qualification until the six months period beginning 15th June,  1925, and finds his name on the register which comes into force on 15th April, 1926, a total delay of 16 months.With only one register and a six months qualification he would have to wait until 15th October, 1926, a total delay of 22 months.to a. A three months qualification would reduce this maximum/ maximum delay of 19 months  (16th March, 1925, to 15th October, 1926).      At the other end the minimum period for a voter coming
R 0 8on to the register would he reduced from 10 months (from 15th December,  1924, to 15th October,  1925) under the present law, to 7 months  (15th March to 15th October) under a three months qualification.Whereas therefore the suppression of one register without altering the qualifying period would only lengthen the waiting period,  if the two changes were made together there would be no average increase of delay for though there would be a possible lengthening &quot;by three months at one end of the scale there would be an equivalent shortening by three months at the other.I should add that advantage might be taken of a Bill as now proposed to remedy certain small defects of administrative machinery which have developed in the working of the Representation of the People Act,  1918*W.G.
