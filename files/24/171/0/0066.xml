ffl^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,SECRET. I      S 9.P. 65  (25).CABINET. Export of Arms and Ammunition. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.With reference to Cabinet 1(25) Conclusion 10,  I circulate herewith to my colleagues a Memorandum explaining the present practice in regard to the export of arms and ammunition.P.C.-L. &quot;*Board of Trade,5th February,  1925.
Memorandum regarding the Export of Arms and Ammunition from Great Britain&quot;and Northern Ireland.Tho export of arms and ammunition from this oountry is roatrioted under tho powers given by the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, as amended by the Finance Act, 1921. Section 8 of the formor provides &quot;that the following goods may., by Proclamation or Order in Counoil, be prohibited either to be exported or carried ooaatwisos-   Arms, ammunition and gunpowder, military and naval stores, and any articles whioh His Majesty shall judge oapable of being converted into or made useful in inoreasing the quantity of military or naval stores, provisions, or any sort of viotual whioh may be used as food for man&quot;.    This Is extended by Seotion 17 of the Finance Act, 1921 to cover weapons and munitions of war of overy description, firearms not being weapons of war and ammunition for suoh firearms, and also shipments of such material as ships&apos; stores.The last Order in Council under the above Acts was issued on the 13th December, 1921, and is known as &quot;The Arms ExportiProhibition Order, 1921&quot;.The Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1921,  (see Annex I)prohibits the export from the United Kingdom of the followings-i.    Cannon and other ordnance and component parts the roof;ii.    Carriages and mountings for oannon and other ordnahoo and component parts thereof;iii.   Cartridges, charges of all kinds, and component parts thereof;iv.   Explosives (with oertain oxceptions).v.   Firearms of every description and component parts thereof;vi.   Grenades and component parts thereof;vii.   Machine guns, interruptor gears, mountings for machine guns and oomponont parts thereof;
vili.     Projectiles of all kinds (except air-gun pellets) and component parts thereof;lx.     Mines, land or sea, and component parts thereof;x.     Depth charges and component parts thereof;xi.     Bombs, bombing apparatus, and component parts thereof;xii.     Flame-throwers and component parts thereof;xili.     Fuses  (other than safety fuses) and component parts thereof;xlv.     Torpedoes and component parts thereof;xv.      Torpedo tubes, or other apparatus for discharging torpedoes.The Order does not at present Include many-articles, whlph are essential in war, and in particular does not Include aeroplanes or aero engines.     It will however be observed that It covers the export of machine gun mountings for machine guns, bombs and bombing apparatus etc. which distinguish aircraft for military use from those for civil use.The Order provides, however, that arms andvammunition etc., may be exported where the export or shipment is expressly permitted by a licence given by the Board of Trade,  and Is in accordance with the conditions (if any) of such licence. An open General Licence (see Annex II) has been issued authorising the export of smooth bore shot guns and ammunition for use there -with to destinations not included in the &quot;prohibited areas&quot; men-tioned in Article 6 of the Arms Traffic Convention of St. Germain-en-Laye, and these weapons may therefore be exported to most countries without specific licences being obtained in each case.The Board of Trade receive normally between 200 and 300 applications for export licences per week, and these applications may be divided broadly into four categories.Personal Lug^ap;e Cases.These are cases where an applicant about to proceed abroaddesires to take with him his revolver, pistol or a sportingrifle or two,  and a small quantity of ammunition for protectionor for sporting purposes.      In-these cases export llcenoes are issued on production of the applioant&apos;s authority under the- 2 -
seeFirearms Act, 3.921, for possession of the weapons in this country. There are also similar cases where it is desired to purchase a revolver er sporting rifle and ammunition to take abroad.     The applicant does not desire to hold the weapons in this country and an arrangement has  therefore been made with the Home Office by which instead of insisting on production of the police authority for possession the Board issue licences on production of evidence that the applicant is proceeding abroad within a fortnight.     Such evidence usually takes  the form of a passage ticket. Small Trade Applications.These comprise small consignments of revolvers, rifles and ammunition, etc., from gun manufacturers and dealers in Britain and Northern Ireland to private individuals or traders in the Colonies and in foreign countries.     It is however convenient to include in this category a few applications which are received for the export of considerable quantities of revolver and rifle ammunition to private dealers in the Colonies.    Careful consideration is given to each application and in doubtful cases the F oreign Office, and the appropriate Service Department, are consulted as to whether the proposed export is regarded as likely to cause embarrassment to His Majesty&apos;s Government or is contrary to any international or other agreement by which His Majesty&apos;a Government are bound not to export arms to the destination in question. Further in cases where the Colonies or India may be affected by the proposed export,  the application is submitted to the Colonial Office and India Office for their observations. But these applications are generally granted provided the applicant is authorised by the Police to deal in arms.Colonial Government, etc. Transactions.Applications are also received from the Crown Agents for the Colonies, the High Commissioners for South Africa, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and Australia, and the Inspecting Engineer for the Egyptian and Sudan Governments.      These applications are frequently in respect of large&quot; quantities of munitions  (cannon,
machine guns, rifles, revolvers, eto.) arid the material is generally obtained from the War Office and always consigned to the Colonial Government concerned.   Licences in these oases are issued without referenoe to other Departments. 4*       Large Trade Applications.Although comparatively few in number these are, of course, the most important and comprise large quantities of all kinds of munitions generally destined for a foreign Government either direct or through an agent.   This category includes stocks of surplus war material sold by the Government department concerned to dealers who desire to dispose of the material abroad.   In all these oases, the application is referred, to the Foreign Offioe and the appropriate Service Department (e.g. the Air Ministry whioh examines applications for material special to military aircraft from the point of view of the secrecy of the inventions embodied in such material) and sometimes to the Colonial Offioe and India Offioe.    Under an arrangement made by the Home Offioe the special branch of the Metropolitan Police is also occasionally consulted,.   The Foroign Offioe not only advises whether there Is any political objection to the proposed export, but in doubtful oasest verifies the country of destination by communication with the Embassy or Logation of the^foreign country oonoerned.   If objection to the proposed export is raised by these Departments, the liaenoe Is refused.    There are certain destinations such as Russia and China to whioh it has been decided that the export of arms cannot be permitted at the present time, and applications in respect of those destinations - are of course refused forthwith.Lloenoes are also being refused at present for
Oilexports to the Hejaz, as the government of that oountry is not in a position to give the guarantees required by the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919.In the oase of Abyssinia the Foreign Office have been endeavouring for some years to obtain French and Italian co- . operation in order to prevent the importation of arms into that country, or at least to limit it to a small annual ration.   All licences to import arms from Great Britain to Abyssinia are refused in pursuance of this policy.    On the -occasion of Ras Taffari&apos;s visit last summer a licence was issued by way of exception for one hundred rifles for His Imperial Highness&apos; personal bodyguard after the concurrence in this course of both the French and Italian Governments had been obtained.The War Office in considering applications whioh are referred to them recommend the refusal of export licences where it appears that the munitions in question are such as eithert-(a) may reveal some new design whioh it is desiredto keep seoret from foreign powers? cabinet(b) may conceivably be used against British troopsin the future.In coming to a deoision in the latter case, the fact that, if a British firm is refused an export licence, munitions of the same kind can be obtained without difficulty on the Continent, is taken into consideration.   Moreover, if the War Office feel any doubt as to the real destination of the arms they ask the Foreign Office to make enquiries.- .^Eaoh applicant for an export licence is required to oomplete a form (see Annex III) furnishing the name and address of consignor and consignee, the prospective date of shipment and a full description of the goods.   He is also required to sign an undertaking that the particulars given are correct, that the licence if granted will be used for the export of goods which are his own property or the property of a firm, eto., for whom he is authorised to aot in the transaction concerned as the sole responsible
representative, and that If 00 required by tho Customs Authorities ho will produce to them within such time as thoy may.allow4proof that the goods were duly delivered at the destination named on the licence.Licences are valid for a period of three months, but It is the praotioe of tho Department to renew licences for further periods of throe months in oasos where the goods are not ready for shipment in time provided that there has been no change in Government policy in the meantime, and that conditions in the oountry of destination remain the same.licences are issued subjeot to three conditions.   The first two relate to the condition referred to above, that the owner or shipper of the goods must, if required, produce satisfactory evidenoe that the goods have reaohed the destination named on the licence.   The other**oonditlon is that the licence (see Annex IV) may be modified or revoked at any time by the Board of Trade without reason given.of Trade. 4th February,  1925.
