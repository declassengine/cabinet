THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 government cabinet. HOME AFFAIRS COMHTtEE. HOUSING- (SCOTLAND) BILL. Memorandum by tho Secretary for Scotland.I d03i.ro authority to have introduced in the House of. Lords at the earliest possible date this Bill which consolidates the permanent, law relating-, to Housing in Scbtland.     The Bill was before Parliament last year and was only prevented from becoming law by the dissolution.The Bill is idontical with the Bill which, after consideration  by tho Joint Select Committee on Consolidation Bills, passed through the House of Lords last year and was road a first time in the House of Commons, except for the omission of one Clause which is now unnecessary -in con-sequence of the abolition of inhabited house duty by the Finance Act, 1924, and for the addition of a now Clause which is necessary to give effect to Section 12 of and tho Second Schedule to the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, enabling local authorities to make advances, etc., to promote building houses-   these powers were first given by the Housing Act, 1923, for a limited period only, but were made permanent by the Act of 1924 after the Consolidation Bill had left the House of Lords.It is thought that the Bill will not reauiro to be referred to the Joint Select Committee on Consolidation Bills but I propose to consult with Lord Muir Mackenzie, the Chairman of the Committee upon the matter.I am anxious that the Bill should come into operation not later than 1st July next.The present position of the Housing Acts is to say the least very complicated.     It is in the interests of local authorities and others concerned that the Consolidation Bill should come into effect as soon as reasonably possible.The Bill is on substantially similar lines te the Housing Bill which I understand tne Minister of Health desires authority to introduce.-   (Sd.)   JOHN GILMOUR.SECRET,CP. 85 ( 25).
