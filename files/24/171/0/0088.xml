BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHINGTON.PRIVATE.Deoember 22nd 1924.My dear Chamberlain,I had two nights ago a long and rather interesting talk with the Secretary of the Navy in which he confirmed and extended what Mr- Hughes had already)! told me, as reported in my despatch No0 1879 of the 18th instant, that the President was most anxious end eager to cut down expen-diture on naval armaments as far as possibles    I understand that this i3 also the temper of Congress.    At the same time Mr. Wilbur said that they all felt that it was necessary to keep up to the 5-5-3 standard laid down by the Treaty of Washington, not only as regards capital ships but also as regards all other branches of the service.    He spoke particularly about the great expense that would be incurred if they were to carry out the programme of building twenty-two modern scout cruisers which he declared were required in order to bring the American fleet in this respect up to the standard of the British fleet.    He estimated the total cost at something like $ 350,000,000 and, as I have already reported, the Bill H.R.8687 for eight new oruisers of this type costing $ 16,500,000 apieoe, totalling 4 132,000,000, is already before the House. Mr. Wilbur appeared to be of the opinion that the number of scout oruisers, also of T.B.D&apos;s was largely dependent on the number of the larger type of ocean-going submarines, and that if the number of these latter could be reduced. It might also be possible to limit expenditures on the other types.From what Mr. Wilbur told me I feel certain that the President is anxious in the interests of economy, whioh seems to be his particular, aim at the present moment, to
out down this naval expenditure if it can possibly be done. His Congressional message and his speech at the Dridiron Club, reported in my telegram No. 374 of December 14th, together with what Mr. Hughes and Mr, Wilbur have told me, all point in the direction of his wishing to call a Conference for naval disarmament in the near future.    I presume that we should be perfectly willing to accept an invitation to such a Conference, especially if it was to limit the number of submarines.One of the principal difficulties, however, In the way of making such a Conference successful is the present temper of Japan.    I think it unlikely that the American Government will give up their Pacific manoeuvres on acoount of the ill-temper displayed on account of these manoeuvres by the Japnese Press, but I feel pretty certain that the very   unusual communication to the Press made by Mr. Hughes in welcoming the newly appointed Japanese Minister, Mr. Matsudaira, before his arrival here must certainly have been made with the object of conciliating Japanese public opinion as far as possible in order to induce them to accept quietly not only American fleet manoeuvres but also to agree to come to a further Disarmament Conference in Washington.In this connection it is interesting to note that Congressman Byrns, representing the minority on the Naval Appropriation Committee, made one or two rather interesting remarks in his speech during the course of the debate in the House on the Naval Appropriation Bill, which would seem to me to confirm the idea that a new Naval Disarmament Conference is in the air.    He asserted that in order to carry out the requirements for the next fiscal year the
appropriations for the ^avy must reach a total of 4 370,000,000 including the provisions of Bill H.B.8687 and the completion of the airplane carriers, that is to say $ 70,000,000 above what we know the President desires should be spent for this purpose.   Mr. Byrns advocated the calling of a further limitation conference to avoid this expense, which he predicted would otherwise be requiredevery year and he confirmed the almost universal American\\sentiment that the United States is determined &quot;to have , euqality in naval strength and with its wealth is goinjg to have it. &quot;That in other words is also practically what Secretary Wilbur told me.Yours very truly, (Signed) 3SM3 HOWARD.The Right HonourableAusten Chamberlain, M.P., etc.,    etc.,  etc.
