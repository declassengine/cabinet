TRADE FACILITIES BILL.Memorandum by the Financial ^e^rgtaryjbo the Treasury^The Trade Facilities Act, 1921, empowered the Treasury to guarantee the payment of interest and principal or of either Interest or principal of loans the proceeds of which were to be.applied &quot;towards or in connection with the carry-ing out of any capital undertaking or in connection.with the purchase of articles ..... required for the purposes of any such undertaking&quot; and where the application of the loans in the manner proposed is calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom.     The powers of the Treasury under, this Act extended to the 9th November, 19 22,. and- the total sum in respect of which guarantees could be given under this Act was not to exceed  25 million.By the Trade Facilities and Loan Guarantee Act, 1922, (Session 2) the period within which guarantees might be given under-the principal Act was extended to the 9th November, 1923-, and. the limit on the amount to be guaranteed was1increased to  50 million a 1 % . &apos;By the Trade Facilities Act, 1924, the period duringwhich, guarantees might be given was extended to the. 31st March, 1925, and the maximum limit of the guarantees increased
to  65 million.If the power of the Treasury to give these guarantees is not to toe suspended it becomes necessary to pass before the 51st March this year a further Bill and I accordingly submit a draft Bill which extends the period during which guarantees may be given for a further year, that is, to 31st March, 1926 eOn the 31st March next there will remain out of the  65 million a substantial balance ( 7 million) in respect of whioh the power to guarantee will not have been exercised and It is not therefore proposed in the present Bill to increase the limit laid down in last year&apos;s Act.     This can be done later if necessary.The Bill will require to be based on a Financial Resolution and I ask for authority to Table the necessary Resolution as soon as the House re-assembles.(Intd.)
