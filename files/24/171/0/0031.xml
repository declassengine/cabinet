(This Document is the Property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government).CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.        , $ h(25). BOROUGH COUNCILLORS  (ALTERATION OF NUMBER) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The number of Councillors of a borough cannot be altered, as the law at present stands,  except by a private Bill or in certain events by a provisional order confirmed by Parliament. It frequently happens that in a town which has grown in population an increase of the number of councillors is found desirable for the purpose of carrying out the additional work thrown on tho local authority and its Committees,  or of giving increased representation &apos;to wards which have developed more rapidly than others,  or for other causes;    and the absence of any power to provide for an increase of the number of councillors without recourse to Parliament is a serious defect in the law,  causing much unnecessary inconvenience and expense^to the local authorities.The Bill proposes to enable the number of borough councillors to be altered by the same prooedure as that by which the wards of the borough may be altered under the existing law viz., by an Order in Council in the case of a municipal borough and by an Order of the Secretary of State in the case of a metropolitan borough.The Bill was introduced in 1923 and re-introduced last year, when it passed the House of Lords without amendment. It is strongly supported by the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Metropolitan Borough Standing Joint Committee, and the measure ought to be quite unControversial.In a number of the London boroughs, ward adjustments are desirable before the triennial elections of councillors this
year.    . If the Bill could he passed early this session some at any rate of these adjustments could probably be made in time for the elections.I ask for authoritjr to introduce at once a Bill in the same form as the Bill attached which has been introduced by the last two Governments.W.J.H.23rd January,   1925.
