T^PQCUMENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF H IS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;5, GOVERNMENT) .EC as 3?.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; CABINET,WIRELESS TELEPHONIC COMMUNI0ATIOB BETWEENMemorandum by the Postmaster-General.When it was decided by Mr.Bonar Law&apos;s Government in1920-21 to give the Marconi Company licences for Continentalwireless telegraphy, (Cabinet 33(21), Conclusion 5,)-facilities for establishing wireless telephone communica-tion with the Continent were also offered to them, but the negotiations ultimately broke down.At the time, the Company claimed to be able to open acommercial service in the immediate future;    hut thisexpectation has not materialised, and it is at leastquestionable whether the Company could provide anything approaching a commercial service for some considerable time to come.    The potentialities and limitations of wireless telephony have since become much better known and in the event of such a service being authorised, thePost Office would he in as good a position to undertakeit as the Marconi Company.The Company have applied again for permission toestablish a wireless telephone service with the Continent.There are two questions involved -(1) Whether wireless telephone services with the Continent of Europe should be admitted.(2) If so, whether their administration should he in the hands of the Post Office or of the Marconi Company.As regards the first point, expert opinion on theContinent, as evidenced by the views of an international committee, meeting in Paris, in which the Post OfficeEngineers concur, and expert opinion in the United States,
are agreed on the general principle, &quot;the practical &quot;field for radio-t-elejflbtcmy lies in general in those situations where it is- impracticable to employ wire...............The two principal objections to the use of wireless telephony at present arc -(a) Its instability and liability to interruption. At present wireless tele$%ony cannot furnish anything approaching the reliability of service which the International cablo system now under construction will supply.fb) The wave-bands required for telephonic purposes are wider than those employed in wireless telegraphy,, and having in view the demands on the available wave-lengths for broadcasting and for communication with moving objects,, it would be unwise to set aside valuable wave bands fora telephonic sorvice which con be conducted more efficiently, and probably more economic alljr, by wire.    It is especially to be observed that the Board of Trade are at present much concerned with ensuring wireless, telephonic communication with lightships off the east coast and will probably in the future desire to extend this benefit to ships navigating in soundings in foggy weather..I am firmly of opinion that the conclusion of the International Committee, supported by American experience,should bo accepted, and that wireless telephony should not at present be admitted on the Continental service so    The progress of wireless, science may in the future eliminate these objections, and the question of utilising wireless telephony for dectinations not easily reached by theEuropean cablo system, or as a supplement to that system, may become a practical issue.    But, even in that event, so long, as the internal telephone system of the country remains inthe hands of the Post Office, the administration of wireless telephony should be under Post Office control also.flntd.)W,IvioT.fcaral Post office, -iannary 10th, 1925.
