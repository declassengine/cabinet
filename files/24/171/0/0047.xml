Memorandum by the secretary of state for War.I observe that the Treasury propose to extend the operation of the Trade Facilities Bill for one year but not to increase the existing limit of  6^,000,000 because there is a balance of  7.000,000 unexhausted lending power.I hope the Home Affairs Committee will extend the limit to say .580,000,000, i.e., by an amount similar to last year&apos;s extension.If suitable projects are not forthcoming, the power will not be exercised but, if work can be obtained, the unemployed are not less numerous nor lees clamant than last year, nor will election promises be overlooked.(Intld.)   L.W.E.The war Office.30th January, 1925.
