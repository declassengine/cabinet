I attach a draft of a bill, the object of which is to empower the Board of Trade to increase the Government Guarantee of  100,000 to the British Empire Exhibition, authorised by the British Empire Exhibition(Guarantee) Act of 1920 to a total of  1,100,000.The circumstances which necessitate tke proposed increase are explained in the draft White Paper (attached), which it is proposed to lay on the table of the House in connection with the financial resolution on which the bill must rest.The question 6f re-opening the exhibition in 1905 was discussed between the Exhibition Authorities and the Chancellor of the Exchequer shortly after the government took office, and the Chancellor then agreed, subject to the provisos mentioned in the Y/hlte Paper, to the proposed increase of the Government Guarantee, without which it would have been impossible to continue the exhibition.With regard to the provisos laid down by the Chancellor I am glad to be able to report that the response from the Dominions and Colonies has been very satisfactory, only two or three of the governments concerned having declined the invitation.to re-open their pavilions.The response from exhibitors has hitherto been less satisfactory.   While the Exhibition Authorities are confident of re-letting most of the space in the Palace of Industry and in the grounds, they are experiencing considerable difficulties in their endeavcura to fill the Palace of -Engineering.So far as the Guarantors other than His Majesty&apos;a Government are concerned the Exhibition Authorities state that out of the original guarantees for  1,107,991 (exclusive of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;a guarantee) guarantees amounting to over  1,000,000 have already been renewed for 1925.The financial administration of the exhibition has been strengthened by the appointment of Sir James Cooper, K.3.E. as Financial Controller ,*The exhibition has been financed by Lloyd1 a Bank who have advanced the sums necessary for construction and working expenses on the security (1) of the Guarantee fund (11) of the title deeds of the lands and buildings, and (iii) of the undertaking given by the late government to seek: authority for an increase in the guarantee up to a maximum of  600,000.If/cret(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty &quot;aGovernment).CABINET- 3 0j.

If the Exhibition was to be re-opened, it was necessary for the overdraft to be increased partly to meet cost of reconditioning, etc., and partly in order that financial assistance might be given to the Dominions towards the cost of re-opening their pavilions and reconstituting their exhibits.This has necessitated increasing the amount foi&apos; which the late government proposed to seek tbe sanction of Parliament.&amp;.M.3.

kmBRITISH EMPIRE EXHIBITION (ffUARANTBg)  BILL.PRAffT_WRITS_PAPER.Memorandum   of   proposed   Guarantee..Under the British Empiro Exhibition (Guarantee) Act. 1920. as amended by the British Empire Exhibition (Amendment) Aot, 1922, the Board of Trado were empowered, on terms and conditions approved by the treasury, to guarantee a sum of  100,000 in respect of any loss which&apos;might arise from the holding of the British Empire Exhibition.The Exhibition grew far beyond the limits contemplated at the time when those Acts were passed, largely as a result of the fact that the Dominions and Colonies eventually participated on a much larger scale than they had originally Signified their intention of doing.   This involved greater capital expenditure then had originally been anticipated, and tho British Empire Exhibition (Guarantee) Bill was accordingly introduced during the last session of Parliament with a view to empowering the Boardof Trade to increase the original guarantee of  100,000 to  600,000.   The financial resolution on which the Bill rested was agreed to on the 19th March, 1924,  and the Bill was introduced but had not been read a second time when Parliament was dissolved.The British Empire Exhibition authorities have given the following figures relating to the financial position of the Exhibition at its close on the 1st November, 1924.Expenditure Revenue.Capital expenditure:-Site construction etc.Maintenance Publicity, upkeep of roads. Buildings and grounds, music, salaries, and wages, polico, bank charges, demobilisation etc.Receipts from admissions rent of space, concessions  2,950,000    etc........... 2,100,000Amount advanced by Lloyds Bank to the &quot;Exhibition authorities,,    1,800,000.950o000 3,900.000  3,900,000There is also a liability of  150,000 for the balance of Entertainments Duty still due upon admissions to the Exhibition,, Entertainment Duty upon the various amusements, eto.,, within the Exhibition has been duly paid.The total of tho Guarantee Fund, excluding theGovernment Guarantee is .........  1,107,991The amount of the Government guarantee is 100,000.Total of the Guarantee Fund .....  1,207,991.//The
The Government have agreed that a Bill should he laid &quot;before Parliament under which the amount guaranteed &quot;by the Exchequer shall he raised to a sum of  lB100 000 subject to the following provisos:(1) That sufficient support from the Dominions and Colonies and from exhibitors should be secured In order to ensure a satisfactory exhibition in 1925;(2) That the consent of the guarantors * other than the Govern-ment - should be obtained to the continuance of their guarantees for the further period &amp;r which the Exhibition will be open.The Government have also requested that measures should be adopted to strengthen the financial administration of the Exhibition.It is now proposed to ask Parliament to empower the Board of Trade to grant an additional guarantee of&quot; 1,000,0CO, mating  1,100,000 in all, the grant of such guarantee to be subject to the Board being satisfied upon the points referred to above *The figure of  1,000,000 includes the  500,000 which Parlia--ment was asked to sanction during the last session of Parliament but Which was not authorised owing to the dissolution of Parlia-mento   At the time when the financial resolution for the ad&amp;iti&amp;r al guarantee of  500,000 was. agreed to by Parliament no decision as to&quot;the continuance of the Exhibition during 1925 had been taken.   The reason for the further proposed increase in the Government guarantee i*e, from  600,000 in all to  i,1009000 in a - is &quot;to provide the   Exhibition Authorities with finance to meet the expenses of reopening in 1925,   The additional guarantee of  1,000,000 will rank pari passu with the original Government ; guarantee of  100,000 and those given by firms, corporations, private individuals etc
