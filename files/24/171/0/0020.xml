[This Document isL the Property ol His Britannic majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the Cabinet.    January 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.[J 241/G]CABINET.MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OE  STATE  FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS  ON  EGYPT.I THOUGHT it right to circulate to the Cabinet a little time ago a memorandum, respecting the political situation in Egypt prepared in the Foreign e niee/a. Office for my information. I circulated this memorandum because it included a most useful appreciation of the forces at work in Egyptian politics, and because, through its annexes, it showed the lines on which the late Government were trying to work and the conclusions to which my predecessor had been led, and because, as I observed in my covering note, I thought that it would help my colleagues to understand the full importance of the decisions which we were called upon to take from day to day.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has now issued a commentary on this paper c.p. 555(24). which calls for some observations from me..1 do not propose to dwell on the Chancellor&apos;s summary of recent history, though I think it partial and in many respects ill-informed. He and I were members of the Government w-hich sent out the Milner Mission, which terminated the protectorate and issued the Declaration of 1922, and if in regard to Zaghlul our policy has been as silly as he thinks it, he and I must take our share of the blame. But these things have now only an historic or personal interest, and controversy about them seems to me undesirable. I will only observe that if we have indeed been over-patient with Zaghlul, our forbearance has not been without some compensating advantages. It cleared the way for the firm and prompt action which we took in the recent crisis; it secured us the support of the foreign colonies in Egypt and the more than friendly attitude of foreign Governments; and there are signs that it was not without effect even on Egyptian opinion, and that Egyptians themselves have begun to realise that Zaghlul&apos;s policy was as inimical to Egyptian liberties as to British interests.But it is with the present and the future that we have now to deal, and 1 am only concerned with these references to the past in so far as they may lead or mislead us in our policy to-day.Mr. Churchill starts from the assumption that we in the Foreign Office have defined the alternatives before us as annexation or evacuation. This is a complete misapprehension. No one in the Foreign Office contemplates evacuation as a possible policy. It is unthinkable that any British Government should now adopt a policy of scuttle; and if such a policy were suggested in any quarter, it would find no more determined opponents anywhere than among the very able officials who advise and assist the Foreign Minister.The point really at issue is quite different, but it is not on that account less vital. It is whether, among the solutions that we can contemplate, what is called Cromerism &apos;&apos; offers a possible policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer plumps boldly in its favour. We are to define Egypt as &apos;&apos; an independent State acting in all matters of external and internal policy in accordance with British advice.&quot; We are to exercise &quot; a complete control over the whole administration of Egypt, while at the same time observing and respecting all the forms and procedure of a native Egyptian State.&quot;* &quot;Finance, police, the army, railways, irrigation, education, sanitation every one of these services must once again be made a credit to Great Britain.&quot; This is &quot;Cromerism&quot; with a vengeance and carried to a point which even in the heyday of his authority would, I think, have been repudiated by Lord Cromer.   But even before Lord Cromer left* The Chancellor adds later: &quot;We cannot acquiesce in ... the exodus of British officials.&quot; Does he mean that we should deprive these officials of the privileges which Lord Allenby (against my wish, it is true) made a part of his ultimatum ?2609   [12535]
Egypt &quot; Cromerism &quot; was breaking down, and Lord Cromer was the first to recognise the fact. He left Egypt knowing that one chapter had closed and that a new-chapter was about to open, and his choice of Sir Eldon Gorst as his successor --mistaken as I have always thought it was prompted by his conviction that the time had come for a complete change of method. Egyptian co-operation was essential, and concession had become the price of that co-operation. Sir Eldon Gorst gave the provincial councils far wider powers than they had ever before enjoyed, but he thereby fostered the demand for representative institutions. Even so, his success was bought at the price of the Prime Minister&apos;s life, who was assassinated for compliance with our wishes. Lord Kitchener appeared to have scotched the Nationalist movement, but he again had recourse to concession, for he gave the Egyptians the Constitution for which they had been clamouring and a Legislative Assembly invested with real power. The result of its first session proved convincingly that it was far too dangerous a body to have in being when we entered upon the war.After the war we restored Egyptian independence. We allowed the Egyptians to frame their Constitution. We have now to reckon not merely with the Council of Ministers or an Assembly of Notables, but with a popularly elected Parliament. Before we can return to &quot;Cromerism&quot; we must abolish the Constitution and suppress the Parliament. When we are prepared to do this, and when public opinion is ready to support us in doing it, it will be a question whether it is worth while to pretend to maintain a simulacrum of independence or whether the time has not come for a new annexation.But my policy is to avoid annexation not to govern Egypt, but to leave the Egyptians to govern it whilst securing sufficient power to protect those interests of which we are the guardians. I draw a great distinction between our position and policy in the Sudan and our position and policy in Egypt. I regard the political crisis in the Sudan as at an end, though I do not exclude the possibility of further military trouble. But the crisis in Egypt I regard as only beginning. We have secured a friendly Egyptian Government. We have made it clear to the King and to his Ministers that if they are loyal to their obligations to us, we shall support them. So far they have acted with courage and success, but everything still depends upon the result of the elections, upon the character of the new Parliament, and upon the attitude which the King and his Ministers adopt towards it if it is hostile to British interests. We have succeeded in the Sudan because it was possible for us to pursue a policy which could be carried out irrespective of the attitude of the Egyptians. We have concentrated all authority in our own hands, and, except for our continued recognition of the Condominium, we have turned the Egyptians out of the Sudan. But we cannot turn the Egyptians out of Egypt, nor can we, as long as the Constitution remains, secure their co-operation by the mere exercise of force.It is only by so framing our policy in Egypt that the defence of our interests and the discharge of our obligations requires the minimum of co-operation on the part of the Egyptians that we can hope to achieve a similar success in that country. When the Egyptians realise that they are powerless to prevent our success then, and then only, may we expect to find that ready co-operation which the Chancellor predicts. It was from this point of view and with this object only that the suggestion was made for a reconsideration of the position of our army of occupation. Erom my recollection of earlier discussions at which I was present I am myself extremely doubtful about the possibility of withdrawing the troops from Cairo, but I think it would be well that the Committee of Imperial Defence should pursue the enquiry which the late Prime Minister invited it to undertake. The mere fact that he raised this question in connection with the negotiations with Zaghlul makes it necessary that an authoritative decision should be- given upon it. I am not a military expert, but even a layman may be permitted to express some doubt as to the Chancellor&apos;s assertion that if the native population of Cairo was starving &quot;it would be their trouble, not ours,&quot; and that we could afford to look on with equanimity provided that we had accumulated sufficient stores for the British troops and foreign colonies. But these are matters which can be better examined by the Committee of Imperial Defence. All that I desire to emphasise for the moment is that a reversion to &quot; Cromerism&quot; is not possible with the existing Constitution, that the abolition of that Constitution is as revolutionary and formidable an operation as annexation itself, and that our business at this stage is to find a method of preserving our rights and discharging our obligations which involves neither revolution nor annexation.- ... A. C.Foreign Office, January 9, 1925.
