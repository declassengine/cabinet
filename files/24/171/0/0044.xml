Documents concerning the Settlement of Inter-Allied War Debts.No. 1.The Earl of Balfour to Count de Saint-Aulaire.*Your Excellency, Foreign Office, August T, 1922.AS your Excellency is aware, the general question of the French debt to this country has not as yet been the subject of any formal communication between the two Governments, nor are His Majesty&apos;s Government anxious to raise it at the present moment. Recent events, however, leave them little choice in the matter, and they feel compelled to lay before the French Government their views on certain aspects of the situation created by the present condition of international indebtedness.Speaking in general terms, the war debts, exclusive of interest, due to Great Britain at the present moment amount in the aggregate to about  3,400 million, of which Germany owes  1,450 million, Russia  650 million and our allies  1,300 million. On the other hand, Great Britain owes the United States about a quarter of this sum say,  850 million at par of exchange, together with interest accrued since 1919.No international discussion has yet taken place on the unexampled situation partially disclosed by these figures ; and pending a settlement which would go to the root of the problem, His Majesty&apos;s Government have silently abstained from making any demands upon their allies, either for the payment of interest or the repayment of capital. But, if action in the matter has hitherto been deemed inopportune, this is not because His Majesty&apos;s Government either underrate the evils of the present state of affairs or because they are reluctant to make large sacrifices to bring it to an end. On the contrary, they are prepared, if such a policy formed part of a satisfactory international settlement, to remit all the debts due to Great Britain by our allies in respect of loans, or by Germany in respect of reparations.Recent events, however, make such a policy difficult of accomplishment. With the most perfect courtesy, and in the exercise of their Undoubted rights, the American Government have required this country to pay the interest accrued since 1919 on the Anglo-American debt, to convert it from an unfunded to a funded debt, and to repay it by a sinking fund in twenty-five years. Such a procedure is clearly in accordance with the original contract. His Majesty&apos;s Government make no complaint of it ; they recognise their obligations and are prepared to fulfil them. But evidently they cannot do so without profoundly modifying the course which, in different circumstances, they would have wished to pursue. They cannot treat the repayment of the Anglo-American loan as if it were an isolated incident in which only the United States of America and Great Britain had any concern ; it is but one of a connected series of transactions, in which this country appears sometimes as debtor, sometimes as creditor, and, if our undoubted obligations as a debtor are to be enforced, our not less undoubted rights as a creditor cannot be left wholly in abeyance.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not conceal the fact that they adopt this change of policy with the greatest reluctance. It is true that Great Britain is owed more than it owes, and that, if all inter-Allied war debts were paid, the British Treasury would, on balance, be a large gainer by the transaction. But can the present world situation be looked at only from this narrow financial standpoint ? It is true that many of the Allied and Associated Powers are, as between each other, creditors, or debtors, or both. But they were, and are, much more. They were partners in the greatest international effort ever made in the cause of freedom ; and they are still partners in dealing with some, at least, of its results.* Also to Italian, Serb-Croat-Slovene, Roumanian, Portuguese and Greek representatives in London, mutatis mutandis.2638 [12587] b 2
Their debts were incurred, their loans were made, not for the separate advantage of particular States, but for a great purpose common to them all and that purpose has been, in the main, accomplished.To generous minds it can never be agreeable, although for reasons of State, it may perhaps be necessary to regard the monetary aspect of this great event as a thing apart, to be torn from its historical setting and treated as no more than an ordinary commercial dealing between traders who borrow and capitalists who lend. There are, moreover, reasons of a different order, to which I have already referred, which increase the distaste with which His Majesty&apos;s Government adopt so fundamental an alteration in method of dealing with loans to allies. The economic ills from which the world is suffering are due to many causes, moral and material, which are quite outside the scope of this despatch. But among them must certainly be reckoned the weight of international indebtedness, with all its unhappy effect upon credit and exchange, upon national production and inter-national trade. The peoples of all countries long for a speedy return to the normal. But how can the normal be reached while conditions so abnormal are permitted to prevail ? And how can these conditions be cured by any remedies that seem at present likely to be applied ?For evidently the policy hitherto pursued by this country of refusing to make demands upon its debtors is only tolerable so long as it is generally accepted. It cannot be right that one partner in the common enterprise should recover all that she lias lent and that another, while recovering nothing, should be required to pay all that she has borrowed. Such a procedure is contrary to every principle of natural justice, and cannot be expected to commend itself to the people of this country. They are suffering from an unparalleled burden of taxation, from an immense diminution in national wealth, from serious want of employment and from the severe curtailment of useful expenditure. These evils are courageously borne. But were they to be increased by an arrangement which, however legitimate, is obviously one-sided, the British taxpayer would inevitably ask why he should be singled out to bear a burden which others are bound to share.To such a question there can be but one answer, and I am convinced that Allied opinion will admit its justice. But while His Majesty&apos;s Government are thus regretfully constrained to request the French Government to make arrange-ments for dealing to the best of their ability with Anglo-French loans, they desire to explain that the amount of interest and repayment for which they ask depends not so much on what France and other allies owe to Great Britain as on what Great Britain has to pay America. The policy favoured by His Majesty&apos;s Government is, as I have already observed, that of surrendering their share of German reparation and writing off, through one great transaction, the whole body of inter-Allied indebtedness. But, if this be found impossible of accomplishment, we wish it to be understood that we do not in any event desire to make&apos; a profit out of any less satisfactory arrangement. In no circumstances do we propose to ask more from our debtors than is necessary to pay our creditors. And while we do not ask for more, all will admit that we can hardly be content with less. For it should not be forgotten, though it sometimes is, that our liabilities were incurred for others, not for ourselves. The food, the raw material, the munitions required by the immense naval and military efforts of Great Britain, and half the  2,000 million sterling advanced to allies were provided, not by means of foreign loans, but by internal borrowing and war taxation. Unfortunately, a similar policy was beyond the power of other European nations. Appeal was therefore made to the Government of the United States; and under the arrangement then arrived at the United States insisted, in substance if not in form, that though our allies were to spend the money, it was only on our security that they were prepared to lend it. This co-operative effort was of infinite value to the common cause ; but it cannot be &quot;said that the role assigned in it to this country was one of special privilege or advantage.Before concluding, I may be permitted to offer one further observation in order to make still clearer the spirit in which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to deal with the thorny problem of international indebtedness.In an earlier passage of this despatch I pointed out that this after all is not a question merely between allies. Ex-enemy countries also are involved; for the greatest of all international debtors is Germany. Now, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not suggest that, either as a matter of justice or expediency, Germany should be relieved of her obligation to the other Allied States.   They speak only loi[12587]
No. 2.Extract from Speech in the Bouse of Commons by Mr. Asquith during the Debate on Lord Balfour&apos;s Note of August 1, 1922. (Hansard, August 3, 1922, columns 1751-1753.)IN my judgment, two things are absolutely essential if we are to deal adequately with this situation. &quot;What are they ? Promptitude and certainty. The claim to reparation, as I have said already, not from any tenderness for Germany, but in our own interest, in the interest of our late allies, but, above all, in the interest of international trade, should be definitely ascertained, should be scaled down to what is really practical. We should be ready, I think I am glad to see the note admits it to forgo our share, and, in regard to indebtedness, to remit what is due to us.   That is no new opinion on my part.THE PRIME MINISTER (Mr. Lloyd George): The note does not say that we are prepared to remit all our claims unless there be all round remission.Mr. ASQUITH : I go further.THE PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but that is not the note.Mr. ASQUITH: I am not quoting the note now; I am expressing my own views, which are not the views of the note at all. As I have said, that is no new opinion of mine because, speaking as far back as February 1920, two and a half years ago a long time in politics when I was a candidate for Parliament, I said that, for my part, and I should not be at all surprised if the Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the Lord Privy Seal, agreed with me, if I were budgeting in the future, I should write them off, and I have always been of that opinion. They are not good debts, not from any want of honour or good faith on the part of those who incurred them, but, without incurring something very nearly approaching national bankruptcy, they are not in a position to redeem their obligation. To remit, in my opinion, is not an act of magnanimity in the least. It is an act of good business. Let me say here and now I am coming rather near the note there are, in my opinion, strong practical reasons against partial and contingent remission. I will tell the House what they are. In the first place, if you have partial and, still more, contingent remission, the European slate is not clean. It still remains with uncertain items, which may come in course of payment at indefinite and, probably, inconvenient times. In the next place, partial or contingent remission hangs up indefinitely under a cloud of uncertainty a fresh start in the general European economic life. Further, it interposes enormous and, I think, insuperable difficulties in the way of an international loan. Lastly, which is not the least important, it tends to stiffen the backbone, particularly in Prance, of those who maintain that if they are left with any part of the burden of these debts upOn their shoulders, as they cannot discharge them themselves, they must shift them on to Germany. In other words, they will be harder than ever against any scaling down of the paper indebtedness of Germany. I think it is a thoroughly erroneous policy, when you are dealing with this, not to deal with it wholeheartedly, and, above all, not to deal with it in such away that this element of contingency will not hamper the whole future of European economic life.I said a moment ago that there is another point of view which we ought to try, if we can, to realise, and that is the American.    The United States ofGreat Britain ; and they content themselves with saying once again, so deeply are they convinced of the economic injury inflicted on the world by the existing state of things, that this country would be prepared (subject to the just claims of other parts of the Empire) to abandon all further right to German reparation and all claims to repayment by allies, provided that this renunciation formed part of a general plan by which this great problem could be dealt with as a whole, and find a satisfactory solution. A general settlement would in their view be of more value to mankind than any gains that could accrue even from the most successful enforcement of legal obligations.I have, &amp;c.BALFOUR.
America know perfectly well-1 am not dealing here with paper figures that we iri this country are both,ready and able to redeem the whole of our indebtedness to them, and of that there ought to be, and there is, no doubt whatsoever on the other side of the Atlantic. I should very much: deprecate any suggestion, direct or indirect, to the United States of America that they were under any obligation, moral or even sentimental, to abate in any way their just and righteous claim. But let me add this. I should be more than glad to see this question of American indebtedness kept quite apart from the pressing and urgent European situation. &quot;We may pay too high a price for strict logic and for abstract justice. It cannot be stated too strongly that this is purely a question of expediency and of policy, and, iri the long run, their voice should be allowed to prevail.No. 3.Memorandum communicated by the British Delegation at the First Meeting of t Inter-Allied Conference held at the Quai d&apos;Orsay, Paris, on January 2, 1923.Plan for General Settlement of Reparation and European Inter-Allied Debts.Summary.Reparation.THE following plan has been prepared as a complete and final settlement of reparations and European inter-Allied debt.The German obligations under the Peace Treaty are fixed by the plan at-Nil for four years (apart);from certain deliveries in kind for which credit isto be given against future payments). 2 milliard gold marks ( 100 million) per annum for the next four years. 2\ milliard gold marks (^125 million) per annum for the following two years. After ten years 3^ milliards ( 166 million) or such smaller sum (not less than2\ milliards) as may be fixed by ah impartial tribunal.If the supervising authority provided for below decides unanimously that the state of German finances before the end of the initial period of four years is such that cash payments for reparation can be made, it will have power to ante-date the commencement of the annual payment of 2 milliards by such period not exceeding two years as it may see fit, and to make such adjustments in respect of future payments as it may deem to be equitable so as to secure that the total liability shall not be increased.The obligations take the form of 5 per cent, bonds redeemable at call by the German Government at the outset on easy terms, gradually rising to par at the end of thirty-two years.The bonds are divided into two series, Series I representing the fixed payment (rising to 2^ milliards per annum), Series II representing the additional payments over and above 2\ milliards per annum from the eleventh year onwards.There is no sinking fund, but redemption, more especially in the earlier years, is permitted upon such liberal terms that the saving in annual interest on the bonds redeemed will, if German credit is re-established, be sufficient to cover both interest and sinking fund on German loans raised in the market for redemption purposes.This arrangement gives Germany a strong inducement to raise such loans as soon as possible, since she will thereby convert a perpetual into a terminable obligation without increase of the annual charge, and also substitute a normal foreign debt to private bondholders for her present obligations to foreign Governments.The bonds provided for in the scheme are not intended either to be issued to the public or placed on the market. They are to serve merely as accounting machinery. The &quot; mobilisation&quot; of the German reparation debt is to be effected by loans raised by Germany, from the public, the proceeds of which would be applied to the redemption of the original bonds.In order to give Germany a real chance of restoring budget equilibrium and stabilising the mark, it is absolutely essential that she should be given complete freedom from payments in foreign currencies during the initial period, and that
deliveries in kind .(except in so far as the receiving countries may be willing to pay cash for them) should be reduced to a minimum.It will, however, be necessary that the deliveries on reparation account of coke-to Trance, coal to Italy, and possibly dye-stuffs should be continued, though upon a reduced scale, even during this initial period.   The precise quantities can only be settled by negotiation.In the event of the plan proving successful, it is highly probable, however, that Germany would herself seek to increase her deliveries in kind in the early years to a maximum, in view of the liberal terms on which the value is applied to the cancellation of her debt. -.The plan would he offered to Germany on condition that she undertakes  1. To stabilise the mark in accordance with the recommendations contained in the majority report of the foreign experts consulted by the German Government in November last, and to restore budget equilibrium with limits of time to be prescribed (say six months for the stabilisation and two years for the budget reform). 2. To accept such financial supervision as may be deemed by the Allied Powers to be necessary to see to the punctual carrying out of these reforms (see Schedule &quot;B&quot;). 3. To submit, in the event of her failing to satisfy the supervising authority that condition 1 is being observed or failing to discharge her obligations as now revised, to any measures which the Allied Powers, upon a report of such failure from the supervising authority, may unanimously decide to be necessary, including forcible seizure of German revenues and assets and military occupation of German territories outside the existing zone of occupation.Inter-Allied Debts.The following proposals are put forward for dealing with inter-Allied debts upon the understanding that the above reparation plan is accepted, and all proposals for the taking of pledges (&quot;gages&quot;) and application of sanctions (otherwise than as provided for in the above plan) are abandoned :-&apos;.1. Gold deposits now held by Great Britain as security for inter-Allied debtsare to be applied towards the reduction of these debts. 2. The 1st Series German Bonds to be received by France in respect of the . Belgian War Debt, and 1^ milliards of the 1st Series Bonds to be received by Italy in respect of her share of reparation are to be transferred to Great Britain. 3. The balance of the net debts owing as between European Allies in respect of advances* for the purpose of carrying on the war is to be entirely written off, all counter-claims being abandoned, on condition that the debtors transfer their interests in the 2nd Series (Contingent) Bonds to a pool for distribution to those Powers which are indebted to the United States of America in proportion to their respective American debts.The governing principles of the plan are 1. To fix a minimum German liability which is within recent estimates which have been made by financial experts of German capacity,  and a supplementary liability which is primd facie not unduly onerous, but which can be reduced or cancelled by an impartial tribunal if it should . .  prove in the event to be excessive. 2. To substitute for the present fixed obligations of the European Allies to .. Great Britain arrangements under which all except a small percentage -       (whichwould be accepted in the form of a transfer of German obligations) -  -would be remitted, but under which the. contingent German payments in excess- of the fixed minimum would be available for discharging European debts to America generally. 3. To give attractive terms to Germany for the early redemption of the annual payments by anticipation.The primary obligation of Germany is put into the form of 50 milliard gold mark thirty-two year bonds bearing no interest for four years, 4 per cent, for the* The status quo would not be interfered with as regards inter-Allied post-war indebtedness.
next four and 5 per cent, thereafter. No provision is proposed for a sinking fund but the bonds can he redeemed on terms which, if German credit recovers, will enable the interest and sinking fund on the loans required for redemption to be met out of the resultant saving on the interest on the bonds.Germany is thus given a double inducement to borrow from the public to redeem the original bonds.*. (a.) She frees herself from her direct liability to the Allied Governments. (6.) She substitutes without additional cost a terminable for a perpetual liability.The merits claimed for the plan are that its adoption will make the restoration of German credit possible and lead to the recovery of very substantial sums for reparation, while persistence in the policy of attempting to enforce impossible claims will end in the destruction of the creance altogether.The present value of the primary obligation under the plan cannot be precisely estimated owing to the redemption options.If the adoption of the plan led to a rapid revival of German credit and Germany were able, by raising loans, to pay off the whole of the fixed annuity in the first few years, the present value might not be more, and might possibly be even less, than 30 milliards.But if this happened the Allies would have actually received this 30 milliards and Germany would undoubtedly be in a position to pay for the service of the 2nd Series of bonds when they fall to be created ten years hence, and redeem that series also very rapidly. In that event this 2nd Series would be worth at least its present value on the Q\ per cent, table 7-4 milliards so that on this supposition the whole indemnity would have been collected in twelve or fifteen years (mainly in the first ten) and a present value of over 37 milliards realised.On the worst assumption that no German loans become possible either now or in the future, that the 2nd Series of bonds has to be cancelled altogether and Germany merely pays the interest on the 1st Series as a perpetual annuity beginning four years hence at 2 milliards and rising four years later at 1\ milliards, the present value on the 5 per cent, table is 39^ milliards.The burden on Germany (which will be reduced if she raises redemption loans on favourable terms) covers all financial liabilities under the treaty.Plan for General Settlement of Reparation and EuropeanInter-Allied Debts.Reparation.1. The existing German bonds of Series A, B and C to be cancelled and the Schedule of Payments annuities to be reduced to the amounts required year by year to provide the interest payable on the new bonds to be issued under paragraph 2.2. Germany to issue to the Reparation Commission new bonds, to be divided into two series : (a.) 1st Series Bonds to the amount of 50 milliard gold marks to be issued forthwith repayable at par on the 31st December, 1954, and bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum payable half-yearly; the interest to be suspended in its entirety for the first four years (until the 1st January, 1927), and to the extent of 1 per cent, per annum for the next four years (until the 1st January, 1931).(&amp;.-) 2nd Series Bonds to the amount of 17-31 milliard gold marks (being the amount of the deferred interest on the bonds of the 1st Series compounded at 5 per cent, to the 1st April, 1933), or such lesser amount (if any) as the Arbitral Tribunal provided for in paragraph 3 may determine, to be issued on the 1st April, 1933, repayable at par on the 31st March, 1965, and bearing interest at 5 per cent, per annum payable half-yearly..If at any time before the 1st January, 1927, the supervising authority provided for in paragraph 11 decides unanimously that the condition of German finances is such that cash payments for reparation can be commenced, Germany to pay in cash such sums as the authority may prescribe in each of the calendar years 1925 and 1926, not exceeding 2 milliard gold marks in either year.* These are not intended for issue to the public, but merely as security for the annual payments and as counters for purposes of accounting.
Any such payments to be applied to the cancellation of 1st Series Bonds at redemption price or otherwise in reduction of the aggregate liability under the preceding paragraph as the supervising authority may direct.3. If before the 1st April, 1933, Germany proves to the satisfaction&quot; of an Arbitral Tribunal that the payments required to meet the interest upon the 2nd Series of bonds exceed her capacity, her obligation to issue such bonds to be cancelled in whole or in part as the tribunal may decide.The Arbitral Tribunal to be appointed upon application by the German Govern-ment, to be made not later than the 1st October, 1932, and to consist of one person nominated by the Reparation Commission, one person nominated by the German Government and a third by agreement between the other two, or, in default of agreement, by the President of the United States of America.4. The bonds issued and to be issued under paragraphs to be accepted by.the Allied Governments in commutation of all financial liabilities of the German Govern-ment remaining undischarged on the 31st December, 1922, under the Treaty of Versailles to Powers which have ratified that treaty, including all liabilities under agreements with particular Powers in commutation of treaty obligations, but excluding the Treasury bills issued to Belgium in respect of the last five instalments of the cash payments due in 1922.       .-,Germany to pay at maturity the bills issued to Belgium in respect of the first two of these five instalments, those issued in - respect of the remaining three instalments to be cancelled and the amounts thereof recredited to Belgium.Treaty obligations to make deliveries of coal, dye-stuffs, timber, &amp;o, to continue, subject to the various conditions in regard to quantities and prices laid down in the treaty. Such deliveries (in so far as they may exceed new annual maxima to be agreed) to be paid for by the respective receiving Powers in cash, unless otherwise agreed between Germany and the Power concerned. All deliveries within the new annual maxima, or which may be made the subject of such special agreement, to be paid for by the receiving Power by set-off against the interest receivable upon the bonds, held by it, or (until such interest payments have begun or in so far as they may be insufficient) by surrender at redemption price of bonds for cancellation.5. Germany to have the right to redeem bonds of the 1st Series as on any interest date after the 30th June, 1923, at the price shown in Schedule &quot;A.&quot;As soon as, but not before, the 1st Series of bonds has been redeemed, Germany to have the right to redeem bonds of the 2nd Series as on any interest date at a discount of f per cent, for each unexpired half-year.Redemption of both series at more favourable rates to be permissible by agree-ment between Germany and the respective Powers interested, subject to the approval of the Reparation Commission.The bonds to be negotiable as between the Governments of the Powers to which they are issued and as between these Governments and the Reparation Commission, but not otherwise, except with the specific sanction of the Reparation Commission^ Redemption to be effected by direct agreement between the German Government and the respective bondholders. In default of agreement, redemption money may be paid to the Reparation Commission, who will call up bonds for redemption in Spa Agreement percentages.6. Eighty per cent, of the bonds of the 1st Series to be distributed forthwith to the Powers entitled to reparation in the Spa Agreement percentages.The remaining 20 per cent, to be retained by the Reparation Commission as a reserve for adjustment of accounts between Powers and for the payment of miscellaneous treaty charges as provided below.7. Belgium to discharge her existing debit in respect of her priority adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4 by surrender to the Reparation Commission reserve of bonds of the 1st Series to a face value equal to the amount of the debit plus 26^ per cent, fBelgium to waive her claims to priority of payment over other Powers in so far as they have not already been met.8. The United States (subject to the consent of that Power), Great Britain and France to receive out of bonds of the 1st Series retained as a reserve by the Repara-* The intention is that these bonds should in no ease be placed on the market, the &quot; mobilisation &quot; of the German debt being effected exclusively by the flotation of German loans to effect the redemption H the original bonds.

tion Commission amounts to a face value equal to their respective credits arising out of the last paragraph of article 232 of the treaty (Belgian war debt).9. All other outstanding debits and credits as between Powers entitled to reparation and the Reparation Commission to be cleared as on the 1st January, 1923 by transfer of bonds of the 1st Series at redemption price. Debits to be adjusted by transfer from the debtor Power to the Reparation Commission reserve and credits by transfer from the reserve to the creditor Power.10. As from the 1st January, 1923, costs of armies of occupation and clearing office and other miscellaneous charges up to such amount per annum as the Repara-tion Commission may approve, except in so far as they can be met from cash accruinc to the Reparation Commission Reserve in respect of interest on bonds in that reserve! to be discharged by transfer of bonds at redemption price from the Reparation Commission Reserve to the Powers entitled to the payments. Any bonds remaining in the reserve when its liabilities have been liquidated to be distributed to the various Powers entitled to reparation in the Spa Agreement percentages.11. Germany to agree (1.) To stabilise the mark in accordance with the recommendations contained in the majority report of the foreign experts consulted by the German Government in November last, and to restore budget equilibrium with limits of time to be prescribed (say, six months for the stabilisation and two years for the budget reform).(2.) To accept such financial supervision as may be deemed by the Allied Powers to be necessary to see to the punctual carrying out of these reforms (see Schedule ;&apos;B &quot;).(3.) To submit, in the event of her failing to satisfy the supervising authority that condition (1) is being observed, or failing to discharge her obliga-tions as now revised, to any measures which Allied Powers, upon a report of such failure from the supervising authority, may unanimously decide to be necessary. Such measures may include the forcible seizure of German revenues and assets and the taking over of German fiscal machinery and the military occupation of German territories outside the treaty occupation area.12. All loans raised by Germany in the national market of any Power which is a holder of any of the bonds to be applied to the redemption of bonds held by that Power, unless and except to such extent as the Government of that Power may otherwise agree.In order to facilitate the provision of funds for the restoration of the devastated regions of France, Great Britain to agree that 50 per cent, of any German loans raised on the British market before the 1st January, 1927, which would otherwise be applied to the redemption of bonds held by Great Britain, shall be applied to the redemption of bonds held by France.European Inter-Allied Debts *13. The deposits of gold which are held by Great Britain as security for loans made to France and Italy for the purpose of carrying on the war, to be applied forthwith towards the repayment of these loans.The French share of the German bonds applicable to the repayment of Belgian war debt to be transferred to Great Britain and accepted by her as satisfaction of an equal amount of the French debt to Great Britain.One and a half milliards 1st Series German Bonds to be transferred by Italy to Great Britain and accepted by Great Britain in discharge of an amount of the Italian debt to Great Britain equal to the face value of the bonds.The balance of the French and Italian war debts to Great Britain to be written off; all counter-claims by France and Italy at the same time being abandoned.The Italian debt to France to be written off.Great Britain and France to transfer to the Reparation Commission as trusWT* the net war debts owing to them by Serbia, Roumania, Greece and Portugal to De dealt with as provided below.* These proposals for dealing with inter-Allied debts are put forward upon the understand ins iW the above reparation plan is accepted and nil proposals for the taking&apos; of pledges (&quot; gngf application of sanctions (otherwise than as provided for in the above plan) are abandoned.

The German Finance Minister will be ex officio chairman (without a vote except in the case of equality of votes), and will be required by law to act on the councils advice in regard to all matters affecting 1. Currency legislation.2. The budget, fiscal legislation and public expenditure. 3. General Treasury administration.4. Financial prohibitions, control of foreign remittances, &amp;c.This, of course, means a considerable measure of interference with German democratic independence in matters of finance, but such interference is the inevitable concomitant of any method of effective supervision or control.The association of the Finance Minister with the Council seems to be the only method by which foreign interference can be squared with the democratic machinery.As regards the powers of the council the main object to be aimed at is to leave German administration as far as possible in German hands, and avoid direct responsibility for initiative in regard to details in the matter of legislation.It is desirable to give the council very wide powers, but also wide discretion as to both the manner in which, and the extent to which, they are to be used.It is not practicable to lay down beforehand any rigid rules in regard to such matters, as the further degree of expansion of the note issue which can be permitted or the further increase which may be allowed to take place in the floating debt still less to insist on the raising of loans the possibility of which depends on finding lenders-Whatever form of local control may be decided upon, it should be responsible and independent, i.e., not subject to a Reparation Commission sitting in Paris.It will be necessary to provide that the German Foreign Finance Council should sit without the German Finance Minister whenever occasion requires to exercise the executive powers at present possessed by the Reparation Commission and by the existing Committee of Guarantees. . if the Reparation Commission is retained at all it should be as a purely judicial body with such changes of constitution as may appear desirable.
uThe special powers of the Foreign Finance Council should expire on the 31st December, 1928, but the Allied Governments should have power by unanimous decision to renew them for a further period or periods, if they deem such renewal necessary.After the expiry of the special powers, the council will cease to sit under the chairmanship of the German Finance Minister, but will continue to exercise the powers which have been transferred to it from the Reparation Commission and the Committee of Guarantees.No. 4.The Marquess Gurzon of Kedleston ta Count de Saint-Aulaire and also toBaron Moncheur.Your Excellency, Foreign Office, August 11, 1923.THE most sincere disappointment has been caused to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment by the replies which they have received under date of the 30th July from the French and Belgian Governments to their identic notes of the 20th ultimo. With those notes was submitted the draft of a joint Allied answer which His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed should be sent to the German memorandum of the 7th June. The proposal represented an earnest effort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whilst showing the utmost regard for the known views of the French and Belgian Governments, to indicate a practical way of arriving as promptly as possible at a final settlement of the question of German reparations,2. His M&apos;ajesty&apos;s Government had understood that there were in the opinion of the French and Belgian Governments two main obstacles standing in the way of any fresh move in seeking such settlement: (1) the necessity of scrupulously respecting the rights of the Reparation Commission under the Treaty of Versailles as regards the fixing of the German debt and determining the modes of payment; and (2) the attitude of the German Government in encouraging passive resistance to the Franco-Belgian occupation and exploitation of the Ruhr.3. With both these questions, accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed, in their suggested reply to the German memorandum, to deal in a manner which they confidently expected would commend itself to their Allies. How completely they have been disappointed in this expectation is made manifest by the contents of the notes in which the French and Belgian Governments have replied to their proposals.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government acknowledge with much appreciation the courteous tone of those notes. If they now proceed to comment upon them, they trust that their remarks will be received in the friendly spirit in which they are offered.5. A reply seems to be all the more necessary, since, in the desire to avoid controversy at a critical phase, His Majesty&apos;s Government refrained from sending any rejoinder to the observations which the French and Belgian Governments com-municated to them over a month ago in reply to the so-called questionnaire which I had addressed to the two Governments. Sooner than embark upon any controversy with their Allies, His Majesty&apos;s Government preferred at that time to submit a definite plan of action, under which they proposed that the suggested enquiry into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay should be conducted within the framework of the Treaty of Versailles, and that the German Government should be called upon to withdraw the orders and measures by which they have enjoined passive resistance. Further-more, in order to comply with the declared objection of their French and Belgian Allies to any specific bargain being made on this point with the German Government, the British proposals were restricted to an intimation that if the German Govern-ment were to abandon passive resistance without delay, not only would this be regarded as an evidence of good faith, but it would involve a reconsideration by the occupying Powers of the conditions of their occupation and a gradual return to the normal features of industrial life in the Ruhr.6. It is difficult to think in what way greater consideration could have been shown to the Franco-Belgian point of view.7. The reception, however, that has been accorded to these proposals by the French and Belgian Governments in their respective notes of the 30th July, leaves His Majesty&apos;.s Government, notwithstanding the terms of courtesy employed, under
the painful impression that neither are their suggestions welcomed by their Allies nor is their offered co-operation held to merit consideration except on condition that no departure be made in any one particular from whatever France and Belgium declare to be their overriding.views and decisions.: 8. It is true that the Belgian reply appears at first sight to be less uncom-promising than the French note. But on closer examination it is seen that the attitude of the two Governments is for all practical purposes identical, and that, though the Belgian Government appear to be especially anxious for the continuance of friendly conversations, it is only upon condition that the substance of the Belgian claims is conceded in advance. Accordingly, His Majesty&apos;s Government ask leave to deal with the two replies in a single answer.9. The first point that has struck His Majesty&apos;s Government is that in neither is there any allusion whatsoever to the terms of the draft reply to the German memorandum which His Majesty&apos;s Government had proposed. The Belgian Govern-ment, indeed, still remain in favour of the principle of a joint reply, but the French Government pass the proposal over in complete silence. And yet this was the main object to which, in their desire for the continued maintenance of Allied unity, His Ma&apos;jesty&apos;s Government had devoted their efforts. The omission is hardly com-pensated by a series of argumentative passages, enquiries on points of detail, and offers of further discussions and conversations, holding out a prospect of an indefinitely spun-out controversy, whilst fundamental principles are only mentioned in order to declare that they do not admit of discussion.10. It may perhaps be said that the Belgian reply does not reject, as categorically as does the French, the proposal for a fresh investigation of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay. But the consent of the Belgian Government to such an enquiry is made conditional upon obtaining for Belgium and for France pecuniary advantages of a far-reaching kind at the expense of their Allies, and notably of Great Britain. Such a suggestion appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government to reveal a palpable misconception of the situation.11. It will not be contested that there can be no use in demanding from Germany more than she is capable of paying. What is the maximum she can pay, is a question of supreme importance to all ker creditors. It is a question of establishing a fact, on the ascertainment of which any practical arrangements or combinations for obtaining, payment to the fullest extent possible must be based. The British Govern-ment accordingly proposed to take steps to ascertain this important fact. Belgium replies that she will not consent unless a corresponding advantage is obtained by herself and by France. His Majesty&apos;s Government could not willingly enter into any such transaction.12. While the Belgian note does not indicate any precise claim, official and semi-official pronouncements by and on behalf of French and Belgian Ministers have made it clear that the French Government wish to insist on a minimum payment to them of 26 milliard gold marks over and above the amount required to meet their debts owing to this country and to the United States, and the Belgian Government on a minimum payment of 5 milliard gold marks, for which, or for part of which, they now ask for further priority.13. If the estimate made on a 5 per cent, basis by M. Bokanowski, tlie rapporteur of the French budget, which put the present value of the annuities under the Schedule of Payments at 65 milliard gold marks, may be accepted as an approximately correct basis of calculation, the share of France and Belgium as fixed by the percentages established, under the Spa Agreement (52 and 8 per cent, respectively) would not exceed 34 milliards for France and 5-2 milliards for Belgium, even if Germany were in a position to pay the total figures of the schedule. But Belgium, has already, under the agreement&quot; which entitles her to priority payments of 2\ milliard gold francs ( 100 million), received approximately 1\ milliard gold marks ( 73 million sterling), a sum far exceeding the receipts of any other Power. Though this priority was given when the total sums expected from. Germany were immensely larger than anything that it now likely to be received, it has not been reduced proportionately, and it has therefore operated to give Belgium an increasingly disproportionate share of actual receipts up-to date. In addition, she has been entirely relieved of her war debts to the Allies, amounting to nearly  300 million sterling. &apos;      &apos;  &apos; u14. France, on the other hand, when counting on receiving 34 milliard gom marks from Germany, would have to balance this amount against her debt to this country, representing about 12 milliard gold marks, and her debt to the United
States, amounting atleast to the equivalent of 15 milliard gold marks, or, together, 27 milliards, which, being set-off against the 34 milliards to be obtained from Germany,. would leave France with a balance of 7 milliards. When, therefore, it is now suggested that she ought to receive 26 milliards net, her total debts to Great Britain and the United States being cancelled, it will be seen that the demand is for an amount between three and four times larger than would, on balance, fall to her share under the existing agreements. It is difficult to see on what grounds a failure of Germany to meet her obligations, by which Great Britain is proportionately damnified equally with her Allies, can be held to justify a claim by France to be placed, at the expense of her Allies, in a far more favourable position than she would have occupied under the Schedule of Payments itself.15. The Belgian proposal to grant a special priority for the restoration of devastated areas seems to rest on a somewhat artificial distinction as regards damages inflicted by the enemy in the late war. It is a suggestion not merely that priority should be conceded to material damages over the cost of war pensions, but that one particular type of material damage, namely, damage by land, should be selected for priority, to the exclusion of other forms of material damage. No justification for such a proposal can be found in the armistice terms or in the Peace Treaty; nor is it easy to conceive what argument can be adduced to support it. Sunk ships and cargoes rotting at the bottom of the sea may not shock the eye like the ruined villages of France and Belgium. But they are equally material damage caused by German aggression, and represent equally heavy losses of national wealth. Great Britain&apos;s proportion of reparations would not in fact be seriously altered as a result of priority conceded to material damages. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be in favour of priority even on that basis, if only for the reason that certain other Allies would be gravely and adversely affected.1.6. In practice the suggested priority would be equivalent to an alteration in favour of France and Belgium of the percentages of division fixed by the Spa Agreement. For it is clear that if Belgian and French claims in respect of their devastated regions are to be.met in full before the claims of the other Allies are considered, and if, at the same time, the total sums recoverable from Germany are diminished, the loss represented by such diminution must inevitably fall on those not enjoying the privilege of priority.17. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot admit that there is any ground whatever for revising the Spa percentages. The principle of a percentage division is not affected by a change in the total to which the percentages apply. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot leave out of account the position of their own country. Apart from the extensive material damages suffered by Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government are now involved in heavy payments to meet unemployment, in respect of which they have been compelled to spend over  400 million since the armistice. They alone, among the Allies, are paying interest on debts incurred abroad during the war, representing a capital sum due to the United States Government of  1,000 million at the present rate of exchange. They alone have been deprived, in the Allied interest, of foreign securities estimated at from  700 million to  800 million, which would otherwise substantially assist in the payment of the British debt in America. Notwithstanding these gigantic burdens, Great Britain made an offer at the Paris Conference of January last to forgo her rights to reimbursement of her damages, and expressed her readiness, by reducing the debts of the Allies, to treat her share of German reparations as if it were a repayment by her Allies of their debts due to her. It would be inequitable, and it is impossible, to ask the British taxpayer, already^ much more heavily burdened than his French and Belgian allies, to make further sacrifices by modifying the Spa percentages for the benefit of France and Belgium.18. &quot;Whilst the Belgian Government attach to their consent to an investigation by impartial experts of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay a condition which renders such consent of little value, the French Government reject the plan altogether, and appear to justify their refusal by putting a series of questions which might lead to an indefinitely protracted discussion at a time when prompt decision is of essential importance. As, however, M. Poincare has asked for answers on the several points which he has raised, they may be briefly given.19. Astonishment is expressed that anyone should question the justice of the Reparation Commission^ decision in fixing the total amount payable by Germany at 132 milliards of gold marks ( 6,600 million), and M. Poincare sees no reason why &quot; an estimate made to-day by experts, whoever they may be, should be more exact
than that made m 1921.&quot; It is not clear to what estimate of 1921 reference is made Ihe Reparation Commission^ finding of 132 milliards of gold marks was a simple estimate of the amount of the damages for which compensation was claimable under the treaty, without any regard to the question of Germany&apos;s capacity to pay them. It is true that the Schedule of Payments subsequently adopted, while purporting to provide for the payment of the&apos; full amount of the damages, in fact granted substantial concessions by extending the period of payment beyond that laid down in the treaty, and by waiving the payment of interest for a long period in respect of a large part of the debt. These concessions represented, even in the opinion of the rapporteur of the French budget, a virtual reduction by approximately one-half of the sum of 132 milliards, and the fact that they were approved by the Allied Prime Ministers in drafting the Schedule of Payments (subsequently accepted by the Reparation Commission) effectively answers the contention that the sum, as originally fixed, was not considered too high by anybody. At the same time, it cannot be said that the concessions were the outcome of anything that could be described as an expert enquiry into Germany&apos;s capacity to pay.20. The French Government are quite right in declaring that the duty of adjusting the Schedule of Payments to that capacity iri accordance with article 234 of the treaty is one which still remains to be discharged.21. They say that during the Peace Conference the American expert estimated Germany&apos;s capacity to pay at 120 milliard gold marks. His Majesty&apos;s Government have not been able to trace in their records any American expert estimate of 120 milliards, though they have found one of 60 milliards and another of 240 milliards. There was also a French estimate of 800 milliards ,and a British estimate of 480 milliards. The truth, of course, is that at that time there was no experience of attempts to establish and enforce inter-State obligations of such magnitude, to which experts could look for guidance. It is precisely because such experience has become available during the last five years that a fresh enquiry is urgently called for.22. The duty of making the ultimate decision rests in part on the Reparation Commission, and in part on the Allied Governments, seeing that, if circumstances necessitate a cancellation of any part of the capital debt, the specific authority of the several Governments represented on the commission is required. It is a duty which must, in terms of the treaty, be performed with sole reference to the resources and capacity of Germany. The Governments represented on the commission, in deciding whether or not to authorise the cancellation of a part of the German debt, are in the position of trustees, since the interests affected are not only their own, but also those of the Governments not represented on the commission a consideration which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to think the French Government must have overlooked when stating that &quot; France will never consent to such cancellation except in the proportion in which her own war debts may be cancelled.&quot;23. An enquiry, therefore, by impartial experts into German capacity, held to assist the Reparation Commission, and (should a cancellation of a part of the debt be regarded as necessary) the Allied Governments to carry out their duties under that article, clearly cannot be held to violate any principle expressed or implied in the treaty.24. Both the French and the Belgian notes dwell on the special qualifications of the Reparation Commission to carry out itself any necessary enquiries. This is a claim which cannot be sustained without serious qualification. In the absence of an American representative (as originally contemplated), France and Belgium are . in a position, with the aid of the casting vote of the French chairman, to carry any resolution over the heads of the British and Italian representatives, and it is notorious that in these circumstances the commission has become in practice an instrument of Franco-Belgian policy alone.25. The French Government ask how it is proposed that the impartial expert commission should be constituted. His Ma;jesty&apos;s Government consider that the more comprehensive its constitution, the greater will be the value of its findings. They would willingly see upon it nominees, not only of the Powers entitled to reparation, but of the United Stal.es of America, of Powers which took no part in the late war, and, it would seem desirable, of Germany herself. If, however, the French Govern-ment would prefer any other form of constitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be happy to consider it.26. As regards its relation to the Reparation Commission and to the Amea Governments : while for their own part His Majesty&apos;s Government would be entirely willing to enter into an agreement by which the several Governments would bma
1.7themselves; in advance to recommend to the Reparation Commission the acceptance of the findings of the body of experts, they would, if the French and Belgian Govern ments are not prepared to go so far, be content that the functions of the experts should be advisory only.27. Both the French and Belgian notes challenge the British contention that it is in the best interest of the Allies that whatever figure be finally decided upon as representing: Germany&apos;s total liabilities, it should, be accepted by the German Government as just and reasonable. They point to the fact that the German Government have, in the past, repeatedly failed to act up to their undertakings.28. His Majesty&apos;s Government remain of opinion that an undertaking freely entered into; because acknowledged to be just and: reasonable, stands, in practice, on a different footing, and offers better prospects of faithful execution, than an engagement subscribed under the compulsion of an ultimatum, and protested against at the very moment of signature as beyond the signatory&apos;s capacity to make good. The Reparation Commission itself, as well as the Principal Allied Governments, has had, on occasion, to recognise that the Overman Government was not in a position to carry out particular obligations which it had been compelled to undertake.29. It will be remembered that the suggestion of an enquiry by experts, of which the first idea originated with the American Secretary of State, included a voluntary engagement by the German Government to accept and give effect to whatever conclusions the- experts might arrive at. His Majesty&apos;s Government are not convinced that such an engagement deserves to be treated as of no value.30. The subject of the occupation of the Ruhr gives rise to a number of propositions in the French note to. which it is necessary to reply. Whilst His. Majesty&apos;s Government have indicated their readiness to join in advising the German Government to withdraw without delay the ordinances and decrees which have organised and promoted passive resistance, they cannot subscribe&quot; to the thesis that passive resistance must cease unconditionally because it is contrary to the Treaty of Versailles.31. France and Belgium hold that the occupation has been effected in virtue of the authority conferred by paragraph 18 of Annex II to Part VIII of the treaty. The German Government have consistently contended&quot; that such an operation does not, on a proper interpretation of that paragraph, fall within the category of &quot; economic and financial prohibitions and reprisals and in general such other measures as the respective Governments may determine to be necessarv in the circumstances.&apos;&apos;32. The highest legal authorities in Great Britain have advised His Majesty&apos;s Government that the contention of the German Government is well founded, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have never concealed their view that the Franco-Belgian action in occupying the Ruhr, quite apart from the question of expediency, was not a sanction authorised by the treaty itself. But they would be quite willing that this or any other difference respecting the legal interpretation of vital provisions of the treaty in so far as they cannot be resolved by unanimous decision of the Reparation Commission under paragraph 12 of Annex II whether arising between the Allied Governments and the German Government,&apos; or between different Allied Governments, should automatically be referred to the Internationa] Court of Justice at The Hague or other suitable arbitration.33! The French Government have endeavoured to convict His Majesty&apos;s Government of inconsistency in now refusing to acknowledge the legality of the occupation of the Ruhr under paragraph 18 of Annex II, when on two former occasions they joined in the presentation of ultimata threatening such occupation, and when, in 1920 they actually participated in the occupation of Dusseldorf, Duisburg and Ruhrort. There is no inconsistency. The action then taken or threatened was never claimed to be in pursuance of the reparation clauses of the treaty. The Allies jointly decided to threaten Germany with the occupation of further territory just as they might have threatened her with a renewal of war, for her failure to perform her treaty obligations, some of which had no connection whatever with reparations.34. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it cannot legitimately be claimed that the measures which the Allies are, under paragraph 18 of Annex II, authorised to take in certain emergencies, include the military occupation of territory. Such occupation forms the subject of the special provisions of Part XIV of the treaty, dealing with guarantees. It is the right to occupy the left bank of the Rhine and the bridge-heads, which has been given to the Allies &quot; as a guarantee for[12587] 13
the execution of the treaty.&quot; Moreover, article 430 particularly stipulates that if the Reparation Commission finds that Germany-refuses to observe the whole or part of her obligations under the treaty with regard to reparations, the whole or part of the occupied territories, which may have already been evacuated, &quot;will be immediately reoccupied.&quot; It would have been idle to stipulate expressly for such reoccupation in case of default on reparations, if the Allies had already an unlimited fight to occupy any German territory under another clause of the treaty.35. If His: Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto abstained from formally contesting the legality of the Franco-Belgian occupation, as an act authorised by the treaty, they have done so solely.in conformity with the spirit of the declaration, made by Mr. Bonar Law at the Paris Conference in January last, that His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to avoid causing any needless embarrassment to their Allies. This should not be made a reproach to them. His Maiesty&apos;s Government would not -even now have taken up this question of legality had they not been challenged to do so.36. The French and Belgium Governments argue that if only Great Britain had joined in the occupation there would have been no passive resistance and&quot; an abundant flow of reparation payments would have been assured. Holding the views which they did, both as to the legality and the practical value of the operation, it was not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take part in it. But even if they had done so, and even if passive resistance had never been started or were now coming to an end, it is not clear how this would bring the problem of reparations appreciably nearer to a solution.37. The French Government have now declared that the object with which they entered the Ruhr was not the prompt or complete payment of reparations, but the breaking of GermanyV resistance and the creation of the will on her part to pay. But the will to pay is useless without the power, and Germany&apos;s power to pay is, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, likely to be rapidly diminished, and in the end extinguished altogether, by a continuation of the occupation with its stranglehold on the most important centre of the most productive and the most highly and delicately organised of German industries.38. The parallel which the French Government seek to draw with German action in 1871 can hardly be sustained. It is true that Germany refused to quit the French departments which she occupied with her forces until the indemnity of 5 milliards had been paid. But this occupation was expressly provided for by the Preliminaries of Peace of 1871. No similar authority can be cited in the case of the Ruhr, and the real analogy in the present case is the occupation of the left bank of the Rhine, as provided for by the treaty, and from this no one has proposed to depart.39. Further, it may be pointed out that the recovery after the short campaign of 1870-71 of an indemnity equivalent to 4 milliards of gold marks (a considerable percentage of which could be immediately covered in gold, and against which credit was given for the value of property in ceded territories, involving no actual expenditure by France beyond internal payments in compensation for the interests of French nationals dispossessed) is not really comparable to the enforcement of a thirty-three fold claim against a country financially exhausted by four years of strenuous warfare and blockade. The ease with which the indemnity imposed in 1871 was paid was largely the result of the credit facilities which France was able to obtain.. Germany has, on the other hand, suffered from a complete inability, to obtain foreign loans, arising to a large extent from the long period which elapsed before her reparation liabilities were defined, and the world-wide uncertainty as to her ability to discharge them. Yet, in spite of this, it is fair to state, though His Majesty&apos;s Government are by no means satisfied with the performance, that Germany has iri fact paid in respect of reparations and the cost of the armies of occupation, more than twice the. amount exacted from France in 1871, as well as considerable sums in connection with the clearing offices and miscellaneous treaty obligations.40. The French Government are in error in attributing to His Majesty s Government the suggestion that simultaneously with the advice to be given to Germany to abandon^ passive resistance, the Ruhr must be made to return to normal conditions, of production. The suggestion made in the British note of the 20th July was that -proposals should be made for the restoration of the Ruhr to that condition which will enable it to become an area of fruitful production, rather than one of international strife. His Majesty&apos;s government confess to a sense of surprise and disappointment at the difficulties apparently felt by the French and Belgian Governments in agreeing to so reasonable and so advantageous a proceeding.
H&apos;: 1941. Although, in words of some , vagueness, it is, intimated that France and Belgium may, when satisfied that passive resistance has ceased, consult together as to how: far they may find it possible to lighten the burden, which the military occupation of the Ruhr lays on the region, nothing tangible is suggested which would hold out any hope of the occupation being brought to an end, even when the avowed object of breaking Germany&apos;s will to resist has been attained.42. His Majesty&apos;s Government believed that they were, showing the fullest consideration for.the position of France and Belgium, as well as ensuring the more effective guarantee of continued and steady payments, when they suggested that the occupation would naturally terminate from the moment that guarantees or pledges, less economically harmful, and more effectively productive, than the. occupation of the Ruhr, should have been not merely devised and obtained, but seen to be satisfactorily operating.    ,, &apos;   , , ,43. Even this suggestion is met by a definite refusal. Both the French and the Belgian Governments emphatically declare that there can be no question of evacuation except in proportion as payments are made by the German Government. Complete evacuation is apparently not contemplated until the total German reparation liability is integrally discharged. The reiterated announcements to this effect, coupled with r,he insistence on leaving undiminished the total of 132 milliards of German indebted-ness under the head of reparations, can only be interpreted as an intention to remain in occupation of the Ruhr for a number of years, which, at best, cannot be less than thirty-six (this being the minimum period over which the discharge of the debt is spread under the Schedule of Payments) and which, in view of the generally admitted improbability of the complete execution of the schedule being found practicable under any circumstances, may be extended indefinitely, if not in perpetuity. .44. Such a situation,: of which the political, quite apart from the economic, consequences could only be described as disastrous, cannot but be viewed by His Majesty&apos;s Government with the greatest concern. It would vividly conjure up the danger of international relations being affected in a manner threatening-to use the words of the 11th article of the Covenant of the League of Nations to disturb international peace and the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends. His Majestj^s Government cannot believe that the French and Belgian Governments will be able to reconcile the opinion of the world, to the indefinite maintenance of so perilous a situation.45. As it is, the occupation of the Ruhr is already having directly and indirectly a grave effect on the economip and industrial outlook,, not only in Germany, whose capacity to pay reparations is rendered more and more precarious, but in the rest of Europe, if not the world, and not least in this country.46. In their note of the 20th July, His Majesty&apos;s Government further proposed that in order to arrive at a comprehensive plan for a general and final financial settlement, inter-Allied discussions should be opened with as little delay as possible. The Belgian Government reply that they will be glad to discuss such a plan if it be of the character that they have predicated in their note. The French Government, whilst questioning the propriety and apparently the legality of the suggestion, asks what exactly it means and whether it will include the question of inter-Allied debts. His Majesty&apos;s Government gladly, avail themselves of this opportunity to explain their attitude on this subject. I have accordingly the honour to enclose a separate memorandum upon it. . The main principle of the British scheme is that Great Britain is ready, subject to the just claims of other parts of the Empire, to limit her demands for payment by the Allies and by Germany together to a net sum approximating 14-2 milliards of gold marks, this sum representing the present value of the recently funded British debt to the United States Government. The concessions which His Majesty&apos;s Government may be able to offer in respect of inter-Allied debts must accordingly depend largely on the percentage of this sum of 14-2 milliards which they can recover from Germany. They can only be granted in a substantive form when the general reparation settlement &quot;for which His Majesty&apos;s Government are pressing bas been agreed upon, and is such that His Majesty&apos;s Government can regard their share of the German payments as an asset of real financial value.-47. To this end the first&apos;step must be to fix the maximum sum which the Allies can reasonably hope to recover from Germany, to be followed, or accompanied, by arrangements&apos;which will ensure the effective ^establishment of Germany&apos;s finances and credit on a sound basis, and. will guarantee the punctual payment of the German debt by a system of control free from the economically unsound impediments inherent in the military occupation of the Ruhr.   .   - .   - ...
48. In the last paragraph of their letter, His Majesty&apos;s Government offered to discuss sympathetically the question of future security with- their allies The Belgian Government warmly welcome this offer. They will not, however, have failed to notice the remark of the French Government that the object has nothing to do with the Ruhr, and the consequent further postponement of the discussion to an unnamed date in the future. The Belgian Government will recollect from the discussions of 1922 that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to enter into anv arrangement respecting the territorial security of Belgium apart from a similar arrangement in regard to France. Having regard to the now declared indifference of the French Government, no useful purpose can be served by pursuing the matter.49. The argument which has been put forward in this note may be summarised as follows: 50. His Majesty&apos;s Government have at no time contemplated and do not now contemplate that Germany shall be relieved from all reparation payments. They are determined that Germany shall pay, up to the maximum of her capacity, the repara-tion to which Great Britain, equally with the other Allied Powers, is entitled, and which is needed to make good the losses sustained by this country in common with her allies.51. What Germany&apos;s maximum capacity for payment may be is a matter which should be determined by impartial enquiry into the facts. It cannot be ascertained by casting up the amounts which Germany&apos;s creditors would like to receive. To ask for more than Germany&apos;s maximum capacity cannot assist in the actual recovery of reparations. It can only destroy the assets which Germany can offer to the Allies. To force liquidation is not the most profitable way of making recovery from a debtor with resources.52. It is admitted that Germany can only make substantial payments if, by the restoration of her public finance and a stabilisation of her currency, a surplus is made available for reparation on her budget. Moreover, this surplus must be in a form in which it can be made available for external payments over the foreign exchanges. External debts cannot be paid by the collection of depreciating paper marks. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government forcible interference with the economic life of Germany, even if it be consistent with the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, cannot assist in the necessary restoration. Not only will it prevent the realisation of any surplus for reparation, but, by intensifying the disorder of German finance and currency, it will have the gravest reactions on trade.53. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, regard as doomed to failure the method pursued by the French and Belgian Governments to secure reparations. In spite of wholesale seizures, the occupation-of the Ruhr by France and Belgium has produced, at great cost, less receipts for the Allies, notably of coal and coke, than were forthcoming in the previous year. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the resulting situation involves great and growing danger to the peaceful trade of the world and, not least, of this country. His Majesty&apos;s Government regard a continuance of the present position as fraught with the gravest risks, both economic and political. They consider the impartial fixation of Germany&apos;s liability at a figure not inconsistent with her practical power of making payment a matter of great urgency; and they have suggested what appears to them to be an appropriate means to this end.54. When steps have thus been taken to ascertain the real value of the asset represented by German reparations, and to secure its realisation without further depreciation, His Majesty&apos;s Government will -be ready to deal, as generously as circumstances permit, and in the light of their respective capacity to pay, with the d.3bts due to Great Britain by her allies, They cannot, having regard to the heavy material losses of this country, both during and since the war, and to the future tax burdens on its trade, admit that other countries are justified in claiming that the agreed percentages of reparation payments should now be further modified or changed in order of priority. But they remain prepared to ask for no more in respect of the very large sums due by their allies than will, together with reparation payments by Germany, meet the British war debt to the United States Government. Their policy in this matter is stated in the British proposal laid by Mr. Bonar Law before trie Paris Conference in January last, and has not changed. It means that Great Britain would be prepared to waive&quot;, in the interest of a complete general settlement, a ven large part of the amount for which the British taxpayer holds the due obligations oi Allied Governments. ..55. Tt is the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the above explanations will convince the French and Belgian Governments of the reasonableness of tiie
British position, and will win their assent to its acceptance. They are reluctant to contemplate the possibility that separate action may be required in order to hasten a settlement which cannot be much longer delayed without the gravest consequences to the recovery of trade and the peace of the world.I have, &amp;c.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.Enclosure.Memorandum on Inter-Allied Debts.IT is, in the Opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, hopeless to deal satisfactorily with the question of inter-Allied debts until a better estimate is made of the amounts which Great Britain, on the one hand, and her allies, on the other, aie likely in fact to be able to recover from Germany for reparations.2.. His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to the policy, which their predecessors have formally announced, of limiting Great Britain&apos;s total claim against her Allied debtors and Germany together to the amount necessary to cover the British debt to the United States Government, which, as recently funded, may be taken to be represented, on a 5 per cent, basis, by a sum of 14-2 milliards of gold marks, present value. This basis is already exceedingly favourable to the Allies as the British debt to the United States Government cannot be redeemed on such favourable terms.3. This offer, in effect, means that Great Britain (whose material war damages were not less than one-third of those suffered by France) is content to forgo her rights to reparation under all heads, and to treat her own share of the German payments as if it were a reimbursement by her allies of their debts to her.4. Nay, the total amount for which she asks from the Allies and Germany together is, in fact, less than the amount of the Allied debts, being limited to the total of the British debt to the United States Government, without regard either to loans raised by Great Britain in the open American market or to the value of the American securities (estimated at  700,000,000 to  800,000,000) used to finance the Allied cause in America before the entry of the United States into the war, the loss of which, from, the economic point of view, is the equivalent of the contracting of an equal amount of foreign debt.5. Of the sum of 14-2 milliards gold marks, Great Britain is anxious to recover as large a percentage as possible from Germany, in order to be able to offer the maximum concessions feasible in regard to inter-Allied debts. But it is not possible for her to grant such concessions in a substantive form unless and until such a reparation settlement has been arrived at as will enable her to regard her share of the German payments as an asset of real financial value. His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly fear that a persistence- in the policy indicated in the French note will make the prospects of such a settlement remote.6. The only practical manner in which, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the question of inter-Allied debts can now be approached, is for the Allies to agree in the first instance upon the maximum sum which they can reasonably hope to recover from Germany. When such an agreement has been arrived at, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared (provided that the settlement is such as to make the German obligation a reasonably good asset) to write down,, with due regard to the different circumstances of the respective debtors, the Allied debts owing to them, to an amount representing the difference between the British share of the revised German obligation and the British debt of 14-2 milliards to the United States Government, and even to consider accepting payment of the Allied debts so reduced in the form of the new German obligations on the principles laid down in the plan presented by Mr. Bonar Law at the Paris Conference in January last.7. They cannot, however, conceal from the French Government the fact that this latter suggestion is less attractive to them than it was then, inasmuch as the deterioration in the financial prospects of Germany, resulting, as they hold, from the unwise policy pursued by the French and Belgian Governments, has made the security represented by German reparation bonds much more precarious (even if the total obligations should be reduced below the figure contemplated by His Majesty.&apos;s Government seven months ago).[12587] e
8. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel bound to observe in this connection that the willingness which they and their predecessors have shown to discuss with the French Government arrangements under which the burden of the French debt to Great Britain might be mitigated must not be interpreted as a waiver on their part of their rights as creditors, which are governed solely by the contracts under which the money was advanced and the securities which they hold.9. That a French Government Treasury bill given to the British Government for value received is a less binding obligation than a similar bill given to a private investor is a doctrine inadmissible both in itself and more especially in view of the circumstances in which these particular loans were contracted.10. The normal course would have been for the French Government to appeal directly to the British investor for the accommodation it required, and that procedure was in fact adopted for a short period at the commencement of the war. It soon became apparent, however, that the French Government would be unable to raise on its own credit amounts sufficient to meet its sterling requirements, and the British Government stepped in and gave its own securities to the lender for the amounts raised to cover French requirements as well as British. By this means the French Government were able to borrow indirectly from British lenders both on less onerous terms and to a larger amount than would have been possible if the normal procedure had been followed. The payments due on the French Treasury bills thus represent amounts which the British Treasury is in fact paying to the holders of securities issued, on behalf of the French Treasury of which the French Treasury received the proceeds.11. There was no suggestion when the loans were made that the repayment should be dependent on recoveries from Germany. Indeed, during the greater part of the period covered by the advances, the prospects of any such recoveries were highly problematical. The bills were made subject to renewal for a limited period only after the end of the war, with the clear intention that as soon as French credit was sufficiently re-established they should be redeemed out of French Government loans to be raised on the London market, the redemption money being applied to the cancellation of the British securities issued on French account.12. While His Majesty&apos;s Government have, by continuing to renew the bills beyond the period of the contract, tacitly recognised that the time has not yet arrived for giving effect to this intention, it must be clearly understood that, in the absence of a new agreement, the carrying out of it remains an obligation of the French Government which cannot honourably be repudiated, and that, in the meantime, the present practice of adding interest to capital cannot be indefinitely continued, and that a commencement of payment of at any rate a part of the interest should be made as soon as the sterling-franc exchange becomes reasonably stable.No. 5.Speech by Mr. Churchill in the House of Commons, December 10, 1924.(Extract from &quot; Hansard.&quot;)Air jHE British burdens in the war were not inferior to those borne by any other Allied nation. It is not right to use boasting words or to draw invidious comparisons, but when the duration of the effort, the loss of life and treasure, the influence exerted, and I may add the achievements gained by land and sea-when the whole of these is computed, weighed and measured, and justly weighed and measured, we are, I think, entitled to respect from every quarter. But if this was our share m the struggle, our financial burdens since the war have been incomparably greater than those of any other victorious Power. We paid all our own expenses m the war. We have discharged and are discharging all our liabilities punctually. We have not hitherto pressed any Allied debtor to meet its obligation, and this pphcy has imposed the greatest sacrifices upon the British taxpayer. No other victorious nation is making similar or equal sacrifices. The taxation of all classes is high, direct and indirect, but the rate of direct taxation in this country is higher than in any other country. And in this country we not only impose high taxes, but those taxes are paid by the tax-paying public. I shall have to say something-later on in the session, when we meet after Christmas, about the effect of the enormous direct taxation now weighing upon this country, about its effect on saving power
and upon enterprise in every form of industry. I shall try to trace its unseen repercussions through every tier and stage of the structure of our economic life.It is with this in our minds that this debate has been originated to-day, and it is as a nation sacrificing, paying, suffering, that we are bound to approach the grave and intricate issues connected with inter-Allied debts and reparations. But we do not need to overstate the case. There is one point upon which I might be permitted to correct the right hon. Member for Spen Valley (Sir J. Simon). He spoke as if we had lent  2,000,000,000, in round figures, to the Allies, and had, in addition, borrowed another  1,000,000,000 from the United States on their behalf. That is not the case. The total loan of Great Britain to the European Allies may be stated, approximately, at  2,000,000,000. Of this, we produced, roughly speaking, half from our own resources, and we contracted a debt equal to the other half,  1,000,000,000 roughly speaking, in the United States. But this latter  1,000,000,000 is not additional to the  2,000,000,000; it is comprised within that total. If we had not lent to the Allies  2,000,000,000, We should not have had to incur, in all human probability,  1,000,000,000 of debt to the United States. But we must not count that  1,000,000,000 twice over.The first main point in this matter, on which the mind should rest, is, of course, the Anglo-American debt settlement. Opinions have differed about that settlement. It is a settlement which commanded the support of the leading financial authorities in the City of London. It is a settlement which was advocated by the experts at the Treasury. It is a settlement which has been ratified by Parliament and accepted by the country. There have been different views about it. I have, been myself quoted as having expressed different views. My right hon. friend the Prime Minister is the last man in the world to resent a divergence of opinion, a sincere divergence of opinion, between persons perfectly free at the time, upon a matter admittedly highly complicated and in regard to which there have been the broadest differences of opinion between experts of unquestionable and unimpeachable authority. But whatever views may have been taken about the settlement or expressed about it, there can be no dispute in regard to two facts. First of all, the settlement has been made; it is done, and it must be made good. It forms the starting-point for all future discussions in the field of inter-Allied debts. That is the first point. The second point is this : It has placed us in an extraordinarily strong- position. &quot;We take oUr seats at the Council Board of Allied and Associated Powers under financial obligations to no one. We have no need to seek indulgence in ally quarter. Having met all Our liabilities as prescribed, having rigorously discharged every contract into which we have entered, we are entitled to rest ourselves with confidence upon the position of freedom and independence which we have regained. We have regained it not without great sacrifice, but it is ours and it is ours for ever.   We can look everyone in the face.This debt settlement was unquestionably the forerunner, the indispensable forerunner, of that consolidation and increasing establishment of our credit throughout the world on which our world-wide trade depends, and it is an essential foundation in all that improvement in the exchange between this country and the United States, and the maintenance of that exchange, which &quot;is a vital factor in the whole of our national and international finance. So much for the American debt settlement, which, I submit, should form the starting-point in the future treatment of the question of inter-Allied debts. What is the second great factor-in the problem, so far as we in this country are concerned? My right hon. friend the Member for Norwich referred to it in terms with which I am in full accord. It is the Balfour Note. That note, drawn up nearly three years ago, associated as it is with the name of a statesman revered throughout Europe, must in British eyes play a most important part in our future discussions on this subject. The Balfour Note was published before the settlement of the American debt Was effected, but we had already been invited by the United States to enter into negotiations for the funding cf the debt.What was the principle of the Balfour Note? It was that we would obliterate and delete all war debts owing to us if we were similarly treated by others in respect of similar debts owing to them. But it also said that if that was impossible, we should ask as much and ho more from Europe than the United States might find it necessary to require from us. That was the principle expressed in the Balfour Note at that date Three years have passed, and I think it may be broadly said, speaking on behalf of the Government, that it still forms the foundation of our policy in this matter. No one can say that it is a selfish or grasping policy. We [12587] E 2
paid our way in the war, and if we contracted these debts it has not been because of our own needs but because of the needs of Allies fighting on a common front And now&apos;the war is over and the victory has been won [Interruption] and the victory has been won [Interruption&apos;] we have not ceased to be proud of that fact  now that all is over and the victory has been won, we seek no more from Allies and enemies together than will enable us to recover the charges we are forced to pay on their account, and pay externally to the United States I repeat externally, because this involves prodigious effort, the effort of annual exportation, across a frontier, across an ocean, of an immense sum of money such as we are now regularly and continually discharging to the United States.In our desire to help Europe we have taken no account of our financial losses in the past. The  800,000,000 worth of dollar securities which we realised and sold in the war, before the United States entered into the war, to provide credit for ourselves and our Allies, we are not dwelling upon; our concern is solely with the external payments which we have to make. And in regard to these the Balfour Note, relating, of course, to the circumstances of the date of its publication -we have been discharging our liabilities for two and a half years since then-in regard to these the Balfour Note remains the settled policy of the Government, and is now affirmed for the third time in three successive Administrations.I must add a word of caution and of definition in this matter. Since the Balfour Note was published German reparations have become more real and prospectively more valuable. There is the 26 per cent, duty which the right hon. gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs, when Prime Minister, had the ingenuity to devise, and which the late Chancellor of the Exchequer not only reduced to 5 per cent., but had the courage, reversing his opinions on later and fuller knowledge, to raise again. [Interruption.] Was it not fuller information? [Laughter.] Well, I am quite ready to withdraw the compliment, and I base myself wholly on the fact that the duty was subsequently restored to the 26 per cent, level. Under this we may perhaps receive the equivalent of  10,000,000 this year and under the Dawes reparation scheme and the Spa percentages, if the revival of Germany and of Europe continue through years of peace, if peace is maintained  [hon. members : &quot;If &quot;] yes, if peace is maintained then we might eventually, as the House knows, receive some  25,000,000 a year in reparations from Germany. But no one can say how far these hopes will be realised or how soon they will be realised. The recovery of Germany may be delayed, The Dawes hopes may not be wholly fulfilled for many years, and I must say, dealing with the application of the principles of the Balfour Note to the existing European situation, that we do not feel able to make our efforts to attain the position aimed at in the Balfour Note, that is to say, parity in payments from Europe to Great Britain with payments from Great Britain to the United States we do not feel able to make our effort to attain that position depend upon the fruition of German reparations. The arrangements which we seek to make with our European Allies must be on such a basis as to safeguard us, within the limits of the Balfour Note, frOm the consequences of German default or failure. That I feel it necessary to say, and that is all I have to say, on the general question.There is one new aspect which has been brought into prominence lately and which was mentioned by both the right hon. gentlemen who have spoken from the Liberal benches on this subject. I mean the negotiations which we read in the newspapers have been taking place between France and the United States for an adjustment of Franco-American debts. My right hon. and learned friend the Member for Spen Valley (Sir J. Simon) asked whether there were negotiations in progress, and if so, what was their character. As far as His Majesty s Government understands there are no formal negotiations in progress, but there have been tentative enquiries and conversations. The matter has not advanced further than that at the present time, so far as we are aware. There is not. therefore, any necessity for a formal declaration on our part in regard to this matter at this moment. Speaking generally, I would venture to say we do not wish to hinder any arrangement for mutual benefit which mav be entered into between two friendly nations, allied or associated with us in the Great War. We consider it essential, however, that any payments made by our debtors in Europe to their creditors in the United States should be accompanied simultaneously vari passu by proportionate payments to Great Britain. That indicates the general scope and outline of the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Government will endeavour to pursue regarding inter-Allied debts in the months, and, I trust, in the years, which He
2a  -immediately before us, and I will also say that in pursuing this policy we shall be animated by a spirit of the warmest comradeship towards our friends and allies in the war, and we will sedulously avoid the use of any language or the indulgence in any mood which could possibly be a cause of offence and lead to a disturbance of the harmony which should exist.No. 6.Figures relating to National Wealth.Pke-Wae.

The French Government desire that all the other problems arising from the liquidation of the war be also approached and dealt with effectually. Knowing the cordial feelings animating the British Government, they are confident of obtaining that Governments help in the search for and study of praotical solutions by which the divergent interests may be brought into agreement.In the forefront of the problems to be solved is that of inter-Allied debts. The various British notes on this subject have always been inspired by the same principles, the examination of which the French Government, desirous of reaching an equitable and friendly settlement, is now prepared to resume. But, in order to continue this investigation, the French Government would wish to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to the principles set out in their previous notes, in particular that of Lord Curzon dated the 11th August, 1923, and how it would apply them.Very cordially yours,CLEMENTEL.
No. 8.M. Clementel to Mr. Churchill.(Translation.) Ministry of Finance,My dear Chancellor and Friend, Paris, January 12, 1925.YOU have, been good enough to tell me that you thought it preferable not&quot; to ask the British Cabinet to reply officially to the letter which I had the honour to send you on the 10th January until after your return to London, so as to enable you to give verbally to your colleagues information which will help them to reach a decision. I understand this attitude perfectly and can only thank you for the motives which inspire it, since after our semi-official conversation and your spontaneous statement in ,the House of Commons, I have every reason to think that after your intervention the decisions of the British Cabinet will be altogether satisfactory.Nevertheless, you know my position and the difficulties I should meet were I to accept for four years the distribution of German payments on the proposed basis without a connection between these payments and the inter-Allied debts, which in our opinion actually exists, being mutually established between us.You intended, as you were unable to reply at once on behalf of your Government to, the questions submitted in my preceding letter, to write acknowledging receipt of the latter, informing me that you would put it before the Cabinet at once, and telling me that it was understood that when France and England broached the study of the inter-Allied debts problem, all the factors conducive to settlement would be brought into consideration.I take the liberty of pointing out to you that this letter, if it is to enable me to sign the agreement prepared between us and the Governments represented at the Financial Conference, must contain definite statements relative to the utilisation of the percentages allotted to Great Britain by the Spa Agreement.Since we agreed at the outset of our conversations to lay all the cards on the table, I feel obliged to remind you at this stage of the reasons which led the representatives of the Finance Committee of the Chamber, in order to reserve the future, to ask me, failing confirmation by the British Government of the terms of the proposals contained in the statements of previous Governments which are mentioned in my letter, to accept only for one year at most the distribution of the annuities to be received from Germany in execution of the Dawes plan, so as to be able to connect, if the circumstances so require, the question of the division of the percentages with that of the settlement of debts.These reasons are set forth in a note which you will find enclosed herewith, and which summarises the arguments advanced in support of this point of view.It is quite understood that if the present British Cabinet adhere, as I am convinced they will, to the terms of the above-mentioned declarations, and particularly that of Lord Curzon, dated the 11th August, 1923, all idea of a revision of the percentages will be abandoned and the French Government will be willing to approach along with the British Government the study of the problem of inter-Allied debts on the basis of the Bonar Law7 and Curzon notes, with the aim of attaining an equitable and friendly settlement.I beg, therefore, that pending the decision of the Cabinet, you will assure me in the interim reply which you intend to send me, that in the event of a refusal the question will remain open, that all the factors which go to constitute the problem as a whole will be brought into consideration yvithout the signature of the protocol of the present Financial Conference being brought up in opposition to a French request for revision of the percentages, the division fixed in this case for four years not being susceptible of consideration by the British Government as a ratification of any sort on the part of France of the Spa percentages, on account of the express reservation which I am obliged to make to cover the possibility that the agreement for Which we are hoping may not materialise.I have, &amp;c. (Signed)&quot;        CLEMENTEL.
Enclosure in No. 8.Summary of Observations submitted to Ihe Minister of Finance by th: Representatives of the Finance Commission of Chamber of Deputies.THE most important agreements regarding the apportionment of reparations were reached in December 1919 before the final appraisement of the damages, and at a time when the Allies unanimously counted upon receiving complete reparation.These agreements were confirmed at Spa, with minor alterations, in an equally optimistic spirit on all sides as far as future German payments were concerned.Insistence on these percentages for the distribution of payments, now reduced by the application of the Dawes plan, would be inequitable, even if the damages would bear comparison, since they would involve for the various allies a definite loss proportionate to their respective damages, thus inflicting a greater reduction on those who have the most damage to repair.In fact, the different categories of damage are not comparable. Ever since the Peace Conference the Americans have contested the right of the Allies to claim compensation for personal damage (pensions and allowances). France and Great Britain have upheld the opposite thesis, which has prevailed.I attach a table recapitulating the damages suffered, as submitted by the Allied Powers to the Reparation Commission. Study of this document shows that Germany is now only liable, in virtue of the application of the Dawes plan, to make payments inferior to the total of material damages, and makes apparent the reasons of equity which render it necessary that the Allies should proceed to a fresh scheme of division on the basis of material damages only.Without entering here into an exhaustive sttidy of the question, it will be sufficient to submit, as examples, the following observations : The material damages themselves are not comparable one with another. Whilst damages on land have been valued at their cost of reconstruction, those at sea have been appraised as at the date of their loss.This method of valuation would suffice to justify a revision of percentages, even if the losses in-tonnage really constituted damage to the Powers under whose flags the vessels sailed.As a matter of fact it is no such damage. Losses of vessels are borne neither by the shipowner, nor by the insmrer, nor by the Government whose flag is flown by the vessel. Maritime damages are in reality suffered by the consumers, all the insurance charges being translated into increased prices of commodities, and, although a portion of this charge fell upon the British consumers, a large part was sustained by consumers all over the world, and particularly those in Allied countries. It has, moreover, never occurred to any Government to admit a right to reparation against itself by owners of ships or cargoes.On the other hand, British official documents show that during the war shipowners realised considerable profits. These profits, as well as those of numerous industries which received from the Allies orders for merchandise and materials needed for defence purposes, have been subjected to considerable levies in the form of various taxes, notably the war profits tax, which have been collected by the Treasuries of the lending countries, and which it is fair to take into account.It can be assumed that the total expenses which the French Government has had to enter upon or will have to provide shortly for the reparation of direct damage to property will reach 111 milliards of paper francs, or 22 milliards of gold marks. The French share of the annuities of the Dawes plan reaches (if one admits as the present value of the reparations part of this plan the figure, undoubtedly too small, of 34 milliards of gold marks established by the British experts at the preliminary conference held in Paris last month) a theoretical total less than 18 milliards of gold marks.The outlay which the French Government has had or will have to effect for reparations of their damages to property alone will thus be greater than the value of the receipts which they can expect from Germany. On the contrary, it does not appear that the British Government have to expend for the reparation of damages to property sums corresponding to the payments which they should receive from Germany.
No. 9.Mr. Churchill to M. Clementel.My dear M. Clementel, January      1025OUR position is that the Spa percentages have been definitely fixed by international agreement, and we should be opposed to reopening the question. 1 cannot therefore do more than take note of the reserves which you have found it necessary to make. Nothing of course in the present agreement engages your Government to any additional degree in respect of these percentages.Yours very sincerely,WINSTON S. CHURCHILLNo. 10.Mr. Churchill to M. Clementel.My dear M. Clementel, Paris, January 13, 1!)25.DURING my visit here you have raised in an unofficial and tentative form the question of the repayment of the French debt to Great Britain, and have expressed to me the desire of the French Government that this matter shall be the subject of future conversations. I have received these intimations with pleasure. His Majesty&apos;s Government had been inclined to expect the question to be raised, and it is certainly more appropriate that the initiative should have been spontaneously taken by France. I had not contemplated, during my visit here on this occasion, that any questions of method, terms, or conditions would present themselves, and therefore I have not so far obtained any instructions from the British Cabinet in this sphere. You have written me a letter asking that His Majesty&apos;s Government should define its position in regard to the Balfour note and the Curzon declaration of the 11th August, 1923. I have transmitted your letter to my colleagues, and I can assure you that as soon as I return to London we will take the whole matter into prompt and earnest consideration, and will endeavour to send you an answer which will place the French Government in a position to present us with definite proposals.Meanwhile, I can only repeat that the Balfour note remains for us a dominating guide of principle set up freely by our own hands. We shall approach the discussion of the settlement of the French debt to Great Britain in the same spirit of loyal comradeship which led us safely through the agony and perils of the war, and will alone enable us to surmount the vexations and difficulties which remain after the military victory has been won.Believe me, &amp;c,WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.oMaritime damage is, in reality, an indirect damage; it is, further, damage to whole world. On this double ground it should give precedence to other material damages once the latter are not themselves covered by the payments.Furthermore, losses at sea received immediate reparation considerable in amount through the handing over of the German fleet. The relative importance of this reparation was all the more appreciable in that, by virtue of the Spa Agreement, the ships surrendered are only shown in the reparations account at two-fifths of the value that the Reparation Commission had to assign to them later.
