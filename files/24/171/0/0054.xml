BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY* S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Memorandum by ,the Minister of Labour.THE ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION.SECRET. CP. 54(25)My colleagues expressed a wish to know more about the activities of the Electrical Trades union, espeoially in London.     I circulate accordingly a note dealing with this subject,(Initialled)   A.S-M,Ministry of Labour, 3rd February, 1925.
ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION.1, .      The Eleotrleal Trades Union is a comparatively young organisation which developed greatly in numbers and in strength during and immediately after the War.     Though it is ranked as one of the craft unions, it does not at present profess to have any craft tests for membership, and it has tended to develop to a oertain extent upon an industrial rather than a craft basisj    its members Include semi-skilled and even unskilled men.     Its membership numbers probably about 30,000,     The Headquarters is in Manchester, but the organisation is strongest and most complete in London, 2, The principal branches of industry in which membersof the Union are employed are(a) electricity supply undertakings;(b) Electrical contracting (i,e., principally, wiring forelectric light and power) and cable laying;(c) To some extent the manufacture of electricalappliances ,(d) As maintenance men throughout the industrial estab-lishments and in government and business offices and private buildings, 3,        The main strength of the Union lies &quot;in its position in the Electricity Supply industry.     It is not equally strong in all part3 of the country, but more of the skilled men in the industry belong to it than to any other organisation. It has an amioable working arrangement with the general unions, who cater in the main for the unskilled men in spite of some overlapping of membership, but there Is a good&apos;deal of friction as to demarcation between the Electrical Trades Union and the electric Power Engineers1 Association, whioh caters for the assistant engineers and supervisory staff, the   men on whom/the
the employers in the main rely to keep the power stations going in the event of a strike.    The line of demarcation varies.    Thus in some undertakings switchboard attendants belong to the electrical Trades Union and in other parts of the oountry mainly to the Eleotrio Power Engineers&apos; Association.     One large local authority has made it a rule that members of the Electrical Trades Union who are promoted to but posts as that of sub-istation attendant must leave the Eleotrioal Trades Union and Join the Eleotrio Power Engineers&apos; Association.4. The members of the Union are on the average young and among them there are a number who hold   -extreme viexvs on political and social questions.    These men were more prominent in 1919 and 1920 than they are to-day, but there is a strong minority of the members, especially in London, who are constantly urging a forward and aggressive policy.     They are very conscious of the power conferred upon them by their position in the Electricity Supply industry.     A stoppage in the supply of. current immediately threatens the community at many points - public and private lighting, with its effect upon order and safety, transport in the tramways and eleotrio railways, the food supply in the refrigerating apparatus and the handling appliances at the docks, &amp;a.&amp; the motive power of many factories.     The London District Oommittee, though it has shed some of the wildest of its members, is an aggressive body impatient of the control whioh the Central Executive at Manchester seeks to exercise over it, and continually urged forward by the shop stewards and 0 the more violent members of the rank and file in the London power stations and railways.    Their secretary, Mr. W. J. Webb, is a man df pugnaolous instinots, who has acquired a reputation for extremism perhaps more lurid than he deserves,
5. So far as electricity supply undertakings are concerned,the power of the Union to take immediate action by way of a lightning strike has been curtailed by Section 31 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1919, whioh extends the provisions of Section 4 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  to electricity,    As a result of this extension of the Oonspiraoy Act to electricity, any person employed by an electricity undertaking who wilfully or maliciously breaks a contract of service,  with that undertaking, either alone or ia oombination with others, knowing that such action will deprive the inhabitants of any plaoe wholly or to a great extent of their supply of electricity, is liable to a penalty not exceeding  20 or to be imprisoned for a term not exceeding three months, with or without hard labour,     The effeot of this provision is that it is necessary for seven days1 notice to be given to an electricity supply undertaking before the men oan oease work.6.        Mainly as a result of the strength of the Union, comparatively high rates of wages and good conditions of employment have been obtained in the electricity supply and eleotrioal contracting industries.     Thus, in London in the electrical contracting industry the rate Is 1/lOd, per hour and the employers have agreed to the condition of the &quot;closed shop&quot;, that is to say, firms who are members of the electrical Contractors&apos; Association will not employ on what is classed as skilled work anyone but a member of the Eleotrioal Trades Union. Similarly in the elebtrioity supply industry, the rates are high, compared especially with engineering,     in the engineering industry, on the other hand, the Union have so far failed in a demand for higher rates both upon the manufacture of eleotr:i cal appliances (work in which the Amalgamated Engineering Union havo greater numbers engaged than they have) and on maintenance work       but generally speaking,      especially/in
in London, they have found that by the free use of threats they have as a rule been able to obtain immediate satisfaction of their demands on minor points without taking drastic action. Thus in 1924, when the Pulham Borough Council rejected a claim of their dustmen, the dustmen ceased work, and the dispute was settled Immediately by the Electrical Trades Union calling out their members in the Council&apos;s power station at Pulham, when the local authority immediately granted the dustmen&apos;s claim.7,        The resulting discrepancy between the rates and conditions of men of similar or identical qualifications in sheltered and unsheltered industries is very striking. Electrical workers are also employed in large numbers in the shipbuilding, shiprepairing and engineering industries and in these cases their conditions, which are settled in common with other skilled and other unskilled workers by agreement with the Shipbuilding, Shiprepairing or Engineering Employers Federations, are much lower.   For example in London the rates are as follows for an Electrical Fitter:-and throughout the country there are similar divergencies, the rates in Shipbuilding being even lower.     Similarly allskilled men&apos;s rates in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Industries are lower than those of the various grades in the Electricity Supply and Contracting Industries, which are not subject to foreign competition.   Thus those workers who manufacture electrical equipment are subject to much lower conditions than those who are directly conoerned with/theirEngineering Trade 60/11Shiprepairing 69/-Electrical contracting 86/-electricity Supply 84/245 &quot; 47 11 47     &quot;47 hours.
their use for the supply of current.8.        So far as rates of wages are eonoerned, the policy of the Union is not merely to safeguard existing contract-ing and supply rates, but to extend them wherever possible, and they profess to be ready to take drastic action to this end.     A recent instance was the dispute at Barking. There an engineering firm from Hebburn-on-Tyne were installing a switchboard and were paying their employees, whom they had brought from Hebburn, the Hebburn engineering rates plus outworking allowance.   The London Committee of the Electrical Trades Union claimed that the men should be paid electrical contracting rates and threatened to call out their members in all the London power houses in support of the demand.    A similar claim was made at Wembley during the installation of power plant there. 9.        On the question of the &quot;closed shop&quot; and the employment of non-unionists, the policy of the Executive of the Union is to press for the employment only of union members.   The Executive are probably content to maintain this as their policy without pressing it vigorously at present, but the London District Committee are insistent on the point   and they have made considerable progress in what is, in effect, a definite campaign to eliminate non-Unionism %o.the London Electricity Supply Power Stations. The strike which was threatened at Christmas in the Brompton and Kensington power station was on this point and it is the real issue in the present dispute with H.M. Office of Works.1
10.        The number of-workers in electricity supply undertakings in London is estimated at about 15,000. Of these probably not more than 50;&apos; are essential men by reason of special skill.     It is to be noted, however, that, besides skill, a knowledge of the particular equip-ment in each undertaking is necessary, a fact which makes more diffioult the replacement of the skilled men ordinarily employed.       In addition there are about 3,000 electrical employees on railways in London, of whom less than 50fo are highly skilled.     There are also about 12,000 electrical workers employed or available for employment in elootrioal contracting, maintenance, etc, in London. Of this total of about 50,000 electrical workers in London, it is understood that the Electrical Trades Union claim that about 15,000 are members of their society. This Is probably an exaggeration, hut they certainly in-oreased their membership in London in 1984. 11.        Part of this increase has been among the employees of the Metropolitan and London Eleotrio Railways and the Southern Railway, and there is reason to believe that they have suooeedod in organising these centres fairly oomplete-ly.     There are a number of outstanding points at issue with the Southern Railway, on whioh the London Oommittee have complained bitterly, and not altogether without excuse, of delay on the part of the railway company. Since last July, negotiations have been proceeding with the Metropolitan Railway on oertain minor wage questions. These have culminated in the Union giving seven days&apos; strike notice on 28th January, though the Railway Company have offered to submit the dispute to arbitration.     The Central/Executive
Executive of tho Union are supporting the men in this action.     The danger in all these small local disputes is of a sudden general extension of; the strike by the rank and file and the shop stewards^ action whioh the Union Executive may find or profess to find it impossi-ble to refuse to endorse, however much they may dis-approve of the shop stewards methods or existence. 12.        It is clearly most desirable in the public interest that further additional safeguards should be set up to interpose at least a longer period of delay before a threat of strike action can take effect in the electricity supply industry.     The industry has a very complete system of Joint Industrial Councils whioh has proved most useful in settling wage questions, but its machinery for1&apos; dealing with threatened disputes is im-perfeot.     The Ministry of Labour is endeavouring to get this organisation to consider the adoption of further voluntary means for avoiding any stoppage of work.     Thevviews recently expressed by labour leaders on the question of strikes In public services vital to the community do not indicate that any of the Unions con-oemed v/ould be likely to agree to any formal abnegation of the right to strike in power undertakings - or. to aoquiesoe in any attempt to curtail it by legislative action.5rd February, 1925.
