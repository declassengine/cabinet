[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1925.SECRET.39CP. 5 (25).cabinet.MARRIAGE ALLOWANCES IN THE NAVY.Pay of the services.(Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)THE First Lord of the Admiralty has put forward, a scheme for Marriage Allowances in the Navy, estimated to cost  350,000 a year.* He asks that a Co-ordinating Pay Committee, on the same lines as in 1919, under the Chairmanship of a sitting Cabinet Minister, be set up to consider this matter in conjunction with the other Services.In the spring of 1919 the pay of the lower deck was raised on the recommenda-tion of Admiral Jerram&apos;s Committee an exclusively naval body. These recommendations were accepted by the then Cabinet under duress and at the price of maintaining naval discipline. At the same time, the Admiralty recommended, likewise on the authority of an exclusively naval Committee, the Jerram-Halsey Committee, large increases in the pay of the commissioned ranks of the Navy. In this later case a Cabinet Committee was appointed, under the chairmanship of Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, consisting of two representatives of the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry and the Treasury respectively. This is the &quot; Co-ordinating Pay Committee &quot; to which the First Lord refers. The recommendations of the Fisher Committee were accepted with some modifications by the Cabinet. They represented the high-water mark of naval claims in a period when the cost of living was very much higher than it is now, when war standards of expenditure were still prevailing and when there was grave unrest in all the armed forces. Even in these circumstances the Admiralty made no proposals for distinguishing between married and unmarried officers. The rates proposed by them even in those spacious times were adequate in their opinion for married officers as well as for single.When the Committee proceeded to consider the allowances for Army Officers, it was decided to lay down two rates for the Lodging and Fuel and Light allowances, of which the higher was payable to married officers only, and to add a furniture allowance paid only to married officers. It is these differentiated allowances which are rather loosely spoken of as Marriage Allowances. It was open to the Admiralty at this juncture to modify their scheme so as to provide specially for married officers. They deliberately&quot; did not do so. Even with these allowances, however, the pay of the Army is age for age markedly less favourable than the pay in the Navy. The accompanying diagram A shows that the Naval Officer who happens to be employed on shore is invariably better off than the Army Officer of the same age. whether the latter is married or single. Diagram B compares the Naval Officer afloat with the single Army Officer and with the married Army Officer separated from his family by the exigencies of the Service. The Naval Officer is shown to be slightly worse off than the married Army Officer at two stages of his career, but the general advantage of a. naval career over a military career, even on this basis, is shown to be indisputable. Diagram C shows similarly the relative emoluments of the Naval Submarine Service with the Royal Air Force. When we consider the far greater proportion of loss which fell upon the officers in the Army than in the Navy[12446]* See CP. 506 (24).
in the late war and the greater loss among officers at present incurred in the Royal Air Force than in the Submarine Service, there are no grounds for placing the Naval Officer in a more favourable position in relation to his comrades in the other two Services than that which he occupies at present. Indeed, the whole tendency of present conditions the reduced cost of living, the burden of taxation, the reduction of wages from the 1919 level accepted over so many great industries, the possibility of further reductions being required if our competitive power is to be maintained tells in the direction of a general diminution of the pay of the fighting Services, and certainly not towards the increase of any one of them. All three Services have, in fact, recently accepted a uniform per cent, diminution of pay and pension.The raising of this isolated naval increase is at the present time apart from any question of merits specially inopportune. It is essential that a revision of the rates of pay throughout the Services should, as prescribed by the Government of 1919, be undertaken, without delay. We are still paying 25. Qd. a day for recruits in the Army and ordinary Seamen in the Navy and correspondingly high rates of pay throughout the scale. A British soldier on the Rhine costs at the present time three times what a French or Belgian soldier costs. The Navy to-day is maintaining less than a third of the pre-war fleet at approximately the maximum pre-war cost. Sir Alan Anderson&apos;s Committee, which reported in 1923, were in no doubt that, having regard to the remuneration of other walks of life, the emoluments paid in the non-commissioned ranks and in the junior ranks of commissioned officers were excessive. It is not possible to reduce the pay of men now serving, but all three Services are agreed that lower rates of pay- can be prescribed for future entrants. An obstacle&apos; has, however, arisen. The Army authorities are willing to make reductions in the Army pay of a more substantial character than those proposed by the Admiralty and Air Ministry, but the Army authorities are not willing to carry through their reductions unless equivalent sacrifices are made by the other Services. It is urgent that this deadlock should be relieved and a definite arrange-ment effected for all three Services. My colleagues will appreciate the increased difficulty of making such general reduction in the pay of the men of all the Services if, at the very moment, the officers of one Service and that the most fortunate-are to receive an additional advantage.W. S. c.Treasury, S.W.,January 2, 1925.
