[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 80 (25).[Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.][C 1246/1246/18] No. 1.Lord D&apos;Abernon to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (Received January 27.) (No. 44.)Sir, Berlin, January 22, 1925.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 2193 of the 12th December, 1924, transmitting a report* prepared by a representative of the Westminster Bank on a visit to Germany in November 1924.I have read this report with interest, and have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of memoranda by Mr. Addison, Mr. Thelwall and Mr. Finlayson containing their observations.I have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABERNON.Enclosure 1 in No. 1.Memorandum by Mr. Addison.ALTHOUGH it is really unnecessary to add anything to the experts&apos; remarks made by Mr. Thelwall and Mr. Finlayson on the enclosure to Foreign Office despatch No. 2193, except to say that I agree with them, I feel impelled to make some obvious comment suggested by the perusal of the report which was drawn up in November last by the agent sent to Germany by the Westminster Bank. Such comment can in the nature of things only touch on some of the points raised, and cannot, therefore, be considered to be in any way exhaustive. The question before us in all these discussions is, obviously, whether the financial, crisis through which Germany has passed was such as-to cripple her productive capacity for a considerable time, or whether we shall, in the near future, have to face severe German competition in the markets of the world.1. The first point on which it is possible to challenge the writer of the report is his statement in the first paragraph that there has been a &quot; complete economic downfall.&quot; He is no doubt using this term in a loose sense, but it is advisable in such matters to be precise in the choice of words. In my opinion-for what it is worth there, has never been an &quot;economic downfall,&quot; but merely a &quot;financial crisis,&quot; brought about in the manner described by Mr. Finlayson, which has necessitated a period of convalescence precedent to full recovery. The writer himself recognises that there is &quot; fixed wealth in Germany to-day to an extent almost as great as ever,&quot; but later on draws the false general conclusion &quot; that the relative expenses in many cases render the possessions onerous.&quot; I do not know what he means by this last sentence. As I wrote to the Foreign Office some two years ago, there are the same number of things in Germany as before the war, minus the loss occasioned by the Treaty of Peace, which has been estimated at about 13 per cent. There are-the same number of activities minus, again, this percentage. All that happened was that, owing to the insane policy of inflation, (1) these things and activities were-under-valued, and (2) the accumulation of surplus activities and values, i.e., working capital, disappeared. As soon as an attempt was made to remedy this state of affairs by stabilisation, it was inevitable that there should be a period during which, with, the object of restoring confidence, credit that is to say, grants in anticipation  would be severely restricted. The writer visited Germany while this process was in full operation, and he appears to have drawn the largely false deduction that this state of affairs was either permanent or was such as to be likely to last a long time, and, consequently, to cripple German industrial activity for a considerable period.2679   [12685]* See Cabinet Paper No. 4 (25).B
The process of stabilisation is well known. The best example in modern history is that of the method by which Napoleon put an end to the French assignats. Speaking broadly, Napoleon did exactly what Schacht did, and, if the process of recovery was remarkably rapid, this was due to a variety of circumstances into which it is not necessary to enter, including military successes, which opened up the way to economic expansion. It is natural that a banker who deals only in the manipulation of money should occasionally forget the nature of that which is his raw material and should confuse the temporary absence of that raw material, or, rather,- the lack of present supply owing to previous dissipation, with a real and permanent absence or restric-tion of the things and activities of which this raw material is but an expression. It is always dangerous for this reason to let a banker, as distinguished from a financial expert, loose on questions which are concerned with more things than the manipulation of money.Money is an expression of value and capital is the accumulation, expressed in terms of money, of past activities. It is this which has so largely disappeared in Germany, but it would be wrong to be too pessimistic about it, for confidence and the provision of sufficient accumulated energy from abroad will suffice to set the whole complicated economic machinery in motion within a comparatively short time. That such assistance from abroad is now gradually forthcoming is pointed out,by Mr. Thelwall and is confirmed by what one hears on all sides, while within ^the country itself the high prices ruling are undoubtedly due to a desire to accumulate working capital more rapidly than would have been necessary in ordinary circum-stances. This explains to a large degree another point to which I think attention should be drawn, and that is the high prices at present ruling in the internal ma. set We are faced with the curious phenomenon that, whereas, on a capitation basit,, taxation is much lighter than in the United Kingdom, and whereas wages and other elements in the process of production with the exception of railway transport are much lower than abroad, the price of the finished article, from cutlets to shirts, is infinitely higher than in other countries. The purveyor of the finished article uses the obvious argument that the cost of production is enormous, but this will not do. We know that it is not. There is one explanation, and one explanation only, of this disproportion between the cost of production and the sale price of the article produced, and that is that the seller (and the other intermediaries between the raw material and the ultimate purchaser) is adding not merely his profit plus taxation, but is allowing in full for his desire to recoup himself for past losses and to recon-stitute a working capital within a short period of time. That the finished article is bought at all is due, firstly, to the fact that nobody has been buying anything for several years and the time has come when he or she must refit himself or herself, and, secondly, to a fact which has nothing to do with finance, and that is that the purchaser, accustomed as he or she is to think in millions, as also to spend at once any money obtained for fear it should lose value, is ready to buy at any price and to spend beyond that which prudence dictates. There is, of course, a limit to this purchasing power, but within this limit buying is brisk for the above reasons.2. I do not understand what is meant by the continual reference to high taxation in this country. That there is very little interest to pay on a comparatively small public debt (about  160 million) is obvious. The total of the Reich and State budgets is at present, in round figures, about  400 million. When a full yield of the Dawes annuities shall have been reached, the total should therefore be about  525 million. How can it be contended that a country of 60 million inhabitants cannot bear a burden to this extent, when Great Britain has a budget of nearly  700 million? What is really meant is not that taxation is too high as a total at the present time, but that it is improperly distributed and weighs too heavily on certain categories of activities. Whether this be true or not, clearly the question is merely one of adjust-ment, and, although the complaint contained in the report that &quot; taxation costs and public services charges are so heavy that . . . . &quot; may be correct in particular instances, in the present transitional period it would be wrong to assume, as is left tc be inferred, that this temporary condition of affairs is not likely shortly to be remedied, and therefore to cease to operate as a positive hindrance to German com-mercial expansion. Nor do I think and in this I appear to be supported by Mr. Thelwall that it is correct to say &quot; that working costs are still so high that only orders for goods in which Germany specialises .... can be secured, and these are largely executed at a loss.&quot; So far as our experience goes, German competition would appear to be becoming serious in the international market. Some months ago a representative of an engineering firm in the north of England, in the course of
[12685]conversation with me, stated that his firm had lost a contract (I think for India) for the delivery of locomotives because the German tender was about  2,000 less for each locomotive than the lowest British tender, i.e.., the tender of his firm. The statement that such orders are &quot; largely executed at a loss &quot; is absurd. How can a German firm which, it is contended in another part ,of the report, cannot,obtain credits to enable it to tide over a bad time, afford to execute large,orders abroad at a loss ? The answer, of course, is that the statement is not true, except, perhaps, in a very few cases. Incidentally, the remark that orders are &quot; executed.at a loss &quot; is hardly to be reconciled with the assertion that &quot; dumping is not even in-sight.&apos;&apos; It is clear that the cost of production cannot he as high in Germany at the present time asin the United Kingdom. The report itself says that the average wage is about 30 gold marks a week, and that most skilled workers cannot,earn more. Capital charges, wages and taxation are all lower than in England. What remains? If, on this basis, orders from abroad are &quot; executed at a loss,&quot; all the elements which constitute dumping would appear to be present.3- The writer of the report appears to have committed the usual error which consists in relying upon one category of opinion for an appreciation of a general situation. He has obviously allowed himself to be influenced in his judgment by the statements of those who are most affected by the transitory conditions obtaining at the time when he visited Germany. It is a common mistake. The foreign Socialist attends a Socialist &apos;&apos; Bier-Abend &quot; and is convinced by his hosts that no one counts outside the ranks of the Socialist party. Another visitor happens to be present /at the unveiling of some war memorial and promptly writes to the &quot;Times&quot; that Germany is preparing for war in 1926. Reality is never quite so simple, and truth is/a1 compromise.Jr If German competition is not to be feared in the near future and German firms, in order to keep going, are obliged to execute orders at a loss (rather like the Sciliy Islanders who live by taking in each other&apos;s washing), then obviously foreign investors would be very foolish were they to purchase German industrial shares, even at the ruling prices. Yet the writer quotes without comment and thereby implies approval of the &quot;astonishment expressed on all sides&quot; that foreign buyers should not :be taking advantage of the bargains available.Clearly the banks, as also the Stock Exchange, are the worst source of informa-tion at such a time. Every stockbroker will tell you that Germany is ruined, by which he means that he is not making as much money as he would like to make, since transactions are on a cash basis and he requires speculation on credit.4. Although every line invites criticism, it is not necessary to say more in order to show that the. report should not be accepted as an accurate description of the present or as a proper anticipation of the future. If it were possible to give a bird&apos;s-eye view in a few brief remarks, I should, on the contrary, be inclined to say-(1.) That the stagnation in financial circles is due to obvious causes which are inevitable and purely transitory, (2.) That German business interests are in a comparatively sound position for . -competition in the near future, whatever may be their temporarydifficulties on the financial side. (3.) That such financial difficulties are being rapidly remedied and that, with theexception of certain agricultural interests and small businesses, foreign rin particular American capital is becoming increasingly available forsound enterprises, at from 8 to 10 per cent. (4.) That the low cost of productions-combined with high internal prices ispeculiarly favourable to a large expansion of German foreign trade inthe near future.(5.) That it is but natural that Germany should suffer from a universal complaint-lack of outlet -duo to a diminished world purchasing power. This is an absolute quantity.   The relative advantage remains.(6.) That German competition in the world markets should, in all probability, soonbecome severe and is already making itself felt to a certain extent.(7.) That from a commercial point of view, the Dawes payments act not so much as a .deterrent, but, to a certain extent, rather as a stimulant to export, whatever be their effect in other directions. - J. A.January 20, 1925.
Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Thelwall.I HAVE read the report carefully and have also had the figures checked. I think the statements on the first two pages are unduly pessimistic, and from the figures which we now see in the gold balance sheets it would certainly seem that it is quite wrong to say that &quot;most of the industrial concerns have lost their working capital and reserves.&quot; It is also not correct that only limited credits can be obtained at 18 per cent, per annum. Good concerns can get all the money they want for current use at 10 per cent, and an increasing number of loans are being given by America at from 7 to 9 per cent.With regard to taxation, it is true that it has been very heavy for the past year, but this represents a desperate effort in order to provide the Reich, the Federal States and the municipalities, all of whom had suffered much more from inflation than the business world, with fresh working capital, and the Ministry of Finance does not pretend that the present rate of taxation can be kept up. During the coming financial year, probably about April, a complete revision of taxation may be expected. It is calculated that it will be possible to balance the budget and provide for the payments under the Dawes scheme, while at the same time considerably reducing the present burden of taxation. We shall only then begin to feel the full effect of German competition, but the latter is quite serious enough even now. I have a long list of tenders all over the world which have been secured by Germans against international competition, and these successes are in addition to the continual under-selling of British goods which goes on in the ordinary course of trade.With regard to the banks, it is true that the leading Berlin houses show only about one-third of their pre-war capital in their gold balance sheets, but this does not by any means signify that 70 per cent, is actually lost. One of the chief reasons why so considerable a reduction of capital has been effected is that the banks have realised the importance of paying a dividend as soon as possible, and they are more likely to be able to do so on a small than an unduly large capital.The writer of the report seems to have skimmed rather lightly over some important aspects and accordingly to be a little misleading. He also seems to me to have accepted with much too uncritical a mind the repressing statements made to him by German bankers.F. T.January 13, 1925.Enclosure 3 in No. 1.Memorandum by Mr. Finlayson.WHILE I am disposed to agree that many of the observations contained in the memorandum represent a fairly accurate summary of certain conditions obtaining in Germany at the time, I consider that the writer has not given sufficient importance to the real, underlying causes which contribute to the &quot; complete economic downfall&quot; alluded to in the first paragraph of the report.The all-dominant factor was the policy of inflation, in regard to which it must be observed that the German Government authorities were not the only people at fault. Indeed they were cordially encouraged and actively supported by the banking and industrial interests, whose short-sightedness, selfishness and ignorance of the real issues contributed in a large measure to create the monster that was later to devour them all! For years the printing press disgorged its daily millions and milliards and billions; money was dirt cheap, as the Reichshank discounted anything presented to it in the shape of a bill; internal prices in Germany fell far below the world market prices and exports boomed; as the mark lost caste in Germany itself people refused to save in specie, and all available cash being turned into goods, the home production market was prosperous. In the circumstances, while the industry appeared to be battening on a false boom, the Reich finances were ruined. Receipts from taxation were only sufficient to meet a mere percentage (4 per cent, to 8 per cent.) of the outgoings.In November 1923 the system was completely changed by the stabilisation of the Rentenmark. The boot was placed on the other foot and industry was not long in finding that a new set of masters had arisen.   Dr. Schacht, true to the economic
o^TIS-r^CTr.&apos;&quot;&quot;-: -^-^-^ ....   ..principles that underlie currency questions, shut down all credits and make the Rentenmark &quot;dear&quot; by the process of scarcity. At the same time Dr. Luther, as Reich Finance Minister, placed the taxes on a gold basis and saw to it that people paid their contributions. By these two processes the position as from the end of 1923 was completely reversed; while the Reich finances were sound, German industry was throttled. The memorandum attached to the Foreign Office paper above referred to describes certain salient features of German industry and banking during this second phase.What is the present position and how is the future likely to develop % The acceptance of the London Protocol and the putting into force of the experts&apos; report have altered the situation, while there can be little doubt that America&apos;s active participation in the reparation question will be bound to have important reactions in Europe generally. For instance, the placing of the foreign loan to Germany has tended to open up the stream of private credits which had previously been &quot; frozen &quot; by reason of the uncertainty of a reparation settlement. This is all to the general good, as the result is bound in the end to increase the consumption of goods by lubricating the wheels of production. On the other hand, it is a moot point just how far Germany will in the future be able to regain a predominant trade position in Europe, for it must not be forgotten that, as from the fourth year of the Dawes plan, Germany will be handicapped by &quot;having to make considerable cash payments to the Allies, and in order to effect these not only is a large production of goods necessary but considerable sums from taxation must be placed at the disposal of the Government.H.
