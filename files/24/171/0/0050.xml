..258[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 50.25).I CIRCULATE herewith to my colleagues in the Cabinet a memorandum on the subject of the control of the private manufacture of arms and munitions of war.A. C.February 2, 1925.Memorandum on the Control of the Private Manufacture of Arms, Munitions and implements of War.1. At a meeting held on the 15th January, 1925 (Cabinet 2 (25) 7), the Cabinet decided that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be represented by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the meeting of the Co-ordination Committee of the League of Nations on the 16th February, and that a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence should be appointed to draft instructions for Mr. McNeill&apos;s guidance. The purpose of the meeting of .the Co-ordination Committee is to draft an international convention for the control of the private manufacture of arms and munitions in accordance with paragraph 5, article 8, of the covenant, which states :-&quot; The members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enter-prise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave objections. The council shall advise jhow the evil effects attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those members of the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their safety.&quot;2. The object of the proposals for the control is incontestably so to hamper the private manufacture of arms and ammunition as to diminish the supply, and the Admiralty, Army Council and Air Council are unanimously of opinion that such a control wold operate seriously to the disadvantage of Great Britain.In the opinion of the three Service Departments it is essential that (1.) Our supplies in time of war from firms in Great Britain shall be assured. (2.) Our supplies in time of war from neutral countries shall not be interfered with.(3.) Our nationals shall be at reasonable liberty to supply other friendly Governments in time of peace or war.As regards (1), any scheme of control with its attendant licences, inspections, reports, &amp;c, will be likely to cause many of the firms now engaged in the manufacture of the innumerable component parts of implements of war to abandon this part of their business, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be placed at the mercy of the &quot;armament ring &quot; and enhanced prices of the great armament firms. This will be serious in times of peace. In times of war it is imperative and vital that as many firms as possible shall be available for the production of arms, and any hampering restrictions that may be imposed would tend to encourage firms to refuse to supply-the Government. As regards (2), the necessity is obvious and requires no development. As regards (3), not only is it desirable to enable British firms to maintain a greater capacity of output, but if countries like Great Britain are not at liberty to supply more backward countries, the latter will be driven either to set up armament factories of their own or to invite foreign firms, such as Krupps, to do so for them. Either alternative would, of course, defeat the object aimed at in the covenant. Moreover, any restriction on the obtaining of foreign orders will necessarily involve the payment of large sums by way of subsidising plant and expert 2653   [12621] b
staff to be available for our own requirements. The arguments are further developed in Foreign Office print A 903/5/95, second and third pages, the 15th February 1923.3. It is realised, however, that in view of the above-mentioned article of the covenant and of the hesitation of His Majesty&apos;s Government to accede to the Geneva Protocol, it would be most impolitic for the British representative at the forthcoming meeting of the Co-ordination Committee to adopt a non possumus attitude from the beginning, and to declare that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept any scheme for the control of the private manufacture of arms.4. The sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, after careful examination of the question in all its aspects, are agreed in recommending that the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government to any scheme for the control of private manufacture of arms should be subject to the following conditions :-(1.) The similar consent of all the principal manufacturing countries, and inparticular of the United States of America. (2.) The previous conclusion of a satisfactory international convention dealingwith the traffic in arms. (3.) The scheme must not apply to firms manufacturing solely for their own government.(4.) The scheme must not operate in time of war. (5.) Control must be national, and not international.These five conditions should at the outset be clearly formulated by the British representative, who should at this period press for their examination, discussion and acceptance by the committee. It may be noted that conditions (1) and (2) have been postulated in a unanimous report drawn up by the Economic Committee of the League, and have thus already received a measure of international support.5. Whether or not the Powers represented on the committee accept these conditions and adopt them on their own behalf, it. will almost certainly be impossible for the British representative to avoid discussing a possible text of a convention. It cannot be argued that it is useless to discuss a text until the consent in principle of the United States has been obtained, since the council in December last directed the Co-ordination Committee to &apos;&apos; notify the council when its work is sufficiently advanced for the Government of the United States of America to be invited to send representatives to co-operate with the committee in the work of preparing an international convention,&quot; and consequently some outline, at least of a scheme, must be drawn up before the attitude of the United States can be ascertained. Again, with reference to condition (2), it might be contended that the discussion should be postponed until after the conference on the traffic in arms in May; but as it was the council that fixed the two dates, it would be somewhat difficult for the committee to say that the council did not know what it was doing.6. We have already, in this country, taken a long step towards the control of the private manufacture of arms, by means of &quot;The Fire-arms Act, 1920,&quot; which prohibits the manufacture or sale of &quot;fire-arms or ammunition&quot; unless the manufacturer or seller &apos;&apos; is registered as a fire-arms dealer in accordance with this Act.&quot;   Fire-arms and ammunition are defined in the Act as follows :&apos;&apos; The expression &apos; fire-arm &apos; means any lethal fire-arm or other weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged, or any part thereof, and the expression &apos; ammunition &apos; means ammunition for any such fire-arms, and includes grenades, bombs and other similar missiles, whether such missiles are capable of use with a fire-arm or not, and ingredients and components thereof.&quot;It is not clear that Parliament in passing this enactment had ordnance in mind, and although the words of the Act are wide enough to include ordnance, it is probable that it would not occur to many chief officers of police to insist on the registration of a firm engaged solely in the manufacture of ordnance. But (a) most of the great ordnance firms manufacture also small arms and register on that account, and (6) as the Board of Trade require production of certificates of registration under the Fire-arms Act before granting licences relieving from customs prohibitions of export of ordnance, the Fire-arms Act is accepted, in that manner, as applying to ordnance.7. The British representative might, at the outset of any discussion, inform the committee that in point of fact His Majesty&apos;s Government have already assumed
a certain control of the manufacture of arms in this country; he might summarise the provisions of the Act, suggesting that they might be of service to the committee in formulating a scheme which all countries might bind themselves to adopt within their several jurisdictions, and try to establish that as the basis of discussion. If other countries, who have not a similar system of control, could be induced to adopt it and put it into effect, it would be of advantage to British manufacturers, whose foreign competitors would then be subject to the restrictions, such as they are, which are imposed on their own operations.-8. The sub-committee understood from the representatives of the Service Departments that those Departments would not object to the universal adoption of a scheme of control which did not go beyond the provisions of the British Fire-arms Act and which was limited in application to the &quot; fire-arms and ammunition&quot; as defined therein.9. Probably, however, the Co-ordination Committee will be unwilling to agree to this suggestion and will desire to propose something more comprehensive. Though the council have requested the Co-ordination Committee to investigate this question anew and with an entirely open mind . . . it will probably be found that the &quot; principles&quot; contained in the majority report of the Temporary Mixed Commission will be taken as a basis of discussion, and it is necessary,- therefore, to consider these &apos;&apos; principles &apos;&apos; in detail and to indicate whether any of them can be accepted wholly or in part and which of them are essentially unacceptable.10. The text of these &quot;principles &quot; is setuut below, and against each of them are set the observations of the sub-committee : (1.) The war material, the private manufacture of which is to be controlled, shall include the arms, munitions and implements of war of category I defined in article 1 Of the Convention for the Control of the International Trade in Arms, Munitions and Implements of War.(2.) The term &quot;private manufacture&quot; shall apply to any manufacture carried out for the profit of private individuals by an enterprise winch is wholly or partially engaged in obtaining con-tracts for the manufacture and sale of arms, munitions and implements of war in category I, or any other private enter-prise which has for its main object the manufacture and sale of component parts of the above-mentioned articles in category I.(3.) The manufacture by private enter-prise of war material, without the explicit consent of the Government, shall be prohibited.This consent shall be in the form of a licence granted for a period to be determined by the Government under the following conditions : [1^)21]It, is impossible to take any definite decision on this point until the Arms Traffic Convention has been finally con-cluded.The Service Departments have repre-sented that many firms, normally engaged on other work, contract, as a small part of their business, for the supply of certain parts. If hampering restrictions were imposed on such firms, they might prefer not to tender for such orders, the profit on which possibly represents only a small fraction of their earnings. The words &quot; or partially &quot; should be omitted. It might, however, be possible to accept the substitution of the words &quot;or largely&quot; for the words &quot; or partially.&quot; In any case this condition must be subject to the accep-tance of principle 3 of paragraph 4r above.The Fire-arms Act imposes registra-tion by the police. The difference between registration under the Fire-arms Act and licensing under a convention would depend upon the conditions imposed by the latter. Registration is not limited by period, but it can be cancelled in certain circumstances. By a small amendment of the Act the consent of the Home Secretary might be made requisite before the police register or licence.But the conditions of the licence raise&apos; different questions.   The Economicb 2
(a.) The licence must stipulate in writing the kind or kinds of war material the holder of a licence is allowed to manufacture.(&amp;.) The holder of a licence must communicate to the Government issuing the manufacturing licence, the names, styles and addresses of the proprietor or proprietors in the case of enterprises belonging to a private individual or to the partners in a firm having a collective title and those of the directors and managers in the case of enterprises organised as commercial companies. The Government shall give official publicity to this information.(c.) The holder of a licence shall supply to the Government issuing the licence the names of all the enterprises with whom he has concluded agreements or associations of any kind whatever with the view to the production of war material.(d.) The holder shall publish annually a report of the enterprise^ industrial, commercial and financial operations relating to the manufacture of the material for which the licence has been granted. The Government will decide as to the manner in which the report shall be verified, and the extent of its publication.(e.) The Government of a State issuing a licence shall have the right to inspect the works of the applicant beforeCommittee has pointed out, and the sub-committee agree, that all the proposed conditions of licences under article 3 need express limitation to the kinds of material referred to in article 1. As regards individual conditions : (a.) If the indication of the kind of war material, the manufacture of which is licensed, is to be made public, this might involve danger. An enemy with precise information as to the localities where certain war material was being manufactured would have objectives for air-raids or would be able to devise a scheme of sabotage. Further, in the event of it becoming necessary for national defence reasons that a new private factory for producing important munitions should be set up (possibly with Government assistance or promise of orders) the publication of such informa-tion might raise awkward questions with other Powers and cause prejudice.(6.) In the case of registered com-panies, this information is already obtainable by the public in this country. It might be difficult to extend the same conditions of publicity to private firms, and some of them might consider this condition so vexatious as to refuse Government tenders (see remarks on principle 2 above). Moreover, the provision is probably useless from the point of view of those who prepared it. It is alway possible to ascertain the nominal proprietor, but generally impos-sible to ascertain that of the beneficial proprietor.(c.) This condition is regarded as quite unacceptable, and, if it be taken to mean what it appears to mean, quite impracticable. As worded, it would include all contracts, even for raw materials. The information might, it was admitted, be of interest to Govern-ment Departments here, but it was considered that few, if any, firms would undertake to supply it.(d.) Much the same objections apply as under (c.) above. The Economic Com-mittee suggested -that it might be sufficient to require the presentation of all information indispensable for the supervision of the manufacture and sale of the war material. The Fire-arms Act is even more narrow, but makes sufficient provision by requiring manufacturers to keep registers of transactions and stock, in the form prescribed by the Home Secretary; and it also gives powers of inspecting the registers of transactions.(e.) The Government in this country already have certain powers of inspec-tion, and, provided no serious extension
and after the issue of the licence, and during the period of the licence.(/.) The Government reserves, in dealing with a licence-holder, prior claim to the purchase and use of any patent and process and method and composition and any other like thing pertaining to the manufacture of war material.(4.) The holder of a licence must not be in a position to influence a newspaper, either by owning a sufficient proportion of its capital or by holding any post whatever in its offices. This measure shall apply equally to all directors, managers and high officials of the firm holding the licence. The holder of a licence must agree not to carry on propaganda of any kind relating to the war material for which a licence has been granted.(5.) The exercise of a legislative man-date is declared to be incompatible with the simultaneous exercise of the function of director or manager of a private enter-prise engaged in the manufacture of war material holding contracts with the State.(6.) The Governments agree to send to the central international office lists of the names and addresses of all enterprises which are licensed by them. The central international office shall publish the lists of the licences issued by the Governments as soon as they have been received.of these powers were contemplated, there would be no objection.(/.) This condition would appear to be outside the scope of a scheme of control such as is believed to be contemplated. Any condition of the kind might prevent firms doing business with the Govern-ment. The British Government already possess sufficient powers in regard to the use of patents.   (See Annex (A).)(4.) This, in practice,:is impossible to enforce, and therefore undesirable. Important firms may have legitimate associations with newspapers, especially commercial publications, in the interest of their trade as apart from munition manufacture, and could not be expected to discontinue such associations.(5.) There are, already, under an old Statute, restrictions on a member of the House of Commons having an interest in any contract entered into with the Government by a firm (but not a registered company) of which he is a member. It might be very difficult to extend the scope of these restrictions.(6.) If the list of licences were to include information as to the kind of material which the licencee is authorised to manufacture, it has already been pointed out, under (3) (a), that this might involve danger.Apart from that, however, the very idea of communicating to an inter-national body any information in con-nection with the control of private manu-facture seems to imply some acceptance of the principle of international control, which has already been pronounced to be unacceptable.11. In conclusion, the Service members wish to emphasise the five principles mentioned in paragraph 7, and recommend that no text should in any circumstances be agreed to without reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Annex (A).Objections to Clause III (f).British Government Departments already have power, under section 29 of &quot; The Patents Act, 1907,&quot; and section 8 of &quot; The Patents Act, 1919,&quot; to use any patent, and to have the patented invention manufactured in any Government factory or by any private agent or contractor, without waiting for terms to be settled with the patentee, on condition that the terms to be paid for such user shall be settled m due course, either by agreement, or, failing agreement, by reference to the court or an arbitrator appointed by the court.
Firms are likely to object strongly to the further drastic provisions now proposed, viz : Government to have prior claim to purchase all their patents pertaining to war material. &apos;        &quot;     .Government to have prior claim to purchase and use their unpatented processes, methods, compositions, &amp;c. (which may include important trade secrets) relating to war material.Such drastic powers might be valuable to Governments as a means of increasing their fighting capacity as against foreign nations, but this appears to be directly opposed to the League of Nations point of view.The fighting Departments, for their own purposes, may quite possibly seek to obtain further powers as regards securing non-publication of new devices and patents relating to munitions, and prior right of purchasing same as a Government secret monopoly if desired. ...But the bringing in of unpatented processes, methods, compositions, &amp;c, is a very far-reaching suggestion, certain to be opposed strongly by firms as unprecedented and arbitrary, and, if enforced, many firms, with whom munitions are only a side-line, but who are of great importance to the fighting Departments, might refuse to take a licence and prefer to discontinue making munitions.
