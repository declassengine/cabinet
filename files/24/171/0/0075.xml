^pq^OCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BHXffANNIC MAJESTY1S G OVER MEN T.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In continuation of C.P. 557 (24) I circulate for the information of the Cabinet a summary of the views expressed at the last meeting of the Board of Trade Advisory Council. It will be seen   that the general impression and forecast are decidedly less optimistic than those given two months ago.I also append certain Tables, which I have had prepared recently, showing the volume of imports and exports for 192 4 as compared with the corresponding volumes of 1925 and 1915. While this attempt to convert changing values to a common measure of volume supplies the best picture of the yearfs trade it is possible to obtain, it is impossible to give a complete or accurate picture without figures of production. The Census of Production figures will not be available until 1926.   I have therefore been trying to persuade trade organisa-tions to produce their own figures of production and to keep them regularly up-to-date.I also attach an estimate prepared in the Board of Trade of the invisible exports in 192 4.   Any estimate of this kind is highly speculative; but the Board&apos;s estimate for 1925, which I also attach, was generally accepted; so far I have not seen any adverse criticism of our present estimate, and I understand that the statistician of the Chamber of Shipping is in general agreement with the shipping estimates.EGRET. 7T7T4CABINET.4 (25).TRADE OUTLOOK,(Intld.)

CONFIDENTIAL. THE TRADE OUTLOOK.SHI P PI NG, AND 3HIFSUILD PNG.SIR ALAN ANDERSON said that he had no salient fresh developments to report In regard to the Shipping industry. The index number of freight rates for Deoember had doolined eomewhat, standing at 28.21 as compared with 29*29 for November.   The yearly average for 1924 was 29.63 as against 28.38 for 1923, and represented 126.6$ of the level of freights In 1913.    -The reaaon for the drop in Deoember was largely that the Plate, Baltic and Atlantic trades were poor, and the Australian also was less brisk.   Laid up tonnage had increased, though the figures Involved were small, namely, about 488,000 tons on January 1st as compared with about 333,000 tons on the 1st 0otcber last.   The corresponding figure a .year ago however was nearly 650,000 tons.He mentioned that as a result of certain Inquiries rooently made in Germany by Sir Frederick Lewis, It had been found that the prices offered by German shipbuilders were vastly less than ours.   Sir Frederick Lowis proposed to oommunicate the particulars he had obtained to the Balfour Committee.   The President said that he had seen these, and added in confidence, that he was taking steps to ascertain if they represented commercial quotations, or if there was any Government subsidy.Sir S. Chapman said it was thought that the German Government contemplated making advances to their shipbuilders somewhat on the linoa. of our Trade Facilities loans.In reply to a question by the President, Sir Alan Anderson said that there was no ohange to roport as regards inquiries coming forward for freights in the future, nor did there appear to be any fre3h volume of demand for general shipbuilding.
CONFIDENTIAL.-.....- -    &apos; &apos; - **SHIPBUILDING.COL. LITHGOW   could report no Increase in enquiries or orders in the Shipbuilding industry:     indeed cargo boats, which were his special concern, were actually harder to sell than in the past eighteen months.     This was due to the state of the freight market: freights being now only some 20% above those of 1913, it was not reasonable to expect prosperity in view of the much greater increase In British shipbuilding costs;   materials, for example, had gone up in price from 50$ to 100$,     Anxiety was being felt for the future.Shipbuilders were much dependent for their costs on their suppliers In other trades, being themselves largely in the nature of assemblers;    and if costs in these supplying trades were further increased (as was now threatened), the difficulties of the Shipbuilding industry would be proportionately aggravated.Foreign competition was very acute.     Even some Dominion Governments had placed orders on the Continent;    also some British shipowners, seeing the wide discrepancy between British and foreign costs, yet not wishing to place their orders abroad, had abstained from ordering at all.Serious as the outlook  was, he could not offer any concrete suggestion for remedial action;    it would be well, however, for the public to realise that shipbuilding for export could not be carried on unless internal trades in this country assist.In reply to a question by Mr. Samuel, Colonel Lithgow observed that shipbuilders could, and to some extent did, effect a saving by utilising German steel, but, on account of the time required for delivery,  they could not use it- to the extent of more than some 50$ of the total amount of steel they required; this however allowed of a reduction of price of about 4/- to 5/- per deadweight ton.
. CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AND STEEL.MR . BAKER said that the heavy iron, and steel trade in this country was not well situated.    In the United States, on the other hand, it had shown an improvement:    Press reports stated that, whereas the industry in that country was only oocupied up to 47% of capacity in June last, it was now working at 9 4%; but perhaps this was a somewhat exagger-ated estimate.   American iron and steel manufacturers were complaining that pig Iron was being imported into the country from abroad at prices considerably beneath those which they could quote.   Their prices for rolled material had gone up.He&apos;would point out that, -though higher rates of wages obtained in the American industry than in this country, this was not necessarily a handicap in itself to them, since the output of a steel works was conditioned,   o a greater extent by its machinery than by its labour.   A number of our blast furnaces (notably In   Scotland) were now out of date, and could not show results comparable with those of some furnaces abroad.   He had heard that in Lorraine there were blast furnaces capable of an output of as much as 450 tons a day.Movements in the Steel Workers&apos; Sliding Scale of wages indicated a fall of prices during the last audit period.   For heavy Iron and steel and ship plates during the past three months this drop had amounted to  9.9.7 per ton, which warrant-ed a reduction of wages of 2-g-. per cent.   The result was that wages now stood at slightly over 26 per cent above the level of August 1914.The results for pig iron in the Midlands would have warranted a reduction of 5 per cent, in the wage scale, but employers had not taken advantage of this, as they thought that wages were already as low as the men could live on.
confidential; iron and steel (contd.).   *He mould like to suggest the point of view that our efforts to bring sterling back to its pre-war parity gave France and Belgium a better chance of importing their iron and steel into this country in competition with the home industry. They were now our chief competitors, the competition of Germany being no longer as keen as formerly.    If a chart were made, comparing the fluctuations of the French and Belgian exchanges with their imports of iron and steel Into this country,  it would probably reveal a close correspondence between them. Regard should, he suggested, be had to this aspect of the matter in framing our financial policy.He was still of opinion that the iron and steel trade would be likely to experience better times in the near future, since it was usually observable that when the United States showed an improvement this country followed suit later,MR. DORMAN said there had been a falling off in the production of pig iron in this country.    It was true that the production was only 120^000 tons less in 1924 than in 1923,? but it was as much as 2,900^000 tons less than in 1913? this was a serious matter.Referring to Mr0 Baker1 s remarks as to the relatively high efficiency of some foreign blast furnacesa.Mr . Dorman observed that hi3 firm had furnaces which could produce a3 much as 300 tens a dayy though he also had heard reports that some furnaces in Alsace could produce 400 tons a dayQThe increase In imports of iron and steel were giving a good deal cf concern tc British manufacturers.    While imports in 1913 amounted to 2? million tons,  those of 1924
CONFIDENTIAL. - -.......... r- &quot;- &apos;.ifIRON AND STEEL  (CONTDj.were 2s million: the increase was,  therefore, not great in amount, but it pointed to the necessity for the British industry to find some means of reducing Its costs.    This could not, he thought, be done by asking labour to accept less, but it should&apos;be possible to Increase output.Business in constructional steel for building purposes was active.    Shipbuilding, however,  showed no Improvement. The galvanised sheet trade was good: orders, however, were scarce for black sheets.The world&apos;s output of iron was less in 19 24 by some 13,000,000 tons than   in 1913, so that there seemed some hope that if British manufacturers could quote attractive prices, buying and demand would increase; but this was looking a long way ahead.Mr. Baker observed that, if the figures for iron and steel were taken together, the general result did not appear very bad, but attempts which had been made by his Union to dissect the figures revealed what seemed a disquieting situation in regard to steel,Mr. Dorman said that our exports of iron and steel and manufactures thereof in 1924 were down by some 1,100,000 tons compared with 1913, and by 465,000 tons compared with 1923: this was attributable to a general falling-off in demand, especially from India.    On the other hand, our retained imports were higher in 19 24 than in 1913 by 223,000 tons, and higher than in 1923 by 1,106,000 tons,
CONFIDENTIAL. 477NON-FERROUS METALS.MR.  TAIT: -&quot;Copper:    The industries appear to be fairly well employed -some of them very well, and the position on the whole is satis-faotory.     This condition of affairs looks likely to continue, and I think will do so if nothing is done to force the price of the metal.     Production and consumption seem to have about reached an equilibrium, and there appears no justification for putting the price higher, which might check consumption and make it more difficult to raise capital for many power schemes which are at present under consideration.&quot;Lead i   The prioe remains high and is undoubtedly affecting consumption in some directions - particularly on the oontinent. The very large consumption in the Cable trade, is, however, off-setting reductions in other directions.     The ordinary manufac-turing industries in this country are actively employed, although fresh orders have been somewhat slow in coming in during the last two months.&quot;Spelter:    The chief consuming industries, namely, Galvanised Iron and Brass, are satisfactorily employed, and the prospects are fairly good.&quot;Tin:    There has been a decided falling off in activity in the tin-plate industry in this country, and some of the V/orks have closed down, and I understand there is a definite proposal to slow down for a period.      In America, on the other hand, the Mills are reported to be well supplied with orders, and it might be that the   slackening here is temporary.&quot;Aluminium:    The demand in this country, particularly in the Motor trade, continues good, and in France and Germany there would appear to be a shortage of metal to meet the demand.   -This,   I however, will be overoome in the Spring.     The demand in the Electrical industry for aluminium transmission cables and in the Metal trade for sheets and circles,  Is good.   During the last two months there has been a slowing down in the demand for sheet metal from India.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL. GOAL.SIR ADAM fflMMO, said that the Coal industry was very badly situated at present, and it ssemed as if in the immediate future conditions would bo worse before they became better.     Competition was very severe, and exports had fallen off seriously - to the extent last year of nearly 18,000,000 tons - and this at a time when our coal fields were probably at their maximum potentiality to produoe ooal.   In consequence, a surplus was being thrown back on our inland market, whioh oould not readily absorb It; and the effect was felt in falling prioes and great &quot; competition within the Industry.   It wae diffioult to see how the position in regard to our export ooal trade oould be redressed, its cause lay largely In the extensive difference between British and foreign (especially German) costs of production.In Germany the output of brown coal had been much developed since, the war.   It was being utilised to produce elecstrio current for supply over wide areas, and was thus enabled, in spite of Its low comparative efficiency, to take the plaoe of blaok ocal, thus releasing a corresponding amount of German blaok ooal to compete with cure.   There would need to be considerable ohanges in labour costs in this oountry before wo could onoe more oommand markets In competition with German ooal.   The French output was also increasing rapidly.UOur output, on the other hand, had declined, as was oloarly shown by the statistics distributed to the Council (aee &apos;StatiBtloal Data&apos; at end).   It was true that
CONFIDENTIAL. COAL (CONTD. ^the figures for a year ago were affected by the Ruhr sltuatlonj but compared with 1913, it would bei seen that a drop had taken place of over 200,000 tons per week.Sir Adam then referred to difficulties whioh had reoently been experienced in obtaining licences to export British coal to Germany.    Though no doubt the Germans were bound, on account of their own eoonomie position, to endeavour to cut down their Importation a&apos;e muoh as possible, he suggested that the Board of Trade would do well to watch that no unfair or unreasonable. restriction is imposed upon British exports in the -German market.The President observed that the Anglo-German Commercial Treaty recently signed, contains a general provision for the abolition of import restrictions In all exoept a few agreed oases,   fie also mentioned, in confidence, that a communication had been received from the German Government to the general effect that if prohibitions and restrictions on the Importation of ooal were maintained, they would give us as good treatment as in the past. Reports,-had reaohedthe Board that ohangea to our detriment were being made or were in contemplation, and the whole matter was being investigated.
CONFIDENTIAL.ELECTRICAL  ENGINEERING.MR. KIRST said that there was still moderate prosperity in the electrical industry.    It was, however, noticeable that whilst last year each month had shown a marked advance over the corresponding month of 1923, the results so far this year had only just kept even with 19 24; and, moreover, there; was not such a steady flow of business, trade being,  so to speak, patchy and showing improvement In some localities and a set back in others.    Export business had not improved, but inquiries from overseas were noticeably better than for some time past.Referring to the use of brown coal (lignite) in Germany for the production of electricity, Mr. Hirst said it was to be expected that In the future Germany would have progressively more coal available for export, on account of the development of hydraulic power and lignite for the generation of electricity. Lignite could only be economically used if by-products were extracted, and British industry could not hope to obtain power so cheaply by merely burning our own black coal.    It would be necessary, in order to secure the same cheapness and efficiency, for our own industries to embark more generally upon extraction of coal by-products, use of pulverized coal, etc. 1 TEXTILES.  COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROM said that the cotton trade had experienced somewhat of a set-back.    In the American section of the trade, where 8i hours&apos; short time per week were being worked, consumption was not equal to production,  and master spinners were taking a ballot with a view to increasing short time to 13 hours.The Egyptian section of the trade had also fallen off, probably on account of the remarkable spurt in the price of Egyptian cotton, especially Sakel cotton, which now stood at over 30d. per lb.    The result was to make our cotton goods,
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXTILES 8    COTTON (CONTD.) whioh should be the cheapest form of clothing, nearly as dear as silk and woollens.He would also draw attention to the practice adopted by the Egyptian authorities of mixing Sakel cotton with other grades. The Liverpool market had had to refuse to accept various tenders of mixed cotton, with the result that the price of Sakel cotton was continually going up.Considerable competition was being met with from Italy, and, at the same time, the demand for British cotton goods had fallen off.    There were inquiries from Russia, but payment&apos;-was difficult to arrange, and there were heavy attendant risks: so that he doubted if the business would materialize.TEXTILES i    WOOL. MR. ANDREWS said that two months ago he had reported that there were better prospects for the Bradford industries.    Un-fortunately these prospects had not been realized, and the position was if anything slightly worse than two months ago. There was evidence of this in the fall which had taken place in wool prices, amounting to SO per cent, since November.Our German competitors were well equipped, but were short of working capital, and their competition was not very severe.    In France there had   been, he thought, a worse falling off in the woollen trade than here:    this also was probably to be attributed largely to scarcity of money and lack of liquid capital, as in Germany.    French competition was not now quite so bad.It might perhaps be anticipated that the fall in wool prices would shortly be checked, since the United States light-weight season began during the current month, and merchants in New York, who wanted to keep prices at a low level, probably now considered them low enough.    Attempts were also being made in Australia to control the fall.   To the ^British industry a
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXT IL ES ?    WO PL    ( C ONTO. ),low prioe was not so Important as a stable price,. .At present there was a lack of confidence in Bradford and a few failures had taken place.In reply to a question by the President as to what causes he would assign for the present slack trade,, in view of the easing-off of French and German competition, Mr. Andrews said he thought that a kind of buyers1 strike was in progress: the wool trade had&apos;probably advanced prices too rapidly.TEXTILES: WORSTED ETC. MR. SUTCLIFPE SMITH:..&quot;There has   been a big increase of unemployment during the last month as compared with December, particularly in the ranks of the totally unemployed.&quot;Piece manufacturers are meeting finding trade at all brisk and there Is a good deal of short time being worked, the percentage of looms employed being if anything less than that mentioned in my last report.&quot;Spindles are also not well employed, the botany section being the worst and short time is also being worked in this section^    The export of yarns is being seriously curtailed.&quot;In the Home Trade, business has not fulfilled expectations but the outlook is a little brighter for the Plain Trade owing to the fact that the French have not been able to continue quoting the very low prices they have given recently and have had-to put up their prices for piece goods.
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXTILES: WORSTED .STC(CQN.TD*).&quot;Italy., Holland, and Czecho-Slovakia are. also offering goods at prices at which, the home textile trade Is at present unable to compete,.&quot;There is still a moderate trade In Novelty Fabrics and Fancies$ and considerable development in goods containing artificial siik*&quot;The New Year holidays and the continued political disturbances in China are still resulting in textiles being held up at the ports, and the recent disturbances in Shanghai have made the position worse.   At the present moment merchants complain very much that orders are not coming through,&quot;The Japanese competition is more felt in this market than ever and is undoubtedly having a very serious effect on the British textile trade, particularly on the cheaper end of the trade, even Czecho-Slovakia has lately been making inroads into the low crossbred wool trade at very low prices which it is impossible to follow.&quot;The Egyptian market is keeping fairly good but Italian competition is still severe;,&quot;At the moment, the immediate outlook in India is not good; the prices quoted being too high, particularly for those cloths, such as Warp Satins where Egyptian cotton Is used, but taking the long view, better trade is expected,  in the future in this market,&quot;The export trade to Java and the Straits Settlements generally has been fairly good.&quot;
&apos; &apos;     &apos;       &apos; &quot;  CONFIDENTIAL.. 484POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS said that exports of the finer grades of pottery, drain pipes and refractories had increased in value by  150,000.    There had been a steady improvement during the last three years.On the other hand the home market was dull, and the seasonal depression which was usual in December and January was more marked than for some years past.    Normally the industry would probably have some 5,000 persons on the Register at the labour exchanges - mostly short time work-ors.   The industry suffered more from under-employment than unemployment.The National Pottery Council had had under considera-tion various measures which might improve the condition of the trade, such as a Merchandise Marks Bill to provide for the marking of imported goods, and measures against dumping.The pottery trade&apos;s chief competitor at present was Czechoslovakia, which was supplying material to this country at very low rates.Prospects for the future were, however, he thought, fairly good.RUgBgR MANUFACTURES. MR. BIRLBY said that the rubber industry usually passed through its quietest period in December and January so, far as sports goods, tyres, etc., were concerned.    Severe corn-petition in tyres was being encountered from France and Italy.   Fair inquiries were coming in from South America and Australia for rubber piece goods.    There was, however, much disappointment among rubber manufacturers that under the Stevenson scheme only an additional 5 per cent, of raw rubber was to be released for the 5 monthly period-now commencing, and not 10 per cent., for which they had hoped. Stocks, they considered, were now dangerously low, especially as Germany was now b egi,a;ing to take an interest in the trade.
CONFIDENTIAL. . ----------GENERAL TRADE.MR. MACHIN said, speaking from the point of view of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, that the improvement in trade was, at the best, developing very slowly, though there was perhaps a slightly more confident tone than in the past.     Our position on the Continent was difficult, especially in France, where steps were being taken designed apparently to place obstacles in the way of our exporters;    thus, a demand was being made in connection with the Turn-Over tax (the normal rate of which was 1.3$) that our traders must disclose their sources of supply under penalty of a doubling ef the tax;    the resultant figure of 2.6% was prohibitive.     The Chambers of Commerce Were taking up this question in Paris through their own organisation.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON aaid that the season in Australia was still good.     Though he had not yet available the figures up to the end of the year, exports promised to be large.There had been a drop in wool prices, but these were still remunerative to the &quot;growers.During the last few weeks shipments of gold to Australia had eased the exchange position.     It was found that it was cheaper to send gold from San Francisco than to arrange the exchange market here:    considerable sums of gold had already been so shipped.The labour difficulties with the waterside Unions, which he had referred to at previous meetings were not yet completely settled.As regards transport, regular air services to various inland towns had now been set up.     Railway development continued:    there was now a continuous coastal railway line round the Continent of over 4,000 miles in length.
QHINSSa TRADE *;MR. LANDALE said that stooks were low in China, and more inquiries were coming in, but our prices were too high for these Eastern markots.    Imports of engineering material into China were not good, on account of the disturbed state of the oountry.With regard to the Chinese railways, ho submitted the following memorandum.-&quot;1. The export trade of Great Britain in railway-materials of all kinds would find a profitable and eager market in China if a strong and stable ^Government was established there that would take in hand as one of their first aims the development of her railways.B2. China possesses only about 7,000 miles of railway and requires for her immediate neods at least ten times more. There is no country in the world where under proper administra-tion, management and control railways oould bo worked more profitably and economically.K3. Unfortunately, since the fall of the Manohu &quot;dynasty in 1911 China had suffered from a ohronio state of civil warfare between military self-appointed leaders or tuchuns over whom tho Central Government admits they have no control. These tuchuns when starting a campaign for their personal aggrandisement and power oocupy strategic positions on the railways, seize whatever revenues are available, and use the trains for the transport of troops without payment.&quot;4. What is required for the railways is proper polioing. When the tuchuns find they are prevented from using the railways for their own military purposes or for obtaining funds, civil wars will to a large extent beoome unattractive to them and other reforms would quickly follow.*5. The rank and file of the railway police force must be Chinese and though they have been quite useless hitherto under Chinese administration, it is felt they oould be made adequately effe6tive if properly oqulpped, trained, organised
CONFIDENTIAL. CHINESE TRADE (CONTD.)and disciplined by foreign officers&quot; .As regards the suggestion contained in (5), Mr. Landale observed that Great Britain and other Powers had been pressing for the establishment of an efficient railway police forceJ but it must be admitted that the difficulty now was the absence of any stable Government on which to bring pressure .FINANCE.MR v BRAND, dealing with the financial position abroad, said that in Germany industrial companies still had to pay the Deutscher Bank about 15 per cent, for advances, but would not pay more, than about 8 per cent, for borrowing in London or New York, where (especially in New York) they found they could get a good deal of credit,   though probably this was now less easy in London.    The loans being granted them in the United States included some for long terms, such as, 5, 10, 15 and 20 years:    this was, he thought, a good thing, since it might bring about a dangerous situation if all German borrowings were short-dated.    It was a curious fact that big German industrial firms were able to borrow in New York on more favourable terms than the German Government itself had obtained in the case of the big international loan to her recently.   The Reichsbank rate still stood at 10 per cent.In France, the Bank rate was 7 per cent, and French industrialists were meeting with difficulties on account of the exceptionally high rates (for France) which were being asked1for money.    These high rates were due to efforts on the part of the French Government to stop the depreciation of the Franc, but they seemed likely to experience some difficulty in succeed-ing in their policy, since employment tended to go down as credit was restricted.    He considered the financial position of France a distinctly difficult one.
CONFIDENTIAL. FINANCE  (CONTP.)The United States were lending very freely to the world at present - on a much larger scale, indeed, than this country had ever done.    The total of their foreign loans for 1924 was about  ,240,000,000 - a large proportion of this probably being for long terms.    Personally he considered that these -loans were much the strongest influence In raising sterling to Its present level.The situation seemed to contain elements of danger, in that if, owing to an internal boom developing, the United States were to stop lending to the world and the Federal Reserve Bank put up its interest rates,.,a great strain might be put upon the   exchange    . of this country.He considered that the past year had been an exceptionally favourable one for sterling, since the appreciation caused by American loan operations, to which he had already referred, had probably had a further psychological effect in stimulating confidence.   But If a boom arose in the States, coupled with demands for increased wages in this country and continuing difficulties in our export trade, the strain on sterling might be extreme.With regard, therefore, to the possibility of a return to the Gold standard, it was his view that it would be advisable to wait, say, six months, before taking steps in this direc-tion, so as to see what the future course of events is likely to be.While in New York recently he had been told by y r.Dillon, of Messrs. Dillon and Reed, that investments in America were now very large; if so, the States would probably have large sums available to lend to the world, and the result should be to help sterling further.   At the present moment we were greatly dependent on the United States for the position of sterling.
CONFIDENTIAL. FINANCE  (CONTP. )The loans of member banks of the Federal Reserve Bank were now higher than ever, but on the other hand commercial loans were not remarkably high.      If, in these circumstances, a great demand arose from Industry in the States, the effect would necessarily be to raise the discount rate.     But he understood that the Federal Reserve banks, which had largely increased their investments during the past year, were now selling securities in order to be in a position to make more commercial loans.BANKING.MR. BEAUMONT PEASE   said that there was still a keen demand for money, and rates in the money market were well maintained.      There had been an accompanying fall in gilt-edged stocks, especially short-dated Government bonds.The figures of Banking results which had been published since the last meeting showed that, so far as  the &quot;Big Five&quot; were concerned,  there had been an Increase of  57,000,000 in advances to customers as compared with a year ago.      This indicated greater activity in trade over the year.      The money for this pxirpose had been found by the banks, partly by letting Treasury Bills run off to the extent of some  50,000,000, and partly by sale of their investments to the amount of  40,000,000.     By this means they had been enabled to find money for loans, and also to increase cash at call, and to meet withdrawals of deposits, which had taken place to the extent of about  11,000,00 0.In reply to a question by the President, Mr-. Pease said that he considered the demand for Industrial money continued as keen as before.     It was true that there did not seem to be such a hopeful tone among traders generally, and that his Bank1s branch reports  tended to show a slight- IB -
CONFIDENTIAL. BANKING    (CON TP.)set-back as compared, with last month in trade generally; but the actual demand for advances,  to &quot;judge from the figures, seemed still to be on the up trend.MR. TENNANT   said that his Bank&apos;s branch reports on the trade situation were not now so- favourable.The figure for banks&apos; advances to customers, though it had increased, as mentioned by Mr. Beaumont Pease, for the past year, would probably, he thought, be found to have declined slightly in January.A good many gilt-edged issues had been made last month, not however very successfullyj perhaps for the reason that the issue price was generally fixed too high, and a good deal had been left on underwriters&apos; hands.RAILWAYS.MR. BROOKE   said that though the published figures of railway receipts in respeot of merchandise f*r January were not strictly comparable with those of January last year on account of the strikes vhich was   then going on, it appeared that some falling off had taken place.     This was probably largely attributable to coal.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES  (ENGLAND).SIR THOMAS ALLEN   said that the Societies&apos; distributing trade showed a slight improvement as regards foodstuffs, to the extend of about 7 per cent on the quarter and 3 per cent on the year.     In wearing apparel, furniture, . eta.,there had been an increase of 11 per cent on the quarter and 5 per cent on the year.      The Increase in foodstuffs, however, was due not so much to a real increase in quantity, as to the higher prices now ruling.     All foodstuffs, withthe one exception of sugar, had shown increases in price,- 19 -
CONFIDENTIAL.CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES  (ENGLAND)   (CONTD. )ranging from 3 per cent to 10 per cent on. the quarter;    on the year, butter had gone up 6  per cent,  lard 10 per cent, &quot;bacon 30 per cent, and flour 34 per cent, so far as wholesale prices were concerned:      the difference to the consumer would be still greater.     Sugar, on the other hand, which had stood at 58/9d, per cwt. on Budget day, was now down by some 26/3d.  (i.e. 12/3d. on material and 14/- on tax) to 32/6d.,and a further drop was to be looked for.There was a very keen demand from the Continent for flour, and the Society&apos;s mills were being kept &quot;busy on this trade.UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES  (MINISTRY OF LABOUR).MR.  PHILLIPS   said that since the last meeting of the Council the unemployment figures had been on the whole somewhat disappointing.      There was a fairly steady drop in the figures until just before Christmas;    but then, in three&quot; successive weeks,  there were increases amounting to a total of about 150,000,  of which from 60,000 to 70,000 had since oome off.      The latest figures, for January 26th, were some 80,000 below those for a year ago, but the latter were inflated by about that number owing to a railway dispute.      On the other hand, owing to the effect of the Unemployment Insurance Act of last year, the present figures included a considerable number, perhaps as many as 70,000, who would not have been counted last year.
STATEMENT REGARDING THE EXPORT TRADE POSITION MADE AT THE MEET IBS 03? THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE on the  1st January, 1925.   1IRON &amp; STEEL.Sir Arthur Balfour (Special tool steels, tools, etc.) sent a statement to the Committee, which reads as followsRegarding the Sheffield steel trade and the engineer1s tool trade, such as twist drills, milling cutters, -saws, files, etc*, there was a decided Improvement during December, both in quality and size of orders, bufc   prices still remain too low to make manu.factu.ring profitable.    This is particularly so in the case of drills.Undoubtedly, manufacturers are employing more men, ana have &apos; increased the working hours of those already employed.   The order books were In better condition on January 1st than they have been for the past three years.There are some very weak spots, however0 The Canadian and Japanese trades have . fallen off to a deplorable&amp;ble extent, and&apos; there are signs of falling off in Australia,,One of the important features is that German manufactur-ers are increasing their prices, and this is making their competition much less formidable, but they are offering buyers abroad very extraordinary terms of payment0There is a considerable amount of genex*al confidence displayed and manufacturers and employees are starting the New Year with great hopeseThe financial strain of high taxation has had a very adverse effect on many of the Sheffield manufacturers, and-&apos; even if trade was to become good, it would take some time for them to re-establish their pre-war financial situation.Sir William iarke (Pig Iron, Steel Castings, etc.) could not speak optimistically of the heavy iron and steel trade, any general improvement being very slight and the export trade showing unsatisfactory results.   During 1924 exports in this branch had been 13$ less than in 1923, but imports into the United Kingdom were 84$ higher.   He was, nevertheless, hopeful, but the peouliar production situation on the continent was the ruling factor.   Competition of an uneconomic order had to be faoed from Belgium, France and Germany, and pending the signing of certain commercial treaties, this appeared likely to continue.   He was of opinion that Germany would probably in the last resort get oom-mercial control of the iron and steel works lost to herAy
jimfi&amp;entlalaby the Treaty of Versailles.   The most baffling feature of export trade to-day was the frequent occurrence of transactions in which Germany was proved to have offered extraordinary terras of credit, which British manufacturers would in essence consider unsatis-factory, while other reports tend to show that credit is both short in amount and very dear in Germany itself.   Luring tho discussion^ Colonel Peel asked that Sir William Larke should draw up such terms of credit as his cwn trade would find acceptable, and he (Colonel Peel) would then gladly consider whether they oould be brought within the terms of the Export Credits Scheme. It was pointed out that the German credit was not necessarily always of great length, but was granted without security of recourse,    Sir Algernon Firth suggested that it should be found out whether the London discount market was at present open to the Germans, as it had   been ascertained that by a chain of endorse-ments on bills given by German manufacturers, London was found i    in the last resort to be financing German trade,,3ir William Ellis (Shipbuilding and Hallway Material) I    thought that there was more confidence in the steel trade but I    that the obvious facts were against any immediate improvement *The heavy steel trade was suffering from high costs of production, j    which were inimical to success,   A quotation for steel tyres froman English works at  20 was met by an English railway companyproducing a German offer at  11 per tona   A general discussionensued on the factors governing costs in the iron and steel trade a I    Sir William Ellis continuing-, said that certain Chambers ofCommerce had asked him to approach the Department owing to the  .concern they felt at the &quot;proo^bla affect of the proposed new jI import duties in France upon the steel industry. Certain English I   concerns ware being pressed to manufacture within the tariff wailin Prance and he urged that the Department should use all itsIefforts to protect the interests of British msnufactorera in this markets   Further he desired to call attention to certain large orders which he understood that the Skoda Works were carrying out for British India,    It appeared to him that these orders had been secured partially owing to the existence of lest rigid trade union rules in Czecho-Slovakia.   A deplorable state of affairs existed in the corresponding branch in this country, where forginge and I   castings were being sold at unduly low rates owing to foreign j   competition which was particularly acute from the works above S   mentioned,HARDWARE. -*-&apos;&apos;&apos;Kir. Hick in bot haia was able to report that order books generally were in a better condition on the 1st January 1925 than     12 months previously.   Trade generally was finding it possible to compete with the United States of America in various SouthI   American countries, a thing which for some time past had not been possible.   This was particularly noticeable in the case of agricultural tools. &quot;Having found German competition severe in the enamelware trade, be had made the experiment of quoting at cost-,!   price to an overseas customer, and was met by a German quotation of 10 per cent, less.    On meeting this quotation the Germans!   quoted again lower,   His opinion was that German competition and methods at the present time presented the most baffling problemI   which British merchants have to meet,COAL.Colonel Watts-Horgan (South V/ales) stated that no improve-&apos; meat was to be seen in the South Wales Coal export trade, but that things were no worse than when last reported.   He considered that a drastic enquiry into costs at an early date was a vital matter for the trade.
OCSJIPBKTIAL. &quot;\Mr. Hargreayes  (Yorkshire colliery district) stated that the export trade In the Yorkshire colliery district was in a deplorable condition.POTTERY.Major Wedgwood reported a variable state of affairs in the pottery trade,  the  tile and sanitary-ware trade being good, but all other pottery branches being slack.     The best end of the trade was with America, the continental trade being most indifferent.TEXTILES.Mr. Kenneth Lee  (Cotton piece goods) reverted to the question   of the French duties, In which the cotton trade  was equally, interested,  and desired to call attention to the monopolistic endeavours of the French in various African Colonies and. i-nore particularly their desire that the capitulations in Morocco should be surrendered.      The cotton trade would regard this eventuality with grave misgivings, i/lr. Lee promised to place this matter before the Chairman in more detail, in order that it might be gone into.Mr, H. ?/. Lee  (Cotton Yarns) recorded little change in the cotton trade generally.     The 39f hours week was at present general in the American trade and full time in the fine trade.      In the near future the question of either reducing or expanding the working week would have to be decided and he was unable to give any strong indication of which way the matter would go.      He raised also the question of defective seed in the Egyptian cotton plantations, but wiiile it was understood that the matter was engaging the attention of the authorities, no pressure could be brought upon trie present Egyptian Government with a view to remedy. In answer to an enquiry, Mr, Lee stated that stocks of piece goods were at present extremely low in the cotton trade.Sir Algernon Firth (Woollens) reported unsatisfactory conditions in the  eat Riding district,  the only people who vvere doing well being dealers in raw&apos; materials.     Loo.vis in general wens very short of work.      Spinning machinery perhaps was slightly better employed, but complaints in the piece goods trade were very general.     The engineering branch was also none too well employed.PROPRIETARY /RTICLYL.Sir Herbert Morgan stated that trie articles dealt with by his firm,, which were principally proprietary articles, showed a very great improvement as far as export was concerned India being a specially good market.      He desired to know whether special statistics- could be produced to show in what proportion our overseas trade was carried on In branded articles, as he was of opinion that enlightenment on this point was(fiesirable,  if his views was correct that a large proportion of our future export trade would be in successful sales of branded articles which were not subject to the same competition as raw materials and staple lines.     The Chairman&quot; replied that he was of opinion that the production of such statistics would be difficult.  If not impossible,  al least until the next census ol production was taken,CHINA TRAD 11.an. podwe11  (China Merchants Trade)&quot; could only report that In the China trade tilings were worse rather than better since he last reported.    Owing to disturbed cond.itic.ns, little or nothing was delivered In Shanghai from the 15th
September to the 15th November.     During the remaining six weeks of the year, deliveries had shown considerable improvement, but a bad situation had again arisen.     Owing to* seasonal quietness the effect was less acute, but he hoped an improvement would be made soon,BANKING.Mr. Hewett (Colonial Bank) made reference to the unsolved question of German credit.     His bank had some experience as they had a branch in Hamburg, where they found all traders greedy for credit which was diflicult to obtain, but the most recent indications were that German banks were in an easier position and were giving better facilities during the last six months.EXPORT CREDITS.Colonel Peel reported a quiet period in the Export Credits Department.     The new sanctions amounted to just over  400,000 and the net Increase in guarantees outstanding was  140,000.      He desired to bring up the question of the ban on the export of gold, as the Act was due to lapse very shortly.      He was assured by the Chairman that the effect of the free export of gold on the export trade of the country would receive the most serious consideration when the question of continuing the Act was reviewed.

Reprinted from The Board of Trade Journal, dated 22nd January, 1925,OVERSEAS   TRADE   IN   1924   AT   THE   VALUES   OF   1923.In illustration of the above article the following tables give a comparison between the foreign trade of this year and 1923 by estimating, as nearly as available data permit, the value which would be put upon imports and exports in the mass, if each item had the same average value per unit of quantity as was declared for goods of the same description in 1923. In this way aggregate figures are obtained, the comparison of which, with the corresponding figures for 1923, enable the extent of the influence of price changes and the aggregate changes in the volume of goods imported and exported to be estimated. In the article we gave the aggregates, and in the tables below supplement this information by extending the comparison to the several groups of commodities in the import and export classification.Class and Group.TABLE   A.
