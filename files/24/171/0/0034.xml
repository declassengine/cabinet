THIS^LOCJJIOTTIS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8, GO VERMTOTC.P, 34(25)- &quot; u. Copy No.CAB I N E T.: ,   3LG.XZJIU......    .,Memorandum by the 1&apos;repident of tite-&apos;&apos;&quot;Br,ard --of Education.In connection with recent Cabinet papers and discussions I venture to set down oertain considerations on Egyptian-Policy... It is perhaps rather.misleading to discuss this question in terms of a contrast, between &quot;Cromerism&quot; and .&quot;Milnerism&quot;,     This contrast does not, in my small experience of Egypt, represent either the facts of the situation in that Country or the real division of opinion among British or foreign residents.      &quot;Cromerism,&quot; in so far as it can be defined at all, aimed at giving the. shadow of power to a native. Egyptian Government while concentrating the substance in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   In so far as it-was successful .in doing this, its success was largely: due not only, as pointed out by the Foreign Secretary, to the absence of an Egyptian Parliament, but also&apos;to the existence of Turkish suzerainty.     So long as that suzerainty existed;, it was not necessary or possible to draw any clear dividing line between.the shadow and the substance..    Turkish, suzerainty, itself in great degree a legal fiction since the.days of Mehmet Ali, made it far easier in practice to maintain the other legal fiction of the independence-: of the native Egyptian Government vis-a-vis Lord Cromer and his officials.     Even so, &quot;Cromerism&quot; was essentially a policy of opportunism;.
it meant different things at different periods, and ita insecurity was always recognised, especially towards the end of Lord Crcmer&apos;s term of office.     Many MMilneritea&quot; would argue, and indeed have argued, that when the disappearance of Turkish suzerainty made it necessary to re-define the status of Egypt, it was on the whole, more in harmony with the spirit of &quot;Cromerism&quot; to define that status in terms of independence than in terms of a protectorate.     Conducted on these lines, therefore, a discussion cf Egyptian polidy tends to &quot;become unreal.The real division of opinion seems to me to be somewhat different.     One school of thought believes that just as Lord Cromer, taking the situation as he then found it, succeeded in permeating the whole Government of Egypt with British advice, assistance, and control, so we, taking the changed situation as we find it to-day, should adopt the same policy.     Our difficulties are clearly much greater than those which confronted Lord Cromer.     S&quot;cr the moment, at any rata, we have an Egyptian Parliament voting the salaries of any British officials who nay be serving under the Egyptian Government.     &quot;We cannot, therefore, offer such officials the same security aa Lord Cromer offered them.     We are, moreover, no longer dealing with a bankrupt Egypt on whose financial restoration depends her chances of escaping foreign intervention, and whose financial restoration can only be carried out with British advice and control.     Again, there is now no immediate danger on any of the frontiers of Egypt and the presence of British officers in the Egyptian Army or of British troops is no longer so obviously necessary as not to require justification.     These and other difficulties notwithstanding, this school believes that if we take skilful advantage of every opportunity which
offered itself and.-if we are prepared, to a certain extent, to pledge the British Exchequer to the officials whom we ask to undertake service in Egypt, we can gradually re-introduce British control and re-establish the traditions of British administration in Egypt.The other school of thought may be called the &quot;arms-length&quot; School.     This school believes that the Egyptians must be convinced by experience that they are incapable of self-government.     The only way in which this can be brought about is to give them full responsibility.     We must, there-fore, withdraw ourselves from any position which might involve us in any appearance of responsibility for the acts of the Government e,nd having so withdrawn ourselves we must hold the Egyptian Government to what President Wilson used to call &quot;strict accountability.&quot;.    We must deal with them at arms length in order that we may strike them more effectively if they do anything wrong.    -The controversy about the garrison in Cairo is an excellent instance of the two views.     The first school of thought wants the presence of British soldiers on the streets of Cairo to become accepted as an ordinary and normal part of the life of the city - as a sign of British interest in Egypt and of British willingness in the last resort to protect the lives and property, not only of foreigners, but of the Egyptian people themselves.     The sensible members of the &quot;arms-length&quot; School on the other hand, point out that so long as the army is in Cairo it cannot be brought into Cairo dramatically as a sign of British displeasure and they, therefore, advocate that it should be withdrawn to some strategic position on the Canal or elsewhere satisfactory to the War Office, from whence it can be easily rushed into Cairo in case of danger or disturbance.
The &quot;arms-length&quot; school attracts me in many ways, but it seems to me that there are two overwhelming objections to it:- lMP^M^:        fl2;IPSS^:SS^;SI^ Si[l)     If you wish to educate an incompetent people into self-government, it is perfectly reasonable to throw responsibilities upon them which you know they oannot adequately bear but which you believe they are capable of bearing in the future with practice and experience. But if you know that this kind of, experiment is going to fail and if. you Initiate it in order that it may fail, then you are doing something which is neither reasonable nor wholly honest.     The only people whom you will convince by a deliberately unsuccessful experiment of this kind will be the people who are intelligent enough to see the connection between cause and effect, and people who are intelligent enough for this are Intelligent enough to be convinced by argument beforehand.     In fact, while the consequences of the withdrawal of British officials are Obvious enough in Egypt already, the only Egyptians whom we have oonverted. by our.policy are our own friends virho needed no conversion who foresaw the oonsequencee quite as well as we did, who are quite      aware of our motives., and are -disgusted with ua for what they regard as our wanton desertion of their interests.     We have hot convinced the stupid Nationalists because they are .incapable of thought, and we have not convinced the clever ITa-tionalists because they never believed in their own policy.     We certainly, have not convinced tho fellaheen who were illiterate enough to swallow Nationalist propaganda in the past and are still illiterate enough to be convinced by the same propaganda in the future that their ills are not - really due, for instance, to inefficient irrigation but
to the machinations of British cotton operators in Lancashire.     Moreover, we have cast a quite Undeserved reflection     upon the competence of Egyptian irrigation engineers and the like.     SO long as these people were, to a oertain extent, protected by English superiors from the burdens and temptations Of independent Responsibility, they did their work perfectly well.     They were Indeed technically competent in a very high degree, and One of the real criticisms which can be made of our administration in Egypt is that we did not sufficiently recognise or giVe them credit for their abilities.     At least, however, we did not hold them up to the contempt of the world as we have now done, and we cannot expect them to thank uo for that action,(2) The &quot;arms-length&quot; policy really means that we are to holdEgypt by our army.     There are only two ways of holding a oountry - by administration or by armed force - and an army in cantonmentB on the Canal would be more really an Army of Occupation than an army garrisoning Cairo.     I agree with Bismarck that   you can do many things with bayonets but you cannot sit upon them, and the &quot;arms-length&quot; policy really means that we are going to sit-upon nothing elBe.I feel, therefore, that our only possible course is a return to the policy of gradual permeation with all its difficulties.   Por that reason I should not abandon any position which we now hold.     If at all possible we should continue to have a British Sirdar and if necessary we should be prepared to guarantee the salary and the future of any British official who is prepared to continue in the service of the Egyptian Government or to enter that service.       We shall only be able to proceed
with thia policy very slowly; we shall need great patience, But if we are to succeed in it, wo must not proclaim it in advance.      At the height of Lord Cromer^a power we always described our position in Egypt In terms of studied modera* tion, a fact which the advocates of a return to HCromeriamM too often forget.      Today, if we are to emulate;Lord Croraej^s success, we oust also emulate hia moderation.
