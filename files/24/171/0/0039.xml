[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!39CABINET.NAVY ESTIMATES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE First Lord wishes to present Naval Estimates to Parliament for the year 1925-26 of  69,241,477 gross and  65,500,000 nett. This is described as an increase of  9,700,000 over the current financial year. As  580,000 of terminable Annuities fall in this year and are absorbed by fresh expenditure, it is really an increase of  10,280,000. This total comprises  1,323,000 for the Fleet Air Arm formerly borne on Air Force Votes without of course preventing a considerable increase on those Votes. Such an event will excite national and world-wide attention. It must necessarily become the outstanding feature of our policy, and it will be taken at home and abroad as indicating the spirit and policy of the new Government. It will play a prominent part in all the criticisms directed against us from every hostile quarter. It is therefore important that the Cabinet, before embarking upon such a policy of increased armament expenditure, should weigh the whole matter well.The expansion proposed for the year 1925-26 does not stand alone. It is part of a policy which, if adopted by the Cabinet, will irrevocably produce further great increases in succeeding years. For instance, the Admiralty ask on Vote A for an increase of 1,350 officers and men. This involves a con-tinuing charge of  870,000 a year, of which only about half operates this year. The oil fuel and storage programme of  3,919,600 is estimated to rise steadily to  4,587,000 in 1928-29. The new con-struction programme of 5 cruisers, 8 submarines, 6 costly depot, repair and victualling ships, and 11 minor vessels amounts to  21millions, less than 2 millions of which fall in the year 1925-26. Neither is it true that the increased expenditure for 1925-26 is caused by the working off of former new construction programmes. The increase under that head is stated by the First Lord to be no more than  550,000, and the total sum required for new construction in the proposed Estimates does not exceed  9^ millions. But this naval programme is only the forerunner of a succession of new construction programmes. The Admiralty have been good enough to furnish me with some information as to their plans for the next four years,  from which it appears that[12571]   [12613] bMOST SECRET. CP. 39 (25).
expenditure on new construction in that period may be somewhat as this forecast shows that the cost of the new construction programmes will rise above the proposed figure for 1925-26 by approximately  9 millions additional in 1926-27, another  4 millions additional in 1927-28 and a further increase of  2 millions in 1928-29, a total super increase of  15 millions on new construction alone, fully operative in the fourth year. The First Lord has explained that in asking for no more addition to Vote A than 4,350 officers and men he is taking some risk. As larger and more complicated vessels are built, further considerable additions will of course be necessary year by year. There are also additions to be expected from the automatic increases in Navy Pay and marriage allowances; for the increase in non-effective Votes; from the gradual exhaustion of the reserves of wartime naval and victualling stores; and for the development of Singapore. Surveying the whole field with some experience of these matters, I cannot doubt that proceeding on the present lines the Naval estimates for 1926-27 will be about  12 millions above those of 1925-26 and those of 1927-28, perhaps  7 millions higher still. This would give us gross Naval Estimates in 1926-27 of  81-i- millions, in 1927-28 of  88-*- millions and in 1928-29 of over  90 millions.If this policy of armament expansion and the reasoning on which it is based are adopted by the Cabinet, certain financial consequences must inevitably follow. &quot; First, there can be no possibility of any appreciable reduction in Direct Taxation, not only this year but in the next three years. Secondly, no effective funds can be available for social reform, housing, insurance, education and the like. I may reasonably expect a moderate expansion of the revenue through a better year coming into the average of the Income Tax returns; through increasingly severe collection; through the slow but steady growth of Death Duties; through the economies due to the reduction of the Debt charge by the operation of the Sinking Fund; and, so long as our credit is maintained, through certain economies of Conversion. But these sums will in the three years under review just about suffice to pay for the naval increases. To resort to borrowing in the shape of a Naval Loan would affect our credit and compromise the great operations of Conversion which will be upon us in 1928-29. The Cabinet is therefore fortunate in finding the choice before it extremely simple. We can, if we choose, make this a Naval Parliament, the work and resources of which will  have been . wholly  devoted  to  maintaining  and  developing ourfollows :   million.1925-26 1926-27 1927-28 1928-2924*
sea power, and which, in consequence has had to demand the hardest sacrifices from the taxpayer, and to forgo all plans of social reform. On this basis I believe that we could meet the Admiralty requirements without any important increase in taxation. Is this, then, to be the decision to which we are to come ?Such a policy would of course concentrate upon us a most formidable agitation at home. The whole force of the Opposition Parties would be directed to denouncing the militarism of the Government, which it could truly be stated had closed the doors on social reform. But more dangerous than this will be the discontent of the direct taxpayer. Everyone will remember the outcry raised at the beginning of 1922 and its deeply injurious effects upon the Coalition Government. It will be unfortunate if in our efforts to sustain and develop the Navy we break up the present governing instrument and produce a political situation which restores a Socialist or Radical-Socialist Government to power; for then would come a wholesale and ruthless cutting down of the Navy, and all the money and efforts which to our own detriment we had devoted for three years would be undone in the fourth. This is an aspect of our Imperial safety which should perhaps be present to the minds of Admirals as well as of politicians.The Foreign Secretary will no doubt judge the consequences which striking British Naval developments of this kind will have upon the external situation. Our League of Nations position will of course become ludicrous. It seems almost certain that the expansion of our Navy Estimates and the growth of our new construction will entail immediate rejoinders from Japan and still more from the United States. We might even find that building five more cruisers had merely called ten or twelve into existence against us, and so on.It seems to be necessary to review our Naval position. The Admiralty consider that we are in great danger from Japan. The First Sea Lord has described the position as &quot;intolerable,&quot; and has expressed his relief that our present unclouded relations with that country accord us &quot; a breathing space &quot; in which to prepare. I do not deny that the position of Japan in her own home waters and in the Northern Pacific is a very strong one, and I am still in favour of a gradual and discreet development of our fuel bases along the Eastern route, and in particular of Singapore. But I cannot regard the situation as urgent or critical. Certainly it is not sufficiently urgent or critical to call for action on our part so swift and far-reaching as largely to transform our naval organisation or to dislocate our whole finances. In the years preceding the Great &quot;War not only was the Japanese Fleet overwhelmingly superior to any force we could place-on the China station, but the whole British Fleet was riveted to the North Sea by the supreme German menace. In those days we scarcely dared to send our battle squadrons as far as the coast of Spain for their autumn cruise. Germany and Germany alone absorbed our thoughts; and nobody with whom I came in contact felt or showed the slightest anxiety&apos; r125711 b 2
about Japan. This danger has, in fact, become apparent only when greater dangers have passed away.The present position is surely better in several respects than it was in those days. The British Navy has no pre-occupations in home waters: the deadly peril to the Island is removed : the German Fleet is at the bottom of the sea. The great and powerful Navy of the United States, in appearance almost the equal of our own, has come into being and, though remote, is in fundamental antagonistic relation to that of Japan. The words which the Foreign Secretary and the Lord President have lately used to the Committee of Imperial&apos; Defence should also afford some reassurance :-&quot; Mr. Austen Chamberlain:.....I regard the prospect of warin the Far East as very remote. I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which, singlehanded, we are likely to go to Avar with Japan. I cannot conceive it possible that Japan, singlehanded, should seek a conflict with us. The only case in which I think Japan (which is an uneasj^ and rather restless Power, whose action is not always easy to predicate) might become dangerous is after a new regrouping of the European Powers. In other words, unless we see signs of a German-Russo-Japanese Alliance or agreement, I should not anticipate war between ourselves and Japan. I should regard the signs of such an agreement, such a new regrouping of the Powers as being a danger signal which would at once call our attention to the situation and would require that we should review it afresh. Of that regrouping there is at present no sign. Germany is not yet in a position in which she can enter into engagements of that kind. There is no sign at present of an agreement between Russia and Japan, and I think it would be with difficulty that they would reconcile their interests for the purposes of such an agreement. Therefore, at the present time, I should regard the danger of war between ourselves and Japan as being as remote as the danger of war with any other Great Power. Japan has ambitions in China. I am quite certain that she is not seeking an occasion to make a Avar for the sake of China, and would be very reluctant to do so, but I cannot conceive at present of a development of Japanese policy in China which, if it were antagonistic to us or offensive to our sentiments, would not be even more offensive, or at least equally offensive, to America, and where we should not be acting with America instead of acting alone. As long as Japan is isolated, as she will be if she parts company with America and ourselves, it seems to- me inconceivable that she should seek a quarrel or get into a position in which she cannot avoid a quarrel with America and ourselves. .... I should strongly deprecate anything that can be read here or elsewhere as competitive building between ourselves and Japan in anticipation of a new struggle. If the danger of a struggle ever materialises, I think we shall have plenty of warning, and it would be a great mistake to
disquiet the Japanese, to render them more nervous than they are. I think they would be rather frightened by any appearance of a hostile programme of naval shipbuilding, which they would interpret not as a measure of protection on our part, but as preparation for an aggressive attack upon them at some time. ...&quot;&quot; Lord Curzon: I do not think I have anything to add to the state-ment made by the Foreign Secretary, with which I cordially agree, except this, that all our evidence from Japan and some of us have friends who write to us from there, apart from the official statements which we read tends to show that, while Japan feels sore and sorry and rather sick at the loss of the British Alliance, she is anxious to replace it, as far as she possibly can, by intimate and cordial relations between ourselves, and therefore, quite apart from the remote risk of any such regrouping of the Powers as Mr. Chamberlain has talked of, there is in Japan itself the strongest pro-British sentiment at the present time, and it is scarcely possible, so far as I can judge, to conceive of any state of affairs in which the general trend of Japanese policy would for many years to come be anti-British. That is the only contribution, for what it is worth, I have to make to- the discussion.&quot;Further reassurance is found by a comparison of British and Japanese Naval strengths. We have 18 Battleships against 6 Japanese and an equal number of Battle Cruisers (4) on each side. In addition, we are building the two strongest Battleship-Battle Cruisers in the World. We have, excluding &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious,&quot; 57 Cruisers, British and Dominion, built and building against 24 Japanese; and 209 Flotilla- Leaders and Destroyers against 118 Japanese. An analysis of the relative Cruiser strengths would emphasise these figures.Although to our eyes the position of Japan (if she became aggressive) in the Far East may appear formidable, her own situation must cause her legitimate anxieties. She is webbed about on both sides of the World by the Naval apparatus of the two mighty English-speaking nations. She has agreed that our two Battle Fleets shall be to hers in the proportion of ten to three. She watches with anxious eyes the strong, though distant, development of American Naval power in the Pacific and the remorseless advance of the renowned Navy^of Britain towards her island home. Can we wonder that she builds light cruisers and is, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;^ words, &quot; uneasy and restless &quot; ? What would our feelings be if we saw ourselves being laid hold of by a similar pair of tongs ?When we look across the Atlantic Ocean at the Navy of the United States, a different series of facts present themselves for consideration. Battleships, Battle Cruisers and Aircraft Carriers are regulated by the Washington Convention. There is absolutely no doubt that our Battle Fleet is the stronger, even on paper.   The Americans have a certain[12571]   &apos; b 3
superiority in Destroyers and Submarines, but in Cruisers they are astonishingly weak. The American Secretary to the Navy has recently stated that the ratio of British to United States Cruisers is as 5 to 1. The United States have only nine modern Cruisers. Since our decision last year to lay down 5 10,000-ton cruisers, Congress has authorised the construction of 8 such vessels, which the United States Navy certainly requires. But the President has not yet taken the necessary steps to obtain the money. Whatever may happen about these 8 cruisers, a vigorous pro-gramme of Cruiser building on our part will read either to our being confronted with the competition of a far superior wealth, to which we ourselves are forced to contribute, or, on the other hand, to our being led into another Naval Convention, in which we shall be compelled to settle on the basis of mere numerical equality and without regard for our special needs.The Admiralty seem to be misconceiving the problem which is before them. That problem is to keep a Navy in being which over a long period of profound peace will, taken as a whole, not be inferior to the Navy either of the United States or of Japan. But this does not imply the immediate development of the means on the part of the British Navy to dominate either of these two Powers in their own quarter of the globe. In the case of the United States it must be recognised that no such attempt is being made by the Admiralty. In the case of Japan, however, a truly prodigious effort is absorbing the thoughts and exertions of the Admiralty staff. The Navy Estimates bear its imprint on almost every page. The construction of the naval base at Singapore, however desirable as a pillar in Imperial com-munications, has become a peg on which to hang the whole vast scheme of scientific naval control of Japan. Our Cruiser programme, with its formidable expense, is measured entirely against the Japanese. One hundred liners are to be equipped with 6-inch guns to act as auxiliary cruisers. The scale and rapidity with which the tremendous scheme of oil fuel installations is being pressed all along the Far Eastern route is a feature. So also are the developments which are taking place in the Naval ports along this route from Malta to Singapore. A costly development of Fleet auxiliaries, oilers, provision ships, Fleet repair ships, new depot ships for destroyers, follows naturally from the same cause. It is proposed at the earliest possible moment to base a powerful submarine force at Hong Kong, and a Submarine Depot Ship costing about  1,000,000 is included in the present programme for that express purpose. As soon as arrangements can be made a Battle Cruiser Squadron will be based upon Singapore1. For this a new million pound Fleet Repair Ship is now required. However desirable or well conceived in strategic theory these developments may be, I cannot feel that the existing international situation justifies either the rate or the scale on which they are now proceeding. If the cost of the &quot;policy becomes so great as to compromise the general action of the State
and to expose us to other dangers of a very serious kind we should be bound to review it and control it.Our naval situation to-day is in no way comparable in intensity or crisis to that which existed before the war. The only other two great naval Powers in the world are separated from us by oceans, and have no bases within thousands of miles of our home waters. They have no means of forcing a supreme naval battle upon us suddenly or within a short time. When we faced Germany across the narrow North Sea, we knew that we must always be ready to fight a decisive battle within a few days of the declaration of war, or perhaps simultaneously with the declaration of war. If, for instance, hostilities began on Monday, we could be threatened with invasion on Wednesday and have to engage the whole German Navy on Thursday or Friday. All our arrangements were aimed, to the best of our science and knowledge, at instant and continuous readiness for the supreme test. It was from such circumstances that the argument of &quot; the average versus the selected moment&quot; was drawn. There is absolutely no resemblance between that tremendous situation and the secondary anxieties of the present time. Nothing could happen on the seas, however unpleasant, which could expose us to mortal danger in a short time, or oblige us to risk a decisive battle unless we were thoroughly ready.Yet in spite of this, the whole of our naval organisation is being kept at a far higher pitch of preparedness and instant readiness than was deemed&quot; possible in 1914. Practically the whole Fleet, apart from destroyers and small craft, is maintained in full commission. The system of manning ships on the Second Fleet scale, i.e., 60 per cent, full nucleus crews on board, and 40 per cent, active service ratings requalifying in the schools ashore, has been entirely abandoned. Practically every ship not in dockyard hands refitting is kept permanently manned with its full complement of active service ratings. These complements have been largely increased in the same ships since 1914; for instance, the approved war complement of the Iron Duke in 1914 was 885, the approved peace complement is now 1,089, and the super-war complement (all of active service ratings to be provided without calling out reserves) is 1,212. Virtually the whole of the personnel are on a long-service basis of twelve years, with an option of continuing to twenty-one. We are therefore keeping our whole Fleet permanently manned during an indefinite period of peace with full complements of highly-trained long-service men. The reserve system, which every other military or naval organisation in the world has adopted to a greater or less extent, has practically ceased to play any effectual part in the British Navy. Only 15,000 Reservists are required for British warships on full mobilisation. Whereas the element of sudden, supreme, fatal danger has been entirely removed, our precautions against such danger have been carried, regardless of expense, to a far higher pitch of perfection. We are invited to live, perhaps for a quarter of a century of peace, with our pistol at&quot; full-cock and our finger on the trigger.   I regard
and to expose us to other dangers of a very serious kind we should be bound to review it and control it.Our naval situation to-day is in no way comparable in intensity or crisis to that which existed before the war.

We are invited to live, perhaps for a quarter of a century of peace, with our pistol at full-cock and our finger on the trigger.  I regard
this not only as utterly unreasonable but as positively injurious to the main interests of the State.The problem of keeping in being for an indefinite period a British Fleet not inferior, taken as a whole, to the next Naval Power in other words, of maintaining a &quot; One-Power standard &quot; is in itself enough to absorb all the skill and science of the Admiralty and all the available resources of the taxpayer. I do not at all ignore the very serious difficulty which will in any case be upon us in future years of replacing a large proportion of the units of our Fleet as they become really worn out. This, in my judgment, is a call upon us far superior to the development of our naval position in the Pacific. If those claims compete within the limits of our available finance we may be forced to choose between them. In any case, if the task of gradual Fleet rebuilding is to be successfully accomplished without raising domestic and external complications, it can only be by rigorous thrift and great administrative contrivance on the part of the Admiralty. It is not necessary in the present state of the world that our Naval organisation should be complete and perfect in all respects, ready at a moment&apos;s notice to spring into full warlike action. During a long peace, such as follows in the wake of great wars, there must inevitably develop gaps in our structure of armaments. We have to select the essential elements of war power from amidst great quantities of ancillary and subsidiary improvements. These gaps can be gradually and unostentatiously filled up if deep international antagonisms, the invariable precursors of great wars, gradually become apparent in the world.The task of maintaining the &quot; One Power Standard,&apos;5 even on a purely defensive and peace-time basis, will, in any case, having regard to all the burdens we have to bear, strain our resources to the utmost. It is a task which will much better be undertaken on a long rather than a short view. I should be quite willing, once the great questions of principle have been settled by the Cabinet, to consider with the Admiralty the increased financial provision which will inevitably be required, after every economy has been made, to rebuild that portion of the British Fleet likely to become finally unserviceable according to standards comparable to those of other Naval Powers in the next five years. There are great advantages in treating the subject in this way. Good reasons can be given to Parliament and the public for a sober and systematic policy of this kind. We should, of course, remain perfectly free ourselves to cope by new measures with unforeseeable tendencies. But the declaration of our intentions in normal circumstances over a lustrum would in itself exercise a steadying effect upon the programmes both of the United States and Japan. Japan particularly, if convinced that she is not being made the object of a scientific Naval approach, would probably rejoice in the relief from new construction thus afforded to her.I do not feel justified in resting solely on criticism.  Although conscious
of the difficulties of making constructive proposals of economy, I would venture to propose to the Cabinet the following measures to arrest the expansion of Naval Expenditure before it is too late :  (1.) No new construction programme this year, except perhaps a few submarines : the whole Cruiser question to be examined meanwhile by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   [Saving (say)  1,800,000.   Second year  8,000,000.](2.) No addition to personnel. The 100,000 officers and men now borne on Vote A to be distributed by the Admiralty to the best advantage among the Fleets and Shore Establishments : the balance between home and foreign service to be reconsidered : a proportion of battleships and cruisers serving in home waters or the Mediterranean to be manned in peace with full nucleus crews-on the pre-war Second Fleet Scale : the reserve system and the immediate reserve to be developed and utilised to a greater extent for mobilisation in time of war, a larger proportion of short-service men being engaged if necessary for this purpose : the schools to be closed on the outbreak of war, and their personnel made available for mobilisation, as in 1914. [Saving  427,000 in 1925-26, and  870,000 a year thereafter.](3.) The expenditure on the Fleet Air Arm to be limited to  1,000,000 in 1925-26, the increase in Aircraft Carriers, in which we have an unquestioned lead, to be slowed down.   [Saving  323,000.](4.) The rate of the expansion of our oil-fuel installations to be spread over double the number of years, i.e., the figure of 5 million tons to be reached only in 1933-34 instead of 1928-29; this to be effected in conjunction with economy in Fleet movement so as to reduce the prospective annual charges on Fuel and Fuel Reserve together by one-half. [Saving in 1925-26  1,950,000. Second year  2,300,000.1(5.) The expenditure on Singapore to be spread over fifteen years instead of the present period.(6.) A reduction of at least  3 millions to be obtained from the Estimates of this year by internal economies, including the diminution in the number of depot ships, of new works, in the costs of shore establishments generally and for the invariable over-budgeting on approved services.   [Saving  3,000,000.](7.) The proposal of new marriage allowances to be negatived. [Saving  350,000.](8.) The pay scales of the Navy to be revised for future entrants simultaneously with the revision in the other services, and these results to be made effective from the year 1925-26 onwards.These or alternative savings would still leave the Navy Estimates at
 57,650,000 or nearly  2 millions above last year, despite the saving from the reduced terminable Annuities. No one can say this is not an ample supply.I must, however, point out to the Cabinet that the serious character of this issue is not confined to the present year. It is far greater in the two years which follow. At the present moment a choice is open between alternative policies, and future naval expenditure is still controllable. Once, however, the programme of new construction now proposed by the Admiralty is sanctioned and begun and additions of officers and men to Vote A are approved, there can be no turning back. The Estimates for 1926-27 must certainly rise by at least 6, 7 or 8 millions above the increase now demanded. It will be impossible then, however great the outcry  unless we are prepared to leave ships unfinished on the stocks or buy out men newly engaged to prevent Naval expenditure from becoming the main, and even the sole, feature of the policy of the Government. &quot;Whatever the decision, it should be taken with full realisation of the consequences.Treasury Chambers, S.W.,January 29, 1925.W.
