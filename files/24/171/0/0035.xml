This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government,   i.Printed for the Cabinet, January, 1925.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 35(35). ,THE CABINET.THE STATUS OF THE EGYPTIAN ARMY AND THE COMMAND OF THE SUDAN DEFENCE FORCE.NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In my previous memorandum (OP. 526 (24) ), I urged the desirability of main- 0343 taining the status quo in the sphere of the Egyptian Army, and this view was, I thought, 21^y confirmed by the Cabinet decision taken (Cabinet 66 (24) ) 10th December, 1924.I have seen a report in the Press of 23rd January that an Egyptian Army Council has been created under a decree of King Fuad, a very serious departure from the status quo. I have not seen any report from Lord Allenby on this departure and yet it could hardly have been done without his knowledge.After the impending elections in Egypt, we may find ourselves confronted with either a friendly or a hostile Government. In the former case any anomalies which exist in the status quo can, it is hoped, be adjusted in a friendly spirit, and a modus operandi agreeable to both parties achieved. In the latter case, it is not improbable that we may require to exercise a measure of active and dominant control over the Egyptian Army. Any steps taken in the intervening period towards making the Egyptian Army independent of British Government control by the appointment of an Egyptian Sirdar would render the renewal, extension and exercise of such control more difficult. The creation of an Egyptian Army Council if, as I expect, the British are in a hopeless minority, adds to the difficulties.In the sphere also of the Sudan I am equally anxious not to disturb the status quo. Colonel Huddleston, the acting Sirdar of the Egyptian Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Sudan Defence Force, should for the time being retain his acting position in the dual capacity. I do not consider that his Sudan command should be made permanent for the following reason : While Colonel Huddleston is an undoubtedly capable officer, I am advised that he has not that experience of organisation and administration which I regard as essential for the development of the Sudan Defence Force. He is a comparatively junior officer and has over 200 substantive Colonels on the active list senior to him. His war experience dated only from January, 1917, when he commanded a battalion of British Imperial Camel Corps in Palestine and subsequently an infantry brigade in Egypt. He was then employed in various missions from September, 1919, to November, 1922, when he returned to the Egyptian Army in which he was appointed Chief Staff Officer and Adjutant-General in June, 1923.I am advised that it would be in the best interests of the Sudan to send out an officer of substantive major-general&apos;s rank, with up-to-date- experience of training in modern methods and of marked administrative capacity which will be required to build up the Sudan Defence Force and possessed of a higher status and reputation in the British, Army than attaches at present to Colonel Huddleston.For these reasons I am averse from any action being taken which would lead Colonel Huddleston to think that his appointment was permanent. At the same time I 0 deprecate the immediate apj^ointment of a permanent successor to him in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief of the Sudan Defence, as such appointment would disturb the status quo and raise the question of the appointment of a Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, although I think it would be fairer to warn Colonel Huddleston of the temporary nature of his appointment.L. W.-E.The War Office,26th January, 1925.26/Ptg/364   100   1/25   W.O.P.   1692
