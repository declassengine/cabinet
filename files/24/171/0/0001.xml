DRAFT    INSTRUCTIONS   FOR    BRITISH   GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVE   AT    THE - TWENTY-FIFTH   SESSION OF   THE   GOVERNING    BODY    OF    THE    INTERNATIONAL LABOUR    OFFICE.Agenda .of .the, 1926 International Labour Conference.The following subjects will be considered for Inscription on the Agenda of the 1926 Conference :-(a (b (c (d (e (f(g (h(iUMethods of Fixing Minimum Wage RateajIndustrial Accidents;Works Councils;Paid Holidays for Workers ;Inspection of Emigrants of Different Nationalities; Sanitary Conditions on Emigrant Ships; Minimum Conditions for  -Emigrant Ships; International Seamen&apos;s Code;System of Inspection for the Mercantile Marine; Hours of Work at Sea.The British Government representative will strongly urge the Inscription on the Agenda of subjects(a) and (b) which are both British proposals.     If it is found Impossible to get both subjects on the Agenda, he will press (a) in preference to (b).     Should he find It impossible to carry the Governing Body with him In Including the subject of fixing minimum wage rates (which he will suggest should be amended to read &quot;(a) The establishment, of machinery for the statutory regulation , of minimum rates of traces in the lower paid industries&quot;\   he will reserve his right at the April meeting of the Governing Body to raise the possibility of the subject of wages in general being considered by a eommittee
appointed at the International Labour Conference in either 1925 or 1926.(c) Works Councils.     This subject Is only a part of the general question of organisation of employers and workers and machinery for regulating industrial conditions, and its inscription on the Agenda at the present juncture will be opposed.Paid Holidays for Workers-      The subject of . holidays with pay is a part only of the general subject of workers&apos; remuneration.     The proper point at which to begin consideration of this question for international purposes, therefore, is the examination of the question of minimum wages, and the inscription of the subject on the Agenda at the present juncture will be opposed, (e), (f) and (g)    Inspection of Emigrants of DifferentNationalities .Sanitary,Conditions on Emigrant Ships, Minimum, Conditions for Emigrant Ships.. The International Conference on Emigration and Immigration convened by the Italian Government and held in Rome in May, 1924, passed various resolutions with regard to emigration, including resolutions on these three subjects. At the conclusion of the Conference, it was proposed that further work should be undertaken by an internstional Committee, having Its headquarters at Rome,    Lord UHswater, the British Delegate to the Rome Conference,  opposed this on the ground that it was unnecessary to set tip a new international body when international organisations already existed under the Peace Treaty that could deal with the matter.
In view of this attitude, therefore, the British Government representative will not oppose the inscription of any of these questions on the Agenda of the 1926 Conference, though it is considered that either of the first two is tr be preferred to the third.(h) International Seamen^ Code.     A draft International Seamen&apos;s Cede, running Into no less than 73 articles and dealing In considerable detail with various aspects of seamen&apos;s employment, has been circulated by the International Labour Office.     It Is felt that this Is not the beat method of approach and that it would be better to try and formulate a certain number of broad general principles to which general agreement could be obtained, before any Conference proceeded to discuss details.     However, the seamen and the International Labour Office seern anxious to have the subject discussed andit is felt that it would be undesirable for the British Government representative to oppose vigorously a proposal to inscribe the subject on the Agenda of the 1926 Conference. He will, however, point out the danger of asking the Conference to discuss in detail a draft containing 73 articles and, if an, opportunity occurs, will suggest that, at any rate, the first Conference to consider the question should merely appoint a Committee to examine the draft generally and report to a future Conference.(i) Syjtem^f^ Inspect ion.....f ,oruii. the, Mercantile Marine...      Itis not quite clear what questions it Is proposed to consider under this head, and the British Government representative will endeavour to get a clearer definition of what is proposed. Probably, however, British interests:will stand to gain rather than to lose by the.introduction of international uniformity
in such matters as seamen s accommodation, heating and ventilation of seamen&apos;s quarters, protection against weather, sanitary arrangements, statutory food scale, and so on.     The British Government representative will, therefore, support the inclusion of this item on the Agenda, subject to It being defined satisfactorily.(j) Hours of Work at Sea.^      It Is possible that consideration of this question at the 1926 International Labour Conference will not be pressed.     If it Is, however, the British Government representative will take the line that it is of no use to attempt to find an international solution of the question until British ship owners and seamen have come to an agreement.
