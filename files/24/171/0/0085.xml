[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;557Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET.CP. 84 (25).39CABINET.AIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE First Lord and the Naval Staff have circulated memoranda (CP.-40/25) upon Airship Development. As both papers show a fundamental misapprehension of the present position, I am circulating to my colleagues the following statement of my own views, together with more technical appreciations of the situation by the Air Staff and the Supply and Research Department of the Air Ministry respectively (see Appendices I and II).2. Three assumptions are made, in the papers of the First Lord and the Naval Staff. In the first place, it is alleged that private enterprise has been sacrificed to bureaucratic control; secondly, that economy has given place to expensive duplication-tion; and, thirdly, that an unnecessary increase of armament construction has been superimposed upon the commercial development of airships. If these assumptions were correct, even though they be supported by a series of most disputable arguments and calculations, the Cabinet would have good reason to insist upon a reversal of the present policy, and, as the Minister solely responsible for airship development, I should be the first to press it upon my colleagues. Not only, however, are none of these three assumptions correct, but the question is by no means as simple as it was two years ago or as the First Lord and the Naval Staff wish to make it appear.3. The Cabinet will no doubt recall the tedious and tangled controversy over airships since, primarily in deference to the views of the Naval Staff as to their limited utility in naval warfare in the then existing conditions, the Air Ministry reluctantly decided in 1920 to close down the airship service. Each, however, of the last three Governments has realised the potential value of a development that may improve Imperial communications to an amazing degree and provide an economical -method of mobile defence and air reconnaissance. Out of this general desire to resume a policy of airship development there emerged two main programmes : (1) the Burney proposals; (2) the less ambitious scheme of the Labour Government. The details of the two schemes I have set out in Appendix III. If, however, I am to compare them in a sentence, I should say that, whilst the Burney scheme provided at least on paper for a larger scale of development, the scheme of the last Government was certainly the safer of the two on the side both of technical development and of the obligations undertaken by the Treasury.Under the Burney scheme the Government were to provide a sum of  2,800,000, subject to certain conditions, over a period of seven years in the form of debentures carrying no interest and only repayable out of profits,^) During a subsequent period of eight years an annual fee payment, inevitably assessed on purely hypothetical data, was to be made to the Operating Company for six airships in commission between England and India. The only two airship stations owned by the Government were to be leased to the Company at a peppercorn rent with an option to purchase for  500,000 4he price to be satisfied by a further issue of non-interest-bearing debentures. (2)Under the scheme of the last Government an experimental stage was substituted for the bigger scheme. The Air Ministry was to build an airship and a second ship was to be built under contract by the Burney-Vickers group. The cost of the scheme was to be  1,350,000 gross, or  1,200,000 net, over a three-year period, i.e.,Q-) Upon the optimistic estimate of. 20 per cent, profits the repayment would take fifty-six years.(2) Also repayable out of profits, a liability which would, of course, proportionately extend the fifty-six years&apos;, period above mentioned. The properties thus surrendered, tog-ether with the plant installed and existing airship material which was to be transferred free of charge, are probably worth, as a going concern, at least double this amount.
the equivalent over the period, as a whole of the annual payments to be made to the Burney-vickers group under the former scheme; an extensive programme of research was to be undertaken and before the end of the three-years&apos; period two experimental airships of 5,000,000 cubic feet were to have been completed and flown to India. The station and bases would be the property of the Government, whilst one of the two airships was to be purchasable by Commander Burney at half price.4. As to the financial features of the two schemes, I should prefer to leave the details to the Treasury, who were responsible for the financial negotiations with the Burney-Vickers group. As for myself, I never disguised from my colleagues the fact that I did not like certain of the conditions. In the circumstances, - however, it seemed to me that, as it then appeared to be a choice between a monopoly upon terms very favourable to the Burney-Vickers group and the abandonment of airship development, it was just worth taking the obvious risks. My doubts have since been strengthened by the subsequent knowledge that a Bill of a very vulnerable character from the point of view of the House of Commons would be necessary for implementing the agreement, and that further difficulties between the Government and the Burney-Vickers group over a number of important financial and technical details were coming to a head at the time that I left office. The Treasury had indeed been most successful in eliminating several of the most objectionable features of the original proposals, but I think that I am right in saying that they were still far from satisfied with the monopolistic character of the agreement and with the division of the risks between the Burney-Vickers group and the State. Even so, the State was incurring possible commitments to the extent of  4,800,000, to say nothing of the heavy subsidy involved in the free transfer of material and the leasing of two large establishments at a peppercorn rent, as against a strictly limited liability of  1,350,000, with the material and establishments remaining Government property.5. In any case, when I returned to office I found the less ambitious scheme in full operation, and I immediately considered what my policy should be. Should I, or indeed, could I, go back to the Burney scheme ? I found that substantial commit-ments to the extent of over  300,000 had already been undertaken, a staff had been engaged, important contracts had been given out, a large sum of public money had been spent and a mission ordered to proceed to Egypt and India for the purpose of deciding upon the locality of the shed and bases.(a)Moreover, many military and technical considerations had emerged that a year before had been scarcely contemplated. It had, for instance, become more and more apparent that airships might prove of paramount value in Imperial Defence; the more the question was investigated, the larger appeared the potential scope for their use as aeroplane and troop carriers, for the conveyance of technical stores and personnel (thus greatly enhancing the mobility of heavier-than-air squadrons, which should make for an increasingly economical distribution of air garrispns overseas) and in connection with Home Defence. It had also been made evident that Commander Burney&apos;s estimates were in many respects unduly optimistic and that a period of intensive research at the National Physical Laboratory and elsewhere and full-scale trials in accordance with the recommendations of the Airship Stressing Panel appointed by the Air Ministry after the disaster to the R 38 were essential in the interests of safety. In view of these developments, was I justified in scrapping the new scheme 16. But even if there had been no new factors in the problem, would it be wise once again to throw airship development into the melting pot ? If my colleagues will take the trouble to review the changes and chances of airship policy over the last five years, they will, I believe, agree with me that, now that we have resumed airship development, it is safer and wiser to continue a policy, even though it does not pretend to be perfect, than to make once again an abrupt change in a programme that is actually in being. Indeed I cannot emphasise too strongly the need for some kind of continuity in a field that has hitherto been chequered with zigzags and tracks that continually return upon themselves.7. Until a fortnight ago I was under the impression that the First Lord generally shared my views, for naturally I took an early opportunity of consulting him upon the subject. Encouraged by our conversations, I had every hope of avoiding or at least of postponing any possible controversy with the Admiralty, and I accordingly(3) In this connection I am informed that the Indian Air Board are recommending to the Government of India that the site of the base in India should be provided as a free gift, and that a limited grant-in-aid should be made towards the actual work of construction. These offers have yet to materialise, but I think it extremely improbable that there would have been any question of their being made to a commercial company. \
devoted myself to making certain modifications in the existing scheme by means of which I hoped without involving the Treasury in heavy future commitments to harmonise the demands of commercial development with those of service requirements.8. This investigation has confirmed me in the view that it is perfectly possible to remove the objectionable features that I and others had criticised in the Labour Government scheme, and to modify it in such a way as to make it the first stage in a scheme of general airship development, with commercial development as its primary consideration. I have already taken most of the necessary steps to carry this policy into effect. I have given instructions that in the selection of bases commercial considerations are to be principally taken into account. I have taken action to set up a special sub-committee of the Aeronautical Research Committee, to which technical questions can be referred both by the Air Ministry and the Burney-Vickers group for impartial investigation. I have told Commander Burney that my policy is to make the fullest use of the experimental period, and that I wish to give him the freest possible scope for the reasonable development of his ideas. So far have I been from attempting to impose any kind of bureaucratic uniformity that in instruction after instruction I have insisted upon the need of variety of experiment and of the freest use of all airship experience available, whether it be in the Air Ministry, in other Government Departments, in the staff of the Airship Guarantee Company, among the scientists of this country, or experts in Germany.Further, I have proposed to the First Lord that we should both agree to ask. the Cabinet to delete the phrase &quot;whose primary function should be naval reconnaissance,&quot; which was attached to the instruction for the building of the Air Ministry airship, and to substitute in its place the only phrase that is applicable in the present circumstances, namely, &quot;for experimental purposes.&quot; For there is, so far as I know, a unanimous feeling amongst airship experts and scientists generally that the immediate problem is the construction and operation of experimental airships of twice the size of any others built or building. If the experiment is successful, subsequent adaptations can easily be made for the peculiar needs of peace or war. The First Lord does not, so far as I know, dissent from this view, although he has not seen his way to issue a joint paper on the subject. The fact remains that the ship which the Air Ministry is building is being constructed for experimental purposes, Air Force, Naval, Military, commercial, and, when it is completed, it will, with the necessary modifications, be equally suitable for all four.9. Finally, I propose to review the whole position as soon as the construction of the two ships has made substantial progress, with the intention of making it as easy as possible for the experimental stage to develop into the commercial stage. Indeed, it has always been my intention to take the necessary steps to enable a commercial company to be established in the future by the Burney-Vickers group and/or any other group which may be interested. In the meanwhile the Airship Guarantee Company will be given every reasonable opportunity for tests and trials and the training of nucleus commercial crews.10. The cumulative effect of these changes in the Labour Government scheme will be to transform a stage of development that in the hands of the Socialists might well have developed into State operation into the experimental stage, which should be a preliminary to a big programme of commercial enterprise. The Air Ministry will thus be enabled to make a most valuable experiment that will at the same time afford opportunities for trying out many possibilities of Imperial defence and enable it to act as a safety valve upon Commander Burney&apos;s somewhat extravagant optimism and his not unnatural desire to obtain as much State money and guarantee as he can for his strictly limited risk. If the experiment fails, our liabilities are limited to the figure of  1,350,000, spread over a three-year period. But if there is failure, we shall at least have the satisfaction of feeling that the double experiment of the two ships has been a comprehensive test, whilst under the Burney scheme the failure of a single ship-for the first of his stages would have produced only one ship would have put an end to airship development, service and commercial, upon the result of a single trial.(&quot;) If, on the other hand, the experiment succeeds, it can easily be developed into the creation of a commercial line between England and India upon financial terms that should obviously be much better for the Government than any terms based upon the great risks of an untried undertaking.11. Accordingly, both on the general ground of the need for some continuity of(*) I may point out that all that the first stage of the Buruey scheme would have proved would be the capacity of a single ship to make a single flight to India ; this one flight made, we should have incurred a liability of  1,600,000 in the light of a test which would have been, to say the least, far from conclusive.

I have left until the end of this memorandum any reference to the amazing claims of the First Lord and the Naval Staff, with reference to the responsibility for airships. The Air Ministry is by the repeated decisions of successive Cabinets the sole Department responsible for airship no less than aeroplane development. It appears, however, from the observations of the First Lord and the Naval Staff that they now desire to exclude the Air Ministry altogether from the field of airship development and the control of airship operations. - A private company, in this case a subsidiary of Messrs. Vickers, is to have a monopoly of design and commercial development, the crews of the airships are to be Naval personnel, the Admiralty alone is apparently to be allowed to make suggestions in connection with the construction of the ships, whilst in peace time the Board of Trade is to be responsible for airships, in the same manner in which it is now responsible for sea ships. This is a claim that goes much further than any claim that the Admiralty has ever made for having Naval personnel in Air Force units embarked in Aircraft Carriers. It is a claim that would exclude the Air Ministry from what may be one of the widest fields of air development in the future and would deprive it of responsibilities vested in it for years by Statute.(5) Aviation offers much the same problems whether it be by airship or whether it be by aeroplane. The technical, constructional, and aerodynamic questions involved are closely inter-related(6) and the knowledge of the air required is identical. Whether the airship or the aeroplane be in question it is airmanship that is needed for its control. In peace airship and aeroplane lines will be closely linked, whilst in war the recent developments of aviation make the closest co-operation between airships and aeroplanes more and more indispensable. Specialists let there be upon the airships by all means, specialists for observing and specialists for wireless, for example, from the Navy and the Army (whose interest in airships the Naval Staff ignore), but the crews must be members of the reserve of the only service that is responsible for the ships. When, in course of time, there are many airships in commission, it would be the duty of the Air Ministry to provide both the Army and the Navy with all the airship work that they require. Economy will doubtless demand for many years that the same airships shall fulfil dual or triple roles; and, as the Air Staff explain in Appendix I, there is every likelihood that the Air Force and the Army will require to use them for operations of war more frequently than the Navy.(7)  The demand to exclude the Air. Ministry from this great field of flying is so diametrically opposed to the expressed decision of every Cabinet since the war that I must assume that the present Cabinet supports the declared decision of its predecessors, namely, that the Air Ministry is alone responsible for the &quot;control and administration of matters in connection with aerial, war fare of all kinds whatsoever, including lighter-than-air craft as well as heavierrthan-air craft.&quot;(8) This decision seems to me to be so firmly established that I:should never have alluded to it, had not the First Lord and the Naval staff thought fit to challenge it at a moment when no airship is likely to be completed for some. eighteen months,(9) and when a Conservative Government has so recently decided against the disruption of the Air Service.-    . S. II.,. Secretary of State for Air.Air: Ministry, February 12, 1925.
APPENDIX I.Note by Air Staff.1. The observations of the Air Staff in answer to the Memorandum by the Naval Staff on Airship Development are restricted to the questions of operation and control of airships and the responsibility for provision of personnel. The questions of research, construction and finance are covered by Appendices II and III.2. The Naval Staff (paragraph 16) state that &apos;&apos; the only real uses to which airships can be put at the present time are for the purposes of Imperial communica-tion in time of peace (i.e., the carrying of passengers and mails) and long-distance and sustained Naval ocean reconnaissance in time of war.&quot;This statement of the problem entirely ignores the probable utility of large airships for Service purposes other than those of Naval reconnaissance. The first business in the work of development is in any case to solve the technical problems involved in building and trying out large airships, problems which arise equally whether Naval, Military or purely Air purposes are envisaged. But if the reliability of large airships is once established, it is certain that they will have spheres of utility in connection with our national and imperial defences which will in all probability altogether transcend their utility for Naval reconnaissance. Ships with a carrying capacity of 80 tons (the size of&quot; the ships now projected) would be suitable for the rapid conveyance of aeroplane squadrons over distances which exceed the range of heavier-than-air craft.This would immensely increase the mobility of heavier-than-air units in all parts of the Empire. An airship, with its possible carrying capacity of 250-300 armed men over and above the crew, would also serve as a swift means of transportation for considerable bodies of troops, as well as for duties of reconnaissance and patrol. This would particularly be the case over great land areas in the Middle, and Far East, where they would be immune from attack by hostile aeroplanes. There are, moreover, important possibilities in the case of large airships for patrols and as aeroplane carriers in connection with aerial home defence. The Army is also interested. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff recently stated that&apos;&apos; The development of airships is a matter of the greatest possible interest to all the military branches, both from the point of view of defence generally, and also on account of the special uses to which such craft might be put by the Army.&quot;*3. It may be observed that if the Military and Naval history of the last 100 years is any guide to the future, the occasions for the utilisation of airships under war conditions would be far more frequently non-naval than naval. Even since 1918 there have been a number of situations in which the availability of a fleet of large airships might have been of the greatest value, e.g., the Indian frontier campaign of 1919, the Iraq rising in 1920 and the recent disturbance in Egypt.It is indeed possible that airships may at some future date render possible radical changes in the method of protection of overseas ports by transferring the system of defence from an immobile to a mobile basis. These are admittedly at present only possibilities, but it is. a lack of vision to ignore them, and it can at all events be taken as certain that, if airships can be successfully developed, Naval requirements will be unlikely to have a predominant interest as regards the functions in which they can be employed for defence purposes.4. The utility of airships (even as auxiliaries) to the fighting services cannot, however, be decided unless full consideration is given to the question of their vulnerability. This point is most inadequately dealt with in the Naval Staffs memorandum. They state, for example (paragraph 1), that &quot; there are two ways of approaching the problem, one by the development of ivar airships whose principal function would be Naval ocean reconnaissance, and the other by the development of commercial airships for the carrying of mails and passengers in peace, which in war woidd be available for Naval ocean reconnaissance on the great trade routes &quot;; and again (paragraph 23), &quot; the cheapest method of obtaining proof of reliability is by means of the development on commercial airship lines.&quot;These and other passages in the Naval Staff Memorandum reveal a grave lack of appreciation of the importance of the question of vulnerability in relation to the possible uses of airships under war conditions.   The Naval Staff refer, it is true* A.D. 24 (6).
(paragraph 16), to their &quot; vulnerability to attack when approaching within reach of enemy shore-based aircraft.&quot; But they ignore their liability to attack by aircraft launched from aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, or even from larger merchant ships, a liability which means, in effect, that in any area where big ships can navigate, the airship runs considerable risk of destruction. The experience of the last war demonstrated beyond contradiction, in the present state of development, the weakness, it might even be said the helplessness, of lighter-than-air craft against aeroplane attack.As against this there is reason to hope that further developments may lead to a great increase in airships&apos; capacity for self-defence. It should be possible for a large airship to carry and to fly &quot;off and on&quot; small fighting aeroplanes of high speed and performance for its own protection. Improvements in gun platforms arid other protective armament fitted to the airships are also feasible, and it is always possible that their vulnerability may be immensely reduced by discoveries in regard to the production of non-inflammable gas.5. At present, however, the problem of defensibility, though not, as the Air Staff believe, insoluble, has still to be solved, and when large airships have been produced, their proper trying-out for service purposes, with particular reference to that problem, will require that at least one large airship .should be available for prolonged service trials without interference by other interests: But under the original Burney scheme, to which the Naval Staff desire to revert, the primary object of the first airship which his company would build would rightly be to initiate a civil aii&apos; route to India. There would be an inevitable clash between civil requirements and those of the service trials. Even the Naval Staff, though anxious to commit the country here and now to an&apos; extensive airship scheme, safeguard themselves by the reservation (paragraph 23) &quot; that until definite and actual proof of reliability is obtained, the actual substitution of cruisers by airships cannot be considered.&quot; How can this definite proof of reliability, whether as regards replacement of cruisers or for other defence purposes, be obtained without prolonged and elaborate trials t They would involve the operation of a ship (under varying climatic conditions) in various forms of manoeuvres carried out in conjunction with aircraft^ carriers and shore-based aircraft All three Service Departments would have their special interests in the trials, and it is impossible to expect that they could be carried out without mishaps and delays due to the need for readjustments in the armament and fitting of the ship itself and also of the mooring masts. Any experiments in the employ-ment of an airship as an aeroplane carrier, to take one form of trial alone, would certainly occupy many months. How could all these requirements be carried out by an airship consistently with its also being available for a civil route to India ? Or otherwise than at great cost to His Majesty&apos;s Government, who would have to pay at charter rates for the whole period of use for service purposes ?6. The Air Staff emphatically dissent from the suggestion of the Naval Staff (paragraph 18) that the crews of airships should be affiliated to naval reserves and that, as far as any departmental control is required for commercial lines, it should be exercised by the Board of Trade. The Naval Staff claim is, in effect, that the Air Ministry should be wholly excluded from any responsibility whatever for airship development or control. It is hardly necessary to point out that this proposal cuts directly across the present allocation of responsibilities. It is inconsistent with the principle on which an Air Force was established as an independent service, and indicates that the Naval Staff are either unable or unwilling to recognise the rudiments of the Air Ministry&apos;s responsibilities. Heavier-than-air craft and lighter-, than-air craft operate in one and the same element, namely, the air. It would be as unreasonable to assign the responsibility for military provision and control of airships and aeroplanes to two different Departments as it would be to allow the Air Ministry to invade the sphere of naval responsibility by providing and controlling aircraft carriers and any sea-going craft required to attend and protect them. The provision and control for service purposes of air units of all.kinds is as clearly a matter for the Air Ministry as the provision of naval units of all kinds is one for the Admiralty. Any departure from this principle can only lead to waste and to utter confusion.7. In time of war the employment of Hghter-than-air craft, would be largely governed by the disposition of heavier-than-air units, whether operating from shore bases or from aircraft carriers or other sea-going craft. Movement of the airships would depend both on the location of our own heavier-than-air units operating in
their defence and on the location of enemy aeroplanes from which, in many areas, they will&apos;be liable to attack. The fact that the large airship, if it makes good, will carry its own protecting aeroplanes is a further indication of the impossibility of dividing responsibility for lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air services.8. It is true that the plan which the Naval Staff at present contemplate is one for the establishment of airships on a civil basis under which the crews would have only a reserve liability. The principle remains, however, the same, and the test of its soundness would be war conditions when the organisation and control of airships would, under the Naval Staff proposals, be taken over entirely by the Navy.9. The Air Staff would further point out that the considerations urged by the Admiralty before the Committee of Imperial Defence in regard to the manning and organisation of aeroplane units for duty with the Fleet, do not apply to airships. The personnel of heavier-than-air units embarked in carriers live on board ship, and their conditions of life and employment are determined by limits of accommoda-tion and by the special requirements of naval organisation. It was due to the recognition of these requirements that Lord Balfour&apos;s Committee recommended some further measure of &quot; navalisation &quot; of the aeroplane units of the Fleet Air Arm, while maintaining the responsibility of the Air Ministry for providing them. Air-ship personnel, on the other hand, will not form any part of a ship&apos;s complement. They will not ordinarily be embarked at all in H.M. ships, even if, as is at present uncertain, the fitting of airship mooring masts to naval craft proves practicable. When the airship is being operated, whether over the sea or over the land, its crew will be borne and wholly accommodated within the airship itself.. When it is not in actual operation the ship will be at a shore base possibly far inland, and its crew will be accommodated at that base.This in no way precludes the carriage by airships, when operating with the Navy, of any naval personnel wha* the Naval authorities may desire to place aboard,-in. the shape of observing officers, wireless ratings, &amp;c, who would be embarked as required over and above the crew actually handling the airship.10. The final observation of the Air Staff is that they are in no way unsympathetic to the development of airships for commercial purposes. On the contrary they would welcome developments which apart from their importance as a means of Imperial communication undoubtedly contain great potentialities of Usefulness in time of war. But in their capacity as advisers to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on questions relating to air warfare in all its aspects, the Air Staff feel it necessary to emphasise the importance of securing that the development of airships shall be on lines which will, without disproportionate expense, provide for defence aspects receiving full consideration. They do not think that this object will be secured by relying at the present time on a purely commercial scheme of development.&quot; - .Summary of Air Staff&apos;s Conclusions.1. It has not been established that the primary or predominant value of airships in the future is likely to be for Naval reconnaissance over the.sea. If the reliability of large airships can be established they may have many other uses to which they will be as well or better adapted than to Naval reconnaissance.2. No conclusions as to the utility of the large airship under war conditions can be drawn until further experiment and trial has been carried out.3. A purely commercial scheme of development, essential as is such a scheme both to improve Imperial communications in peace and to provide for the availability of sufficient ships in war, could not provide for the work of experiment and trial being carried out on an adequate or satisfactory scale.4. The development and control of airships cannot be separated from the control of heavier-than-air craft, and the responsibility for the former as for the latter is a matter for the Air Ministry and not for the Admiralty. It follows that the crews of any commercial airship lines which may be established should be enrolled in the Royal Air Force Reserve, and not in the Royal Naval Reserve, just as are the personnel of the existing heavier-than-air transport companies.Air Staff, February 11, 1925.
APPENDIX II.Technical, Note on Admiralty Memorandum on Airship Develop-ment annexed to C.P.40 (25).Main features of THE Admiralty memorandum aims at two main objects, each ofAdmiralty which involves a complete reversal of existing airship policy :  Memorandum.(i.) The substitution of the original Burney scheme in all its essentials for the scheme now in force (paragraphs 13, 15 and 18-20).(ii.) The transfer of control over airship development from the Air Ministry to-(a.) The Admiralty as regards all questions in time of war and as regards construction also in peace.(&amp;.) The Board of Trade as regards traffic in peace (paragraphs 11 and 16-20).The Burney Scheme: Air Ministry re-sources for carrying- out first (experimental) stage.Before, however, these proposals are remarked on, it is necessary to review the introductory paragraphs of the memorandum, as the comparison therein made between the original Burney scheme and the present Government scheme is in many respects misleading, owing, no doubt, to a lack of appreciation of the research, technical and operational problems involved in the construction of a 5,000,000-cubic-foot airship and its successful navigation to India.At a time when there appeared to be no prospect of airship full scale research and development being again undertaken by the Government, it was clearly better that it- should be carried out by a private company than not at all. But from the technical point of view it would always have been preferable that the first stages of research experiment and construction should have been undertaken by the Air Ministry, for the the following reasons :  &apos;(i.) The Air Ministry possessed and had collated all the records of the Airship Design Staff transferred from the Admiralty in 1919.(ii.) The Air Ministry, through its representatives on the Inter-Allied Commission of Control in Germany, was in touch with the latest German developments.   -(iii.) The staff employed on (i) and (ii) were Air Ministry officials and/or E.A.P. officers, and in addition to the above duties had kept themselves in touch with the latest developments of airship theory and practice.(iv.) The reports of the Accidents Investigation Sub-Committee of the Aeronautical Research Committee on the R 38 disaster, and later of the Airship Stressing Panel (which was appointed by and reported to the Air Ministry) emphasised the paramount importance of full scale research and experiment on the aerodynamic forces imposed by flight, before any further construction was undertaken. Such research and experiment could clearly best be undertaken by the Depart-ment already responsible for aeronautical research as a whole, and daily engaged on similar problems in connection with heavier-than-air aircraft.(v.) Research and experiment on components and accessories such as : girders, engines, fuel, propellers, fabric and instruments inter-. - locked at every point with similar work already in hand under Air Ministry direction (on;the heavier-than-air side) on light: ..   metal construction, heavy oil engines, metal and variable pitch
propellers, dope and fabrics, and flying and recording instru-ments of all kinds, (vi.) A considerable amount of experimental flying on existing ships would be necessary, both from the research and the opera-tional point of view,&apos; and practically all the officers and ex-officers capable of this including the pilot of R 34 on her successful Atlantic trip were in Air Ministry employ.(vii.) The Air Ministry had similarly retained the officers most familiar with the ground organisation required for a successful experimental flight of the kind contemplated.(viii.) In any event, the Air Ministry would be responsible for the. grant of a certificate of airworthiness to any ship constructed by the Company, and would have, therefore, to keep in close touch with the Company&apos;s technical programme of research and experiment, on which depended the whole system of construction.Conflict of commercial con-aiderations withIn short, in the first stages of airship research, development and construction any private Company would necessarily have depended largely on the Air Ministry for up-to-date technical information, and for certain parts of the scheme on Air Ministry personnel, who would have had to be loaned or transferred to the Company; and whilst, if the research and experiment were to be carried out by a private Company, the Government would lose the advantage of first-hand experience, it would none the less still have had to accept a general responsibility for the adequacy of the preliminary work a position involving no small administrative difficulty and inevitable loss of efficiency.But the disadvantages inherent in any scheme of this kind were enhanced, under the Burney scheme, by the fact that the largest advances from the Government fell due after the completion of the first stage, and req^mVements of not before it. As soon as a single flight to India had been carried out by the research and 5,000,000-cubic-foot airship even if, for lack of adequate base facilities experiment, or some other reason, the ship were never able to come back the Government became liable for. advances totalling  1,200,000 over three years, whereas before this flight the Government would have advanced only the smaller amount of  400,000, any expenditure on the first stage in excess of this sum being a matter for the Company, up to a maximum of f00,000.Thus the Company had the strongest financial inducements to (a.) Run considerable risks in the hope that the ship might qualify them for the payments in the second stage by managing to perform a single flight to India, whatever happened after this had been accomplished.(b.) Cut down to a minimum the expenditure in the first stage on everything except the bare necessities for the ship, e.g., on ground organisation and equipment, and on research and experiment.In this connection the highly experimental character of the first stage cannot be too strongly insisted upon. In the first place, the airship to be constructed was nearly twice as large as any ship ever constructed hitherto, in England or abroad, and more than twice as large as any previous successful ship. Moreover, the -principles followed by English designers in the last series of ships built had not been successful. Thus on both grounds the construction of the new ship was an experiment of the greatest magnitude, and one which, as had been brought out by the reports of the Aeronautical Research Committee quoted above, could only be undertaken after exhaustive research and experiment, with a view to establishing new and satisfactory principles of design.In the second place, airship navigation in the tropics, including the mooring out of a ship to a mast under tropical changes of temperature, involved&apos;risks; of which no one in this country had any experience, and presented special operational and constructional problems- e.g., as regardsSpecial need for exhaustive research and experiment.
Precautions proposed to be omitted by the Company.fabric and fuel which would not have arisen in the case of a voyage conducted in a temperate climate.Lastly, one ship only was to be built for this great constructional and operational experiment, and on its success or failure was to depend the whole future of airship development&apos;in this country.The situation was clearly one in which every possible precaution should be taken to increase the prospect of success, and in which the requirements of research and experiment for ensuring safety should be paramount and not secondary to commercial considerations. It was precisely in this respect that the Burney scheme was so disquietingIt is now clear that the Air Ministry&apos;s apprehensions were amply justified and that the Company, influenced doubtless not merely by commercial considerations, but also by the enthusiasm and sanguine optimism of thej promoter of the scheme, had- contemplated hurrying on to the second stage as soon as possible, and omitting from the first stage many precautions whioh expert aeronautical opinion regards as essential not only for the success of the first experimental flight to India, but also for the subsequent development of airships for commercial and military purposes.The following are briefly the most important points in regard to which the above criticism is made; they have been dealt with in more detail in papers presented to the Sub-Committee appointed by the late Government: *(a.) Non-Provision of Shed in India. No shed was to be provided at the terminal or any other point on the route, but only two floating mooring masts, one in the neighbourhood of Egypt and the other in India. Consequently, if on her outward voyage the ship were to sustain damage of a kind which could only be repaired in a shed, she would become a total loss.(b.) No Provision for Tropical Mooring Trials. There is no experience as to the behaviour of an airship at a mast in the tropics, exposed to great heat and violent. changes of temperature. Changed methods of handling and modified ballasting and mooring arrangements will almost certainly be required, and for this purpose trials with an existing ship are essential. The Company, it is understood, did not propose to carry out such preliminary trials.(c.) Reliance on Floating Mooring Masts.  Until the &quot; Shenandoah &quot; (2,150,000 cubic feet) was moored to a floating mastt a few months ago no rigid airship had ever been so moored. While the &quot; Shenandoah &quot; trials show that a rigid airship of that size pan be moored to a floating mast under very favourable conditions, considerable experience under differing weather conditions is necessary before a floating mooring mast can be regarded as a safe anchorage for an airship under all conditions for any lengthy period.The land mooring mast trials in 1921 lasted several months, and a similar period is necessary before floating mast mooring can be accepted as the equivalent to mooring to a land mast, particularly in the tropics.Moreover, only one type of mastj has so far been success-fully tried out, and this the Company did not propose to use.In short, the only anchorage the Company proposed to provide for an experimental ship nearly twice as large as any ship previously constructed was a system of mooring which has never been thoroughly tried out, using a type of mast which had equally not been tried out, under conditions of which no one had any previous experience.* See A.D 24 (10), p. 3 and Appendices D 1 and D 2.t This mast, like all the masts erected by the United States Government, was. of the Air Ministry type.% The Air Ministry type.
The Air Ministry programme allows for tropical mooring trials with Air Ministry an existing ship, the provision of a shed in India, and the provision of rese^rclT ex&apos; ri-mooring masts of a tried-out type in England, Egypt and India.   It is on ment^&amp;c.6^6&quot;&quot; these items that much of the expenditure stigmatised as unnecessary by the Admiralty is being incurred.In addition, the following extensive programme of research and experiment is being or will be undertaken : Experiments with monitor mooring and alternative types of mast; wind channel research on the shapes of hull, fins and power units; full-scale experiments on strength of existing airships and experimental girders; the acquisition of data as to aerodynamic loads and forces by experimental nights with R 33 which has been fitted with specially designed instruments for the purpose; investigation and tests of fabric, dope, substitutes for gold-beater skin, study of German methods of using this material; experiments on the extensibility of fabric ; the development of a heavy oil engine and of variable pitch propellers ; methods of protection against lightning-While this experimental and research work is being carried out by the Air Ministry its results will be available to the Airship Guarantee Company; but the Company is being given an entirely free hand, subject only to the requirements of airworthiness, which will be determined in&apos; accordance with the recent report of the Airworthiness of Airships Panel of the Aeronautical Research Committee.In short, when the late Government took office the negotiations over Position when the contract documents with Commander Burney were just bringing to Labour Govern-light a most difficult and disadvantageous situation on the technical side, &quot;^g^ scheme&apos;&apos; It is understood that it was largely on account of  these difficulties satisfactory (coupled with similar problems that had arisen on the financial side) that on technical that Government decided to consider the whole question de novo.   The grounds, settlement they made was from the technical point of view as satisfactory as the previous arrangement was the reverse.   The Air Ministry which would ultimately have had to shoulder responsibility for any preventable failure of the project has been given the duty of carrying out the necessary experiment research and ground organisation: the probabilities of success and the rapidity of future expansion have been doubled by the building of two ships instead of one; and the commercial company, while being associated with the venture from the outset, has been given a special contract on a commercial basis.In the circumstances, on technical grounds the Air Ministry would regard the reintroduction of the Burney scheme as disastrous.In View of what has been said above it is perhaps unnecessary to -deal Criticisms of -at length with the admiralty criticisms of unnecessary expenditure. unnecessary\ expenditure.The Air Ministry design and research staff consists of 1 Head of Design staff. Section with 4 Technical Assistants and 1 officer in charge of the development of airship engines, and 41 calculators, designers, draughts-men, &amp;c, later to be increased to 50. In addition there are 3 specially paid consultants. The total cost is about  15,000 per annum35 and it is considered that this expenditure is fully justified seeing that it will secure first-hand knowledge for the Government and will enable two designs to be tried out instead of one.As regards Cardington, its retention at least during the preliminary Retention of stage is necessary for two reasons: first, in order to carry out the Oardmgton. necessary research and experiment and ensure the construction of two ships instead of one, as an insurance against disaster from weather navigational error or any other cause; second, in order to retain a Government constructional and operational establishment for the purpose of experimenting with an airship from the service point of view as foreshadowed in the Air Staff memorandum. To transfer Cardington at this stage to a private company is premature and unnecessary, and would probably involve the country ultimately in far greater cost than is involved by its retention.* Rising to  16,500 at most.
Proposal to construct one ship onlyProposed control of design by the Admiralty.As to the construction of a second ship by the Air Ministry, it is absolutely essential on technical grounds that this should proceed in accordance with the present programme. Having regard to the previous history of airships, the Air Ministry consider it would be the height of unwisdom to risk the whole.future of airship development on a single ship. A serious accident to this ship (and under Commander Burney&apos;s proposals the risk of accident would be greatly enhanced by the absence of proper ground facilities in Egypt and India) would mean the closing down of airship development, though the accident might well be due to pure mischance, and in no way to any failure of design or inherent defect of lighter-than-air craft generally.A second ship, even if merely a duplicate of the first, is in fact a necessary insurance against the failure of the scheme; but the experience already gained by the Air Ministry on experimental types of heavier-than-air craft has clearly demonstrated the desirability of always trying out alternative designs. Monopoly of design is always open to grave objection; competition, as has been shown time and again, is essential to progress.Moreover, as pointed out by the Air Staff in Appendix I, if the utility of the airship for purposes of Imperial defence is to be adequately tested, a ship will have to be made available for months at a time, which would seem impossible under Commander Burney&apos;s proposals, at all events for the next five or six years, without the complete dislocation of the Indian service.Another important consideration is that to cancel, the Air Ministry ship now would be to waste the value of the greater part of the important preliminary work which has already been accomplished. For example, two alternative shapes have been designed and fully tested in the wind tunnel at the National Physical Laboratory, and one of them has now been provisionally selected; alternative power units have been designed; work on testing various types of fins has been more than half completed; the loading and stressing have been agreed with the Air Ministry&apos;s consultants; contracts for experimental girders and transverse rings have been placed; and in many other respects the design is far advanced.In addition contracts have been let for the construction of the mooring masts required at Cardington and in Egypt and India, so that it is in any case too late to consider postponing the construction of these masts as the Admiralty propose on grounds which are obviously altogether inadequate.Lastly, the proposal to cease work on the Air Ministry ship (it is noteworthy that the Admiralty wish the Cardington shed enlargement proceeded with) conflicts with the Admiralty desire to obtain airships in quantity. Under the present scheme which is comparable rather to the first stage of the Burney scheme than to that scheme at the end of seven or fifteen years there will be at the end of three years two 5,000,000-cubic-foot airships, two designing and constructional staffs and three sheds capable of dealing with the repair and construction of ships of this size. It is clear that if as the Admiralty anticipate the first stage is success-fully carried out, the potentiality of expansion under the present scheme is more than double what would have been obtained at the end of the first stage of the Burney scheme, and considerably more than it would be under the AImiralty&apos;s present proposals.With regard to the statement that all British airships have hitherto been built under the supervision or to the design of the Admiralty, it must be remembered (a.) That no airship has been designed in this country for the last seven years.(b.) That the larger airships were little more than copies of German designs.(c.) That the theory of airship construction has almost been transformed in the last three years by the work carried out by the Aeronautical Research Committee on behalf of the Air Ministry. since the R. oS disaster, more particularly by the Accidents Investigations Sub-Committee and the Airship Stressing and Airship Airworthiness Panels.
As already stated, Air Ministry officials have kept in touch with these developments and served as members- on all of the above Committees and Panels. The Air Ministry do not know to what extent any officials previously engaged on airship design, who may still be in Admiralty employ,: have kept up to date in this respect, but it is noteworthy that the Admiralty&apos;s claim to control design is not based on this ground, but on their general experience in connection with the construction of sea-going ships, and on their knowledge of the earlier work on airships. As to this it &quot;has already been pointed out that the collation of all the records of the Admiralty Airship Design Section -at Cardington was carried out by an Air Ministry official (who is now the head of the Design and Research Section under the Director of Airship Development).It is in fact clear that the Admiralty tend to regard an airship simply as a kind of ship, the design of which ought to be entrusted to depart-ments and firms with shipbuilding rather than aeronautical experience. In this connection the Air Ministry must point out that the report of the Accidents Investigations Sub-Committee on the R 38 disaster makes it clear that it was the absence of aerodynamical knowledge and data that was responsible for the disaster. The static strength of the ship was considerable, but its aerodynamical strength was, too small.*In this connection, the composition of the Design Committee assembled by Commander Burney in the latter part of 1923 is significant. Commander Burney, his manager and his chief designer formed three of the members; the remaining,four were all aeronautical and not ship-building experts. They were Professor Bairstow, Zaharoff Professor of Aeronautics in the University of London, and an Air Ministry consultant; Professor Southwell, Head of the Aerodynamics Department at the National Physical Laboratory, and an authority on structural strength, in which connection he is now employed by the Air Ministry on airship stress calculations; Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond, of the Directorate of Research, Air Ministry, now Head of the Design and Research Section at Cardington; and Major Scott, the pilot of R 34 on her Atlantic voyage, now Officer in charge of Plying at Cardington.It is clear that Commander Burney, in spite of his connection with Vickers and his close relations with the Admiralty, realised that the essential problem of the airship is one for aeronautical experts and not for shipbuilding engineers. This is in fact the only conclusion possible in view of. the history of the last three years, and, that being the case, to transfer the control of airship design to a department which has no aeronautical staff and is not in touch with aeronautical development would be a most retrograde step.The proposal to place the control of airship traffic in peace under the Proposed control Board of Trade will serve as a- convenient illustration of the Admiralty&apos;s of traffic by the lack of appreciation of the problems involved in aeronautical administra- Board of Trade, tion.   Not only is the Air Ministry the statutory authority for all aerial traffic, but its regulation is governed by the Air Navigation Act,. 1920, and by the Air Navigation (Consolidation)Order, 1923, and Directions issued thereunder.   Moreover, the regulations for international flying have to conform to the requirements of the International Convention for the Regulation of   Aerial Navigation, and  the grant  of  a  Certificate of,    .. Airworthiness depends upon compliance with a number of technical requirements,  and   the satisfaction  of   the   Aeronautical  Inspection Directorate of the Air Ministry that these  requirements have  been carried out.    The  question of  applying these  general  principles to airships is now engaging the attention of a number of departments in the Air Ministry.    If the Admiralty proposal with regard to airships were adopted, it would either mean the duplication of this staff and work in- * In the stress calculations which were made by the (Admiralty) Design Staff, the airship was assumed throughout to be in the static buoyant condition ; the stresses which-would be imposed due to the additional air pressures when in flight were not calculated.&quot; (Report on Accident to H.M.

It is difficult to believe that the proposal to divide the administration of civil aviation between two departments of State can have been put forward seriously.Department of Supply and Researeh, Air Ministry,February 11, 1925.
