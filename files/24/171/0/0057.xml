ffiIoi)OCUMMT Id THE PKOPaKTx Of HIo BRIgftHSIO KAJE3TY1 S GOVEKBMEHT.CABINET.Homo Affairs Committee.Therapeutic Substances Bill.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.Copy No. tLQEGRET. 1P.J7(25),.I have to ask the authority of tho Home Affairs Committee for the introduction at an early date of the Therapeutic Substances Bill.   The object of this Bill ia to provide for the standardising and testing of   vaccines, sera and other substanoes, such as salvarsan and its substitutes, tho purity and potency of which oannot be determined by chemical analysis.    At present there are no means of seouring either uniformity in strength or freedom from impurities in these substances, the use of whioh in medicine is continually increasing.    In fact the British Manufacturers have maintained a high standard of purity, but the valuations in strength botvieen the products of different firms makes correct dosage often a matter of chance, and in the absence of legislation, such as exists in most other countries, there Is no means of preventing the importation of supplies which have been rejected in foreign countrloe as not conforming to the statutory standard.     The Bill was introduced last session In the House of Lords and passed through all stages without opposition, but owing to tho dissolution it could not be taken in the House of Commons.     It has been aocepted by the manufacturers and it will be supported by the medical profession and the British Pharmaceutical Society.I recommend that It should be introduced again in the House of Lords.(Intld, )   N,0, Ministry of Health.
