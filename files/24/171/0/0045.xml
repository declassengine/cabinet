(THIS DOCUMENT IS, THE PROPBHTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S (K3VERMMKKT). SECRET. Copy Ho.  &apos;; e&apos;CP. 45 (25). CAB IN E T.SUMMER       TIMS.Memorandum by the Mini a tor of Agriculture and FlshiTrTea.1*       I feel bound to raise objection to the course proposed by the Home Secretary in CP. 24 (25).2.      He proposes to introduce a Bill to extend permanently the existing period of Summer Time by beginning a fortnight earlier and ending a fortnight later.3.      This is the same proposal as that contained in Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;s Bill last year, whioh was vigorously opposed by agriculturists.   Similar opposition must be expected to any Government Bill with the same object, and I am satisfied that such a Bill could only be carried after prolonged discus-sion and in the face of keen opposition from many of our best friends*4.       I do not contest the considerations put forward by the Home Secretary for hiB proposal.      I appreciate the advantages of uniformity of period between this country and Franoe and Belgium.     But at the most, the inconvenience caused under the present arrangement can affect only a small proportion of the whole population, represented by the travelling publio, for a period of four weeks.5.       I realise also that there may be a substantial demand from urban interests for an extension of the present period, but, as the Home Seoretary points out in his memorandum, the period in the Act of 1922 was Inserted a3 the result of1
an arrangement reached as between the divergent claims of urban and agricultural interests.    Agricultural representatives in the House accepted this period as a settlement.     On the Third Reading of the Bill Mr. Shortt used these words&quot;The shortening of the period so far as the recommendation of the Departmental Committee are concerned is very slight.     However, it helps the fanner, and it was agreed to on both sides in -Committee upstairs, by those representing the urban districts and those representing the agricultural districts as a fair compromise.     It did not please either party, and therefore it ms probably- just.&quot; If we upset what was then represented, and has been taken to be, a definite agreement, we shall lay ourselves open to the charge that agriculturists are being let down again.     In the main, agriculturists are, from the party point of view, our friends and they were led to believe at the last election that if we rare returned to power they would at least be free from measures to which they takd. strong, objection.     Already though this was unavoidable they have been made uneasy by our proposal to provide  1,000,000 a year to facilitate the marketing of Imperial produce, in spite of the care taken in drafting the form in which the announcement was made; and this proposal to extend Summer Time will certainly increase their irritation. It would not matter so much if we were doing something very tangible for them on the other side, but unfortunately our agricultural shop window is not very full, and we have therefore very little -Jam with which to cover the pill.8.       I should have thought that it would have been comparativaly
easy to resist the demand of the urban interests by pointing out to them that the present period is the result of a bargain, and that the bargain must be kept.7,     I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will agree toleave the present compromise unaltered.    This would havethe additional advantage of avoiding the necessity for anothercontroversial Bill which is likely to occupy not a littleparliamentary time.(Intld)    E.F.L.V:.try of Agriculture and Fisheries, 30th January, 1925.
