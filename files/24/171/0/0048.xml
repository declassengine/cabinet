THE CABINET,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.[W 745/9/98J1Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.United States and the Geneva Protocol.I RECENTLY informed the Committee of Imperial Defence that I intended to try to find out what was the real attitude of the United States Government towards the Geneva Protocol, as to which our information had hitherto been sharply conflicting. I could not, as my colleagues will appreciate, address a formal official enquiry to the United States Government, but from unofficial and confidential enquiries which I have made I think it is safe to assert that the attitude of the present Administration is broadly as follows: . In their eyes the protocol contains numerous sources of trouble, and they had hoped that it would die a natural death. The United States have hitherto regarded the League of Nations with no more than a certain mistrust; if the protocol went through as it stands, it is no exaggeration to say that they could hardly help considering that body as a potential enemy. It is, of course, the compulsory arbitration and the sanctions provisions which inspire this feeling. It is not difficult to imagine that the League, at the instance of some Central or South American member, might be brought into conflict with the Monroe doctrine. If, for instance, the United States Government were at any time compelled to take measures for the protection of the Panama Canal and were on that account to be arraigned before the League by one of the Central States, there would undoubtedly be an explosion of public opinion throughout the country. Similar difficulties would arise if the neutral rights of the United States in matters of trade and commerce were interfered with in the event of an economic or an armed blockade of an aggressor State by the League, and of course it would be practically impossible to institute an effective blockade without such interference. In short, if His Majesty&apos;s Government ratify the protocol, they will be running a serious risk of grave trouble with the United States in the future.A. C.Foreign Office, January 27, 1925.2645 [12604]
