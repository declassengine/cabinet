HOME    AFFAIRS    COMMITTEE*ORIMIMAL JUSTICE BILL,  1925.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill has its origin in the Reports of four Committees dealing with various questions that have arisen in connection with the criminal law.      Attention is drawn to the more important provisions in the printed memorandum prefixed to the Bill.      The main objects of the Bill are:-(l)    The development of the probation system by the appointment of probation officers in every district.      It will be assisted by an Exchequer Grant.(2)    A reduction of the more prolonged periods of detention in prison of prisoners awaiting trial.(3)    A simplification in oertain respects of criminal prooedure.(4)    Various amendments of the law relating to certain offences and the creation of a few fresh offences;    eto. As regards  (l)  there is a strong demand for early legislation and the matter was mentioned in the King&apos;s speech.As regards  (2), it may be mentioned that it is proposed that examining Justices shall in oertain oiroum-stances be empowered to commit to any convenient Court for trial;    that if a trial is abortive,  tho fresh trial may take place in a convenient Court elsewhere;    that the jurisdiction of Quarter Sessions should be enlarged,  that the number of offences triable summarily by Magistrates with the defendant&apos;s consent should be increased, etc.As regards  (5), grand juries will be abolished at Quarter Sessions;    the unnecessary attendance at the trial
of certain formal witnesses may &quot;be dispensed with;    witnesses may &quot;be bound over to attend the trial provisionally if the accused should later be committed for trial;    a prisoner may be tried in one place for offences committed in different counties or boroughs;    several prisoners may be tried in one placee if they are concerned indirectly in the same crime though tho actual offences with which they are charged are different and were committed in different places;      in summary proceedings the&apos; amount of a defendants wages may be proved by a certificate from his employer, etc.As regards  (4), it may be mentioned that the imitation of currency notes, the taking of photographs in Court, and false statements made to procure a passport will bo made offences.      The penalty for being drunk whilst in charge of motor cars and reckless driving is being Increased.Further, a right of appeal is given against a sentonoey or a probation order made, by a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. A power to issue a soarch warrant in respect of any indictable offence is conferred upon Justices.      The presumption that an offence committed by a married woman in the presence of her husband is committed under his coercion,  is abolished.The Bill is substantially the same Bill that passed the House of Lords and was read a second time in the House of Commons in 1923, and the Bill that passed the House of. . Lords in 1924.        &apos; In both years progress in&apos;the House of Commons was stopped by a dissolution.This year I propose to introduce the Bill in the House of Commons in the hope that it may be  sent to a Standing Committee early in the Session, and I shall be glad if -.-my colleagues will approve this course.W.J.H.13th February,  1925.69-70
MEMORANDUM.A Bill to amend criminal law and procedure was introduced into the House of Lords in 1923, and after passing that House, was read a second time in the House of Commons. In 1924 a Bill comprising all the clauses except two of the Bill of 1923, and containing in addition certain provisions amending the system of probation of offenders, passed through the House of Lords but made no further progress. The present Bill, subject to a few drafting and other minor alterations, reproduces substan-tially the Bill of 1924 with the omission of one clause and the addition: of three, new clauses (viz., 20, 30 and 40).; Part L of the Bill consists of provisions intended to improve and develop the system of probation of offenders established by the : Probation of Offenders Act, 1907. With this object, it is proposed to require a probation officer to be appointed for every probation area, to provide for the formation of probation areas by the combination, of petty sessional divisions, and to make certain alterations in the method of supervising and paying probation officers.The remainder of the Bill consists in large part of amendments of criminal procedure, of which many are founded on or arise out of recommendations made by Committees: viz., els. 13 and 16 on recommendations made by a Committee (of which Mr. Justice Horridge was Chairman), which dealt with the detention in custody of prisoners committed for trial [1922, Cd. 1574], and els. 10, 11, 12, 18, 22, 23, 26, 29, and 33 on recommend-. ations made by a Committee (of which the Director of Public Prosecutions was Chairman), which was appointed to consider the desirability of amendments in criminal procedure [1923, Cd. 1813]. Cl. 42 deals with the subject of a wife&apos;s responsibility for crimes committed under the coercion of her husband, which was inquired into by a Committee of which Mr. Justice Avory was Chairman, [1922, Cd. 1677]. and cl. 30 is based on a suggestion contained in the report of Mr. Justice Talbofs Committee which was appointed to review the provisions of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, 1920, and the Regulations made thereunder [1924, Cd. 2278].55-4 a
iiCriminal Justice.[15 Geo. 5.]Some of the proposed amendments of procedure are of a technical character, but the following clauses may be specially referred to as being of more general interest, viz., cl. 13, which enables justices to commit an accused person to be tried at such assizes or quarter sessions as they think expedient with a view to expediting the trial or saving expense, instead of at the assizes or sessions for the county or borough; cl. 16, which gives quarter sessions power to try certain offences now outside their jurisdiction; cl. 22, which enlarges the number of indictable offences with which magistrates may deal summarily; cl. 23, which gives a person pleading guilty the right of appeal against the sentence imposed on him; and cl. 32, which prescribes the procedure to be followed where a corporation is charged with an offence.During the war grand juries were suspended both at assizes and quarter sessions and while following the opinion of the majority of the judges of the High Court the Bill does not propose to abolish grand juries at assizes, it is considered that, as regards cases investi-gated by the justices at petty sessions and by them committed for trial at quarter sessions, the summoning of a grand jury causes unnecessary expense to a county and loss of time to the jurors summoned; it is ac-cordingly proposed (cl. 17) to abolish grand juries at quarter sessions. The right to present an indictment without previous committal by justices is preserved, but it is provided that such a Bill must be presented to a grand jury at assizes.

NOTE.THE lengthy memorandum appended to the First Lord&apos;s recent note on airships (CP. 40 &apos; 25)) indicates such a complete misapprehension on the part of the Admiralty of the present position as regards lighter-than-air development that I have had no alternative but to place on record a more or less detailed rejoinder.This will be found in Appendices I, II and III of the annexed paper.At the same time I have endeavoured in a prefatory memorandum, which occupies pages 1 to 4 of the attached, to deal briefly with all the more salient features of the airship question; the- issues involved are comparatively straightforward, and I think that my colleagues will find within the compass of these four pages all the material which they will require to enable them to reach a decision.S. H.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry,February 13, 1925. fc
