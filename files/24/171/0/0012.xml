S E C R E T. CP.  12  (25) .CABIMET. HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. IMPERIAL INSTITUTE,Memorandum Toy the Secretary of State for the Colonies,  covering Draft Bill.1.        I circulate herewith the draft of a bill to carry out the recommendations of the Imperial Economic Conference with regard to the Imperial Institute,2.        The Conference unanimously recommended that the Institute should be re-organised and a new Governing Body established; that the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau should be amalgama-ted with the Institute to avoid duplication of work;    and that the Governments  of the Empire should contribute in agreed proportions to the reformed institution,3.        Legislation is necessary both because the composition of the present Governing Body is fixed by statute, and because the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau cannot be amalgamated with the Institute until the Bureau1s charter has been repealed, and the repeal of the charter can be effected only by an Act of Parliament. I 4.        This Bill was originally drafted by the Conservative Government  in 1923, but was net  introduced by them into Parliament.      The late Government amended the Bill to provide for the retention of the Exhibition Gallerie? at the Institutec      The Conference had acquiesced in their abandon-ment for financial reasons, but the Dominion Governments changed their attitude on this point and the majority, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand,  desire theYLS DOCUMENT  13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS VRIIA^JJ2^M^^^IXIJI.-IlIIZZIiJiMZ- Il )
Galleries to be continued.      The Bill v/as then introduced into the House of Lords last summer,  and was passed without substantial alteration,      It was not possible, however,  to secure its passage through the House of Commons befpre the recent dissolution.      The present Bill stands exactly (with the necessary amendments as to dates)  in the form in which it left the House of Lords on the 9th of July last. 5-        It  is essential that the Bil3   should be passed in the coming session of Parliament,  as the bringing into force of the scheme of re-organisation recommended by the Conference is long overdue,  and it has net been possible to secure the Dominion and Indian contributions in advance of the  necessary legislation.      There  is also a danger that the Oversea Governments will lose interest  in the  Institute unless it  is shortly established on its new basis.(Signed)    L.  S.
