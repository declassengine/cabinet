[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]   X1i3Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1925.SECRET. Copy l^o.    39CP. 22 (25).CABINET.[J 136/133/16]COMMAND OE THE EGYPTIAN AKMY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs .LORD ALLENBY proposed on the 27th November that it would be best that General Huddleston should continue to act as Commander-in-chief of both the Egyptian and Sudan armies for the present, and that British officers and non-commissioned officers should also remain in their present posts.In a memorandum dated the 5th December (CP. 526 (24)) by the Secretary of State for War the following points were brought out: (a:) The army of the Sudan must be entirely under the control of the Governor-General, with officers holding commissions signed by him.(6.) Provided the Egyptian army remained under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government, British officers could continue to serve in it, but, in the contrary event, i.e., a purely Egyptian army, safeguards would have to be provided respecting (i) the entrance of foreign officers into the Egyptian army; (ii) the creation of too powerful an Egyptian army.(i) would have to be forbidden. All foreign instructors or advisers would have to be borrowed from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and, further, no British officer could serve under an Egyptian officer except in an advisory capacity.In regard to (ii), financial considerations would probably be a sufficient safeguard as well as the unpopularity of compulsory service.In these circumstances it was suggested and subsequently decided by the Cabinet that Lord Allenby should be told to maintain the status quo for the present.The memorandum in question was sent to Lord Allenby with instructions in the sense of the Cabinet decision on the 18th December with a request for his observations, which have now been received, and are contained in the two annexed telegrams of the 13th January, Nos. 19 and 20. In a letter* dated the. 15th December from Sir Eyre Crowe to Sir Maurice Hankey, copies of which have already been circulated to the Cabinet, it is made clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no treaty right to insist on the appointment of a British Sirdar to command the Egyptian army. This also applies to the appointment of British officers in subordinate capacities.Lord Allenby shows that with the creation of the Sudan Defence Force and the absorption by that body of the greater number of British officers who have hitherto been seconded for service with the Egyptian army, the remainder would be serving not in executive, but in more or less advisory capacities. The appointment of an Egyptian Sirdar is therefore unlikely to give rise to any difficult problems in so far as these British officers are concerned.Lord Allenby&apos;s proposal to address a note to the Egyptian Government explaining that the employment of non-British foreign officers in the Egyptian army will be regarded as an unfriendly act is probably as good a way to achieve our purpose as any other. The actual terms in which the note is drawn up will necessarily depend on the Government to which it is ultimately addressed, whether the present or some future less well-disposed Egyptian Government. Lord Allenby appears to think that any danger arising out of an undue increase in the numbers or efficiency of the Egyptian army should be dealt with if and when it arises, and I am disposed to share his. view. As long as foreign officers and non-commissioned officers are not employed, the Egyptian army appears unlikely to become a formidable military machine.* CP. 549 (24)!2622   [12559]   [12566]
sIn all the circumstances our best course appears to be that suggested by Lord Allenby, namely, that we should.place no obstacle in the way of the appointment of an Egyptian Commander-in-chief, that we should make it clear that we will regard as an unfriendly act the appointment of foreign officers or non-commissioned officers or the engagement of foreigners as instructors, and that, generally speaking, we should make it.easy for the Egyptian Government to obtain British officers as instructors and.British material for arming their troops.&apos; ; . .. A.  C.    .Foreign Office, January 16, 1925.[J 133/133/16] Annex I.,,   Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (ReceivedJanuary 13.)(No. 19.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Cairo, January 13, 1925.YOUR telegram No. 315.I think that our rights in respect of Egyptian army were exclusively those which flowed from general authority claimed by His MJajesty&apos;s Government to have their advice taken in matters of civil and military administration in virtue of Lord Granville&apos;s despatch. As to surviving practices, British officers actually hold following appointments in Egypt as opposed to Sudan: 1. Sirdar (at present acting) Commander-in-chief of Egyptian army has been a British officer since early days of occupation. Major-General Huddleston&apos;s head-quarters are of course at Khartum, where he spends almost all his time.2. Inspector-General of troops in Egypt assisted by staff officer.This advisory post was created by late Sirdar on 1st January, 1924, in connection with process of &quot; Egyptianisation &quot; of army in Egypt when officer commanding Cairo district, who had been in de facto command of troops in Egypt, was replaced by Egyptian officer. This process has long been in operation, last British command of an Egyptian battalion having left in 1922. Colonel Spinks, the present Inspector-General, for various reasons virtually exercises functions of Commander-in-chief here. It seems not unlikely that Egyptian Government will wish to. retain services at least for the present.3. Financial Secretary.4. Certain British officers employed in medical, ordinance and supply departments.5. A few British non-commissioned officers employed as clerks, &amp;c. Majority of officers and non-commissioned officers referred to are on active list of British army.Remainder are eligible for benefits of Law 28.Except Major-General Huddleston, no British officer or non-commissioned officer has any executive connection with Egyptian combatant troops. &quot;In the case of the former, connection is by force of circumstances now practically in abeyance, for since executive terms of my note to Zaghlul Pasha of 22nd November Minister of War has in practice consulted Colonel Spinks on matters concerning troops in Egypt, instead of referring-to Acting Sirdar in Khartum.[J 136/133/16] Annex II.Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Mr. Atisten Chamberlain. (ReceivedJanuary 13.)(No. 20.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, January 13, 1925.FOLLOWING is a continuation of my immediately preceding telegram: I had assumed that Sir Lee Stack during his last visit to England had placed before His Majesty&apos;s Government full implications in course of action that has since been taken. It was his opinion, in which I concurred, that, upon creation of defence force, Egyptian troops in Egypt should be placed under command of Egyptian officer in this connection (please see my telegram No. 439).  I do not see upon what grounds
we :eould justify resistance to such a proposal, andj I doubt- whether we should stand eventually to gain by doing, so., .; ,:iP [ yu-, ,.Hy.    -        t&apos;\ .-r-h    -mbntp.: rc--:      -:\.:&apos; ;. As to safeguards suggested by. War:.0.J0Bcain-their memorandum &apos;Um&apos;-&apos;df 5th December, foreign Powers have been apprised qf^attAtude^of^His^Majesty V Government5 Hn&apos;&apos; 1 espect of entrance of foreign officers into- Egyptian army and: similar matters by^ Lord Curzon&apos;s circular despatch of 15th March, 1922. We must hope that point will eventually be covered by some final agreement with Egypt. Until then, I should propose anticipation of any action by a hostile Egyptian Government by stating in a note, preferably on occasion of appointment of an Egyptian Sirdar, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard as unfriendly act employment of any non-British foreign officers.With regard to possible creation of an embarrassingly powerful Egyptian army, Council of Ministers decided on 4th January to put into operation place made some time ago for creation of two additional battalions and a squadron of cavalry, largely with a view to absorbing surplus officers evacuated from the Sudan, and that scheme should be prepared for provision of an air force,  E. 150,000 being allocated for this latter purpose. I have reason to believe, moreover, that it is intended to arm each infantry battalion and cavalry squadron with two machine guns. At present they have none.I do not ignore that increases in strength of Egyptian army, training young officers in England and elsewhere, and, more particularly, acquisition of artillery and machine guns, might add to its efficiency, even to a point where large British army of occupation might become necessary, but, broadly speaking, I concur in view expressed in last paragraph, first page, of War Office memorandum.I do not see how we could impose limitation of numbers. Any attempt to do sp would probably have the effect of stimulating generally in Egyptian minds desire for a large army that has yet only found expression in extremist circles. It is true that Zaghlul had intended to examine some scheme for a much larger army, and had con- -suited Stack as to formation of a committee to consider it, but I gather from Ziwar and Sidky that they are entirely opposed to it, on the ground that it is. unnecessary and expensive and that conscription of men which it would involve would make Government unpopular in the country.In the same way, we cannot try to restrict opportunities for military education or purchase of armaments without driving Egyptians to seek help elsewhere.
