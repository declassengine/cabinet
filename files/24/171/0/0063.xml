ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BILL.5:tgote by the Lord Chancellor, covering Draft Bill.I circulate for the information of my colleagues the draft of a Bill which, subject to the consent of the Cabinet, I propose to introduce in the House of Lords at the earliest opportunity.The Bill deals for the most part with small technical amendments of the law, some of which are rendered necessary in order to enable the Judicature Acts to be consolidated.The Bill is substantially the same Bill as that which made considerable progress in Parliament both in 1923 and in 1924.Clause 5* however, is new.     It proposes to authorise the appointment of an additional Judge in the Probate, Divotfce and Admiralty Division.      On this subject I circulated a Memorandum on the 3rd February (See C.P.55(25).)C.louse of Lords,5th February, 1925-
fj  O  HiAdministration of Justice Bill.MEMORANDUM.This Bill in the main reproduces a Bill which in 1924, under the same title, passed the House of Lords and through Committee in the House of Commons, and which itself represented, with certain amendments, a Bill which in 1923 had passed the House of Lords and second reading in the House of Commons.The Bill for the most part deals with technical matters, but clauses 1, 3 and 5 are of general interest.Clause 1 originated from the Report (1923, Cd. 1831) of a Committee (over which Mr. Justice Swift presided) appointed to consider what re-arrangement of circuits could be effected so as to promote economy and greater despatch in the business of the High Court. The clause (without authorising the permanent abolition of any assize town) gives power to the Lord Chief Justice with the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor to dispense, on the occasion of any particular circuit, with the holding of assizes at any place at which there is no substantial amount of business.Clause 3 restores the law relating to trial with a jury in the High Court to the exact position in which it was before the Juries Act, 1918, i.e., it leaves the matter to be dealt with by Rules of Court; the Bill of 1923, and the Bill of 1924 as introduced, defined specifically the cases in which there was to be a trial with a jury and those in which there was to be a trial without a jury.Subsections (1) and (2) of clause 5 (which is new) authorise the appointment of a second puisne judge to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division with a view to relieving the great congestion of Admiralty business which has become increasingly serious of late years and is now causing great inconvenience to litigants. Subsection (3) amends the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, 1910. This Act fixes the maximum number of puisne judges of the Kdng&apos;s Bench Division seventeen, hut provides that a vacancy which does noillfe reduce the number below fifteen is not to be filled up, except on an Address from both Houses of Parliament. Such an Address now becomes spent as soon as an1-8 a
appointment has been made thereunder, with the result that if a vacancy immediately re-occurs it is necessary to obtain a new Address. This subsection makes such an Address operate as a continuing authority for filling not only the existing vacancy but any vacancies which may subsequently occur within a period of a year.Some of the remaining clauses, give effect to recommendations of a Committee (of which Mr. Justice Tomlin was Chairman) appointed to consider the arrange-ments of the Supreme Court offices, while others prepare the way for a Bill to consolidate the Judicature Acts, by removing anomalies and other small difficulties which have come to light during the preparation of that Bill.Clauses 12 and 17 and the Third Schedule are new, and represent amendments which the Attorney-General of the late Government, in fulfilment of promises made in Committee, had put down on the notice paper for the Report Stage of the Bill of 1924.
