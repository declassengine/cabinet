SECRET.CP. 17 (25). .39CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 112.    December 1924.THE number of persons on the Registers at the end of December was 1,273,885, an increase of over 80,000 since the beginning of the month. The decrease during the first portion of the month may be attributed mainly to additional temporary employment which is usually available during the period immediately preceding Christmas, and the subsequent rise in the Registers is the result of the discharge of persons temporarily engaged and the extension of Christmas Holidays in certain industries.It will be seen from Part II of the report that little change has occurred in the principal industries, apart from a steady improvement in the cotton trade. The activity in motor manufacture has continued and there are indications of improved conditions in general engineering. The long-standing depression in the Iron and Steel trades remains unrelieved and the industry has suffered a further slight set-back, particularly in Wales, owing to the slump in tin-plate manufacture.A.

COAL MINING.This industry was still depressed, and under-employment was fairly general, although improvement was shown in some districts. In the Northumberland and Durham coal-fields the position remained bad, owing to lack of export orders. The situation in the South Yorkshire coal-field was good, and full time was worked. In the North-Western Counties there was a f alling-off in the export trade, but in certain districts, notably Tyldesley, employment was very good. In the South Staffordshire area two collieries closed down at Cradley Heath, and unemployment was heavy at Dudley and West Bromwich. In the North Staffordshire area the position was better on the whole, although there was a further decline at Longton, and no improve-ment was shown at Burslem. At Nottingham and Basford the outlook was better, and at Sutton-in-Ashfield the collieries were working full time. In the Kent coal-field the long-standing trade dispute at Chislet Colliery (Canterbury) ended and work was resumed by a few men, but some time will elapse before all the remainder can be re-engaged. In the South-Western Counties there was an increase of unemployment in the Forest of Dean, and the position was not so good in the Somerset coal-field, where many men were &quot; stood off.&quot; In Scotland the improvement was maintained, while in Wales the position was much steadier.IRON AND STEEL.No appreciable movement towards recovery from its long-continued depression is apparent in this industry, and there was still much unemployment in the majority of districts. In the North-Eastern Counties there was little change to report, but the future prospects appear to be brighter. On the Tees-side enquiries were being received for Cleveland Foundry pig-iron, and haematite stocks were being sub-stantially drawn upon for Transatlantic shipment. A large contract for the erection of a steel bridge over the River Tyne, between Gateshead and Newcastle, was secured by a Middlesborough firm, but work on the manufacture of the material had not actively commenced. A furnace at West Hartlepool was closed down during the period under review, but two blast furnaces at Middlesborough will be re-started at an early date. No change is reported from the Scunthorpe and Frodingham area. In the Sheffield area there was little change in the position, but there was an increased demand for railway steel, such as axles, tyres and springs for home use. Billets were still in poor request, owing to the lower prices of foreign imports. In the Midlands: area unemployment was still heavy and the general trend was
downwards. Trade was very depressed in South Staffordshire, but in the North Staffordshire area the position was somewhat better. In Scotland trade was quieter in all districts, but the situation is likely to be benefited if there is any demand for steel-frame houses. The light-castings branch was well employed. In Wales the depression in the tin-plate industry adversely affected steel works, where steel bars for tin-plates are manufactured. Considerable unemployment and intermittent working was reported from the centres of the tin-plate industry at Lianelly, Swansea, Neath and Port Talbot. The Eastern part of the South Wales area was not affected by the tin-plate situation, and works were very busy at Cardiff and Dowlais, high pressure being maintained on general orders. At Ebbw Vale the position was better, one of the Siemens steel furnaces having been restarted, and the sheet mill depart-ment was working full time. In North Wales there was little change and the depression was still severe.TIN-PLATE TRADE.The sudden depression reported in this trade last month has now become acute and a large number of workpeople have been &quot; stood off.&quot; Gorseinon and Llanelly were the two chief places affected.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Employment was still slack in this industry. Contracts for several small ships and some repair work were secured at Wallsend, resulting in the absorption of a number of unemployed workpeople, but at Jarrow and South Bank completion of contracts caused additional hands to* be paid off. Unemployment in the North-Western Counties remained at a high level, although a slight improvement was shown at Barrow. On the Mersey greater activity in repair work caused a reduction in the Exchange registers. In the South-Western Counties some improvement was shown at Cowes, and the situation was better at Southampton and Woolston, where Atlantic liners were undergoing their usual winter overhaul. Employment in Scotland was still below normal. The lack of orders for tramp steamers, for which the Clyde has been famous in the past, has been particularly felt. Orders for vessels ranging from 1,500 to 5,000 tons have been placed at Troon, Port Glasgow, Renfrew, Govan and Leith, but further orders are required to keep pace with completed ships being launched. Among the Welsh ship-repairing ports a slight set-back occurred at Barry and Bute Docks, Cardiff, but employment was fairly steady at Newport. Work was intermittent at Port Talbot. An improvement was shown at Swansea Docks. In North Wales there was a slight improvement at Holyhead, but little work was being done at Flint.ENGINEERING.Motor, Cycle and Aircraft Engineering. The improvement in.this industry was still maintained, and full time was worked in most districts in the Midlands area, where better trade appeared to be general. In the South-Western Counties employment was very good at Oxford, and further unskilled workers were taken on. Marked activity was shown in the aircraft section at Earnborough and Cheltenham. In the South-Eastern Counties, aeroplane engineers at Kingston have booked orders which will last for some time to come, and trade was still brisk at Acton, but slack at Dartford.General Engineering. There has been some decline in unemployment in this industry and signs of improvement are apparent. In the North-Eastern Counties increased activity was shown in the railway wagon-building section. Makers of machine and engineers&apos; small tools continued to be busy, and the file trade at Sheffield also showed improvement. In the North-Western Counties there was a scarcity of orders and little indication of improvement in the industry generally, although some improvement took place in textile engineering, particularly at Rochdale and Accrington. In locomotive construction and general railway work increased employ-ment was provided by new works put in hand by the railway companies. In the Midlands area unemployment was still heavy, but improvement continued in most centres. Skilled workers were in demand at Birmingham and Coventry, and there was an increased demand for labour in the electrical branch at Cradley. In the South-Eastern Counties there was a general tendency to slackness, and trade was quiet at Bermondsey, Woolwich and Colchester, but some improvement was shown at
the Borough, Deptford and-Erith. Electrical work (especially wireless) was generally good at Tottenham. In the South-Western Counties improvement was reported from Newbury, and a firm of agricultural implement makers at Dursley were exceptionally busy and engaged a large number of skilled and unskilled men. Short time was being worked, however, by a large firm of agricultural engineers at Banbury. There were signs of improvement in Scotland. A Bridgeton firm secured a contract amounting to approximately  1,000,000 for two large beet sugar refineries at Kidderminster and Spalding, and orders for railway rolling-stock have been placed at Glasgow and Springburn. In Wales, slackness of work during the last two months was followed by a depression in this industry, which is largely dependent on the prosperity of the coal-fields, and to a smaller extent on the steel, and tin-plate industries. The position at Holyhead had become better, but remained bad at Flint. Employment was fair at Aberystwyth, but not so good at Newtown.TEXTILES.Cotton. Employment in this industry continued to improve, and the outlook is very bright. Extended holiday stoppages for Christmas were less prevalent than last year. The Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation do not yet regard the time as ripe for the introduction of full-time working in respect of spinners of American cotton, and most of the spinning mills were therefore stopped for one day per week. In the weaving section there was a tendency for trade in high-class goods to predominate over trade in the lower-grade goods, and the position was influenced mainly by the comparatively weak demand for cotton goods from India and China. Weavers were in great demand in some districts. Unemployment in the bleaching and finishing sections was more pronounced than in the other branches and much short time was being worked, although some improvement was reported from most districts. In the North-Eastern Counties the register at Todmorden decreased by nearly one-half, and in Scotland the improvement at Bridgeton was maintained.Woollens and Worsteds. A decline in employment is reported in this industry, which is attributed to the continued advance of wool values. In the North-Eastern counties the most marked change was in the heavy woollen branch of the trade. The immediate outlook is uncertain, and irregular short time continued. Many firms closed down for extended holidays at Christmas. There was an improvement in the rag and shoddy sections and skilled rag sorters at Batley were in demand. Many workpeople were re-engaged at Wellington (Somerset). In Scotland trade was quiet, though the position remained good in Stirling and Ayr; but in Wales, the position was very unsatisfactory, owing to wool shortage and small demand for goods.Hosiery. Trade was still quiet in this industry, and extended holidays due to lack of orders was the general rule. Employment at Leicester was intermittent and short-time working was still prevalent at Mansfield, but the improvement was maintained at Nottingham. At Peterborough, machinery for a new textile factory was installed. In Scotland, discharges took place at Dumfries and Aberdeen. Short time was still prevalent at Hawick. The improvement at Kilmarnock was maintained.Lace. Improvement in the curtain section at Beeston continued, but trade in the plain net section was only fair. The Leavers section remained depressed. Much short-time working was the general rule at Long Eaton and Derby, while the position at Nottingham was unchanged, and there was much short-time working in the plain net and curtain section. The lace curtain industry at Darvel, Ayrshire, showed signs of an improvement, after a depression which has extended over several years.Silk. The position remained unchanged. There was a slight improvement at Cheadle, and employment was good at Leek, Macclesfield and Leigh. The artificial silk trade at Coventry continued to flourish and there was an increased demand at Nottingham, but the position at Derby was not so good. Full time was worked at Flint, and orders were plentiful.Jute. The position in this industry remained satisfactory.Carpets. There was no change to report in this industry, and the position at Kidderminster remained satisfactory, slackness only being shown on the cheaper class of fabric.
BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.Employment in this industry remained good and activity was still shown in most districts. The mild winter has had the effect of allowing work to proceed without stoppage. There was still a constant demand for skilled workers, chiefly brick-layers, although in the London area the number of bricklayers available increased during the latter portion of the period. Unemployment among painters was still heavy. Employment was generally good in the brick and tile industry, and the fire-brick trade remained busy.CLOTHING.This industry is suffering from general seasonal slackness and trade was very quiet. The demand for workers in the West end of London dropped considerably, but in the East end men&apos;s tailoring was still busy. Trade was still very slack in corset manufacture, but an improvement was shown in the shirt and collar trade.BOOT AND SHOE.There has been a slight decline in employment in this industry as is usual at this time of the year. The position was poor at Kettering, but considerable improve-ment was shown at Leicester and trade was good at Northampton. Trade was worse at Wellingborough and further depression was apparent at Stafford, where some irregular short-time working commenced. A slight improvement was reported from Mansfield. There was no improvement at Kingswood, where short time was still worked. Trade was generally good at Tottenham and Norwich, and firms at Stepney were busy, but conditions were quiet at Hackney.POTTERY.Employment was not so good in this industry, and workers were placed on extended holidays. There was a tendency to improvement in the earthenware branch, and trade remained good in the sanitary fire-clay section. The position at Worcester remained satisfactory, and there was comparatively little unemployment there. The china trade continued&apos;good at Derby. In the Bristol district, full time was worked, and trade was good at Kingswood, but slack at Springburn and Rutherglen, in Scotland.DOCK TRANSPORT.Employment continued to fluctuate in this industry, an improvement being shown in some districts, while others showed an increase in unemployment. Work for dockers was more plentiful at Aberdeen, Dundee and Leith, but this will be reduced with the closing of the Baltic, which has remained free from ice longer than usual. For this reason dockers in Bermondsey enjoyed better work than for some years past. An increased volume of freightage was handled by dock workers at Liverpool, and there was plenty of work at Hull and Middlesborough, but an increase in unemploy-ment took place at North Shields. Greater activity was shown at the Bristol docks, where imports of grain were particularly heavy. For the same reason transport workers were well employed at Avonmouth. The position in Wales was not so satisfactory owing to the cessation of import of pit props and pit timber. Employment was bad at Swansea and fair at other South Wales ports.
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of previous Report (CP. 541 (24)).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes put in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in. respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade F facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with, employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c., accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for December 1923, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly. e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t In addition to the figures quoted, the average number of men employed during December 1924 on the -Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) was 2,025 as compared with 1,693 during December 1923.I These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.
IY. OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922, assisted passage schemes for Australia. New Zealand, Canada and Ontario have been agreed with the Dominion Authorities concerned. In addition, schemes for the settlement of immigrants on the land have been agreed with the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A number of organisations, having as their object the provision of facilities for the settlement of immigrants in certain of the Dominions, have also been assisted. An extension of this assistance to other organisations is under consideration.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number; of departures during the month of November (with the corresponding figures for November of last year) and for the eight months ended the 30th November, 1924 and 1923 respectively,, are set out in the following Table : -Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.(A.)Schemes.

Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class VII, Vote 3.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided Insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924, the rates of benefit were raised (from 155.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to January 2, 1925.Expenditure                     Benefit paid         ....          ....          .... 187,122,000Appropriation for Administration   .... 17,227,000Section 9-^Unemployment InsuranceAct (No. 2), 1924         ....          .... 437,000   .Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;c.....          ....          .... . 2,308,000Income Contributions Employers           ....          .... .... 70,592,000Employed            ....          .... .... 64,115,000Exchequer           ....          .... .... 46,488,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men) .... 3,014,000207,094,000184,209,000Interest (Net).... .... .... .... 819,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers .... .... ....      5,825,000Employed .... .... ....      5,825,000Exchequer .... .... ....      3,884,000----    15,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net).... .... .... 5,650,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future Contribu-tions, &amp;c..... .... ......... 882,000207,094,000* note.

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20.To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out oe the Road Fund.1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during -subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Tear.

Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (&amp;) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local A uthorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement.(A.)-England and Wales.

From the 1st April, 1924, the Exchequer Grant will, as an emergency measure, so long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains at its present scale, be raised to 100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local Education Authorities.Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31,1924.
