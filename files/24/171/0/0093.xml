HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.Note of interview between the Minister of Labour and M. Albert Thomas on the Eight Hours Convention.EGRET., 1.     When M. Albert Thomas was here a short time ago I,p.92(25).     mot him on several oooasions, and the Foreign Seoretaryhas suggested that my oolleaguee may oare to have a short note on what took place at the last interview,,-2.     After some general conversation M. Thomas stated once more the position that he realised fully that general British praotice was aotually in advance of the stipulations of the Convention itself, but that owing to the particular difficulties here we were not able to propose legislation to ratify the Convention.He asked once again if I would make a statement in parliament saying that we ooncurred in the objeots ajmed at by the Convention,  though we were not in a position to legislate.3.      I had decided on consideration that It would probably be the best way of avoiding future dangers and miaunder-standings if I were to put the position perfectly frankly to M. Thomas.   I therefore said to him that;-(a) I was glad that he recognised that while Elnglish practice was ahead of the Convention,  yet (owing to reasons which we both recognised and which I need not enumerate) no political party in power, whether Sooialist or Conservative, would really find It feasible to introduoe legislation at the present time for the ratification of the Convention.(b) As regards a speeoh or statement, I told him that there was one danger whioh I   -was determined to avoid./It
It was the danger that the other great European countries might all of them express their willingness to ratify provided that others, including Great Britain, did so.    in other words,  the danger was that we might be represented to be the obstacle to general ratification and the bar to progress,  even though all the time we were in fact the people who, as he admitted, were in practice in advance of the others, (o)      I told him that I, realised the difficulty of the position of the international Labour Office and himself as its responsible head,   a number of useful industrial Conventions and Reocmmendations had been adopted, of whioh I did not contest the value, yet doubtless he might think that the future usefulness of the international Labour Offioe perhaps depended on the fortunes of the Convention,  since it was the most important industrial question with which they had yet had to deal,(d)      I said, therefore,  that I would consider the making of a statement,  and that while he would realise that I was quite genuine in my consideration,  j could make no promise in the matter at all until further&apos; thought had been given to the   matter.(intld,) A.  S-M.Ministry of Labour. 17th February,  1325,
