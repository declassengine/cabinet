.c DOXOtfMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.Government have been urging a claim for financial assistance from Great Britain in aid of the Northern Ireland Unemployment Insuranoe Scheme.     Recently Sir James Craig and Mr.J,M. Andrews, the Northern Ireland Minister of Labour, have pressed the matter specially In conversation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with myself.     Under previous Governments, Mr,Neville Chamberlain and Mr.Snowden, aa Chancellors, in turn declined to entertain a similar request, but as the matter has again been raised it seem necessary to obtain a Cabinet decision.   Sir James Craig or Mr.Andrews or both will certainly continue to press the point till a definite answer is given.2.     In substance, the Northern Ireland claim Is, first, that they must provide unemployment benefit on the same scale aa in Great Britain and for the same weekly contributions from employers and employed and, secondly, that Great Britain should assist in making up the deficit on the Northern Ireland Unemployment Insurance Fund if the contributions are Insufficient.3,     I may say at once that, In my view, the question is one of real difficulty.   The case that can be presented against the claim is a formidable one - I deal with some aspects of it in the detailed note attached - but on the other hand the Northern Ireland Government have a strong case on grounds of political equity.4,     Broadly, the claim now put forward by Northern Ireland really means that though there Is a division of Governments, there should be a pooling of resources.   This is not compatibleCABINET.NORTHERN IRELAND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND.1.3&quot;7(25)/with
with *eIf-government in the ordinary acceptation of the term. In accepting a separate government, It may be argued that Northern Ireland necessarily accepted separate financial responsibility.5.     On the other hand (and it is really upon these two points of view that we have to take our deciaion) the general political argument advanced by Northern Ireland Ministers is that in &quot;accepting&quot; a separate government they were acquiescing in a suggestion put forward in order to effect a settlement of the Irish question; they did not advocate separation and! their acquiescence (unwilling as it was ) would have been much more difficult to secure if it had been contemplated that as a result of the separation the social standards of the population were to be lowered below those of the population of this country.   Per the time being, owing to the abnormally lftng unemployment (which was not foreseen at the time of the 1920 settlement), the same rates of contribution towards Unemployment Insurance do not enable benefits to be paid on the same scale as in Great Britain, and the Northern Ireland Government ask, therefore, for assistance in order to avoid a lowering of standards which, in their view, would be politically repugnant. 6.     To enable the Cabinet to reach a deoision on the matter I have prepared the accompanying detailed note setting out, as briefly as possible, what appear to me to be the main points that arise,     I should add that it seems clear to me that if- assistance ia given at all it should be by way of Exchequer grant and that there is no case for making a subsidy out of the British Unemployment Fund, a courae which moreover could not be adopted without legislation.(Intd, )   A, S . M,Ministry of Labour, 28th January, 1925.
NORTHERN IRELAND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND.DETAILED NOTE.1,     Before the operation, of the Government of Ireland Act, a eingle scheme of insurance against unemployment applied to Great Britain and Ireland.     There was a single fund into whioh all contributions from employers, employed and the Exchequer were paid, and from which benefit was paid to unemployed persons.The Government of Ireland Aot did not make unemployment insurance a reserved service.     Accordingly, when a separate Government for Northern Ireland was set up on 1st January, 1922, the scheme then in operation (with other social or-vices) was taken over by that Government among the matters for which they were responsible under the Act.     They have since colleoted their own contributions and paid them into a separate fund from which benefit is paid to persons unein-ployed in Northern Ireland.     At the date of separation an apportionment of the assets and liabilities of the general Unemployment Fund (in fact, consisting almost wholly of the outstanding dobt of  7,600,000 owing to the Treasury) was mado between Groat Britain and Northern Ireland on the basis of tho insured population in the two countries.     The Northern Ireland Fund was debited with  152,000 of the dobt, 2. Very similar arrangements were made with the IrishFreo State at 1st April, 1922.5. Since January, 1922, Northern Ireland has carried onits own Unemployment Insurance Scheme.     In doing so it haskept step with Great Britain by passing amending legislation or making Orders as the Great Britain scheme was varied fromtime to time by legislation over here.     The financialposition of the Northern Ireland Fund has proved so far tobe much more unfavourable than that of the Great Britain/Fund,
Fund, and it is understood that the debt of tho Northern Ireland Fund has shown a practically continuous increase.     The debt of tho Great Britain Fund, down to last September, was decreasing and was  4,670,000 on 15th September; it has sinoe been increasing and was at  5,540,000 at the end of December, 1934.     Calculated on tho basis adopted at tho time of the separation of tho funds, I,e.* the ratio of the insured populations, the Northern Ireland deficit at Deoember, 1924, would have amounted to  3.10,000; actually it was  2,356,000 (subjeot, however, to an offset of  477,000 the amount of a special grant made by the Great Britain Exchequer).     The position which confronts the Northern Ireland Government is therefore a serious one.4. The unfavourable position in Northern Ireland isaooounted for largely by the fact that its two principal indus-tries, viz. shipbuilding and linen, have been continuously de-pressed.     Whether in normal times the risk of unemployment in Northern Ireland is or is not greater than the risk in Great Britain (and therefore whether or not the Northern Ireland Fund can without outside assistance oontinue over a long period to pay the same benefits as the Great Britain Fund for the same contribution revenue per head) is a matter upon which such slender evidence as exists is conflicting and unroliable. 5. The arguments of the Northern Ireland Government havebeen summarily stated on their behalf in the terms of the underlined paragraphs lettered (a) to (g) which follow.     For convenience, comments on each paragraph arc added immediately after iti.No allowance for financing unemployment was raade inthe WhitPaper which set out tho financial^ relationobetween Great Britain and Northern Ir;eland.6. On this it is to be observed that allowance was in faotmade in tho White Paper for all normal expenditure falling on/the
the Exchequer at the time it was prepared, viz. May, 19*30. Thus, allowance was made for 3uch part of the cost of Unemploy-ment Insurance as then fell on the Exchequer but not for the in-creased expenditure thrown on tho Exchequer by the Unemployment Insurance Act of August,  1920.     I understand that that increased expenditure was taken into account by the special Arbitration Committees when it reviewed the Northern Ireland contribution to Imperial Services for 1922/25 and 1923/24 and will doubtless also bo allowed in one way or another in future years.     The same applies to expenditure thrown on the Exchequer by other Unemployment Insurance Acts passed before severance took place on 1st January,  1922. 7. Allovrance was not made for -(a) the increased charge thrown on the NorthernIreland Exchequer by later Unemployment Insuranoe Acts passed by the Northern Ireland Parliament, nor for(b) the deficit, due to abnormal unemployment, whichhas grown up since in Northern Ireland becausethe contributions to their Unemployment Funddid not equal the expenditure made out of it,8. It is, I think, fair to say that in May, .1920, no oneforesaw the magnitude of the unemployment problem whichsubsequently faced the Governments of Great Britain and ofNorthern Ireland, nor was it present to the minds of those whodrew up the White Paper that that problem would necessitatevery large expenditure by way of relief to those who wore un-employed.     While therefore the Government of Ireland Act laidit downnexpressly that the Parliament of Northern ireland should make provision for all the services for which NorthernIreland became responsible and that contributions out of moniesprovided by the Imperial Parliament for such services should/cease,
oease, It is not surprising to find that the Northern Ireland Government, faoed by a finanoial situation quite different from anything that was anticipated whan the Act was passed, now ask for some assistance. 9. There is, of oourse, little doubt that had theNorthern Ireland Government left tho un*anployment Insurance Acts as they stood at the dato of severanoe and passed no legislation to extend benefit, tha deficiency, If any, would have been very small.     The present deficiency is due to their own action in adopting the new legislation passed by Great Britain, without finding sufficient new money (notwithstanding, that they raised their contributions when we Aid) to meat the consequent expense.     Tbeir action was, hoover, determined by their desire to -ensure that their people should obtain the same sooial bsmof its as they would have done but for the separation.10* I understand that allowanoos of substantial amountover and above those mentioned In paragraph 6 above were made to Northern Ireland in the settlement under tho Government of Ireland A**t and undoubtedly these should go far towards meeting any additional expenditure inevitably occasioned to tho Northern Ireland Sxohequer owing to the continuance of this trade depression.     These additional allowances included  650,000 a year in the form of Land Purchase Annuities and a special allocation of  477,000 out of tha revenue of 1921/2, to assist thorn In the initial stages of unemployment insuranoe.     Remembering that abnormal unemployment was not foreseen at the time of the settlement, I do not know how far we oan, at this date, arguG that the Land purchase Annuities ara a set-off to the claim now under oonsidaration.
(b) But for tho Government of Ireland Apt, 192Q, the probloin would never have arisenc,     There is no justification for Northern Ireland workers being asked to suffer in a domestic matter of this kind because of their acceptance of a parliament at the bidding of Great Britaiand^against their cwn wishes. f0) It would bo as unju-st to throw the financial burden of unemployment on Northern Ireland as it would be to cut the Clyde or Sheffield district out of the rest of Great 3ritain and ask them to bear their own unemployment, which they would be equally unable to dp? 11. It is, of course, the case that Northern Irelanddid not wish to be separatsd from Great Britain and that the present problem arises on aooount of separation.   The separation, however, with its accompaniment of a separate Government for Northern Ireland must be accepted as fact or we shall be in danger of re-opening the largo questions settled by the AQt of 19 20.      It follows that it is no use arguing that Northern Ireland must now continue in the same financial relationship to Great Britain, as, say, the Glyde or the Sheffield District,     Self-government is practicable so long as the exercise of powers is combined with financial responsibility;    It is not compatible with any arrangement under which its finanoial responsibility is impaired.12. One of the implications of paragraph (b), and an argument that has in faot been usei, is that Northern Ireland is bound to have the same standard as Great Britain in sooial services and that if their revenues are insufficient for this purpose, Great Britain must assist in making up the deiiois-contingency.
13, The admission of any such contention would involvea far-reaching principle.     Unemployment insurance Le only one of the social services, and the earns claim could, &quot;be made with equal validity in respect of other services present or future.     Moreover, there is Implied the maintenance not merely of the standard at the date of severance between the two oountriesj but of any higher standard subsequently reached by Great Britain.     It it: fair bo waver to point out that this does not mean that Great Britain v-ould be paying for levelling up the standard of a more backward country to its own.     On the contrary the general industrial condition in Belfast is very much the same, and indeed, in some respects, is rather ahead that of the Clyde. 14. It is to be noted that Northern Ireland are notpleading for a speoial and exceptional grant to maet an emergency.     They are olaiming continuous assistance on a ground of principle, - the principle which they explicitly advanoe being that social services in northern Ireland must be maintained on tha same level as in Great Britain, and that if the proceeds of taxes or contributions levied In Northern Ireland at the same rate as in Great Britain do not suffioa for this purpose, the difference cught to be made up from the resources of Great Britain.^J 2?northern Ireland Industries are part and parcel of Industriea organised on a united Kingdom basis, Qogo shipbuilding, engineering, making-up ! 1 ^&quot;s^es K atQo(e) Workers In northern Ireland are largely In the same Trade Unions as those of great Britain, employed under the same Industrial conditions and moving regularly between the two areas.
15.        The point raised in these two paragraphs A3 of some lmporfcanoe as regards the workers, many of wh-^m are in Unions that have membership both in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, though the employers are not to any appreciable extent connected with Employers&apos; Organisations in this country and as a result the conditions of the workers are settled independently.     As a rule, too, disputes arise in the two countries independently, and are settled or terms arranged independently. 16.        The rallwaymen, the dockers, shipyard workers, engineers and building operatives are members of British Trade Unions.     The linen workers (the   remaining important group) are in looal Unions.17.        It is the oase that (particularly in the shipbuilder ing trade) workmen move to and fro between Belfast and the Clyde, and the conditions of employment in the yards in the two areas are   very much the sama.18.        As regards Industrial conditions generally, wages and hours of labour in the principal industries of Northern Ireland are approximately the same as in corresponding industries In this country.     The linen trade is a possible exoeption to this.19.        On the other hand, the Trade Boards Act, 1909, provides expressly that there shall be separate Trade Boards for Ireland,     Thus there Is a separate Trade Board for the Linen Industry in Northern Ireland from that in Great Britain and different rates of wages apply.     A similar state of affairs exists in the shirt and oollar and other Trade Board trades.(f)
(f) On financial grounds Northern Ireland la too^ small an area for a self-contained unemployment fund&apos; it is too dependent on two export trades, ljnen and shipbuilding, with no sufficient proportion of steady Industries with generally good employment.20 .        Unemployment Insurance is only one of the social services which a modern Government is called upon to provide, and it is not easy to see how a country which is large enough to have a separate Government, with all that this implies, is  not large enough to have a separate scheme of Unemployment Insurance.     The nature of the trades In Northern Ireland may lead to great fluctuations in the level of unemployment at different times, but all that this necessarily affects is the nature of the financial arrange-ment which Northern Ireland ought to make at the various periods of the trade cycle.     It does not prove that the scheme oannot be self-supporting.21.        As the suggestion put forward by Mr. Andrews is. that assistance should be given to his fund through the Great Britain Unemployment Insurance Fund, I have considered this in detail.     No grant could be made from the British Unemployment Insurance Fund under existing legislation. I doubt whether the arguments advanced would justify us in putting forward the legislation that would be needed if it were proposed to make a grant out of our Fund.     Three-fourths of the revenue of this Fund oomes from a seleoted part of the population, viz. work-people In insured trades and their esrployers.     The arguments in favour of a grant to Northern Ireland are mainly of a political character./The    v
The contributors to the Unemployment Fund would have good reasons for objecting if the burden were thrown upon them, and not less so seeing that the Fund is heavily in debt and likely to continue in debt for a long time.     It seems to me that as the reasons which could be held to justify assistance are mainly politioal, if the Cabinet should come to the conclusion that some help should be given to Northern Ireland, it would seem that the aid should come from some source other than the Unemployment Insurance Fund.22.        While this is my opinion, I have thought it right to draw up for the information of my colleagues a memorandum, (attaohed hereto as an Appendix), whioh sets out the various methods by which assistance might conceivably be given from the Unemployment Fund, with comments upon them.     The objections detailed in this memorandum reinforce the view I have already expressed as to the inadvisability, and indeed, the Imprasticabil-ity, of attempting to give assistance from the Unemploy-ment Insurance Fund.(Intd)      A.S - M.Ministry of Labour, 28th January, 1925.
APPENDIX.METHODS OP ASSISTANCE.The methods of assistance from the British UnemploymentFund -Thioh at first sight might seem possible appear to be:-(l)     Complete amalgamation of the two Unemployment Insurance Funds;(2)     Periodical equalising grants from the Great Britain Unemployment Insuranoe Fund to the Northern Ireland Unemployment Insurance Fund calculated on such a basis as to enable the latter to keep paoe in solvenoy with the Great Britain Unemployment Insurance Fund;(3)     Grants on some less generous basis. (a)   Amalgamation.It is clear that any plan for pooling liabilities while retaining separate administration would be thoroughly vicious. The existence of separate parliaments would make it impracticable to exercise any effective control over Northern Ireland administration.     Any attempt to exercise such control could only lead to a dangerous state of friction,   it is understood that in other spheres where Great Britain and Northern Ireland have common finance,   there is single control of policy and practice.On the other hand it is plainly out of the question to transfer the administration of Unemployment Insurance in Northern Ireland to the Minister of Labour in London, i.e. to make it a reserved service.   This would be a formal re-opening of questions settled by the Government of Ireland Act.    Even if this step is politically oonoeivable,  the problems and difficulties that would arise in the course of day-to-day administration would be very serious.    Even In regard to the ordinary aspeote of Unemployment Insurance administration,/touching
touching as it does the daily life of large numbers of people, the position of a British Minister who had to deal with complaints concerning Northern Ireland would be difficult enough.      in fact, however, the British Minister and the British Government with him, would be involved direotly in religious and boundary questions, owing to alleged discrimination or lack of discrimination between persons of different religious beliefs, between persons living on different sides of the boundary, or between persons who had served or not served in the British or Free State Armies.    These are problems with whioh no British Ministry would be well-equipped to deal, in the face of two local Parliaments.It may be added that experience has shown how important it is that Poor Law policy should be co-ordinated with the administration of unemployment benefit and it is hardly conoelvablc that there could be any step taken to plaoe responsibility for the administration of unemployment insurance on Whitehall which did not transfer the responsibility for Poor Law administration too.    ,    Similar considerations arise with regard to other functions of Government in relation to labour.    Provision for relief work is another matter whioh it would be difficult to leave to the Northern Ireland Government if Unemployment insuranoe were re-transferred.    The endeavour to co-ordinate these functions is sufficiently difficult while they are distributed among different departments in Whitehall but were there to be a division so far as Northern Ireland is concerned between Whitehall and Belfast the difficulties would be   groai.lv increased, (b)    EguaJLltiitig S1 ants*An equalising grant of an amount     sufficient to make Northern Ireland&apos;a progress towards solvency keep step with/that
that of Great Britain seems to be cpen to all the objections to which amalgamation without unified control is subject.    It would remove all incentive towards economical administration by Northern Ireland,    it would not be possible for a complicated and elaborate system of checks to be introduced under which this oountry supervised effeotively the administration in Northern Ireland, whilst that administration was responsible to another Government,It may be added that the possibility of corresponding payments at some later date from   Northern Ireland should their position become more favourable than that of Great Britain need not be seriously considered;    the amount of any payments which Northern Ireland oould make could not possibly be large enough to be of any appreciable assistance to the British Kund. (o)     Partial Grants.The effect of a grant of a partial character would of course deoend to some extent on the proportion it bears to the total deficit;    but if the grant were of substantial amount it would be open to very much the same objections as those to which a full equalising grant is exposed.   The difference is only one of degree.     The objections would be less serious if the grant were very small but such a grant would be of no real Use to Northern Ireland.Moreover, if it proves to be the case that Northern Ireland unemployment is permanently higher than that of Great Britain no partial grant will enable Northern Ireland to go on keeping step with Great Britain with the same rate of contributions, and requests for further assistance  rould pretty certainly be made at a later date.
