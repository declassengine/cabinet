The Prime Minister has asked the Home Affairs Committee to consider whether the Government should adopt the Roman Catholic Relief Bill introduced by Mr. Blundell last Session. I am bound to say that I think it would be most unwise to do anything of the kind.The Bill is much more spocioue in appearance than the Bill of 1909 (which is the latest of a series of Bills on the subject) in as much as it simply purports to repeal a number of old statutes;    but apart from tho fact that some of these repeals ought to be accompanied*by saving clauses, some of them involve questions of a highly controversial kind and ought not, in my opinion,  to be proposed by the Government at this.stage. It would be much better to wait until the feeling of the House and of the public in 1925 has been to some extent tested by letting the Bill go forward as a Private Members&apos; Bill.As regards the particular Acts or Sections proposed to be repealed, I can if desirod circulate a full memorandum, but perhaps it would suffice for the moment to make a few brief remarks upon them.As regards  the first three,  all that need be said is that a saving clause of some kind seems required to cover acts,done under them an order, for example,   to prevent claims in respect of property confiscated,  particularly from private individuals. One of the Acts also contains some special provisions about the Temple and the historic Church of St. Bartholomew the Great, Smithfield, as to which it might be desirable to consult the Authorities concerned.(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).egret- 2-A-9-LJ!JEjr-.P. 70(25).Home Affairs Oommittee.: GROMAN 0ATHOLI0 RELIEF BILL. Memorandum, by the Home Secretary.
As regards the fourth Act,  questions of an ecclesiastical character arise, for example, whether the Benefices Act of 189R and other provisions of the law now in force are regarded as sufficient to prevont &quot;unfit&quot; persons being presented,The proposed repeal of Section 11 of the Act of 1791 and Section 26 of the Act of 1829 raise the question of the law relating to Roman Catholio processions.      It may be right to repeal these Sections, but I ought to point out that on tho occasion of tho Eucharistic procession in London in 190P they became the subject of most acute controversy,  and the Government of the day were faced with decisions of a most difficult kind in relation to the duties of the Police and the enforcement of tho law, having regard to threats of attaok upon the procession.      This at any rate shows that tho matter requires careful consideration before the Government assume tho responsibility for proposing repeal.The proposed repeal of Section 12 of the Act of 1P29 has also been highly controversial in the past.      The question of providing that the Lord Chancellor may be a Roman Catholic was very fully debated in Parliament in 1P91 and at that time the Home Office received a large number of petitions against the proposal.The remaining proposal of substance in the Bill is the repeal of a number of provisions imposing disabilities on religious orders.      It would appear from information collected in the Home Office some years ago that these are almost, entirely dead letter but, it cannot be said, that a proposal to repeal them would not arouse controversy.I trust that the Home Affairs Committee will agree to recommend to the Catinet that the Government should not accept any responsibility for this Bill and that if the promoters ask the Government as to their attitude in regard to it they should
C4P-50be informed that in the opinion of the Government some of the proposals are likely to prove highly controversial, and they are not prepared to consider tho question of adopting it as a Government Bill until the feeling of the House and the country has to some extent been tested.W.J.H.6th February,  1925.
