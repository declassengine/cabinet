ilS nOOOMEMT&apos; IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).KjJ E T. CABINET.P. 52 (25.).. I--- THE STATUS^OF THE EGYPTIAN ARMY AND&quot;CQMI-iAWD QF^H^TSPBAN...DEFlN&apos;CE^FOp:CEaDecypher of telegram from Lord Allenby,  (Cairo) toForeign Office.Despatched 2.00 pcm. 21st January,  19250Received     1.35 pams 21st January,  1925.Mo.  33.My telegram No. 24 of yesterday to Khartoum.I.hope formal communication of Governor-General&apos;s proclamation will enable me to expedite sett lenient of number of details concerning budget and establishment involved in separation of Sudan defence force from Egyptian array which, so long as they are outstanding are causing some administrative delay and confusion?Arrangement in respect of Huddleston is necessarily somewhat of a makeshift.     As I pointed out in my telegram No.19 his relations with the army here have recently been little more than nominal.     Now that new force has been created retentionA)y its command   of Sirdarship of Egyptian army is likely to prove embarrassment rather than advantage,Enough time has I think now elapsed to ensure that mass of Egyptians do not regard appointment of an Egyptian Sirdar as direct outcome of Sir Lee Stack&apos;s murder.      I trust it will be possible in the near future to authorise me to tell Egyptian government that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no objection to such an appointment.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 33.     Repeated, to Khartoum.^tehall Gardens, S.W.1.  gte?ry 2nd,  1925.
