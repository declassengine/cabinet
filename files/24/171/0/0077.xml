THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.

CABINET.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.

CONTROL OF THE PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS, MUNITIONS AND IMPLEMENTS OF WAR.

SECRET

?

There is one point in the Memorandum (C.P.50 (25)) on the, above subject circulated by the Foreign Secretary which, in my opinion, deserves especial attention.

The Sub-Committee of the Committee of imperial Defence recommend that the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government to any scheme for the control of private manufacture of arms should be subject to the following condition:-

"Control must be national, and not international" (see Para. 4 (5) of C.P. 50 (25)).

The objections to international control  are obvious. But a system of national control is fraught with a danger which ought to be weighed carefully before that alternative is adopted.

In the industrial sphere, British manufacturers object to the ratification by Great Britain of the Eight-hours convention and the whole gravamen of their objection lies in the belief that while the duties imposed by the Convention would be loyally carried out in Great Britain, the interpretation of them in foreign countries would be so "elastic" as practically to make the obligations of the Convention binding upon us alone.

This objection, though somewhat exaggerated, has much substance. It would be of still graver importance in relation to the manufacture of arms. So much is obvious at once to anyone who studies the implications of Seo. 10 (5) (a) and the observations upon it. Our national safety might come to depend in large measure on the bona fides of a foreign power in loyally carrying out its control. Can we trust to this in the present phase of international relations?
