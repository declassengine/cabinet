THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PR OPER Tf OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET.-&quot; (Home Affairs Committee). p: QCP. 11(25).Former Enemy Aliens (Disabilities Removal) Bill. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,The attached Bill has been drafted to give effect to the undertaking embodied in the Anglo-German Treaty of Commerce,, with the authority of the Cabinet, that legislation would be enacted to remove the existing disabilities af fe cting German citizens and German Companies which do not extend to aliens and alien companies in general.   These disabilities extend to (1) participation in the non-ferrous metal industry; (2) participation in banking business; and (5) serving on British merchant ships.The Bill goes further than the Treaty In so far as It removes the disabilities in respect of all ex-enemy countries.   There Is obviously little to be said for retaining them In respect of Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey, seeing that it was almost entirely Germany and the Germans which Parliament had in view when they were imposed.   A.s regards Austria in particular, I am advised that their maintenance would be contrary to the spirit if not to the letter of the Anglo-Austrian Treaty, the ratification of which is imminent.   Austria only accepted them as part of the legislation of this country affecting ex-enemies in general, and would certainly have grounds for protest if they were removed in the case of Germany and not in   her case.   Moreover, so far at least as concerns the legislation affecting the non-ferrous metal trade, It would not be reasonable to require that all firms in that trade should have to satisfy the Board of Trade that they had no association with countries such as Turkey and Bulgaria whose subjects   in fact never engaged In such trades in this country.   There Is no reason to believe that any opposition the Bill is likely to encounter would be mitigated by limiting its provisions to Germany only.-1-
Whilst the first Schedule to the Bill contains only the particular provision of the Treaty which necessitates the passage of the measure, I propose that, at the time of its introduction the full text of the Treaty (including also the official minutes of the meeting at which the signature took place) should he published as a White Paper.   The Treaty contains many provisions of great value to British traders and the defence of the present measure in Parliament will largely depend on the argument that the concessions to Germany embodied in this Bill are amply compensated for by the advantages we have been able to secure.The draft Bill is agreed to both by the Foreign Office and the Home Office.(Intd.)
