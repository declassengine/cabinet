IIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRHAMMBS MAJESTY1S GOVERHMEMT)JSjLB E To .P. 99 (251C A B  I N E T.M ILK   LEG ISLAT ION ,Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer2I circulate herewith a Memorandum prepared in the Treasury in regard to Milk Legislation and I invite the concurrence of my colleagues with the views expressed thereino* 7/ o S e C oTreasury Chambers, SaW,l* February 18th, 1925.1,     The Cabinet decided on the 28th January (Cabinet 4 (25) Conclusion 2), that consideration should be given to the question whether legislation was necessary for the revival of the Tuberculosis Order of 1914 with an Exchequer contributlon.The Order depends on the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, and the Act provides that the Board of Agriculture may, in the oase of disease, other than diseases specifically provided for, authorise &quot;The Slaughter of Animals by local Authorities .... and in all or any such cases the payment of compensation for the same by local Authorities out of thelOCal   rate     o o o,e c*o.*.(iac*.iocaIt is now proposed that the local rates should be relieved of a proportion of the payments to be made under the Order.     This requires specific statutory authority and oannot in practice be done by an Estimate; strong exception is always taken by the Committee of Public Accounts and in the House of Commons to any proposal to adopt the latter course because, &quot;while it is undoubtedly within the discretion of Parliament to override the provisions of an existing Statuter    : &apos; -1-______-il
by a Vote in Supply conformed by the Appropriation Act&quot;, such a course is extremely undesirable &quot;on grounds of financial regularity and constitution consistency&quot; \    and whatever Government is in power it has always had to bow before the feeling of the House in this matter.Having regard to the views so frequently and so strongly expressed by the Publio Accounts&apos;Committee as indicated above,  it would not be right to impose a charge on the Exchequer in connection with the proposals under consideration except with the authority of a specific Act of Parliamenta2.     There is a further questione     Assuming that an Exchequer grant is to be made, what should be the percentage? The- Ministries of Agrioulture and Health propose a 75 ; 25 division between the Exchequer and the Local Authorities on the grounds (1) that the local authorities will have themselves to bear the cost of administration, which will be substantial, and (2) that the County, I.eB Rural, Authorities who pay the compensation will feel that they are being mulcted in order that the Urban Authorities may get pure milk, and that as the measure is for the benefit of the milk consumer living in towns, the latter should be called upon to pay, and can only be called upon by means of taxes contributed to the Exchequer.     The Treasury see serious objections to paying more than 50 per cent of the cost of a service administered by another authority.     Any proportion over half Is likely to lead to extravagance which it&apos; is impossible to check.     The officer who assesses compensation for slaughtered animals will&apos; be aware that he his employer, the local authority, pays only 5/out of every   awarded.      The rural areas cannot claim a vested interest in supplying disease-carrying milk to the towns.     Finally
although rates have approximately doubled, taxes have gone up three or four-foldeIt is accordingly suggested that the Cabinet should direct that the Exchequer contribution shall    be limited to a maximum of 50%
