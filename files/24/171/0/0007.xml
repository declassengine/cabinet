Chancellor of the Exchequer *A Committee Including representatives of all parties in the House of Commons was appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer In May, 1923, to enquire (a) into the initial salary of what are known as Lytton entrants to the Clerical Class, and (b) into the question of the appointment of ex-service men to posts In the Civil Service,This Committee, of which Lord Southborough was Chairman, covered in its first report the question of the initial salary of Lytton entrants, and effect has been given to the Committee&apos;s recommendations under this head. In its second report the Committee dealt with the measures which had been taken, and were still being taken, to substitute ex-service men for non-service men and women In temporary posts in the Civil Service, and under this head came to the conclusion that the fullest possible effect had been given,and was being given to the policy of preferential treatment for ex-service men.      In Its, third report the Committee recommended that a further opportunity should.be given to ex-service men of securing appointment to established posts in the established Clerical Class.     The late Government accepted this recommendation.      It Involves the holding of an examination for admission to the established
Clerical Class at which ex-service -len temporarily employed in the Civil Service will alone be eligible to compete.     Of the 35,000 ex-service men so employed, about 16,000 have applied to sit at the examination, which in the ordinary course would have been held in the spring of this year.It was further decided, on the recommendation of the Southborough Committee, that candidates reaching a qualifying standard at this examination should be entitled to all vacancies in the Clerical and Departmental Clerical Classes existing and declared before the 31st December 1924, and thereafter to every second vacancy arising in these Classes until every qualified candidate,should have received an appointment. ,   The remaining fifty per cent of vacancies arising after 31st December, 1924, would go to candidates recruited by open competition;    the Committee being of opinion tttaty in the interests of the efficiency of the: Service, it was necessary to re-establish the normal method of recruitment In filling some at least of the vacancies in the Clerical and i Departmental Clerical Classes. -....   It became evident at once that the Association of ex-service Civil Servants would strenuously oppose the Committee&apos;s findings. A press,, campaign was started.     Questions were asked, in the House of Commons.     In reply to these, the late Government declared Its adherence to the terms of the Southborough Report and declined to suspend the arrangements for an examination, but undertook, to provide an. opportunity of discussion in the House before any examination was actually held.     The dissolution of Parliament followed, almost immediately. .*
In the general manifesto of the Unionist Party at the General Election it was stated that &quot;the proposals &quot;of the present Government for carrying out the &quot;recommendations of the Southborough Committee with &quot;regard to the position of temporary ex-service Civil &quot;Servants will be carefully examined if we are returned &quot;to power, and our conclusions will be presented to &quot;Parliament before any action is taken to put them into &quot;effect&quot;.     Apart from this, the Prime Minister wrote to the Secretary of the Association of Ex-Service Civil Servants in the following terms  :-&quot;In reply to your letter of October 13th, &quot;I am glad to be able to give you the following &quot;assurance on the question of ex-service men employed &quot;in the Civil Service to which effect will be given &quot;in the event of the Party being returned to power.&quot;(1) The forthcoming examination for ex-service &quot;men temporarily employed in the Civil Service would &quot;be suspended until such time as the Party should &quot;have examined the reports of the Southborough &quot;Committee and afforded the House an opportunity of &quot;disctissing any action proposed to be, taken upon them.&quot;(2) The Party is, generally speaking, in favour &quot;of the absorption of the competent ex-service &quot;temporaries in appropriate positions in the permanent &quot;Service in preference to the admission of entrants &quot;from outside, but without prejudice to the rights &quot;of permanent Civil Servants who served in the war.&quot;(3) The Party would afford the Association an &quot;opportunity of expressing the views of the men &quot;concerned at any Party Conference which may hereafter
&quot;consider the matter&quot;.In view of these declarations it becomes &apos;immediately necessary for the Government to examine therecommendations of the Southborough Committee and to forma judgment upon them.     For this purpose a briefdescription bf the structure of the established,CivilService and a general $statement of the present abnormalposition are necessary.leaving out the higher duties assigned to administrative and Executive Offioers, the routinebusiness of the Civil Service (involving duties of variedimportance and responsibility) are carried out at thepresent time by -(1) The established Clerical Classes on scales of salary rising to a&quot; maximum of  250 plus bonus 369) for men, and to a maximum *   180 plus bonus (*  279) for women:(8) The established Writing Assistant Class (women and girls) on a sca le of s alary rlsing to 36/- a week plus bonus f55 62/7d. a week):(3) Temporary Clerks fmale and female), the majority * being on scales rising for men and women respectively to 65/fid. a week, and 50/9d. a week.A considerable part of the work now done will come to an end in the next few years, and the fringe of temporary employees Is consequently muoh larger than would be the case in normal times.The routine business of Government as it exists at present is distributed among these three Classes broadly as follows :-The established Clerical Classes (men and women) are employed on the better and more responsible duties. The Writing Assistants (women and girls) are employed on
mechanical duties.    The Temporary Clerks, men and women, ex-service and non-service, are divided up into a : nuD^ber of grades, but the great bulk of them are classified as Grade III Clerks and are employed on duties vuhieh otherwise would be entrusted either to the least competent members of the permanent Clerical Class or to writing Assistants.    The ex-service men employed as Temporary Clerks differ in capacity, but it is clear that a large proportion of them are fit for no better or more responsible work than that of Writing Assistants or quite Junior Clerks, and that as a body they fall far short of the standard of competence that would normally be exacted of entrants to  the established Clerical Class.      ouch being the  case,, some process of selection is obviously necessary if appointments to the established Clerical Class are to be made Iron their ranks.On viha t method is the selection to be made? In considering this problem, it must be borne in mind that the Civil Service is organised on a departmental basis, and that the ratio of vacancies in the established Clerical Class to the number of ex-servicemen serving temporarily in each Department varies, enormously.    This fact alone, quite apart from the consideration that the standard of selection would certainly not be uniform if it were left to eighty or ninety different Departments to  select their own men, is decisive for some kind of centralised machinery.This would mean, in effect, either a central selection board or a test by examination; and to my mind -    , although I should naturally start with a prejudice against examination for men between the ages of 30 and 40 - a
selection board is out of the question, if only for the reason that it would be unable to work through a list of 18,000 to 20,000 candidates in lest; than three   years,, On this ground alone we are driven inexorably, as both the Lytton Committee and the sou thbo rough Committee saw, to the expedient of an -examination.      In recommending that 25 per cent of the total marks at the examination should be awarded on the basis of departmental reports, the southborough Committee have in fact made some concession to the views of those who argue in favour of the method of departmental select ion.    This,  however, is by the way.    The really important and decisive arguments in favour of examination are first,  that an examination is, after all, an absolutely impartial and   impersonal test,   and secaidly,  that it  can be over and done with in a reasonably short space of time.So far,__therefore , as admission, of ex-servicemen to the ^ es tabli shed 01 er ical Classes is concerned.. I am sa tisfled thb t there i s no thia ; for it but to stand by the dou th bo r ough Re p o rt. iI accept also,  for  the reasons in paragraphs 28-32 of  their third report,   the findings of the Southborough Committee regarding the admission of temporary ex-service men to the -Executive fend Administrative Classes of the Civil Service and their appointment to technical posts in the Civil Service.    Qui te apart from any other consideration,  the existing redundancy in the iixecutive Class makes recruitment to &quot; that Glass Impossible for some years to come.    i&apos;or  the -Administrative . Class
the temporary ex-service men have already been given their ohance.      In filling up vacancies in the varioustechnical establishments of the Civil Service,  it isthe approved policy, endorsed by both the Lytton andSouthborough Committees, to give every possible preference to qualified ex-service men on the temporary staff.After all, the   main difficulty with which wsare confronted is not what should or should not be donein favour of the small handful oi ex-service men layingclaim to higher posts in the Civil Service, but what isto be done with the t^ns of thousands who do not  qualify even for admission to the established Clerical Classes.Undoubtedly the chief pre-occupation of these men&apos;s minds is not their chance of getting into the Clerical Class but the risk of losing their present employment in the Civil Service.     Many of them - perhaps most of them -are haunted by the spectre of unemployment.      They think that if they fail at the Clerical Class competition, they will within a very short time be thrown out altogether.So far as -the great bulk of these men ars concerned,  I believe this to be a delusion.      I do not believe, however important it may be on administrative grounds to get in recruitjs by open competition, that temporary ex-service men will ever be discharged in order to let in open competition candidates.     Many of the jobs that these temporary men are employed on will come to an end sooner or later during the next few years, and no one could defend keeping them on without jobs to do.      But I am not at all sure that as the result of a continuous process of discharges during the last few years, we are
not now well within sight of what will come to he regarded as our normal post-war total establishment. Making reasonable allowance for normal wastage and setting that against the reduction of establishment that could probably be effected as blocks of temporary work get finished, I calculate that it would be perfectly feasible to give a guarantee of permanent status in their present grades to a considerable proportion of the ex-service clerks still remaining on the temporary establishment after the Southborough exa.ination for the CTarical Class has done its work.In the hope of arriving at an agreed settlement on this basis, the treasury has been in informal negotiation during the past few weeks with the Chairman and   Organising Secretary of the Association of Ex-Service Civil Servants.      These negotiations have now reached the stage of a draft scheme which I think these tvio officials might be prepared to recommend to the Executive of the Association.     Under the terms of this scheme provision is made for the employment in their existing grades on a permanent bag-is of not less than 8,000 members of the existing temporary ex-service clerical staff.   .  If the number of temporary ex-service   clerks v*ho qualify by ue ans of the SoutEbor ough examination for the established Clerical. Classes turns out to be less than 5,000,  the figure of 8,000 Hould be exceeded to a corresponding degree,     The scheme further
provides that every third vacancy in this supplementarypermanent unpensionahle class may be filled by theappointment to it of an ex-service clerk from the temporarylist.     As regards temporary ex-service men at presentemployed on higher than clerical .duties on the&quot; temporaryestablishment, the scheme provides for the possibility ofgiving permanent employment to some such officers&quot;&apos; in so faras this arrangement may be warranted by the requirementsof the work.     Provision is further-made in the schemefor the. permanent grading of 75 per cent of the temporaryex-service messengers employed in London headquarter .establishments.      In all cases, preference is to be givento disabled men and men who have, served overseas.Provided that the two officers of the Ex-ServiceAssociation with whom the Treasury has been negotiatingare prepared to recommend a scheme on these lines to theirauthorityexecutive,   I would, suggest that we should seek Cabinet/ to assure them.that the Government on their part are prepared,  in ^consideration of getting an agreed settlement, to give effect to it.      I am bound to add that there is already ample evidence that any such scheme will be strongly opposed by organised sections of the permanent Civil Service.      I should have been glad if we could have cured this ex-service trouble in the Civil Service without opening new sores. But taking everything into account I am satisfied that if by means of the scheme now proposed we can bring the ex-service agitation to an end, we shall be well advised to adopt it.
If, however, the scheme now proposed is not likely to secure an agreed settlement with the ex-service men and if, in particular, the Chairman and Secretary of the Ex-Service Association are not prepared to recommend it to their Executive as an agreed settlement,    I should propose to inform them that the negotiations are at an end and that the      Government intend to endorse the Southborough recommendations without modifitfation or supplementary provisions. After all, the scheme which we have been considering, so far from offaring any administrative advantage, is likely to prove administratively inconvenient and sooner or later to involve&quot; increased expenditure,, e, g. for pensions.      If it is not to be the basis of an agreed settlement, It is not worth having at all:    and the Government would, in my judgment, be amply justified in that event in refusing to budge beyond the terms of the Southborough recommendations, which are greatly to the benefit of the temporary ex-service men in the Civil Service and might certainly,  on merits, be accepted by the Government as a reasonable and final solution of the problem^.(Intld.)
