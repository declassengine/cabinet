(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government).In a previous memorandum  (CP. 542/24) the Home Secretary recommended that,  subject to certain amendments, we should agree to accept this Convention)  but that in notifying the amendments to. the International Labour Office we should Intimate that in view of the present high cost of living and the recent appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the present food prices,  it would be impossible for H.M. Government to undertake to bring into actual operation any change in the present system which might affect the general cost of production,  by any specified date.When this proposal was discussed at the last meeting of the Cabinet,  it was pointed out by the President of the Board of Trade that this question would be the subject of considera-tion by the Royal Commission,  and it was agreed that the position should be further discussed between the President of the Board of Trade,  the Minister of Labour and the Home Secretary with a view to a decision being taken by the Cabinet at their next meeting.The matter has since been discussed between the three Departments and as a result of this discussion it is now proposed -(l) That the Home Secretary should be authorised on behalf of the Government to Invite the Royal Commission to investigate and make a Special Report on the  question whether a compulsory discontinuance of night baking would be likely to result - either permanently or temporarily - in anSECRET.CABINET.CP.  3(25).DRAFT CONVENTIONS PROVISIONALLY ADOPTED BY THEINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.Memorandum by Sir JohnAnde r s on.
increase in the price of bread,  and if so, what would be the amount of the increase.      The question should be considered on the basis of the scheme recommended in the Report of the Departmental Committee on Sight Baking (Cmd. 246),  and in view of the importance of the Government being in a position to come to a final decision before the mooting of the International Labour Conference in May next, the Commission might bo asked to consider the appointment of a special Sub-Committee for the purpose, which might usefully perhaps include representatives of the National Association of Master Bakers and the Operatives&apos; Bakers&apos; Union.(2) That the International Labour Office should be notified that H.H.  Government are disposed to accept the Convention if amended on the lines indicated in the previous memorandum,  provided they can be satisfied that the effect of the adoption of the Convention would not be to cause an increase in the price of bread to the consumer. They are referring this question to the Royal Commission on Food Prices for special investigation, and, pending the Report of this Commission,  are unable to come to a final decision.I understand that the Cabinet has agreed to the replies proposed, to be sent to the International Labour Office in regard to the other draft Conventions provisionally adopted at the last Conference and does not desire to review the reply proposed to be sent to the Questionnaire on the subject of Workmen1s Compensation.      This reply, which has been approved by the Inter-Departmental Committee presided over by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour,  does not commit the Government to any modification of the existing system.J.A.1st January,   1925-.
