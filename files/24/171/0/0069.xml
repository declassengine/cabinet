iPWlg DOCtJMBMT IS THE -PRO-PERT? OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJKSTI1 a GOVERHMEUT.fij^O RET.JUVENILE Unemployment 0 YI.-IE N T^QOIOI TT EE . &apos;CABINETInterimReport.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet) (Cabinet 3 (25) 7), the Juvenile Unemployment Committee have considered the Government policy on the question of Juvenile Unemployment and now submit the following Interim Report.The Committee have examined the Report, dated 20th November, 1924, of the Juvenile Organisations Committee of tie Board of Education on the problem of unemployed juveniles between 14 and 16 years of age.      The two main recommendations of this Committee are &quot;that compulsory Day Continuation Schools should be instituted at the earliest practicable date and that the age for Unemployment insurance should be lowered from 16 to 15,      The Committee concur with the view expressed by the President of the Board of Education and the Minister of Labour in their Memorandum (CP.23 (25)  ) that the re-introduction of compulsory Day Continuation Schools is quite impracticable at the moment.With regard to the lowering of the Unemployment Insurance age to 15 the Committee consider that the educational, political and general objections to this proposal are of so serious a character as to make its adoption by  the Government most difficult, if not impossible.    These main objections may be briefly summarised as follows.It will be remembered that when the late Government pro-posed to reduce the Unemploymen t Insurance age from 16. to 14 the-1-
was resisted by educationists on th-e ground of the prejudicial effect which it would have on proposals., for raising the  school-leaving age.    The educational objection -would be little,  if at all, reduced by substituting 15 for 14 as a minimum age of entry into Unemployment Insurance. Educationally the proposal could only be justified if there was any real chance in the near fixture of a general raising of the school-leaving age to 15.      Secondly,  there-is, undoubtedly, a very widespread feeling that the unemployed are being demoralised by being pauperised.     Under the proposal children will not merely be brought &quot;into the dole&quot; but, if the further proposal of the Juvenile Organisations Committee be adopted,  that the first thirty weeks1 attendance at a class or centre should rank as so many weeks of contribu-tion to the insurance fund, they will be eligible to receive benefits towards which they have not fully -^contributed - an arrangement which, it is felt, would, still further shock the moral sense of the community..    Lastly,  the adoption-of the proposal would disorganise the arrangements now under con-sideration for a general scheme of Insurance on a contributory basis and would greatly complicate the administration of any such scheme,,The Committee having decided that the proposed lowering of the Unemployment Insurance age to 15 was one which they could not recommend the Cabinet to adopt, proceeded to examine the suggestion in C*P923 (25) that Local Authorities should be empowered by Statute to compel the attendance of unemployed children at Juvenile Unemployment Centres after leaving school up to the age of 16.      If legislation on these lines were obtained it is contemplated that Local Authorities in areas where juvenile unemployment is particularly severe would adopt the arrangements and enforce them fairly effectively through the School iitt endanceJ Service,
The Oommittee are favourable to  this proposal but before examining-i t in detail they feel that a decision on the question of principle should be given by the Cabinet *The Committee recommend the Cabinet :-&apos;&apos; &apos; i!(l)      To accept in principle the proposal to give Local Authorities power to compel the attendance of employed children at Juvenile Unemployment Centres up to, the age of 16,(2)      To authorise the Committee toprepare for the consideration of the Cabinet a de-tailed scheme for giving effect to  the proposal in (1) above s together with estimates of the cost thereof to the Exchequer *(Signed) IBVILLS CHAMBERLAIH.
