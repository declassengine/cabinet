[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.j-     39ARTICLE X OF  THE  RUSSIAN  TRADE  AGREEMENT.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IN accordance with Conclusion 3 (c) of Cabinet 61 (24), I circulate for the information of my colleagues a note on Article X of the Russian Trade Agreement. This note has been prepared by the Treasury and is concurred in by the Lot eign Office and the Board of Trade.w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W., January 2, 1925.Article X of the Russian Trade Agreement.This article reads as follows :--&quot; X. The Russian Soviet Government undertakes to make no claim to dispose in any way of the funds or other property of the late Imperial and Provisional Russian Governments in the United Kingdom. The British Government gives a corresponding undertaking as regards British Government funds and property in Russia. This article is not to prejudice the inclusion in the general Treaty, referred to in the preamble, of any provision dealing with the subject-matter of this article.&quot; Both parties agree to protect and not to transfer to any claimants pending the conclusion of the aforesaid Treaty any of the above funds or property which , may be subject to their control.&quot;So long as the Russian Trade Agreement is in force, the Soviet Government is debarred from claiming these balances, and the British Government is debarred from making any attempt to take them over. The Trade Agreement can be denounced by either party on giving six months&apos; notice, and the Treasury have been advised by Counsel that, if the Agreement is denounced, he saw no course open other than ad hoc legislation, and that he saw no special difficulties in the way of : such legislation other than political difficulties. Such legislation would presumably take the form of transferring to the British Government the rights of the Soviet Government without in any way interfering with the rights of third parties who may succeed in establishing valid claims to any part of these Funds.Difficult legal questions arise with regard to the power of the Soviet Government to claim through the intermediary of British courts property in England belonging to institutions (e.g., Banks) which have been nationalised in Russia. These are not protected by the Trade Agreement. They are probably not in immediate jeopardy. This matter is, however, being explored.SECRET. CP. 8 (25).cabinet.[12491]
