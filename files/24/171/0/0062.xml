THIS DOCUMENT 13 THIS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMHIC MAJESTY&apos; S government .NMEHT..,.GABIOI.. HCjff..... AFFAIRS   .committee . LOBDON QUINQffBNNIAL VALUATION.KIMOflUMHBt BY THE MINISTER OF HSALTH. .OT . &quot;     OopyTf o^JTJ^.61(25).I desire to obtain the authority of the Home Affairs Committee for the introduction of a Bill to amend the Third Schedule of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869.In London, whioh in this respect differs from the country generally, the Valuation List for the time being in force ia conclusive evidence not only of the rateable value, but alao, for the purposes of Income Tax Schedule A, of the gros3 value of the several hered-itaments included therein As the percentage or rate of deduction from the gross value to the rateable value for the purposes of the 1869 Act cannot exceed the amounts prescribed in the Third Schedule to that Act, it follows that an increase of gross value necessarily involve! an lnorease in the rateable value under the existing statutory provision,At the last Quinquennial Valuation in 1920, the 40$ increase in the rents of house property subject to the Kent Restrictions Acts had not taken effect, and the gross and rateable values remained at the 1915 level.     In the forthcoming Valuation, however, the gross value should be Increased by the full 40$ (otherwise actual rent income would continue to escape taxation), and as under the Rent Restrictions Acts any increase in the rates for the time being payable by the landlord can be passed on by him to the tenant, the result, in the absence of the legislation which I propose, would be that the out-goings, in the shape of rent plus rates, of the tenants of the rent restricted house property mould be substantially increased,In these circumstances the Assessment Authorities of the Metropolis- are pressing for an increase in the
maximum rate of deductIon,, allowed &quot;by -^lua--T!hird. .S6hetinle-o --the Act of 1869, and aa the result of a series of conferences with, their representatives, a scheme has been devised which on the one hand removes any inducement to the Assessment Authorities to keep down the gross values of the properties in question, and on the other hand provides a generous scale of deduction for the purpose of arriving at the rateable value of these properties.The Bill, of which a copy Is appended, proposes to secure this twofold object -(a) vay substituting for the deductions prescribed in the Act of 1869, a scale of deductions, set out in Part 1of the Schedule, which follows the Income Tax (Schedule A.) deductions, and(b) by prescribing in Part 2 of the Schedule a more, generous scale, and providing that where the gross value Increased by 40$ and reduced in accordance with this more generous scale would produce a lower i*ateable value than (a) above would give, the rateable value may be reduced to that lower level.Proviso (b) deals with certain special cases which are mentioned in the proviso, and gives the Assessment Authorities a fre   hand in these cases to apply such a rate of deduction   as they may think equitable within the limits prescribed by Part 2 of the Schedule.Sub-clause (2) represents a further concession, viz,, that of allowing the lower pound instead of the higher to be taken in any case where the amount of the rateable value includes a fraotion of a pound,It will be observed that the Bill is made applicable only to the forthcoming Quinquennial Valuation,(Intld,) N.C,inistry of Health,February 6th., 1925,
