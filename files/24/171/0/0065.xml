SEOKET.3.P.64(35)(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).CABINET.H orae ^ Af fa 1 r a 0 cyril i 11 e e. GUARDIANSHIP OP INFANTS BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Bills on this subject more introduced in 19S0/21/22 and 23, but although the Bills of 1922 and 1923 were referred to Joint Committees of the two Houses the Committees failed to come to any agreement and no progress was made.      In 1924 a Bill substantially similar to its predecessors was introduced by Mrs. Wintringham in the House of Commons and after being welcomed by a large number of speeches from every side of the House received a second reading without a division on the 4th April,  1924.The Bill as drafted was, however, open to serious objections. It proposed -Olause,^^ to establish on a footing of absolute equality the rights and obligations of father and mother In regard to tha guardianship of their children;    and to enable any matter in dispute to be brought within the purview of the Courts.Clauses 4 and 5 to provide for the making of Orders of custody and maintenance in respect of children whose parents are living together.Clause 7 to provide for the attachment of wages.As regards Clause (3) while no objection was seen to placing husband and wife on an equal footing in matters which as the law stands could be brought before a Court it was thought that a provision allowing them to bring beforn a Court any question however trivial that might be in die put r. between them could not fail to te subversive of family life and in ma?iy cases to place an impossible task on the Judges.Qjlauses j4 and 5.      Similar - objection was felt to a. provision
which would enable a wifo while still living with her husband to obtain an Order for payment of money which could only bo enforced in the laBt resort by seizure of the property of the home,  or imprisonment of the husband, who would normally be the wage earner. I)Clause 7.      It was felt that a provision for attachment of wages would be highly controversial and best excluded from the Bill.As a result of a series of Conferences with Mrs. Wintringham and hor supporters agreement was reached on a draft Bill.The promoters while stating plainly that the Bill did not go as far as they wished accepted it as a useful measure &quot;of reform and undertook not to put down any amendments but to lend their support to the Government in securing its passage as an agreed measure.The Bill which obtained a Third Reading in the House of Lords without any serious amendment begins by a preamble declaring the expediency of extending tho principle of equality in law between the Soxes, which was established for certain purposes by the Sex Disqualification (Removal)   .-Act.,  1919, and other enactments to the sphere of domestic relationships.Difficulties arise in the application of this principle to particular problems- but the   Bill is an attempt to solve these difficulties in the application of the principle to the guardianship of infants and the rights and obligations conferred thereby.Clause (7), provides as regards England and Wales that the Court of Summary * Jurisdiction shall be added to the . County Court and High Court for the purpose of dealing with certain types of application under the Bill, andClause 7  (4 and 5) deals with the enforcement of Orders for&apos; payment of money made by Summary Courts.
The governing provision of tho Bill can bo simply stated.      It provides for absolute equality as between father and mother in any cases that might come before the Courts under the existing law touching the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the applioa-tion of the income thereof.      In all such oases the Court is to have rogard solely to the welfare of the infant without taking into consideration a claim for superiority of the mother over the father or of the father over the mother. The Bill does not, like previous Bills, attempt to enlarge the Bcope of possible litigation in domestic matters arising between husband and wife.      The matters in which and the processes by which a judicial decision may be sought will remain the same as at present.      Tho evidence given before the Joint Select Committee of 1982 and 1923 shewed that weighty criticism could be directed against any proposal to enable parents to bring before a Court any question however -trivial that might be in dispute between them.Secondly the Bill confers on a mother the same rights of applying to a Court in matters affecting an Infant as are possessed now by the father..The third principle of the Bill is that contained in Clause 3 and is perhaps the only contentious feature of the Bill.      Under the existing law (Section 5 of the Guardian-ship of Infants Act, 1886) a Court has power upon the application of the mother of an infant to make such order as it may think fit regarding the custody of the infant, and the right of access thereto of either parent and in every case may make such order respecting the costs of the mother and the liability of the father for the same or otherwise as to costs as the Court may think just.      Previous Bills have proposed to extend this power of the Court so as to
enable a wife while still living with her husband to obtain, an order for payment of money whioh oould only be enforced in the last resort by seizure of the property of the home or imprisonment of the husband who would normally be the wage earner.      Such a proposal is open to (serious objections.      The present Bill proposes an amendment of the existing law enabling a wife to obtain an order for custody and maintenance while still resident with her husband but providing that such an order shall not be enforceable while she is residing with him. Such an order can of course only be obtained if the husband has been in some respect in default but the Bill proceeds upon the view that while an order for custody or maintenance cannot In practice be enforced during consortium without destroying the sanctity of domestic life it is unduly burdensome to require the mother actually to separate from her husband before sho can take any steps to have her rights determined by ^application to the Courts. ^C-IL/&quot;&apos;&apos;    The only remaining provision of the. Bill to whichspecific reference need be made is that giving the mother of an infant the same power as is now possessed by the father to appoint a guardian by deed or will in the event of her death.There are other provisions dealing mainly with machinery and one relatively unimportant provision dealing with the consents necessary to the marriage of an infant.It seems clear.from the prolonged discussions that took place that the Bill represented the absolute minimum necessary to secure anything like agreement -in the last House of Commons, and,  in view of the statement containod in the Conservative Party&apos;s Election Manifesto that &quot;equal rights should be ensured to women in the guardianship of children&quot;, and of the attitude of other parties as disclosed by the Speeches on the Second Reading of Mrs. Wintringham&apos; s Bill,  it seoms frighl^-
vbusfc^that early steps should be taken to give effect to tho compromise arrived at and avert tho danger which might result from a renewal of the agitation for a more radical amendment of the law, though I am bound to say that I am notin favour of some of the provisions of the Bill.&apos;     - &apos; 11W.
