This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1925.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 16 (25).CABINET.DEFENCE OF IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. THE Cabinet Committee appointed by Mr. Bonar Law recommended upon the 23rd March, 1923 (CP. 167 (23)) that &quot;the period within which our mandatory relations with Iraq and expenditure on that country should be brought to an end should be at the longest four years from the date of ratification of the Turkish Peace Treaty.&quot; As the Treaty was ratified upon the 29th July, 1924, several months of tnis four years period have already elapsed. When my colleagues remember that the Cairo Conference accepted 20 years as the period for the continuance of the Imperial garrison, they will realise the need for quick action if in so short a time as four years Iraq is to be put into a position to maintain order and to defend its own frontiers. It is because I have realised the urgency of the question that I have from almost the day of the issue of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report pressed for the carrying out of certain conditions that in the view of the Air Staff are essential if we are to withdraw the Imperial forces within a reasonable time or even to make gradual reductions in their strength.2. The principle upon which Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s Cabinet came to this decision, and upon which the Air Staff has attempted to act, was the gradual substitu-tion over a period of years of local defence forces for the Imperial garrison. The Chief of the Air Staff gave a tentative estimate as to how this principle might be carried out in his paper of the 15th February, 1923 (I.R.Q. 38), in which he presupposed three necessary conditions, namely : &quot; (a.) That a satisfactory peace is concluded with Turkey before the 1st April, 1923; and&quot;&apos;(&amp;.) That a stable policy is decided on forthwith to govern our relations with Iraq, providing definitely for the continuance of a measure of British control; and&quot; (c.) That Iraq revenues provide sufficient funds for the maintenance of an efficient Arab Army or the formation of additional levies, or a combination of these two measures.&quot;&quot;If these three assumptions are not fulfilled,&quot; continued Sir Hugh Trenchard, &quot;particularly if there is any delay as regards (a) and (&amp;), it should be. clearly understood that the whole programme will be proportionately set back.&quot;3. Not one of these three conditions has been fulfilled. The peace with Turkey was not ratified until the 29th July, 1924, stability cannot be attained whilst the Mosul frontier question is still open and the last 12 months have not seen any material improvement in the efficiency of the Arab Army, whilst, according to Sir Henry Dobbs&apos; telegram (No. 643) of the 8th December, they have witnessed a serious deterioration in Iraq resources for supporting it.4. This triple failure to obtain the conditions upon which the four years&apos; plan was based makes it more than ever necessary to re-examine the situation and to remove without delay any obstacles that stand in the way of the establishment of Iraq as a self-supporting State.5. I need not dilate upon the two first conditions presupposed by the Chief of the Air Staff, namely, peace with Turkey and the establishment of stable conditions. As to peace with Turkey, the frontier incidents of last autumn seem to show that the Turks have no intention of involving themselves in war with the British Empire, and that the 8 Squadrons of Royal Air Force and the other units now in Iraq are fully [12509] B
capable of dealing with Turkish raids or Turkish bluff. As to the frontier, I must assume for the purpose of this memorandum that the League of Nations Commission does not alter it to our substantial detriment, for obviously the return of the Turks to the Mosul Vilayet would completely change the whole situation.6. It is rather with the third condition that I wish to deal at length, namely, &quot; that Iraq revenues provide sufficient funds for the maintenance of an efficient Arab Army or the formation of additional levies, or a combination of these two measures.&quot; For here is a condition that is mure directly within our control than the question of either peace with Turkey or frontier delimitation, and a question that is insolubly connected both with the carrying out of the Mandate and the liquidation of British commitments. Is an efficient Arab Army being formed, and is it being formed at a sufficiently speedy rate to be able to take over the maintenance of order and the defence of the country in July 1928 at the end of the four-years&apos; period ? My answer, supported by the views of the Air Staff, the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq and Air-Marshal Sir John Salmond, to this double question is a very definite no. The Arab Army, although its appearance is smarter and its discipline better, is no nearer taking over the defence of the country than it was a year ago, and, unless drastic changes are made without delay, it will be little nearer in 1928. If, therefore, things go on as they are going on now, we shall be faced in 1928 with the same dilemma that faced us in 1923, namely, the continuance of heavy and unpopular commitments or the surrender of the country to chaos and foreign intrigue.If this dilemma is to be avoided, no time must be lost in setting up local forces in Iraq adequate both in numbers and in efficiency to take over in due course from the Imperial garrison the services of Iraq security.7. At present the strength of the Imperial forces in the country is that contemplated at the Cairo Conference and approximately identical with that accepted by the Cabinet Committee, namely, 8 Royal Air Force Squadrons, 1 white battalion, 3 Indian battalions, 1 pack battery and 4 armoured car companies. It is in respect of the local forces that there is a serious deficiency in the scale accepted both at Cairo and by the 1923 Committee. Instead of the 15,000 men needed for the army and the levies, there are only about 10,000 men in all, the army being short of about 2,000 men and the levies 2,500. Up to the present, therefore, the Imperial garrison has, in spite of the Turkish raids and the delay with the Peace and the settlement of the frontier, been reduced almost according to schedule. A point has, however, now been reached when, as a result of the failure to develop the local forces, no further reduction beyond a pack battery and an armoured car company is practicable for some time to come. Indeed, it may be affirmed that, unless definite progress can be swiftly made with the improvement of the local forces, no substantial reduction in the Imperial garrison can be effected until the time arrives when all the Imperial units will be simultaneously withdrawn. It will, therefore, be seen that the key to the position is the efficiency of the local forces.8. The local forces are at present divided into two organisations, the Arab Army,&quot; paid out of Iraq revenues and commanded by Iraq officers, and the Iraq levies (mainly Assj^rians) paid by the British taxpayer and commanded by British officers. The continuance of this dyarchy is contemplated under the Military and Financial Agreements signed between the British and Iraq Governments on the 30th April, 1923. The effect of it is to create a constant British demand for the disbandment of the levies, or at least for their transference to the Iraq Army, where their cost will be met by the Iraq and not the Btritish taxpayer. Militarily, however, the weakening of the levies would delay still further the creation of a self-supporting Iraq defence force. For not only are the Assyrians better fighters than the Iraquis, but the levies have. the predominating advantage of being commanded by British officers. Air-Marshal Sir John Salmond, who had unique opportunities of judging the respective merits of the army and the levies, informs me that it is to the second difference, namely, the training and command by British officers, that he chiefly assigns their superiority over the Arab units. The problem, therefore, as I see it, is not to increase one or other of the two local forces, but to bring them both together up to a strength of not less than 14,000 men with as little delay as possible and upon conditions that are likely to make them both equally efficient without penalising the Iraq Treasury.9. The first and essential condition is the introduction of British officers into the Iraq Army and the appointment of a senior British officer to executive command of that Army.   Without a British Commander and an infusion of British officers in
[12509]its units, there is not, in my view, the least chance of the Arab Army becoming efficient or of the Imperial forces ever being able safely and honourably to evacuate the country. The British Commander would of course be responsible to the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq.10. The second condition is some alteration in the present arrangements for British grants to Iraq defence. Under the Military and Financial Agreements Great Britain undertakes certain diminishing liabilites towards the expense of Iraq defence. One of the stipulations in this connection is that King Feisal shall be militarily and financially responsible for the Iraq Army and that no British contribution shall be made towards its maintenance. I am convinced that this stipulation is retarding the development of the local defence forces. As Commander-in-Chief of the Arab Army, Feisal is not anxious for British intervention in its affairs, whilst, as King of Iraq, faced with heavy internal commitments and the excessive burden of the Ottoman debt, he is averse from increasing Iraq expenditure upon security at a time when there is likely to be a considerable Budget deficit. I have come to the conclusion that the only way to meet Feisal&apos;s susceptibilities and to overcome the Iraq opposition that is sure to be mobilised against any idea of British military control is to devote a comparatively small amount of the savings that upon the assumption of a more efficient local defence we can make in the Imperial garrison, to the payment of the British officers in Arab units. Feisal has already agreed in principle to the introduction of British officers in three units, but, although the arrangement was accepted twelve months ago, nothing has been done to carry it into effect. I urge that we should now take up with him the wider question of the creation of a British Commander and of the introduction of British officers into all units. Only by offering some financial inducement are we likely to obtain the voluntary assent of the Iraq Government to such an arrangement, and only by insisting upon this policy shall we be able to carry out gradual reductions in Imperial expenditure and eventually to liquidate altogether our financial commitments in Iraq.11. At a Conference held at the Colonial Office between Mr. Amery and myself it was agreed that the Chief of the Air Staff and I should immediately prepare proposals on the lines that I have suggested. I am, accordingly, circulating this memorandum, to which I have annexed two Appendices. Appendix I is a table showing in comparative form the garrisons in French Syria and Iraq. It will be seen that the French are needing as many air squadrons as we have in Iraq and, in spite of recent large reductions, five times as many regular troops for holding a country considerably less in size and much more manageable in situation. Appendix II contains the more detailed recommendations of the Chief of the Air Staff.12. The Cabinet will note that Sir Hugh Trenchard&apos;s scheme covers a period up to 1930-31. The non-fulfilment of the three conditions that were the basis of the 1923 recommendations has necessitated this postponement of the period of evacuation by about two years. Even so the six years contemplated is short in comparison with the twenty years accepted at the Cairo Conference and with the adequate fulfilment of the responsibility of setting up self-supporting local forces.13. If the present Cabinet take the view that the Imperial forces will never evacuate Iraq then I admit that the question of the local forces becomes unimportant and that it might be possible to ease Iraq finances by reducing rather than increasing their strength. If, however, the Bonar Law Cabinet view is accepted, namely, that a period is to be allowed for the formation of local defence forces and that when these defence forces are efficient the Imperial garrison is to be withdrawn, I desire to emphasise the urgent need of making the Arab units as efficient as we can in the shortest possible time. The Chief of the Air Staffs proposals show the lines upon Avhich with this end in view we ought to be working.S. H.,Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry, January 14, 1925.

In view of the Colonial Office Conference on the 17th December with reference to the defence of Iraq, I now submit the draft scheme. I must emphasise that this scheme has not been discussed with the High Commissioner in Iraq, the Air Officer Commanding, the Colonial Office, or the War Office. It is simply a basis upon which we can work if His Majesty&apos;s Government decide that something must be done. It is drawn up in the same way as the scheme I drew up at Cairo and I hope it will be as near the mark.2. As I have already foreshadowed, the Imperial expenditure in Iraq will not end with the treaty period, even if this scheme is approved. In fact I do not consider that any very considerable reduction in the Imperial Garrison is possible until the end of the present treaty period.* If the scheme is put into operation now and the leavening of the Iraq Army with British officers begins by April 1925, I feel that a reduction of one infantry battalion, probably the British, two squadrons of aero-planes and one armoured car company would be possible during the course of the next three years.3. It would be necessary in the scheme I propose to extend the treaty period because part of the Imperial Garrison will have to stay in the country for a period of between one and two years after the present treaty period terminates. Even then the withdrawal of the Imperial Forces would not terminate Imperial expenditure in Iraq as it is proposed that a grant-in-aid be paid to Iraq for several years on a gradually reducing scale. The sum payable for the first three years after the complete withdrawal of the Imperial troops would be in the neighbourhood of  840,000.4. I attach a table (Appendix IIa) showing the course of expenditure on Iraq Defence for the period 1925 to 1931 under this scheme. This table, in conjunction with the notes which follow, gives the general outline of the scheme. No definite details can be given till the authorities in Iraq and other Departments give their expert criticism, but I feel that no change in principle should be necessary.* Treaty period ends July 29, 1928.
5. The scheme is based on the following main principles :  (a.) Defence Forces.(i.) The total armed forces of Iraq, exclusive of police, to be not less than 14,000 before the Imperial garrison is withdrawn.(b.) British, Officers.(i.) British Officers are to be employed in executive roles in all the units of the Iraq Army on the following scale : - !Cavalry Regiment  .1 Commanding Officer. 1 Adjutant.3 Squadron Commanders.Infantry Battalion 1 Commanding Officer. 1 Adjutant.4 Company Commanders.Pack Battery 1 Commanding Officer. 1 Adjutant.(ii.) Engagement.They should be engaged for a period of 5 years, with the option of extending by one year periods subject to agreement between the Iraq Government- and the Imperial Government.(iii.) Pay.His Majesty&apos;s Government to be responsible for their pay, which should be on the present Levy scale. This responsibility to continue so long as the Imperial Government pays anything towards Iraq Defence expenditure, after which all contracts are to terminate automatically. .. Any renewal of contract should then be made between the Iraq Government and the officers themselves, subject to the consent of the British authorities concerned.(iv.) Command.In no case are British Officers to be subordinate to Iraqi Officers in matters of command and discipline.(c.) British G.O.C.(i.) A British Commander to be appointed to the Iraq Army, when the first British Officers are put into executive command of units. This officer to be responsible under the Air Officer Commanding for co-ordinating the whole scheme and for the welfare of the British Officers.(d.) Arab Officers.All existing Arab Officers to be retained and new officers to be trained, by a slower and more complete course, for the new units.(e.) Iraq Levies.The Iraq Levies to be transferred to the Iraq Government in about two years&apos; time, as follows :- (i.) Arab Infantry Battalion to Iraq Army on Iraq Army scale of British. Officers.(ii.) The two Cavalry Regiments, Pack Battery and Assyrian Infantry Battalions, with their present scale of Officers and British N.C.Os., to be transferred as a Frontier Force on special rates of&quot; pay.To enable the transfer of the Assyrians to be carried out successfully, it will be necessary to settle the whole Assyrian Community within Iraq as a contented body.[12509] B 3
Employment of British Officers.     &apos;,&apos;6. The status of the British Officers will require careful consideration. I suggest that they should have local ranks corresponding with the same rank as that held by the Arab Officers occupying the position they take over.They should be responsible to, and controlled by, the British Commander through the British unit Commanders.In every unit each British Officer should have an Arab Officer of the same or junior rank attached to him personally and the two will, work together in the closest touch, the British Officer handing over to the Arab Officer at convenient times to increase the latter&apos;s command, initiative and sense of responsibility. Should the British Officer be absent on leave or duty his Arab Officer would normally take command of the unit. Minor adjustments regarding any junior British Officers would be necessary.During operations the British Officers would be in command, but as time goes on the unit could be handed over to the Arab Officers, the British Officers acting as advisers.The system proposed will require considerable tact on the part of the British Officers, and therefore great care should be taken to select officers who are genuinely interested and who understand the British Policy towards Iraq. A knowledge of the country, customs and language would be very valuable.Cost of Proposed Scheme. . -7. The approximate cost of the proposed scheme is set out in detail in Appendix (Ha), but I should like to draw attention to one or two points.Percentage of Revenue for Defence.The first point is the percentage of revenue which the Iraq Government pays for defence. The provision for defence expenditure at present included in the Iraq Budget is approximately 23 per cent, of the total revenue, but I understand that the whole sum voted for defence will not be spent this year. I have shown the provision for defence to be met by the Iraq Government as 21 per cent, of the total revenue on its present basis up to the end of 1927-28., After 1927-28 I have shown an increase in the amount to be paid by the Iraq Government. These increases may involve some curtailment in the expenditure on the Civil administration, but can be fully justified on the ground that in a country like Iraq defence expenditure must form, the primary charge on revenue.On the other hand, revenue may, and I hope will, increase, or other avenues of saving may be opened in future and so lessen the proportionate burden of defence expenditure on Iraq and permit of an even larger contribution being paid with a corresponding reduction in Imperial expenditure.Conscription.In this connection I must emphasise that my figures are all based on a voluntary army. If conscription&apos;were introduced, and it seems quite probable that it may be, the figures shown in Appendix (Ha) would be open to considerable reduction, and this would lower still further the amount of the grant-in-aid required from. Imperial Funds.Actual Operation of Scheme.8. The actual operation of the scheme would be as follows :  (a.) At present the combatant local forces, Levies and Iraq Army combined, number approximately 10,000.   These ,are to be raised to not less than 14,000, exclusive of police, before the Imperial Garrison is finally withdrawn.1st Year. , .(&amp;.) During 1925-26 the Iraq Army would be increased by one Infantry Battalion with British Officers.In addition, two of the existing Iiaq Army battalions, one Pack Battery and one Cavalry Regiment would be given British Officers. The British Commander and his staff would be added as soon as the scheme starts. Some of the existing British Liaison Officers would probably be available, as these officers would not be required in their present positions. . , -Towards the end of 1925-26 one Squadron of aircraft would be withdrawn.
During 1925-26 a small grant-in-aid to Iraq may be necessary. At the end of 1925-26 the figures would be : (i.) Iraq Army and levies ...       ...       ...       ...   10,894(ii.) British Officers in Iraq Army        ...       ..,       ... 30(iii.) British Officers in Iraq levies        .......       ... 722nd Year.(c.) During 1926-27 British Officers would be put into the remaining units of the Iraq Army on the scale suggested.Towards the end of the year one Infantry Battalion&apos;, probably the British one, and one Armoured Car Company would be withdrawn.During this year a small grant-in-aid to Iraq may be necessary. The 1926-27 figures would be approximately :  (i.) Iraq Army and levies (unchanged; combatant)     ...   10,894 (ii.) British Officers in Iraq Army        ...       ...       ... 64(iii.) British Officers in Iraq levies        ...      ...      ... 723rd Year.(d.) On the 1st April, 1927, the Iraq Army and Iraq levies would be amalga-mated under one command and the expenditure, except the cost of British Officers, met from Iraq funds, which would, however, be supplemented by a grant-in-aid from Imperial funds for the whole Iraqi defence forces and not solely for the trans-ferred levies. The Iraq levies, less the Arab Infantry Battalion which would go into the Iraq Army as the 7th Infantry Battalion, would be renamed the Iraq Frontier Force and would be maintained as such on special rates of pay with their present scale of British Officers.Towards the end of the year the Imperial Garrison would be reduced by a second Squadron of aircraft.During 1927-28 the figures would be approximately : (i.) Iraq Army and Iraq Frontier Force (combatants) ...     10,725* (ii.) British Officers in Iraq Defence Forces ... ...        1344tth Year: End of Present Treaty Period.(e.) On the 29th July, 1928, the present Treaty Period comes to an end. Towards the end of 1927-28 and early in 1928-29 the Iraq Army would be increased by one Battery (the 5th) and one Cavalry Regiment (the 4th), each with British Officers.&apos;During 1928-29 the figures would be approximately : (i.) Iraq Army and Iraq Frontier Force (combatants) ...    11,395 (ii.) British Officers in Iraq Defence Forces ... ...        1415th Year: 1st Year after Present Treaty Period.&apos;(/.) Towards the end of 1928-29 and early in 1929-30 the Iraq Army would be increased by three Infantry Battalions (the 8th, 9th and 10th) and one Battery (the 6th), all with British Officers.During this year the remainder of the Imperial Garrison would be withdrawn.During 1929-30 the figures would be approximately  -(i.) Iraq Army and Iraq Frontier Force (combatants) ...     13,651 (ii.) British Officers in Iraq Defence Forces ... ...        161Qth Year: 2nd Year after Present Treaty Period.Towards, the end of 1929-30 and early in 1930-31 the Iraq Army would be increased by one Infantry Battalion (the 11th) and one Pack Battery (the 7th), with British Officers.The figures would then be approximately : (i.) Iraq Army and Iraq Frontier Force (combatants) ...     14,527 (ii.) British Officers in Iraq Defence Forces ... ...        169Summary of Assumptions on which Scheme is Based.9. In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that the whole scheme is based on the following assumptions, and, should any of these assumptions prove incorrect, the scheme will have to be amended accordingly : * This figure 10,725 is lower than the figure in 1926-27, as the Arab Levy Battalion would be reduced to Iraq Army Establishment on transfer.
January 1925.Summary of Assumptions.(1.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to remove the Imperial troops from Iraq as soon as possible without prejudicing the present policy ofmaking Iraq entirely a self-governing country. (2.) That the Frontiers of Iraq will be settled before the 31st December, 1925,without serious modification in the present position. (3.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government pay a grant-in-aid to Iraq for defence purposes in addition to paying for the British Officers.  This means thatafter the withdrawal of the Imperial Garrison the Imperial expenditure will be approximately  840,000. (4.) That British Officers are in executive control of all units in the Iraq Armyby the 1st October, 1926.I attach Appendix (IIa).

All figures are approximate.2. It is anticipated that new units will start forming towards the end of the financial year immediately preceding the year in which they are shown, but no financial provision has been made for this in the table as it is assumed that the additional expenditure will be inconsiderable.notes (see figures in body of table).(a.) It has been assumed that the actual expenditure on the Iraq army in 1924-25 will be approxi-mately  700,000.(b.)  715,000 represents 21 per cent, of the present Iraq revenues.(e.) These increased amounts ( 800,000,  850,000 and  950,000) have been put in as it is considered that Iraq should pay more towards defence in the future as a result of saving in other directions, e.g., Civil Adminis-tration.(d.) Introduction of conscription reduc-tion of Iraq&apos;s share of Ottoman Debt and saving in cost of Civil Administration would help to decrease Imperial grant-in-aid as Iraq would have more money to spend on defence.8 4
