13DOCUMfiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ). 56 (25):CABINET.HO ME   APPA IRS    C om IT TE S.SANDWICH PORT   AND HAVEN BILL,  1925Memorandum by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The Port of RIchborough we s constructed by the War Office (under the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by the Defence of the Realm Acts) within the Statutory Limits of the Sandwich Haven Authority as established by the Sandwich Haven and Improvement Act, 1847.     This action on the part of the War Office was equivalent to the assumption by the Government owing to war necessity of almost all the functions of the Haven Authority,     That Authority, however, continued to own and operate a small wharf, known as the Town Wharf, which is situated higher up the Haven than the Government wharves at Richborough.The Port of Richborough was created solely to meet special war requirements, and was in no sense&apos; the outcome of Industrial development in East Kent0     Nevertheless, the expenditure Incurred was amply justified during the period of hostilities.     More than 2,000,000 tons of stores, materials, guns, etc. were shipped from the Port to Dunkirk, Calais and Dieppe, and after the Armistice the Disposal Board evacuated through Richborough for sale in England enormous quantities of surplus material, mechanical transport and railway rolling stock.The subsequent administration of the Port could not be regarded as. economically satisfactory because the Government had no powers to levy dues on ships and cargoes,T*    1
These dues were taken by the Sandwich Haven Authority,In   arch 1921, the Disposal Board sold the Port as a going concern to the Port of Queenborough Development Company Limited, and this firm immediately concluded an agreement with the Sandwich Corporation under which the parties agreed jointly to present a Bill to Parliament to a^end the Act of 1847 by a new Act providing for a joint Board of Control and for a revision of the already out-of-date schedule of dues.     This Bill, known as the Sandwich Port and Haven Bill 1922, was allowed to lapse because the Queenboroiigh Company were unable to implement their contract.      In July,  1923, the Government accepted a rescission of the Contract and re-entered into possession.By this time the position as regards the Sandwich Haven Authority had become still more unsatisfactory. Cargoes (almost entirely privately owned) amounting to approximately- 50,000 tons a 7/ear were being dealt with at the Government wharves;   the Government were compelled to expend money on dredging, buoying and general maintenance of the Haven and works, and all the time shippers and ship-owners were pa7fing vessel and cargo dues not to the Government but to the Haven Authority,     The whole situation was examined de novo,   with the help of the advice of an eminent and independent docks engineer.     Regard being had to the acquisition of mineral rights,.boring operations and coal shaft sinkings around Richboreugh by Messrs.Pearson and Dorman Long and Company, Limited,  it was apparent that any commercial prosperity at Richborough in the near future would be entirely dependent upon the development of industry in the vicinity.     Negotiations were accordingly opened with the Sandwich Corporation for the promotion of a new
Bill to regularise the control of the Haven, and, concurrently with Messrs. Pearson &amp; Dorman Long for-the leasing or sale to them of the Government&quot;s interests in Richborough.The negotiations with Messrs. Pearson and Dorman Long have now matured.      The Company are buying the Port on the understanding that the Government will promote and pass a measure on the lines of the Sandwich Port and Haven Bill 1922, to secure to the purchasers fl) equal represent? tion with the Sandwich Corporation on a joint Board of Haven Commissioners and (2)    the right in perpetuity to cross the main Runsgate-S^ndwich Road with certain Railways on the level.     A copy of the Draft Bill is attached, and as at present drawn it has the -support Of the Sandwich Corporation.Messrs. Pearson &amp; Dorman Long enter into possession of the Port under licence on 16th February, 1925,      IfF however, the Government cannot obtain the Royal Assent to this measure by 31st January, 1926, the purchasers will then have the right to rescind the Contract, and the Government will have to face the alternatives either of operating the Port as a Government or quasi-Government undertaking (which will involve the necessity of legisla-tion and probably an annual loss in running the Port),  or ef breaking up the Port and sacrificing the bulk of the assets at prices probably far below normal scrap value. It will be seen therefore that it is essential that the Bill should become law this year and I accordingly ask for authority to introduce the Bill at once with a view to its passage through Parliament before the Summer recess.(Intd) W.G,Treasury Chambers, 4th IvUrch,  1925.
