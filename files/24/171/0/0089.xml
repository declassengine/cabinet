THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF EIo BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&amp; GOVERNMENT. -CABINET. HOME AFFAIRo COMMITTEE*i &apos;4  ..^m HOtFoING AND TOWN PLANNING CONSOLIDATION BILLS.I desire to ask for authority to introduce in the House of Lords the Housing and Town Planning Consolidation Bills &quot;which were before Parliament last session and which were only prevented from becoming law by the dissolution in November.The Housing Bill is identical with the Bill which, after con-sideration by the Joint Select Committee on Consolidation Bills, passed through the House of Lords last year and was read a first time in the House of Commons, except for the omission of one Clause&apos;which is now unnecessary in consequence of the abolition of inhabited house duty by the Finance Act, 1924, and for the addition of a new Clause which is necessary to give effect to the provisions which enable local authorities to make advances to private persons building houses;   these powers were first given by the Housing Act, 1925, for a limited period only, but were made permanent by the Act of 1924 after the Consolidation Bill had left the House of Lords,     In the case of the Town Planning Bill, there are no amendments of any kind and the Bill as introduced will be textually identical with that which was before Parliament last year,,It does not appear necessary in these circumstances that the two Bills should again be referred to the Joint Select Committee on Consolidation Bills, and I should hope therefore that the proceedings on the Sills would be merely formal.I am anxious that the two Bills should come into operation at the earliest possible date.     Theyjare being pressed for by local authorities throughout the country and by all Interested in the housing question.     The present state of the Housing Acts on the statute book ia quite indefensible and has been the subject of much adverse criticism in recent cases in the High Court.SECRET CP.  88(25)(Intldo) N.0,iniatry of Health, February 13th,  1925,
