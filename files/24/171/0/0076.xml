fo^TR DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).Sj^C R E T. CP. 75(25) .CABINET.ARBITRATION IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet the draft of a circular which It is proposed to Issue to Heads of Departments.The staff organisations of the Civil Service have now decided In favour of acceptance of the scheme of arbitration to which the Official Side of the Committee appointed to work out detailed arrangements had expressed their willingness to agree.     The way Is thus clear for giving effect to the general principle accepted by the Prime Minister almost two years ago.     The Court will be. the Industrial Court set up by the Industrial Courts Acts, 1919, and its Chairman will be the President of the Industrial Court, or the Chairman of a division of the Industrial Court, for the time being.     In addition, the tribunal for the Civil Service will include two members appointed to the Industrial Court by the Minister of Labour, one as representing the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the time being,  and the other drawn from a panel of persons appointed to the Industrial Court as representing the staff side of the National Whitley council I consider it essential that Instructions should be issued to Departments as to the procedure to be followed by them when the tribunal is established.     There have been cases in the past in which departmental authorities
in, discussing questions of remuneration affecting their own     staffs, have openly declared their willingness to make larger concessions than the Treasury were prepared to sanction.     Where such cases occur, even though there may he no appeal to arbitration,  the situation is sufficiently serious;    when a system of compulsory arbitration has been put Into force it becomes impossible.      I am sure my colleagues will agree that in dealing with claims which may be the subject of arbitration proceedings, overt differences of opinion on the official side must at all cost be avoided.W0 S.

Procedure in dealing with claims from Departmental Staffs relating to pay and conditions of service.Cabinet De clsi on.Sir,1.      I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to request you to invite the attention ofto the terms of Treasury Circular of even date,relating to the establishment of an Arbitration Court for the Civil Services    and to inform, him that in this connection His Majesty1 s Government have had under consideration at a Cabinet meeting held on the question of the procedure to be followed by Departments in dealing with claims from their staff for increased remuneration or improved conditions of service,2.      In conducting negotiations with their staffs on such matters Departments will appreciate that it is the Government as such which is represented in Court in the event of arbitration proceedings being instituted,3-    To ensure that full effect is on all occasions given to this principle, the following procedure will be observed in dealing with any proposals from Departmental Staffs affecting remuneration or conditions of service, viz:
(a) No statement will be made by Departmental representatives during the course of negotiations or at arbitration, which might be held to commit their Department to agreeing in or recommending a proposal requiring Treasiiry sanction, unless that proposal had been discussed and agreed with the Treasury.(b) Should a Department desire to accept, or to advance to its staff representatives, proposals which the Treasury is not prepared to sanction, the question at issue between the Department and the Treasury will be settled officially before any statement is made to the staff representatives;(c) In the case referred to in (b) above the official representatives will be the spokesmen of the decision so arrived at to their staffs;    and (where the dispute is referred to arbitration) before the Arbi trat i on Court.I am.Sir,Your obedient Servant,
