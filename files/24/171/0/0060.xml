This document ia the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government. 3^1SECRET. Copy No.   o printed for the Cabinet, February, 1925.C.P. 59 (35).THE CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.Restoration of Order in Ireland Act and Regulations.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.Mr. Talbot&apos;s Committee on the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act and Regulations      79 have recommended the immediate repeal of almost all the Regulations, and the repeal as    Homo from, say, the end of 1925 of the Act itself.   In making this recommendation they appear      16 to have considered only the case of the Irish Free State, where doubtless this Imperial Act and Regulations are, as the Committee say, out of place.I wish, however, to point out that there is in Northern Ireland a large body of British troops (5 battalions and ancillary services, or nearly 5,000 in all) for whom we, and not either of the Irish Governments, are responsible, and who might well have to intervene on our behalf to secure law and order in the event of trouble arising over, for instance, the report of the Boundary Commission. In effect, these troops might have to step in and keep the peace between the two contending parties.For this purpose the troops would want (a) powers (of billeting, taking land, closing roads and so on) more or less on the lines of some of our own D.O.R.A. regulations during the wrar, and (6) an indemnity for their actions ; such powers and indemnity should be guaranteed by the Imperial Government.The Act and the Regulations as they now stand secure exactly what is required in these respects, and, so long as there is no emergency, no question arises, i.e., they simply lie dormant until required.In the circumstances, I urge that for the present we should let matters alone, and take no steps to repeal the Act or cancel any of the Regulations.L. W.-E.The War Office,4th February, 1925.26/Ptg/364   100   2/25   W.O.P.   1700
