[THIS DOOUkjgilJ^^ MAJESTY&apos; S gOVBHlflCBBT t )SjLg. R E T.c.p. 5? (25).3CABINET.7PROPOSAL EOR^AE ADDITIONAL JUDGE Iff THE PROBATE DIVISION.Note by the Lord Chancellor.1. I have recently been compelled to review the state ofbusiness in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court, with special reference to the Admiralty work, and have reached the conclusion that it is necessary that measures should be taken for making a permanent addition to the judicial strength of that Division.2, The judicial strength of the Division, as constitutedby the Judicature Acts, consists of two Judges - the President (Lord Merrivale) and one puisne Judge (Mr. justice Hill).     During the period, now nearly 50 years, since the Supreme Court of Judicature was constituted, no addition has been made to this judicial staff.     During that period the population and wealth of England and Wales has increased enormously and the complexity of business transaction-tions has increased in perhaps a greater degree;    and these increases have naturally produced an increase in the work done by the Supreme Court.     Additions to the judicial strength of both the Chancery and King&apos;s Bench Divisions have been found necessary from time.to time;    but in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division the only relief which has been given has been furnished through the occasional sitting of some ex-Judge or other person who has held high judicial office, or by the temporary transfer of a Judge of the King&apos;s Bench Division.
3.     Meanwhile,  the increase in the work of the Division, as a whole, has been enormous.    The divorce work has shown a steady increase.    Taking the yearly average of petitions in quinquennia from just before the Judicature Act, 1875, up to 1913,  the average figures are:-1874	to	1878	56018 79	to	1883	5931884	to	1888	6841889	to	1893	6751894	to	1898	7751899	to	1903	8861904	to	1908	9301909	to	1913	1078Shortly before the War, new Rules came into operation affording facilities for litigation in the High Court to persons whose means had hitherto denied them opportunities for reliefs    The effect of these Rules as regards Chancery and EingTs Bench proceedings was slight.    But as regards divoroe proceedings, it was very great.    The number of petitions filed, which was 1,267 in 1913, increased in 1914 to 1,348, and rose from that figure until it reached 5,763 in 1919.      It is to be hoped that this last figure was a high water mark.    Since that year, the number has fallen to 5,184 in 1920; 3,464 in 1921; and 3,004 in 1922. Sinoe then it has shown) a slight rise to 3,212 in 1923, and a slight fall again in 1924, the full figures for which year are not yet availableaThe inference to be drawn from the figures appears to be that the effect of the War itself is now spent, but that we are left with a permanent block of work amounting to something like 3,000 divorce petitions in each year, producing for trial somewhere about 2,500 causes as against
916 in pre-war years, while out of this number some 250 are defended and some 2,250 undefended.    This represents an increase of cases to be tried over pre-war figures of about 800$ - the increase of defended oases being about 25$ and the increase in undefended about 250$.4.      Scarcely any means exist for relieving this pressure by such measures of devolution as have been applied in other Divisions of the High Court.    Proposals have from time to time been made for transferring the work or some part of the work tb the County Court.    The problems involved in the consideration of any such measure transcend any question of mere administration and touch matters involving the social life of the community.    It is unnecessary to discuss them here.    It is enough to say that though I am anxious to promote the decentralisation of the divorce work, I should regard the conferment of divorce jurisdiction upon the County Courts as disastrous, both to the administration of those Courts and to the public welfare.Statutory authority has been obtained whereby certain olasses of divoirce cases are tried on Circuit by the Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division.    The measures taken under this provision have relieved the Court of the trial of a number of undefended causes whioh may normally be expected to amount to between 800 and 900 in number.    Further progress on these lines is possible, and probably desirable,  in the interests both of the Court and of the litigant.    But it will never be possible to arrange for the trial of heavy defended causes on Circuit without producing more disorganisation in the Kingls Bench Division than is proportionate to the relief given to the Divorce Division.It must, therefore, be anticipated that the Judges of the Division will, as regards divorce alone, be faced per-manently with somewhere between twice and Z\ times the amount of work whioh had to be accomplished before the War-
5.     Meanwhile the Admiralty work, has also grown, though not in the same proportion as the divorce work, nor to the extent to which it would have grown if reasonable facili-ties had existed for its disposal.    The number of writs in Admiralty taken out in the year 1914 was 432.    The circumstances of the War produced a great increase in the number of shipping casualties.    The number of Admiralty proceedings rose rapidly, though with some fluctuations, and reached high water mark in 1917 with 911 writs, and in 1920 with 931*    Since then there has been a slight decline, due in part to the laying up of shipping, in part to the unwillingness of shipowners and underwriters to litigate in times of shipping depression, and in part also (it is to be feared) to the congested state of business of the Court, which has been such as to deny to the litigant any security for an expeditious trial at a fixed date. 6       litigation in Admiralty has many characteristics which differentiate it from litigation in the King&apos;s Bench. The sums of money involved are very great, and the increase in tonnage of modern ships makes them greater than was the oase in past years.    Furthermore,  the questions arising are primarily questions&apos; of fact, which can only be determined upon an examination of witnesses, and it is a commonplace that the testimony given by witnesses can best be weighed when they give evidence in open Court before the Judge trying the case, and not on commission.    Yet in the nature of things, the witnesses in shipping cases are engaged in a trade which requires their frequent and prolonged absence from London and indeed from the Kingdom.   Hence it is necessary, if justice is to be done, that dates should be fixed for the trial of the issues, that those dates should be fixed some time beforehand so that arrangements can be made to bring the witnesses home or keep them at home, and above all that those dates,  once fixed, should be adhered to.
7.     There is a further circumstance relevant to the consideration of these buestioris.   A national interest is involved,.    It has been said in truth that all those who are engaged in commerce upon the sea, whether shipowners, merchants, underwriters, captains,  or crews, look to the Admiralty Court to enforce the discipline of the sea.    The Court and its decisions have an importance whioh is far more than municipal,,    Shipowners from all over the world resort to the Court, even in cases when no British ship is involved in the collision or salvage operation.    The result is to bring a world-wide prestige to the Admiralty Court; and this country gains greatly both commercially and in reputation-tion by the common acknowledgment of the supremacy of that Court.    It is largely due to the reputation of the Court as a Court of Admiralty that its decisions as a Court of prize were accepted so readily by the world at large during the War; and the decisions of Lord Stowell during the Napoleonic Wars and of Sir Samuel Evans and Lord Sterndale during the late War rest for their acknowledged authority largely upon the repuation built up by the Court both before and after it became merged in the Supreme Court of Judicature. 8.     The vast increase in the divorce work of the Court had, even before the War, made it very difficult to deal with the Admiralty work promptly and at fixed timesc    The further increase caused by the War and the Poor Persons Rules caused a further disorganisation.    Efforts have been made continuously to meet the difficulty, both by lending a Judge from the King&apos;s Bench Division, and by the regular Judges of the Division undertaking more work and sitti-og for longer hours than are consistent with efficiency. The expedient of lending a Judge from the King&apos;s Benoh Division, though it has enabled the Court by great efforts^
to keep down the divorce work, is ineffectual to meet the evil as regards the Admiralty work.    For such a Judge can only be lent when he can be spared from the work of his own Division, and as the time when he will be so available cannot be foreseen in advance, dates cannot be fixed for the hearing of Admiralty causes.    The other expedient, that of imposing an undue amount of work upon the regular Judges of the Division^ has resulted in disaster.    The President suffered a serious breakdown in health during the Summer, was absent during the greater part of Trinity fittings, and was dialy able to return in October.    Mr. Justioe Hill broke down as scon as the Long Vacation began as a direct conse-quence of overwork.    He has not yet recovered, and it is doubtful when he will be able to resume his seat. 9*      I am satisfied that the time has now come when, as experience has amply proved, the permanent work of the Division requires a permanent staff of three Judges.    It may even be that occasions will arise in the future, as in the past,  when further assistance may be necessary.    If so, temporary help can again     be obtained from the King&apos;s Bench Division.    Statutory authority is necessary for this addition, and I propose that a provision enabling the appointment of a third ttudge be inserted in the Administra-tion of Justice Bill about to be introduced in the House of Lords.10.   Among the arguments adduoed in favour of the passing before Christmas of the resolution for the appointment of two additional Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division was the pressure of work in the Probate Division and the constantly recurring necessity for the loan of a Judge from the former Division to the latter.    Wo doubt criticism in Parliament upon the present proposal will be based upon this fact.   But the necessity for the two additional Judges of the  ing&apos;s Bench Division was apparent even without this argument; and
House of Lords.3rd February, 1925.it will be safe to assure Parliament that in considering, upon the occurrence of any future vacancy in the King&apos;s Benoh Division,  whether the vacancy should be filled, the additional provision now to be made will be taken into accounto11.    I should add that the present proposal has been re-peatedly pressed both upon myself and my predecessors.    It has the&apos;-support of Lloyds,  of the law Society, of the Chamber of Shipping,   the Chamber of Commerce, and the London Chamber of Commerce, and of all those engaged in shipping business, particularly in London and in Liverpool. 12.    The cost involved in the additional appointment will not be largeo    A suitable Court is available, and the existing staff will be able to cope with the work.    The remuneration of.the new Judge and his clerk (5,400) will be partly met by the increase of fees which is likely to follow on increased efficiency in the administration of justice; and if, when the present arrears in the King&apos;s Bench Division have been overtaken, it proves possible, owing to the change now proposed, to allow the number of Judges in that Division to fall to 16, the saving so effected will fully compensate for the expenditure now proposed.flntld,) C.
