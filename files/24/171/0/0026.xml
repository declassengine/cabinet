HIS .D001BOTT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERKIiSNT. 8RST.CABINET.ROM AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. 26 (25).POOR LAW EliERGENCY PROVISIONS CONTINUANCE (SCOTLAND) BILL. MSMORANDLli BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND,1.     I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Draft Bill which is required in connection with the administration of the Poor Law in Scotland, and I shall be glad to have authority to introduce it in Parliament at an early date.2.    Prior to 1921 poor relief in Scotland was not available to able-bodied neraons even though destitute.   In view of the very considerable amount of destitution due to unemployment then prevalent, parish councils, who administer noor relief, were instructed to provide relief to destitute able-bodied persons out of employment,&quot; and the statutory position was regularised by the Poor Law&apos; Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1321.   That Act, which was only a temporary provision, has been kept in force, with some amendments, bv subsequent Acta^ the last of which was the Poor Law Emergency Provisions Continuance Act of 1324, which prolongs the Act of 1921 until 15th May, 1925.As my colleagues will realise, the position in regard to unemployment is still sufficiently.serious to necessitate the con-tinuance of the Act of 1321 after 15th Hay next, and the draft Bill provides for this continuance for a further two years.3.    The Bill in addition makes one amendment of the existing provisions.   In Section 3 of the Local Authorities Emergency Provisions Actt 1323, by which the Act of 1921 was continued until May, 19 24, Parish Councils were authorised to make arrangements with other Local Authorities whereby applicants for relief might be given employment with the Local Authority on works of public utility instituted for the relief of unemployment, and the Parish Council might pay over the sum, which would otherwise have been provided by way bf relief, to the Local Authority.   That provision was   largely aa a result of pressure bv Labour Members, expressly declared to be applicable only where the Local Authority carried through the relief works by means of direct labour.   Representations have been received from mahv Parish Councils, including&apos;Parish Councils having a large number of Labour Members, that the power should apply also where the Local Authorities were carrying through the relief works by contract, and the Bill is drawn to meet this point.    At present nearly all the Local Authority relief schyiibs are being worked bv contract labour, so that, unless the amendment is made,&quot;very little use can be made of the existing provisions in the Act of 1923.&quot;JOHN GILMOUR&apos;.Scottish Office.21 at January, 1925
POOR LAW EMERGENCY PROVISIONS CONTINUANCE (SCOTLAND),   B I L L toextend further the duration of the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1921, and to amend certain provisions of that Act as amended by the Local Authorities (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1923, and the Poor Lav/ Emergency Provisions Continuance (Scotland) Act, 1924.Be it enacted, &amp;c:1.
