0 RET.CABINET,84(25).qSUMMER   TIME.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1,    1 desire to raise the question of altering the period of Summer Time in this and subsequent years,.2.    Summer Time in this country is at present regulated by the Summer Time Act of 1922.    Under it Summer Time begins on the day after the third Saturday in April (or,  if that is Easter Day,  a week earlier) and ends on the day after the third Saturday in September.    This gives a maximum period of 23 weeks (from 15th April to 21st September).    This year there will be 22 weeks (from 19th April to 20th September).3o    It is necessary to give some account of the history of Summer Time prior to the Act of 1922.4,    Summer Time was first introduced in 1916 and the Act of that year  (which was in force from 1916 until it lapsed in 1922) fixed Summer Time for 1916 from 21st May to 1st October,,  and gave power thereafter to prescribe the period for each year by Order in Council.    Thus up to 1923 the period was fixed each year by the Home Secretary as public policy and opinion seemed to demand. The only independent opinion which he had to guide him was the report of a Departmental Committee of 1917 which, after the experience of one year only,  recommended a period from the second Sunday in April to the third Sunday in September (23-24 weeks).5c    During the War years 1916-1918 a uniform period was imposed, by the Allies for military convenience.    In 1919-1921 the periods of Summer Time in this country were 26 weeks each year (approximately the months of April to September inclusive) except that in 1920 Summer Time was extended for 4 weeks to 25th October owing to the coal dispute.    Prance and Belgium however lengthened the period
with the result that serious difficulties and inconveniences began to be experienced in connexion with the navigation of ships and aircraft and the transport of passengers and mails.    In an endeavour to obviate these a conference was held in November 1921 between representatives of the Home Office and other Government Departments interested and representatives of the French and Belgian Governments.. It was then agreed to recommend a uniform period of Summer Time for the 3.countries, viz. from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October.    This was in fact a compromise,  being longer than the period recommended by the Departmental Oommittee of 1917 but shorter than the period of Summer Time  (from 15th March to 25th October) then in force in France, but the French Government consented to give up part of this period provided the British Summer Time was not less than 6 months and included the whole of September.    The period for 1922 was fixed in accordance with chis agreement.6.    A Bill to give effect to this agreement was introduced in the Lords and reached the Commons in June 1922.    The Bill met with great opposition from the agricultural interests,  and its supporters, who apparently failed to realise that they were in danger of losing Summer Time,  did.not exert themselves very ^effectually in its favour.7.    At the same time the course of events in France threw serious difficulties in the way of the Bill.    The French Government failed to carry the corresponding Bill which they introduced with the result that when the British Bill was before the House of Commons there was no legal authority in existence fir the continuance of Summer Time in France after 1922,  and no one could foresee what would happen.    This naturally rendered it more difficult for Mr. Shortt to resist the pressure of the representatives of agriculture for a shortened period of Summer Time in this country: and in moving the 2nd reading \he undertook before the Committee stage to try and come to an arrangement between the urban and agricultural interests as to the period to be fixed.    The period
.3.- . . 120finally inserted in the Bill was from the 3rd Saturday in April to the 3rd Saturday in September,  and this was accepted by the agricultural representatives in the House as a settlement.    The Bi.ll was also made an annual one.8,    Since that Act,  two. factors have arisen which appear to me to call for an alteration of the present period, viz.:-(l) Actual experience in 1923 of the shortened period of summer time led to widespread complaints from town-workers and the urban interests generally.    The cessation in the middle of September was particularly unpopular, as it fell in-the midst of a holiday month;    and it is lAnderstood that it was a matter of very great difficulty and inconvenience to,the railway companies to revise their time-tables while they were still busy with holiday traffic.    There is no doubt that there is a general demand that Summer Time should extend over the six months April to September.(2) The situation in Prance has also changed (and in this question Belgium follows the lead of Prance).    In May,  1923,  a Bill for the establishment of Summer Time was at last passed; and in July the French Government proposed a conference with a view to establishing uniformity between France, Belgium and Great Britain.    This was at once accepted by H.M. Government, but it was not until March 1924 that the Conference was actually held.    The British delegate was authorised to try to obtain uniformity with Prance and Belgium on the basis of an extension of British Summer-Time tc  the end of September,  or the beginning of October,  but it proved iinpossible to secure agreement without a short advancement of the commencing date. The Conference recommended&quot; a period from the first Saturday in April,(or if that coincided with Easter,  the last Saturday in March) to the first Saturday in October.9.    A private A1ember&apos;s Bill which proposed to make Summer Time permanent for the period recommended by this conference was introduced in the House of Commons by Sir Kingsley Wood who was backed by the Early Closing Association.    It obtained second
Reading on 11th April by 169 votes to 129,  in face of strong agricultural opposition.    It did not reach Committee until 17th July.    it was then taken up as a Government Bill, but in the course of 4 meetings of the Committee at intervals of a week,  two of which were abandoned for lack of a quorum,  the successful obstructive tactics of one or two champions of the agricultural interests prevented any substantial progress.    The recess supervened, and the Bill was not touched in the short Autumn session.10.    As regards the attitude of the representatives of agriculture,  it should be explained that,  when Mr. Bridgeman,  in November 1925, was pressed by a large and influential deputation to extend the period of Summer Time, he said that- he must ascertain the views of those who are opposed to.Summer Time, and must consult the Ministry of Agriculture.11.    Mr. Bridgeman had arranged to receive deputations from bodies representing agriculture,  but was prevented from doing so by the General Election.    The views of the Ministry of Agriculture have however been received,   and they are of considerable interest. The Ministry say, referring to a discussion of the question at a meeting of the Council of Agriculture in December,  1923  :&apos;-&quot;It appears that farmers on the whole now recognise that in face of the overwhelming opinion of the urban community it is useless to object to Summer Time as an institution,  arid that they realise that any opposition to be effective should be concentrated on securing modifications of the period.    The Ministry is of opinion that the interests of agriculture are not seriously prejudiced by the operation of Summer Time in the four months May to August,  when the period of daylight is sufficiently long to allow,  when required,  of fairly convenient adjustments being made in the times of starting s.nd finishing work,  and. further that there a,re less objections to an extension beyond August than to a commencement earlier in the year.&quot; 12.    This is confirmed by a resolution sent to the Secretary of State by the Council of the Central and Associated Chambers of
Agriculture, which is as follows&quot;The Oounoil recommends that the Act shall operate from the first Sunday in May until the first Sunday in September,  but if it be extended beyond that date it should continue until the last Sunday in October on account of the potato harvest.&quot; 13.    It is not to be anticipated that the proposals of the Conference of March,   1924, will be more favourably regarded now than they were last year by the representatives of agriculture,  but, on the other side,  there are considerations of very great weight, viz. : -(l) Uniformity of period between Great Britain on the one hand and Prance and Belgium on the other is obviously very desirable.    Absence of uniformity gives rise to the greatest inconvenience while it lasts in the transport of-mails and passengers,  and it is understood that as the timing of boat trains necessarily affects the whole train service,  the inconveniences are not confined to persons travelling to and from the Continent but extend to every one who uses the Southern lines.(2) It will be exceedingly difficult to resist the demand of the urban Interests for an extension of Summer Time to cover the period April - September.,14.    There would not be time to pass legislation to alter the date of the commencement of Summer Time this year, but it would be possible to alter the date on which it ends.    Summer Time would then extend this year from 19th April to 4th October^15.    I ask for authority to introduce a Bill to make Summer Time permanent in each year from the day following the first Saturday in April  (or if that is, Easter Day,  the day following the last Saturday in March) to the day following the first Saturday in October and to extend the period of Summer Time in 1925 to 4th October.W.
