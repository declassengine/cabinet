his Document is the Property; of His :Brl tannio^ Ma je sty Ts Government -Cabinet aCcP.67/25,NAVY BSJIMAflBS. MEMORANDUM BY THIS fflRSO? LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.The course which the Chancellor of the Exchequer asks the Cabinet to pursue in regard to the Navy Estimates amounts to an invitation to reverse, in the few days whioh elapse before those Estimates are finally settled, the policy of ^he late Conservative Administration, upon the continuity of which the Admiralty had based their proposals., He oontends that the Admiralty aim at a great and rapid development of sea-power under the influence of an exaggerated idea of the possibility of a war with Japan,Our policy Is not one of great increase of strength, but of replacement of vessels necessary to,the security of our commerce, and to the maintenance of the one-power standard, which have beoome obsolete bwing to age or the strain of war aervioe.His view is that there is little risk of a war with Japan, and therefore we can let down our programme of construction and take the risk, and that ii the probability of war became apparent we oould easily and rapidly raise our strength to the requisite standard.I cannot aooept this view.taking into consideration changes of Government in other*countries, the possibility of unexpected incidents, the obligations we may have to other Powers or as a member of the League of Nations, no one can scan the future with any oertainty of uninterrupted peace,I oonsider it a most dangerous policy to say that the Government is able to say at any time what the chance of war with any other Power may be in the next deoade or two. Governments have not been very successful in their previsionof....\
-2rof war in&apos;the past, and are not likely to be more so in the futures   It therefore seems to me impossible for the Admiralty to take up the comfortable attitude that the Government have said there een be no war&apos;till, say, 1940 or 1950, and so we oan reduce our strength now and build it up again at aInfills &apos;] &apos; V &apos; -        ; &quot;:more convenient season later on.The correot view, in my judgmentj......is to regard theupkeep of the Fleet as an Insurance against the catastrophe of an expensive war evem if successful and the ruin of an unsuccessful one.   We have to maintain a, force up to the one*-power standard and capable of protecting trade, which can be expected to seoure the Empire from aggression from any quarter.When a man insures his house or his. car, he endeavours to seoure for himself the value of either in the event of their destruction, and the premium he pays is one which the Company regards as sufficient to provide that sum.   If his car is worth  1,000, he does not say &quot;I do not think my oar is likely to be smashed, and therefore I will only ensure for  500*&quot; He pays his premium in order to recover the full amount of his loss.   In our oase we have to secure ourselves against a defeat ruinous to our Nation and ISmpire whioh oaanot be computed in  . s. d, or a costly war in which we may ultimately succeed but which might cost us in actual expenses of war and resultant loss of trade perhaps  6,000,000,000.As against such risks a premium of about 1$ in the latter oase, and a great deal less in the former, does not seem excessive.Furthermore, I traverse the view that it would be easy to see the signs of any imminent war in time to speed up a programme of construction which would raise us again to a position of superiority.If such signs were to become apparent, the Country of whose attitude we were suspicious, would either speed upher....
her &quot;building to keep pace with our acceleration, or attack us &quot;before we had time, to increase our strength.V*. 3?he only safe course, and the bnly one which cannot be   regarded as aggressive, is to pursue a consistent policy of replacement unless and   until some further agreement as to disarmament is reached.What should be the period over which this programme is to be spread is a matter which can well be considered fully when this yearns programme has been settled,I attach the views of my Haval Advisers upon tho Chancellorrs criticisms of the Estimates, dealing with many of the technical and strategic questions which he raises. But I do not think I can conclude without reference to the light in which I think such a course as the Chancellor proposes would be regarded by the Conservative Pe.rty*Our Estimates are framed upon the policy drawn up by the Cabinet Committee of February 1922 consisting of Mr,, Churchill (Chairman), mr. Montagu, lord Birkenhead and Mr.Baldwin, and cordially accepted by the party.   Upon those lines MToAmery, with the consent of the prime Minister, prepared Estimates for 1924-5 amounting to  62,250,000, and providing for 8 new cruisers, which were reduced by the labour ,Party to  55,800,000, including 5 new cruisersa    This reduotion was oaused by postponing works and provision for men, and by excessive drawing on stores, which have to be made up if we are to maintain the position even as they left ita   large automatic increases of nearly 2 million have accrued, and  1,320,000 has been added by transferring the cost of the Fleet Air Arm from the Air Ministry   Vote.Will our followers in the Souse and in the Country bo content to stultify their own votes for 0 cruisers and sink below the one-power standard adopted in 1921, or to follow the,a.
the cheese-paring parsimony of the Labour Government and postpone necessary repairs merely to swell the Estimates for future years?   I cannot contemplate the reception whioh our supporters would give to a programme which could easily and not unfairly he represented as worse than that of the Sooialist Party.W. C.

HmOST SBO.KST., NAVY   ESTIMATES.In replying to the Memorandum &quot;by the Chanoelior of the Exchequer, Go P. 39 (25), My Lords are of the opinion that it will be desirable to deal &quot;Firstly - With the general criticisms as contained on pages 1-8, Secondly -With the proposals contained on page 9, 2*     If My Lords have correctly interpreted the remarks of the Chanoellor of the Exchequer the latter1 s criticisms may be grouped under the following general headings:--(a) That the Admiralty have lost sight of the fact that weare separated from the only other twc Groat naval powers by oceans *(b) That the naval situation is in no w&amp;y comparable-to that which existed before the war*     Nothing could happen on the seas however unpleasant which could expose us to mortal danger in a short time^(c) That Admiralty policy is one of attempting to dominate Japan in her own waterse(d) That our preparations are on such a scale as would be required if the situation were urgent or critical and that the Admiralty are taking a. short, rather than a long view^(e) That the Admiralty are working to a standard of naval strength in excess of a one-power standard and building or replacing ships before it is necessary.,(f) That by their programme of replacement, the Admiralty are forcing the pace, making their League of Nations position ridiculous and risking a further limitation of naval armamenta by a new Naval Convention(g) That the whole of our naval organisation is being kept at a far higher pitch of preparedness and instant readiness than was deemed possible in 1914 and that an excessive number of ships are kept in full commission;-.
My Lords have the following reraarks to make on the above criticismsZ. (a) That the. Admiralty have lost sight of the fact that we areiiseparated from the only pother two Great Naval Powersi by oceans.This is true when considering the British Isles vlz-a-visU.StA. and Japan, but when the position of the Great Dominions ofCanada,Australia and New Zealand as well as India and EasternPossessions ia considered in relation to those powers, it need notbe pointed out how different ia the situation. It is on the strategic requirements of the Empire and not only of the British Isles that my lord have based their policy.(b) That the ^aval situation la in no way comparable to thatwhioh existed before the war&amp;   Nothing could happen on these as however unpleasant, which could expose us to mortaldanger in a shorty time-.It is agreed that the present situation is in no way comparable to that of 1914.   We are faced with an entirely different problem.For Germany to defeat the British Empire It was necessary for her In the first place to defeat the Grand Fleet, thereby freeing the exits for her Cruisers and Ralders^to emerge&apos;and throttle the commerce which is our life-blood*   The geographical position of Great Britain was so favourable that no less an achievement would enable Germany to strike at our commerce.Japan, on the other hand, owing to her geographical position can deal us a serious blow, by attacking our trade and outlying portions of the Empire,without having to engage in a Naval battle;.The difference between the two problems, is, the re fore, that whereas our main strategy in the late war began and ended with the correct placing of our battle fleet, a nwar with Japan would, certainly, for the first 12 months or more, be a Cruiser war of oceanio proportions as well as involving the very difficult operation of concentrating the Main Fleet in Far Eastern Waters.The problem before,the Admiralty will therefore be more difficult and complex
(o)   That the Admiralty Policy ia one of attempting to dominate Japan in her own waters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer is distressed at the idea that we should dominate Japan In her quarter of the globe *In the Admiralty view. It is inc&amp;rreot1 to regard that quarter of the globe as belonging to Japan alone;.     The F&amp;3? East covers a vast expanse and in it are situated such British possessions as India, Straits Settlements, Australia and New Zealand.     They are at the present moment dominated by Japan.It is the Admiralty^ responsibility to neutralise this domination as far as is possible.     Immense regard is shewn for the susceptibilities of Japan but the fact that Japan does at this moment beyond all question of doubt dominate British possessions in their own waters appears neither to arouse any comparable anxiety nor to wound our susceptibilities.My Lords cannot ignore the fact that should war with Japan unfortunately occur the fleet might ultimately be required to bring the maximum pressure possible on Japan, which could only be achieved by operating in Japanese waters.My Lords rest under no delusion, however, as to the magnitude of this task which could only be attempted after many months of intense preparation and provided that the whole Naval resources of the Empire were available for the purpose, which again pre-supposea that we have no preoccupation in Europe!.Unfortunately this state of affairs is not likely   to obtain if the considered opinion of the Foreign Office as to the instability of the good-will of France towards ourselves can still be accepted.     This opinion (C.I.D.101A) was given in connection with the Channel Tunnel Project, and bearing It in mind - as well as the unanimous decisions on the subject reached by the Leaders cf all political parties - My Lords have acted on the assumption that In the event of war 1* the East^ It would not be possible to leave the heart of the Empire without Naval -protection.
9 0 0Admiralty policy in tho Par East has therefore ore been     - .    0 directed towards gradually making such minimum preparation ae will safeguard the territory and trade of the Empire in those watersoThe stationing of battle cruisers and an increased number of submarines in the Par East is strictly in accordance with the above policy as the existing British Naval force in the Par East are inadequate either to ensure that Military reinforcements will reach Singapore or to prevent the destruction of the oil supplies on the route to the East.Our trade and possessions in the Far East can only be safeguarded if(1) The Fleet detailed for the Far East is ready to sail for those waters Immediately and must therefore be in full commission, (ii) Supplies of fuel are available for the passage of the Fleet.(iii) Singapore with its anchorage and fuel supplies is available for the Fleet on arrival. (d)   That our preoax-ations are on such a basis as would berequired 3,f the situation were urgent., cr critical and that the Admiralty policy takes the short ^rather than the long, view. The fact that the proposed building programme for 1925-26 forms part of the 10 years1 building programme prepared for the late Government would appear to conclusively prove that the Admiralty havw considered all the relevant factors over a^long period.Also My Lords are unable to agree that they have framed their proposal on the basis of the situation being either critical or urgent when it is remembered that -(I) The minimum   number of cruisers required in war will not be reached until 1936.(II) The date for the completion of the oil supplies on the route to the East is 1931.(ill)Provision of guns for such merchant vessels aa may beneaessary to convert into armed cruisers mill not be Completed until 1936.
(e)    ghat the Admiralty are working to^ a standard of naval strength in excess of the One-PowerL &amp;ta^ard ana, nre-placing; Jghlgi s, befpre-init is necessary.It is necessary to deal with this question as a whole and then to consider eaoh class of ship separately,,In 1921 it was laid down by the Government of theday that &quot;the Naval policy o&apos;f the Government is to maintain a * On empower Standard11 ite, that our Navy should not heinferior in strength to that of any other Powerc&quot; (VideStatement Explanatory of Naval Estimates 1921-22, 12.3*21)this was endorsed by the Imperial Gonferenoe of 1921in the following wards;-&quot;That, while recognising the necessity of naval co**.operation among the various portions of the Empire toprovide such naval defence as may prove to be*essential for security, and while holding that equality with thenaval strength of any other Power is a minimum standardfor that purpose, thiB conference is of opinion that themethod and expense of such co-operation ishould bodeferred until after the coming Conference on Disarmament&quot;.(Vide Command Paper No.1474, Aug0192l),The standard of naval strength to which My Lords have endeavoured to conform is strictly in accordance with theGovernment deoision of 1921 as endorsed by the TmperialConferenoe of that year.Owing, however, to the financial stringency of thelast few years it haB not been possible to genuinely maintain this standard as recommended by the Cabinet Committee in 1922.Each olass of ship will now be dealt with separatelyunder two headings -(i]    Is a One^Power standard of Naval Strength being exceeded?(ii)   Are ships being built or replaced before it is necessary?CAPITAL SHIPS,
CAPITAL SHIPS*The building of Capital Shipn is governed by the Washington Agreement which is; being strictly adhered to.AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. The conversion or building of aircraft carriers is governed by the Washington Agreement, and is being strictly adhered to and we are in fact one short of our requirements.CRUISERS.(i)    Is a One-Power Standard of Naval Strength being exceeded?In this Class of vessel the One-Power Standard is not applicable as we have special needs, as has been recognised at the Washington Conference and by the Chancellor of tha Exchequer.Our requirements are based principally on the numbers required to protect our Trade, but in addition to this it is necessary to have sufficient cruisers to provide&quot;&quot; a scouting line for the Main Sleet, (ii)    Are ships&apos; being built before it is necessary?The total number of Cruisers required in war is 70, a number we are considerably short of at the present time, as for reasons of economy, vessels have been scrapped without replace^ meht. At the present time, we have 51, whioh together with the 51 Cruisers of the 10 years1 building programme would give a total of 102 by 1936 if no vessels had to be scrapped in the meantime.It is estimated that before 1936, it will be nsoessary to scrap 32 Cruisers now on the list, leaving only th!; bare minimum required in war available.That the Admiralty are taking a considerably risk In only asking that provision may be made by 1936 for a total of 70 Cruisers may be judged from the experience of the late war at the commencement of which we possessed 109 Cruisers whioh ware supplemented by the considerable number possessed by our Allies.To....
SUBMARINES. . .&quot;.To Illustrate the very large number of cruisers we require to defend our trade it is desirable to recall that in the Indian Ocean the &quot;Bmden&quot; was responsible for &amp; concentration of 23 vessels either actively engaged in search of her or in convoying merchant ships on account of the menace of her presence in those waters.   In addition, a hunting force of eight more cruisers had been organised, but had not reached the scene of operations before she was finally destroyed.In tho same ocean and about the same date, four oruisers were hunting- for the ^ onigsberg&quot;.Daring the same period in West Indian and South Ameriean waters 18 ships were at one time or another detached to search areas in which &quot;Earlsruhe&quot; was reported.Again in the Pacific and South Atlantic at approximately the same time, no loss than 22 ships including &quot;Good Hope&quot; and &quot;Monmouth&quot; were searching for or protecting trade against Yon SpeoTs Squadron.In any future war we shall not be so well situated geographically to prevent raiSors getting out on to the trade routes.DESTROYERS .(i) Is a One-Power Standard of Naval Strength being, exoeeded?As stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on page 6, line 1 of his Memorandum, the U.S.A. has a superiority in this class of vessel.The actual figures including both flotilla leaders and destroyers is **U.S.A.       288 British Empire       205.(ii) Are ships being built before it is necessary?It is not proposed to include any destroyers in the 1925-+26 Programme of Now Construction.In spite of the replacement programme which it is proposed should commence in 1926-27, we shall be greatly inferior to U.S.A. for many years*

From this table two faots indisputably emergeB Firstly, that this country has not set the pace; Secondly, that Japan far from following the load given by this country has seized the opportunity to increase hor naval strength relativo to that of this oountry, &apos;       u As the programme of new construction is solely one of replacement of either ships which have already been scrapped or will be scrapped on beooming ineffective, in an endeavour to maintain a One-Power Standard, it is not clear to My Lords why our position as regards the League of Nations should be oompro-promised.It would appear to My Lords that there is littlo doubt that a conference for the further limitation of armaments will be called in the near future and that It may then be possible to arrive at an understanding with tho other great naval powers. Until such time as such a conference,, is called My Lords would deprecate any gesture such as that proposed by the Chanoellor of the Exchequer as it will Inevitably place us in a relatively weak position at the oonferenoe from whioh It will not be possible to retrieve our position.   In this.-connection tho following extract from a speech by tho late Prime Minister is not without interest, (Hansard - Thursday^ 21st February 1924, Col. 2131);-&quot;Ihore is no increase-in-our naval strength if we bogin to build those five cruisers this year because they are purely for the purpose of replacing a certain type(&quot;County&quot; Glass) of Cruisers with a wide range, whioh is wanted.

(g)   The whole of oar Naval organisation is being kept at a far higher pit oh of preparedness and instant readiness thaai was deemed possible in 1914 and that an excessive nyber of ships are kopt in fall oommiasloa.Mr Churchill (cn page 7) claims that &quot;the whole of &quot;oar Naval organisation is &quot;being kept at a far higher pitch of &quot;preparedness and instant Readiness than was deemed possible in &quot;1914.     Ptfaotlc&amp;lly the whole Fleet,, apart from destroyers and &quot;small craft, is maintained in fall commission.     The system &quot;of manning ships on the Secend Fleet scale, i.s., 60$ fall &quot;naeleas orews on board and 40$ active service ratings re-&quot;qualifying in the schools ashore, has been entirely abandoned. &quot;Practically every ship not in dockyard hands refitting is kept &quot;permanently manned with its fall complement of active service &quot;ratings&quot;.A more misleading picture could not be drawn.In 1914 Great Britain kept permanently manned withtheir fall complements of aotive servioe ratings -30 Battleships 7 Battle Cruisers 39, CruisersTotal      76Behind this permanently fally manned fleet we had a &quot;SecondFleet&quot; of older ships which oarried 60$ active service ratings,whilst the regaining 40$ were requalifying in the schools im.shore spi that these ships also on mobilisation were fally, manned, .with aotive service men.     This   ISsecond Fleet&quot; consisted of -15 Battleships 81, Orals eraTotal        36Behind these two Fleets, me had a &quot;Third Fleet&quot; of yet older ships which had 2/5ths active servioe ratings assigned to them and filled ap with reserves on mobilisation.     This &quot;Third Fleet&quot; consisted of -10 *. i..
10 Battleships 34 CruisersTotal        44The ships of these &quot;Second&quot; and &quot;Third&quot; Fleets were either sunk: during the war or have been sorappod since without replacement.     It was thus, in the main, that the great reduo-tion in officers and men of the navy from the 1914 Vote &quot;A&quot; of 151,000 has been secured.When the changes on which the 19 25-86 estimates are based are complete the position with regard to Capital Ships will be -1914 1925In eommlasion with full In commission with 85$JAoVive &quot;Service erews. &quot; Active feeWieV crews.30 Battleships 14 Battleships7 Battle Cruisers 3 Battle cruisers39 Cruisers 32 Cruisers10 Flotilla LeadersThe Fleet of 1925 being less than half that of 1914 in capital ships.BBHIHP THfi&amp;B.With j5/5th8 Active Service l/10th Aotlye ServiceCreyW In peaceT&quot;&apos;       *&quot; crews ^ peacefe .FuVl&apos; Actlva Service &amp;&apos; Full 1 Aotive Serviceorsvjs in &quot;war. crews &apos;in war.15 Battleships 3 Capital Ships21 Cruisers 0 Cruisersi.e. Practically no second line, and even that lesB efficientlymanned.All the rest of our cruisers and destroyers are in reserve with care and maintenance crews in peace.

cruisers (with the exception of tho two newest cruisers ) carry reduced complements, which are about 15$ below their full numbers.   The balance of thoir orows go to provide the numbers for training in tho schools Just like the balanco of Mr.churchill&apos;s nucleus crews.     The Admiralty have adopted this systom in order to economise man, although there is a much greater complication to be provided for than there was in 1914, for in 1914 the &quot;Second Fleet&quot; --ships wore all lying at -the ports ready to receive their balanco erews, whereas we have applied the system to ships on foreign Stations trusting to have long enough notice ef trouble to be able to got their balance&apos;crews out to them.It is of course truo that tho full complements of battleships and cruisers today arc oonsidorably larger than they were in 1914, but this is due to the addition of anti-aircraft armaments,- greater elaboration and precision of firo-oontrol apparatus and olootrioal equipment, etc., and every addition can bo individually aooounted for and justified.It has alroady beon explainod to Mr,Churchill, and is now repeated that his proposal to take still more men out of the ships in peace time would not offset any reduction In Vote &quot;A&quot; unless he does not intend to put.the men back in war, i*e,, unless his proposal is that an increased proportion of our greatly reduced number of capital ships and cruisers shall bo only partly manned by active service ratings on mobilisation.    It is utterly misleading to describe this as a return to pro-war organisation.    In 1914 with our groat superiority of strength and a front line of 76 capital ships and cruisers in full commission wo manned oven our &quot;Second tine&quot; with full active sorvioo crows on mobilisation and didnot. .
Pnot oome to reserves until tho &quot;Third&quot; Line.Mr.oChurchillTb plan on tho other hand involves (a) largely reducing our First Line;  (b) forming a Second Lino which would be muoh loss efficient than tho 1914 Second Line because it would.be partly manned by reserves; (c) bring ships homo from foreign stations, tho effect - of which on our prestige and interests and also on tho efficiency of sea training would be considerable.,    Tho suggestion of short servioo men has no real bearing on the question, as the present reserve organisation could provide the men if the groat reduction in offieiency could bo aooeptodoAs regards tho closing of tho sohools it should be explained that it is not a question of whether the mqn training in the sohools shall be mobilised or not,    Thoy are mobilised as a matter of ooTirsa,    It is a question of whether the instructional staff shall be mobilised, making it impossible to start the training of new classes until a staff has been got together by entering pensioners er gradually bring back the instructional staff from the ships again ( the latter is what actually happened in the war).    It was decided after the Goddos Committee*s Report on the recommendation of Mr .0%urohill1s Committee to tako the middle course, and retain &quot;only specially valuable Instructional staff ikeyl men&quot;, releasing the remainders This is still tho policy and should not be altered.As regards this point and several others referred to by MrsChurchill - particularly his comment that only 15,000 reservists are utilised on the day of mobilisation &quot; it is clear that he is still visualising a war in homo waters when our fleet was close at hand so that exchanges of reserves and active service men, additions to complement, etca, could bo made in a day or two when tho wastagofrom.. * o
from sickness etc., was only the normal home waters Wastage, and when praotioally no allowance had to ha made for the loss of men&apos;s services whilst going between port, and ships.     it is quite a different matter to deal with the manning of a fleet operating thousands of miles away when the shifting of men means the loss of their services for a period of weeks, and when the wastage from siokness is on a foreign and perhaps a tropical standard a     Under such ciroumstanoes the requirements of reserves for replenishing crews from the very first week of war would he quite unllka anything that was necessary in the last war.If our Vote &quot;A&quot; is compared with the personnel vote for the Japanese and American Navies, it will be seen that our Vote ia considerably less than either of the others.     The Japanese vote is 72,800 which on the three - five standard is equivalent to 121,000 for Great Britain.     The United States voto is 115,100.Thus it will be seen that we have fewer men in proportion than either U.8.A. or Japan in spite of the fact that we have to maintain a large number of cruisers in commission over the world.It will also be soen that from the figures given below the proportion of ships maintained in full eommlssion compares very favourably with the proportion maintained by either U.SJU or Japan.CAPITAL SHIPS IN FULL COMMISSION AjfD INWhen the charges on which the 1926-26 estimates axe based are complete tho position with regard to Capital Ships^ will be british Empire.....

Admiralty remarks on the detailed proposals of MreChurchlll for reducing Vote A are as follows:-(a) Reconsideration of the balance between home and foreign Service*Bringing ships home would not result In any great economya.to personnel unless they were kept with reduced complements in peace and completed with reserves in war.     The only advantage to be obtained from this proposal is some reduction in the numbers allowed for crossing reliefs and foreign service leave.        These results would be quite incommensurate with what Is lost by the superior training abroad and the loss of prestige owing to the reduction of foreign service squadrons^(b) A proportion of battleships and cruisers serving in Home Waters or Mediterranean to be manned in peace with full nucleus crews on the pre-war Second Fleet Scale *There would be no saving In this.The pre-war Second Fleet had a 60$ active service crew on board, completed by the other 40$ of active service men on mobilisation.Nothing would be gained in Vote A by adopting this course.Wo have already in tho interests of economy gone to great lengths in using reserves for 92 destrpyersj before the war all destroyers were manned entirely by active service ratings. In addition all ships in full commission whether at home or abroad have complements some 15$ below their war complements.
-    19   *-(e) A Reserve Fleet system and Immediate Reserve to be adopted and utilised to a greater extent on mobilisation.The efficiency of ships manned by reserves is not, and never can be, equal to that of fully commissioned ships until many months after mobilisation.Since.&quot;the adoption of a Standard of Naval Strength in conformity with the Government decision of 1921 (see paragraph 3 (e)j it becomes even more essential that the personnel themselves and their organisations should be of the highest possible standard, in order that we may have confidence in the superiority af 084* fleet as a whole.     To attain this standard it Is neoessary to &quot;&quot;keep practically the whole of our more important ships In full oommissionnin peace.This has been recognised by the U.S.A. and Japan which as is shown In paragraph 3g maintain all their Capital Ships in full commission except those under refit.(d) A larger proportion of short service men to be engaged if necessary to develop the reserve system and immediate    , reserve.A short service system is not necessary,as there are now-ample reserves without it for some years to come.In Itself it is undesirable. An inferior type of men enters and they are lost to the active list soon after they become efficient.(e) Schools to be closed on the outbreak of war.This wets, done in 1914 and found to be a mistake. They very soon had&apos; to be re-opened*   A much smaller saving would result than might be anticipated as many of the ratings remaining behind are cooks,stewards,etc. and would have to be borne In peace in any ease (3)    The expenditure on the Fleet Air Arm to be limited to &quot; 1,000 yOOO in 1925-26j the increase in Aircraft carriers in whieh we have an unquestioned lead, to be slowed down.The &quot;Grant in Aid&quot; &quot;for Fleet Air Ami, put forward to the Admiralty by the Air Ministry, in a letter dated 4th Dec ember, 1924, was  1.750.000*_ ......... ........_______________________uL-^.----.....
This, by request of the Admiralty, was cut down to the present figure of  1,520,.OOP, this being achieved by placing the &quot;Pegasus&quot; in reserve instead of employing her as an instructional Carrier, and by reducing the proposed reserve of Engines for Aircraft from 275$ to 150$,With the exception of  109,800, the sum of  1,520,000 is taken up with the maintenance charges, including pay of personnel, and the provision of material already ordered, due to the strength of the Fleet Air Arm as it exists at present *The sum of  109,800 referred to above is included to meet part provision of the formation of 4 new Flights (a Flight consists of 6 aircraft) to be formed in the latter part of 1925/25 as part of the equipment of 17 Flights required for &quot;Courageous&quot; and ^Gloriousn now being converted into Aircraft Carriers,The other 13 Flights tq-iae provided in the following year (1926/27) partly from &quot;Argus&quot;,  &quot;Hermes&quot; and aircraft already provided for Battleships, Battle Cruisers and Gruisersj and partly by &amp; new Flights *&quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; will not be completed before 1927, b\tt it is considered neoessary to make a start this year to form a portion of the flights required for these ships in order to avoid forming the 9 new Flights all in the same year thus overloading that year&apos;s estimates.It will be realised from the above  that, when the 17 Flights required for these two Carriers are formed, there will then exist no equipment for the following aircraft carriersH.M.S, &quot;ARGUS&quot;; H.M.S.  &quot;HERMES&quot;; -
also there will be no aircraft Available for embarkation in Capital Ships and Cruisers,Aircraft will eventually be required for &apos;*/rgus&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; and the Cruisers for the protection of our Ocean Trade Routes, but the Admiralty have not proposed any provision should be made for this or for the Capital Ships at present, jThe Admiralty struck out a 30 knot 17,000 Ton Aircraft Carrier from their Sketch Estimates for 1925-26,Mr. Churchill1^ statement that we have &quot;an unquestioned lead in Carriers&quot; may be true as regards numbers, but a closer inspection of the facts of the case shows that in large Carriers of 23 knots and tabove the situation in 1927, if we do not slow down, should be:-G-REAT   BRITAIN.&quot;Eagle&quot;Completed in( &quot;Furious&quot; 1917.

Carriers the great advantage of being new ships.If the conversion of &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Gloriotis&quot; were slowed down, these ships, which are already comparatively
It will thus be seen that the Admiralty have already cut the provision in 1925-26 for the Fleet Ala? Arm to an extent beyond which any further reduction is inadvisable,(4) The rate of expansion of our oil fuel installation to be spread over double the number of years.The effect of the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect to oil fuel provision lh the Navy Estimates for 1925-26, if adopted, will be &quot;that the total purchases would be reduced from 1,220,000 to 610,000 tons -divided up between Expenditure and Additions to reserves as follows:-Provision for Expenditure  ...  ... 400,000 tons.Provision for Reserve ,,.  ...  ... 210,000 tons,Total ,.,-610,000-Expenditure,Deducting the Estimated Expenditure for Essential requirements, i.e. Auxiliary purposes of ships in commission, authorised trials, Training Establishments, Bunkers of over-seas oilers, etc. - which amount In total to over 387,200 tons ^. less than 12,800 tons would remain? this is equivalent to about two days steaming for all ships in commission.It is obvious that such a proposition is out of the question and further, it is considered that the number of steaming days provided In the Estimates represents the irreducible minimum.old, would &quot;be correspondingly increased In age before they can be scrapped and replaced under the Washington Treaty, i,e, if they are not completed as Carriers until 1928-29, they cannot be scrapped and replaced until 1948-49 by which time they will be over 30 years old and much reduced in speed and efficiency.

. &apos;.    i 1 .   -.good will.     Meanwhile the steady expansion of the Japanese Navy continues.Despite this the Chancellor proposes that completion of the Base should he postponed.The question is finally one of policy for decision by H.M. Government.     The Admiralty are hound, however, to point out the considerable naval dangers involved and with what apprehension they would view a postponement of the nature suggested.(6&apos;)   A reduction of at least  2,000,000 by diminishing the ffi^er^VOg, depo^&apos;, a&amp;ipft-.. new., works, costs of shore ost ah 11 ahments t and &quot;for the ^invariable .over budgeting on approved services&quot;.A reduction of anything like three millions on &quot;services&quot; is absolutely impossible.     When the fleet numbers, dockyard numbera, new construction, oil fuel, and the non-effective votes, have been dealt with, there is nothing left on which to make large reductions.The five large items indicated above account for Fifty Two Millions out of the Sixty-Five and Half Millions of 1925-26 Estimates, so that Mr Churchill is suggesting almost a 25$ out on the remaining services.An overhead cut &quot;to discount in advance possible delays in   &quot;contract work&quot; or as Mr Chtirehill oalls it rthe invariable over budgeting on approved services is on a different footing, but experience suggests that the &quot;overhead out&quot; of two and a quarter millions this year was greater than oould be safely, made next year.The Admiralty would however accept an overhead out of 2 millions subject of course to the same assurance from the Chancellor as was given by his predeoessor in the ease of the present Estimates.
ADi.il RALTY * 4th February,1925.(7)    Thor proposal of Officers&apos; Marriage Allowance to be negatived without examination.This ia a case based on evidence that naval officers at present are suffering serious Inequality of treatment as compared with officers of the other service3*In the interests of all ideas of Justice and fair dealing we cannot agree to omit this item.(8)    Revision of the pay scales for future entrants.The Chancellor refers to the Navy only but presumably he realises that all three services are equally affected.     The Admiralty have urged for more than a year that this question should be dealt with, and offered last summer to reduce their Initial rates for new entries forthwith if the other two services would do the same.     This would have saved the country very large sums on future estimates.
