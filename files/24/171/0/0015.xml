This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.71Copy No.SECRET.CP. 15 (25).THE CABINET.DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS MUNITIONS TO FOREIGNCOUNTRIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The decisions of the late Cabinet of 15th April, 1924 (Cabinet 27 (24), Conclusion 5)_57and 19th July, 1924 (Cabinet 41 (24), Conclusion 7) forbade the sale of surplus Govern- -_8^ment arms and munitions of war to Foreign States, and ordered their destruction if it     348 proved that they could not be made use of by the Services or sold to the Dominions or Colonies.Previously the policy followed was &quot;that the responsibility for giving effect to the policy of the Government in the matter of the sale of warlike stores should rest upon the departments concerned, who should be authorised to carry out negotiations for the sale of such stores to foreign Powers in proper cases, as suggested in my memorandum, CP. 4180 of 5th September, 1922, and that departments should exercise their.discretion in referring to the Cabinet the more important questions concerning the sale of arms.&quot;No appreciable market having been found for these arms and munitions in the Dominions or Colonies, the question of the destruction of some of this material will arise shortly, if the Cabinet decision of 19th July last is to hold good.I feel it desirable to bring to the notice of the Cabinet the serious effect of this decision on military policy.Apart from the cost of destruction of the arms, &amp;c, which are, or might be made, available for sale, the loss to the State of their sale value will be considerable, estimated at  2,400,000 for 800,000 rifles, with bayonets and scabbards,  1,800,000 for 900,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition,  33,000 for 11,000 revolvers of non-service pattern, besides 10,000 Hotchkiss machine guns, 1.00 tons nitro-cellulose, and a number of other articles of which the sale value cannot be estimated accurately. These stores are not in every case surplus to service requirements, some of them forming part of the war reserves. Of the rifles, a large number are of American manufacture which it is desired to replace as quickly as possible by reduced numbers of more modern weapons. The small arm ammunition, much of which is included in the reserves, is becoming useless owing to deterioration, and if not sold within a comparatively short time, must be replaced out of annual estimates at a very considerable cost.It is in the future, however, as the present Army reserve stocks generally become obsolescent or deteriorate and have to be replaced by more modern patterns, that the Cabinet decision will bear most heavily on the Army,In present financial conditions it would be of great assistance to me in keeping the reserves up to date, to be able to dispose gradually of the older pattern material, and to devote the proceeds, to the extent to which they will go, to the provision of post-war designs, as and when they are evolved.The Cabinet decision of 19th July severely restricts the disposal not only of purely surplus stocks, but also of all army equipment as it becomes obsolete, and will, if maintained, make it increasingly difficult to keep the forces properly equipped or to do much more than work out improvements which, for want of funds, cannot be put in practice on an adequate scale.When replacement is necessary, if it is not permissible to find a market abroad for obsolescent or obsolete material and utilize the proceeds for providing more up to date equipments, the whole, instead of part, of the cost will&apos;have to be incurred, entailing either an increase to Army Estimates, or the postponement of the introduction of necessary changes until they have become overdue and a limitation of the reserves below the margin of safety, or alternatively the curtailment of other essential Army services.26/Ptg/364   100   1/25   W.O.P.   1647
The late Cabinet, when it reached its decision in July last, presumably realised that an embargo by the British Government on the sale of surplus arms, while possessing some moral significance, could not have any considerable practical effect in preventing foreign States from purchasing war material, since many other sources of supply existed, and I am, in fact, in possession of information that extensive transactions in arms from foreign Government stocks have taken place on the Continent during the last nine months to the financial detriment of this country. The majority of foreign States cannot afford to buy new up-to-date equipment, and if they are debarred from buying surplus stocks from the British Government they will inevitably obtain them on the Continent.Apart from this, the decision was not altogether consistent as, while it forbade the sale of surplus arms to Foreign Powers, it very properly left British Armament firms free to undertake foreign orders for fresh manufacture.The late Cabinet were no doubt aware of this inconsistency, but judged it impracticable to place an embargo, on the manufacture and sale of arms tp. Foreign Governments by private firms, as this would have involved the closing down in whole or in part, or the subsidizing, of British armament production, with the effect of seriously crippling the country&apos;s powers of expansion in munitions manufacture in time of emergency.The advantage of inducing foreign armies to adopt armament of British design, involving the placing of subsequent orders in Great Britain for replacements and repairs, is of considerable military importance.Once the British pattern of armament has been adopted, the power to refuse subsequent supplies, which cannot be obtained elsewhere if homogeneity of equipment is to be maintained, presents a potential means of influencing the policy of the country concerned.The expediency of any particular sale can of course always be considered as heretofore on its merits (CP. 4180). Sales to the Soviet Government may also be excluded.The risk of British arms falling into undesirable hands is not great, in view of the existing system of export licences, and I am willing to adopt such further safeguards against this risk as the Foreign Office or the Police Authorities may suggest.Nor do I think that the sale of Government stocks of obsolete pattern will appreciably injure the activities of the armament industry in this country. On the contrary, the replacement orders which would have to be undertaken by the industry would materially help to keep alive essential capacity for the manufacture of warlike stores without payment of the otherwise inevitable subsidies, and at the same time contribute appreciably to relieve unemployment in the industry, as to which I have already received representations.In conclusion, I desire to press very strongly for a reconsideration of the decision of July last, and ask to be authorised to take steps to find markets for the surplus and obsolescent equipment amongst the Allied and friendly Powers, either directly or through private contractors who are recognised licensed dealers.L. W.-E.The War Office,12th January, 1925.
