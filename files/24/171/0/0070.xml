(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government).SECRET^ 0 A B 1 H E T.CP.69(25).CORONERS bill^ Memorandum circulated by the Home Secretary.1 circulate a draft of a Bill to amend Coroners Law and a note explaining its main provisions. During the debate of 12th December last on the Committee stage of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill - which continues in force for another year two emergency Acts relating to Coroners&apos; Juries - I had to promise, as my predecessors have promised, to introduce a Bill dealing with Coroners&apos; Juries, and with other matters on which Coroners Law requires amendment.        ^ .I contemplate,  if the Cabinet approve my proposals,, consulting representatives of local authorities upon the matters which more particularly concern them before the&apos;Bill is introduced.Wo new charge on Imperial funds is involved.(l) This Bill is bas-ed in the main on the report of the Coroners Committee Of 1910  (Cd.  5004).  .That Committee reported that &quot;the law relating to-&quot;coroners is/antiquated.       ......On the whole we have been&quot;astonished at the good work done by coroners with out-of-*date&quot;and imperfect machinery.       .....But we think that the&quot;performance of their duties would be made easier,  and the &quot;system in general rendered more efficientj  if the law relating &quot;to coroners was amended and brought more into line with &quot;modern requirements,&quot;The Committee&apos;of 1910 had teen appointed in consequence of a widespread desire for some such reform.      For many years
previously the need for some amendment of the law had been generally recognised by those engaged in administering it. The last important statute had been the Coroners Act, 1887, but this purported merely to consolidate numerous statutes dating from the thirteenth century onwards.(2) The Committee of 1910 attaohed special importance to certain recommendations.The first was Abo1ition of Franchi se 11Cor oner ships (Paragraph 1.of Report).      The Committee said &quot;Franchise &quot;coronerships are inconvenient and anomalous.   1 They were &quot;created by charters from the Crown, granted either to an&quot;individual or a corporation......The districts of franchise&quot;coroners are for the most part exceedingly inconvenient. &quot;They constitute islands in the jurisdiction of the county &quot;coroners.      This is particularly the case in Norfolk   where, , &quot;for example, one franchise coroner&apos;b distrJot is scattered &quot;over the county and consists of twenty-threes, patches of &quot;exclusive jurisdiction.&quot;pFor the purposes of the Act of 1887 coroners for the Duchy of Lancaster  (as well as coroners for the KJng&apos;e household and Admiralty coroners) are &quot;franchise coroners&apos; (section 42) tut not in the ordinary sense&apos;]].While Franchise coroners aro appointed by private persons or privileged bodies, their salaries are in almost all cases paid from county funds:    further,  the existence of areas,  which are subjects of franchise and cannot be grouped or re-arranged as the districts of county coroners can, prevents some local authorities from making necessary re-arrangemento, centralising buildings for use by coroners, and appointing a few whole-time coroners instead of several part-time coroners, and so results in the continuance of arrange-ments whioh involve unnecessary trouble and expense.Clause 9 of the Bill follows the recommendation of the Committee in abolishing most franchise coronerships as
from the occurrence of the next vacanoy.     The clause has been submitted to and concurred in by the Department of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who appoints franchise coroners for districts comprising a greater area in all than any other bady or person;    and it is believed that, as drafted, clause 9 will not be seriously opposed.(3) The second recommendation to which the Committee of 1910 attached special importance (paragraph 5 of report), was that all-OoJrorierB-sJbould-be-paid, as all county coroners are paid now, ty^salary., aric3- not by fees, and that the salary should be fixed, and revised periodically, in the light of all the circumstances, and not by reference to the number of inquests^ which plan is open to the same objection as payment by fees, i.e.  that it makes earnings depend on the number of inquests, whereas the best coroner is he who does what is required, and no more, and in particular holds no inquest unless the public interest makes it desirable to do so.Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill give effect to those recommendations.(4) The third recommendation to which the Committee attached importance was &quot;the bestowal on a central authority QJ^fr-PO^QP jkO-B^kes ru-1-es of practice and procedure&quot;.,   (Para graph 46 of Report).      This is given effect to in Clause 27.(5) Some of the other&apos;recommendations of the Committee relate to matters which have been made the subject of emergency and temporary legislation during the War.      This is so as regards juries.The Committee: said &quot; a coroner j s jury, may consist of &quot;any number not less,than twelve and not exceeding twenty-three &quot;...... ....      V/e suggest that not more than twelve jurymen should&quot;be sworn and to meet the case of a juryman dying or becoming &quot;incapable of acting before the completion of the inquest, we &quot;recommend that the coroner should be empowered to accept a &quot;verdict of not less than three-fourths of the jury.......  if
&quot;this three-fourths majority cannot be obtained, he should be &quot;empowered to discharge the jury and summon a fresh one&quot; (Paragraphs 25 and 26 of Report).By the Coroners   (Emergency Provisions) Act,  1917,  the number of-jurymen to be summoned was made not more than eleven and not less than seven.      This enactment, which has been continued in force by one special Act and by two Expiring haws Continuance Acts,  is Jasp*e re-embodied, in permanent form, j.n Clause 13 of the Bill.      Majority verdicts and. failure to agree are dealt with in Clause 14.      Section 4(5) of the Act of 18S7, dealing in another way with failure to agree, will be repealed.As regards the system of holding inquests with juries in every case, the Committee said &quot;the jury system is so deeply &quot;rooted in English life and history, that we do not see our way &quot;to advocate any change.&quot; (Paragraph 45 of Report). Change., however, was effected under stress^-of war. Under Section 7 of the Juries Act, 1918, a coroner is empowered to dispense with a jury unless there is suspicion of murder or manslaughter, or unless some spooial statute requires an inquest to be held, e.g in the case of a prisoner dying in prison.The motive of both the emergency enactments - the Act of 1917 and Section 7 of the Act of 1918 - was economy of man-power.      Economy of public monies also resulted,  computed in London at  3,000 per annum,  in Leeds at  600 per annum, and so on.      For this and other reasons,  continuance of similar provisions has been favoured on the whole;    but very strong exception has been taken to dispensing with juries in cases involving industrial questions,  or questions of traffic,  or other questions of public interest and importance.      It is for this reason that debate has arisen on the continuance of the emergency provisions in Expiring Laws Continuance Bills. Clause 12 of the present Bill requires  juries  to be summoned in the cases referred to as well as in cases of murder etc.;    in other cases it allows the coroner to decide whether he should
summon a jury or not.      It will,  therefore, maintain tho economy and convenience of the emergency system,  except where there are strong grounds for having a jury.(6) The Committee of 1910 recommended that in cases of sudden doath a coroner should have the  ower-to-order^^jqo^r mo.Lt2J?.--?L5L1r:i.^l?LtLi.^.&apos;2.J^^A^^ltL-^^^S^n^nqjjest  (Paragraph 15 of Report):    Clause 25 of the Bill makes the necessary provision. In many caoeo,  the postmortem will remove any doubt as to the cause of doath and thus render it unnecessary for the coroner to hold an inquest.      In many oases this would mean a saving of money to the local authorities and of anxiety and pain to friends and relatives.(7) The question of c^^Ltt^^^^-t^-i^i^l^i-ti0.^^-^?.c or on er s ^__jur j^e s ,__for jnurder L-man s 1aught or,__or ^infan t lc ide, is of paramount importance.For many years past it has been felt that the duplication-tion of proceedings before coroners and before justices is unnecessary,  arid sometimes detrimental to justice.      In very early tines,  the functions of the coroner seem to have been largely fiduciary:    he saw to tho King&apos;a interests in such matters as the forfeiture of the property of felons, and in the days before any local justices of the peace had been appointed, he probably constituted the most Important part of the machinery for bringing persons suspected of homicide or other felonies to trial.      Even after local  justices of the peace were appointed throughout the realm the coroner was still essential for whereas  justices cannot take any action except against a suspected person the coroner can and should inquire into the cause of death whenever there is a suspicion of felony even though suspicion attaches to no one in particular.      But when a suspected person -  is under arrest and. will shortly be charged with murder it is an anomaly that before he is put on his trial a verdict of wilful murder may be found against him by aCoroner&apos;s  jury.The Committee of 1910 did not deal with this difficult
matter.      Since the Committee reported it has frequently&apos; come into prominence;    public opinion is strongly against the duplicate procedure now required by law especially when the evidence is of a painful or revolting character, and will have to bo given for the third time at the trial.      Clause 23 would enable a coroner to adjourn an inquest as soon as criminal proceedings begin, unless there is some matter outstanding which should be cleared up -  (e.g. when a report on material for analysis has not yet been received) - and not to resume it unless the criminal proceedings have proved abortive or other-wise unsatisfactory,  or have failed to elucidate facts, e.g. concerning a fatal fire or an industrial disaster, which in the public interest should be elucidated.The principle on which clause 23 proceeds is accepted on fehe one hand, by the Coroners1 Society and, on the other, by the Director of public Prosecutions.    - Consequential provisions as to registration particulars, in this clause, and alss in a different connexion in clause 24, have been approved by the Ministry of Health and the Registrar General.Sub-clauses 23  (4) and (5) make minor amendments in the procedure when a coroner does commit for trial,  e.g. when his inquest,  has been begun and completed before criminal proceedings are started.It is believed that Clause 23 will be found, when discussed in Parliament to meet tho general wish.(P) Of most of . the other provisions of the Bill it need only be said that they are restricted to adjustments which either were recommended by the Committee of 1910 or have been shown by experience to be necessary.One provision, however,  should be mentioned specially, namely, Clause 5, which empowers local authorities to grant pensions to whole-time coroners on their retirement.      This Clause precedes, but really arises out of the necessity for,
7th February,  1925.C51-7Clauso 6, which confers on local authorities power to require an aged-or-infijTTra^whol Provision on both heads was recommended by the Committee of 1910 (Paragraphs 6 and 7 of Report).The pension charge will not fall on Imperial funds, and for many years to come little cost will be incurred by local authorities under this head, for there are very few whole-time coroners.      If local authorities are empowered, as proposed by other clauses of the Bill,  to re-arrange coroners&apos; districts so as to have a few whole-timo coroners in each county instead of several part-time coroners and franchise coroners, the number of whole-time coroners will gradually increase and the scope of Clauses 5 and 6 will be extended. It is believed that both the spokesmen of local authorities, and the advocates of economy, will accept Clause 5 concerning superannuation as paving the way, at small cost,  to Clause 6 concerning compulsory retirement.2ilE^2.:ki^at 0J2.&apos; which was recommended by the Committee of 1910  (Paragraph 41 of Report) is best deferred until after amendment is effected.W.J.H.
