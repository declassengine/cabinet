February 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 91 (25). I[Circulated to the Cabinet by Direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.]CABINET.THE SIRDARSHIP  OF THE EGYPTIAN ARMY.I PRINT below for convenience of reference the telegram sent to Lord Allenby, Appendix A, and his reply, Appendix B. At the next meeting of the Cabinet I shall ask approval for the definitive instructions to Lord Allenby contained in the draft printed as Appendix C. -A. 0.Foreign Office, February 14, 1925.Appendix A.Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby (Cairo). (No. 43.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 5, 1925.YOUR telegram No. 33 of 21st January: Command of Egyptian and Sudanese armies.Question of command of Egyptian and Sudanese armies has been twice discussed at great length by Cabinet, and your views have received the fullest consideration. There was no hesitation in deciding that the present arrangement is anomalous, and should (for the reasons which you have given) be terminated with no undue delay. In other words, Egyptian Government will have before long to be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government agree to the severance of the two military commands, and that Sirdar of Sudanese army will have nothing to do in future with Egyptian army.This, however, will at once raise question of Sirdarship of latter force. His Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate the considerations which you have urged in. favour of appointment of an Egyptian officer to this post. But a very strong view was expressed in Cabinet that such a change of policy, which does not appear to have been asked for by Egyptian Government or by King, and which may conceivably at bottom be distasteful to latter, would, if effected at the present juncture, be liable to serious misconception, either as being direct sequel to recent events, or as indicating abandonment by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a position of forty-two years&apos; standing, in which British authority and prestige are regarded as involved.Apprehensions were also expressed as to juxtaposition of British and Egyptian forces at Cairo under the new conditions, and as to nucleus which an Egyptian army thus commanded might afford to Nationalist sentiments and to Anglophobe agitation. A further consideration is the&apos; undesirability of making any such revolutionary change while results of Egyptian elections are still undecided, and before we know what future is likely to be. &quot;What might be a harmless concession under one set of conditions might be a very hazardous one under others.On the other hand, it was recognised that when the decision as to Sudan command is announced, and the question of Egyptian Sirdarship is ipso facto raised, we should have no legal right, and it would be politically most unwise, to appear to dictate the appointment of a British officer to the Egyptian Government or to the [12699]
&amp;King. It was accordingly suggested that, in discussing the matter with the latter, you should assume as a matter of course thaVhe will (on this occasion, at any rate) appoint a British officer of high standing to that office, and should convey to His Majesty that any other course would be certain to provoke considerable feeling in this country, and might even be denounced as a weak surrender of British claims in consequence of the murder of Sir Lee Stack. Further, the argument might even commend: itself to Egyptian Nationalists that, if by murdering a British Sirdar they can secure an Egyptian successor, the same process might be applied to other high British officials in the Egyptian service.Before arriving at any decision on this difficult point I feel it only fair to place before you the views of the Cabinet, and to consult you as to the feasibility of proceeding on the lines above described.Appendix B.Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby to Mr. Austen Chamberlain. (ReceivedFebruary 13.)(No. 67.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, February 12, 1925.YOUR telegram No. 43. -Though it is true that question of appointment of Egyptian as Sirdar has not been formally raised by &quot;Egyptian Government or the King, both Ziwar and Sidky have since Sir L. Stack&apos;s death frequently urged in conversation with me that we should assent to such an appointment, and so has Nashat on behalf of King Fuad. I have on each occasion informed them that I considered it premature to raise question. Fact remains that, far from being distasteful to King Fuad, appointment is eagerly desired both by him, by Government and by public, though perhaps not by senior officers of army, and it is probably known that Sir Lee Stack had contemplated a division of Egyptian and Sudanese commands and abandonment of former to Egyptian hands.This step would be in accordance with policy declared in 1922, which has already been taking gradual effect in army, as in other Departments, by progressive elimination -tion of British officers serving in Egypt.Such small risks as there are in juxtaposition of British-Egyptian forces would perhaps be very slightly increased by a change in command of latter. It would also, I think, render more probable some development of Egyptian army in numbers and equipment accompanied by a loss in efficiency. I do not anticipate that Nationalist agitators in the army would be seriously increased, while, on the other hand, new British Commander-in-chief would be likely to be a peculiar object of such agitation.It is a case where we should have to choose between abandoning post or dictating, not without difficulties, a British appointment, as to which I concur in remarks in paragraph 4 of your telegram. The King would not acquiesce in the assumption that he would appoint an Englishman, and he would not be moved by representations as to effect upon opinion in England of his not doing so.In view of above considerations and those advanced in my telegram No. 33, I recommend that we should agree to appointment of an Egyptian when suitable moment arrives. But I entirely concur in your view that no appointment should be made until we see how matters stand after elections, and I also consider that we should wait until after murderers of Sir Lee Stack have been convicted and their sentences executed.   I hope that they will be tried at March assizes.Further, I am of the opinion that we should aim at setting off this concession by obtaining at the same time from Egyptian Government an undertaking 1. To maintain &quot;post of inspector-general (or one of at least equal importance) for say three years in default of agreement to thecontrary, and to employ an Englishman in this post.2. To employ in default of agreement to the contrary no non-British foreigners in Egyptian army or air force.With regard to (1), Egyptian Government are, I understand, offering Spinks Pasha two years&apos; contract. They are most anxious to secure his services, are disposed, I gather, to appoint him adjutant-general and definite second-in-command, and any Egyptian Sirdar would necessarily be largely guided by his advice.
5.appendix C.Draft Telegram to Field-Marshal Viscount Allenby.YOUR No. 67.Your proposals are approved.You will understand that your condition (2) is essential. We cannot in any circumstances allow the introduction of foreign officers other than British into the Egyptian army. t.
