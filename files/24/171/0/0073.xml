APPENDIX    I.MEASURES OF THE CHURCH ASSEMBLY.Note on the relations between the Church assembly and Government Departments. :The Enabling Act of 1919 mck.es- no prcviaicmJor any ,consultation with the-Government or with Government Depart ments to take pl&amp;ee&apos;, so th&amp;-t the .-..processes&apos;mbly are under no obligation whatever to give the Government any intimation of the provisions of a lie a sure before the Measure is actually presented to Parliaments      In practice, however&apos;,, apart from the Reports of the Proceedings of the assembly whi ah are available in the press, they dc not spring these Measures as a surprise, but the secretary of the assembly has alvays forwarded copies of Measures for their informal tion to &quot;such Departments as he considers may be concerned. In December; - 12&amp;fi,  the Archbishop ef Canterbury asked the . then Prime Minister whether,  in respect of two Measures then in draft,  the Government would give an assurance that so far as the Measures affected the crown1 s rights and privileges,  these rights weuld be placed at the disposal of Parliament&quot;.   He pointed cut that such an assurance would &quot;enable a discussion to go forward without the hampering sense thf-t it may be render. d futile by a sub-sequent discovery that Crown rights tre affected ana are not at the disposal of Parliament,&quot;     The opinion, of the Lew Officers was taken as to whether this assurance&apos;, could
be given ana their advice was to the effect that it was not desirable, even if possible-,  th&amp; t such an intimation as the x.r oh bishop desired should be given in the Assembly. The proper time for such assent to be signified was after the Measures in question had been laid before^farli wnent.In accordance with this opinion the Government1 s attitude towards any Measure has never been indicated to the Church Assembly beforehand.    But the Measure when it comes before Parliament cannot be amended,  and there is thus always the risk that,  though in full concurrence with the principle of a Measure,  rejection may be forced on parliament&amp;ment by the presence of one objectionable clause or by some minor detfcil which: could h,      easily have been adjusted by arrangement beforehand.,      This consideration was so present to the mind of the spokesman for the late Government when certain Measures were being discussed in the ncuse of Commons on the  8th May last that he made the following statements&quot;We are s o unfortunately situated that the  details of tiiese Measures are not put before the Government-    They are not acquainted with the Measures at all till they are actually handed to them in a finished state,  so that if some small part of a Measure were objected to,  the Govern-ment would have to recommend the House to reject it in tote.      That is a very unfortunate position to be put in, and so far as this Measure is concerned.,  we   have no object&apos; ion to it, but we went it clearly und erstocd  that this must be no precedent, ana if, as they can under the cabling Act,  the Church Assembly should pass serious Measures    &quot;
affecting the rights of this House and the Constitution of the Realm, we should certainly tc.ke steps to prevent it, i,e i think that the position of the, bpus e of commons and the Government vis-a-vis the Church kssembly cculd be verymuch impro ved if.....we ^ h o d a oe retain.....amount of con saltationon these Measures before they are placed before us.^This invitation for further collaboration was tfken up unofficially on the part of members of the standing Committee of the Assembly and methods were discussed, whereby the Government might be kept in closer touch with the activities of the Assembly.      To meet this end it was arranged that a number of copies ef projected Measures should be forwarded by the secretary of the Assembly to the Prime ministers Secretary, and tin organisation was set up in the Treasury for distributing these Measures to the. various Departments conoerned and for collating their observations thereon.    This arrangement has been put in train so recently that on only one Measure (The Clergy Pensions Measure) have the observations of Depart-nents been obtained: and, pending the result of the Com-mitteels decision on the subject of consultation between the Government and the Church Assembly, no action has been taken in regard to communicating to the Assembly the cem-ments on this Measure.    A note of these comments is contained in a separate paper.It should bt adde^ that during the conversations by which this arrangement .&apos;f keeping the Government, informed of projected Measures was arrived at, stress was consistentlylaid on the fact th-. t tt-is ass entirely without prejudice te the attitude which, when any given Measure came before the House,  the Government would finally adopt towards it.(Intld.)

aPEENDK,II. JtegJEXJks .t i e IL t P.. S i r JPh il l^,BaJ-er^v/ilbraham.6th February,  1925.Dear Sir Philip,With reference to previous correspondence as a result of whioh a purely informal arrangement has been reached under which copies of Measures of the Church Assembly are sent to the Private Secretary at 10, Downing Street,  I am desired by the First Lord of the Treasury to put on record that these copies are for the information of Departments which may possibly be affected directly er by implication, and I enclose a draft of the suggested procedure which, if it commends itself to yow,  it is proposed to adopt and whioh we think,  if adopted, will expedite matters-    The procedure when approved will in due course be notified to the Departments.It must be clearly understood that the fact that no comments are forwarded to you in the case of a particular Measure does not for a moment imply that the Government agrees with the Measure.It must also be clearly understood that comments transmitted to you from this Offioe, even if they are accepted by the Church Assembly, do not in any degree prejudice the decision of the Government with regard to any Measure as a whole.    This decision can only be announced in Parliament.Yours sincerely,Sir Philip Baker-Wilbraham, Bart.
SUG G 3 ST ED^ PR OCE DV REIt is suggested that you should continue to send to the Prime Minister7 s Private Secretary who dealsjwith Church Patronage twenty copies of each Measure as submitted for general approval and at every subsequent stage whenever the Measure is reprinted until it is in the form in which it is submitted to the Ecclesiastical Committee.The comments,  if any,   of the Departments will be obtained and forwarded to you at each stage with the least possible delayc    Copies will also be sent at the same time to the Chairman of the Ecclesiastical Committee..I feel sure you will agree that it is desirable for the Assembly to await the receipt o  the Departmental comments before any Measure receives final approval .
