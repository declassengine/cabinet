This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;is Government. 2 () 1Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1925.SECRET.Copt No.       QC,P. 51 (25).THE CABINET.DEFENCE OF IRAQ.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.I circulate for the information of the Cabinet some comments by the General Staff on 0178 the scheme prepared by the Chief of the Air Staff, and circulated under cover of 427 Cabinet Paper 16 (25) by the Secretary of State for Air.L. W.-E.The War Office,2nd February, 1925.The General Staff agree that the only chance of securing the ultimate efficiency of the Iraq army is to hand it over to British officers. Whether or not officers of the right stamp can be found in the required numbers is a doubtful point which requires further investigation.The test of the whole scheme lies in its ability to meet the situation which will arise when the moment comes for the Imperial garrison to leave Iraq. It is hardly conceivable that a corps of 169 British officers could be left behind in the service of the Arab potentate of a remote region with which the British Government have severed all connection/, and which is beyond the reach of effective military support or intervention.It is clear that if these officers all depart (as it seems they would have to do), the Iraq army would be left without guidance or leadership. And it seems necessary, therefore, to try to evolve some compromise based on (a) the simultaneous training during the mandatory period of Iraq officers for the higher appointments and commands of the Army ; and (b) the possibility of leaving behind a small British . Advisory Military Commission to assist the Iraq army in establishing itself on its own feet.The General Staff are afraid that to leave behind in Iraq a large corps of British officers in the Iraq army (even supposing these were prepared to stay) would form a commitment which the British Government would be unable to ignore and which would defeat their purpose of terminating their liability.26/Ptg/364   100   2/25   W.O.P.   1704
