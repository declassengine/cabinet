[This Document is the Property of Hfr Britannic Maje*ty&apos;^Govgnment. ] Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1925.SECRET.O.P. 96 (25).CABINET.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction oe the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.]I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a draft despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington regarding a new Naval Conference at Washington for the further limiting of naval armaments and expenditure.Draft Despatch to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No.    .)Sir, Foreign Office, February    , 1925.IN the course of my farewell conversation with Mr. Kellogg we touched, amongst -other great questions, on the prospects of further disarmament and the possibility of holding another conference at Washington to continue and develop the work of the conference of 1922.2. I need not remind your Excellency how gladly His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the invitation to that conference, nor need I recall their hearty and immediate response to the general scheme proposed by Mr. Hughes. No Government more readily accepted nor has any more loyally fulfilled the obligations then subscribed by the most important naval Powers. The decisions of that conference have done much to restrict the growth of a fresh international competition in naval La, armaments and to relieve Wburden of taxation which would otherwise have fallen to be borne by the taxpayers of our respective countries.3. I have now to request that your Excellency will formally repeat to the Secretary of State the assurance which in conversation I have given to the Ambassador, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would cordially welcome the summoning of a new conference to be held at Washington, and would most readily join with the other great naval Powers in further limiting naval armaments and expenditure.4. It will be for the convening Power to consider in what directions progress may be most readily achieved. It is obvious that there are geographical and other reasons for which the ratio already agreed on for capital ships could not be applied to the case of cruisers. But His Majesty&apos;s Government have no doubt that, with the co-operation of the other naval Powers, further substantial progress could be made. Tn particular and without excluding other matters, it would seem to His Majesty&apos;s Government that discussion on all or any of the following points might well lead to an agreement which would sensibly relieve the burdens on our national finances and lessen the danger of war : &apos;(1.) Dimensions and armament of cruisers. (2.) Armament of aircraft carriers.(3.) Total number, dimensions and armament of submarines. (4.) Dimensions and armament of destroyers.2687   [12708]
