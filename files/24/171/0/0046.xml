[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]SECRET.CP. 46 (25).Copy No.39INTER-ALLIED DEBTS.THE only immediate question which the Cabinet have to settle is the answer we have promised to send in accordance with my letter of the 13th January to M. Clementel&apos;s letter of the 10th January. We do not therefore need at this stage to commit ourselves to any definite method for payment by the French of their debt, nor to decide upon terms or figures. Our task is simply to place the French Government in a position to propose a scheme for our consideration, and to indicate to them broadly the main principles by which we are guided and the scale and proportion we have in mind. When, and if, any proposals are made to us, we shall no doubt find them wholly inadequate; and it will be then, and not till then, that we shall have to formulate our counter-suggestions and that negotiations for a settlement will ensue. Let us not therefore complicate our immediate and comparatively easy task by discussions of the intricate and disputable issues which will be raised at a later stage, and which, even when decided, will themselves form only the basis of hard bargaining.I have, however, for the purposes of our immediate answer to M .Clementel, been forced to arrive at some conclusions in my own mind of a general and provisional character, both as to method and amount. In particular it is necessary to have a clear idea of what is to happen in the event of a total failure of the Dawes annuities, and what is to happen after the possible cessation of those annuities in 1962. The full fruition of the Dawes scheme&quot; would probably enable us to secure from Europe a complete equivalent for our American payments. On the other hand, we must, as reasonable men, face the fact that a total failure of the Dawes plan would leave us with a heavy deficit. What, then, is the intermediate point in the yield of the Dawes annuities at which we should- claim to be covered by France (and Italy) as against America ? What is the minimum we should exact from France (and Italy) in the event of a total failure of all payments from Germany?Opinions will differ on this,. I find that whereas four years ago T was strongly opposed to waiving our claims against France and Italy (except as part of a general cancellation), I am now rather in opposition to those who from, the other extreme wish to demand the fullest repayments from our Continental Allies. I have always thought that they, and France at any rate, can pay a substantial sum, and that they ought to-pay a substantial sum.   I have never thought they could pay the whole,[12615]b
or ought in any circumstances to be asked by us to pay the whole. I have therefore with some trepidation roughed out a purely tentative exposition of my own views as to how this problem should be handled and the sort of figures which we might reasonably try to obtain. I doubt whether we shall ever get so much. I do not doubt that we ought to try most resolutely to secure it.The answer which the Cabinet should now approve for transmission to the French Government is not inconsistent with the method I have outlined; but it in no way commits us to that method. The statement that we should expect to be indemnified as against America, even if only half the Dawes reparations were received, goes considerably beyond the figures I have indicated in my table. This is no doubt only prudent at the outset of negotiations. On the other hand, we do not wish to send an answer which will chill and check any further proposal by France. We wish to encourage her to make a proposal, and so to take a step towards a practical result rather than to give satisfaction to our natural inclination to exact our strict legal or at least our full moral rights.w. s. c.January 30, 1925.Action Required. Draft Reply to M. Clementel.His Majesty&apos;s Government adheres to the principle of the Balfour note. Much of the substance of this note was repeated in Lord Curzon&apos;s note of the 11th August, 1923, more particularly in paragraphs 2 and 8 to 11 of the enclosure. But paragraphs 6 and 7 of the enclosure, which refer to Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s proposals of January 1923, are clearly no longer applicable to the existing facts of the situation. These paragraphs were written before the framing of the Dawes plan and on the assumptions that the total German liability would be fixed at a figure less than that adopted in the Dawes plan, particularly in the earlier years, and that bonds of the kind contemplated in Mir. Bonar Law&apos;s plan, with the rights of redemption given in that plan, would be issued. These assumptions are not now tenable. It follows that Lord Curzon&apos;s statement cannot, therefore, in this respect be reaffirmed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.In the application of the Balfour note to the existing situation among the Allied and Associated Powers and with regard to Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to consider proposals under which the existing French debt to Great Britain would be appreciably reduced provided that the principle of a definite payment by France from her own national resources, fixed with due regard to her relative wealth and tax-paying capacity, is assured without reference to reparations.
The principle of the Balfour note is that Great Britain should receive from Europe payments equivalent to those she is under obligation to make to the United States of America. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept a position in which this principle could only be achieved upon the basis of the full normal yield of the Dawes annuities. They recognise, of course, that a total failure of these annuities would place all the Allies in a position of difficulty; and in such an event which they certainly do not expect  Great Britain would be prepared to share in the common misfortune. While in no way countenancing any failure of Germany to fulfil her obliga-tions, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that they should be fully indemnified by their European allies in respect of the British obligations to the United States on the basis that only half the Dawes annuities are actually received.They are of opinion, therefore, that there should be a fixed annual payment by France not dependent upon German Reparations, and an additional payment, which might take the form of a percentage of the receipts under the Dawes annuities, the latter to be subject to revision in accordance with the principle of the Balfour note that no more will be taken from the Allies and Germany than is required from Great Britain by the United States, due allowance being made for the full period of British debt annuit)^ payable to the United States Government. In estimating the amounts at which these payments shall be fixed in the first instance, it will only be possible to take account of prospective receipts from other Allies to the extent to which these can be treated as good assets, e.g,, the whole of the Russian war debt to Great Britain must necessarily be ignored. His Majesty&apos;s Government, will, of course, continue to use its best efforts to secure an acknowledgement of this debt and to arrange for its discharge. Any receipts which may thus ultimately be obtained will, of course, when they actually become available, operate, in accordance with the principle of the Balfour note, to reduce the payment due from the other allies. They would be glad to receive from the French Government proposals on these lines.His Majesty&apos;s Government is under obligation to pay the United States of America approximately  33 millions a year as from 1923 until 1932 inclusive, and approximately  38 millions a year for more than fifty years thereafter. They have already paid over  70 millions in excess of their receipts to date from German reparations, and they have not yet received payment in respect of war debts from the Allies.His Majesty&apos;s Government are, as has been stated, prepared, in consideration of the fact that war debts between Allies have been incurred in a common cause, to contemplate a large reduction in their legal claims against their Allies. They have already consented not merely to reduce their claims against the Allies to an amount necessary to cover their own payments in respect of the British war debt to the United States Govern-ment, but actually to apply the whole of the United Kingdom share of [12615] b 2
German reparations to that purpose and limit the payments to be demanded from the Allies to the balance. This means that Great Britain not only takes to her own charge the whole of her own war damages, but also the value of the very large amount of foreign securities devoted to financing trie common cause before the United States entered the war, in respect of which Great Britain would be equitably entitled to ask for an equivalent payment of debt owing to her by her Allies.In view of the fact that the burden of the British debt to America would not have been incurred but for the loans which Great Britain made to her Allies and largely to France, it appears to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the very minimum which they can ask is that France should ensure that the British taxpayer (who will, in any case, continue to bear the heavy burden of the domestic loans raised to provide that part of the advances to France of which repayment is not claimed), shall not, in addition to sacrificing the relief to which he is justly entitled from German reparations, be called upon to shoulder a nett burden in respect of this debt.It is in this spirit and in the light of these considerations that His Majesty&apos;s Government is prepared to discuss the proposals which they now invite the French Government to formulate for settling the question of the French war debt. -His Majesty&apos;s Government will deal with such proposals with complete frankness and with due consideration for the special circumstances of the initial years.
SUGGESTIONS ON METHOD AND SCALE.(1.) In framing any schemes certain facts must be borne in mind.First, the Treasury proposed to the Cabinet in 1920 to cancel all claims by us on our European Allies.Secondly, Mr. Asquith, as Leader of the Liberal Party, declared publicly in 1922 in favour of cancelling our claims against Europe, irrespective of any arrangements that might be made with the United States.-Thirdly, the successive indications of British Government policy contained in the Balfour note, the Bonar Law and Curzon proposals and my own recent declarations in the House of Commons.Fourthly, the American debt settlement in effect scales down the present value of our debt to them by 28 per cent.(2.) There are certain unpalatable probabilities, verging on certainties, which must also be faced :; First, the United States will exact its full claims from us. &apos;Secondly, there is no hope of our recovering an equivalent amount from Europe in the event of a total failure of the Dawes plan.Thirdly, France and Italy, although willing to pay something for recovering their financial reputation, will not pay more than they think that reputation is worth for the purposes of future borrowing.Fourthly, it is useless to count on Russia, and the minor Allies are negligible.(3.) Proceeding on these general assumptions it will be necessary to make our claims on Europe relate directly or indirectly to the payments of the Dawes annuities from Germany, and to take as the basis of departure the existing Spa percentages. Accordingly, I propose that we should by every means in our power require France to assume annually a minimum burden amounting to about one-fourth of our total payments to the United States, viz.,  8^ millions out of  33 millions annually till 1932 and  9-i millions out of  38 millions annually thereafter till 1984 when the American debt is extinguished. The above would constitute the minimum payment guaranteed by France, irrespective of any receipts from Germany, and even in the event of a total failure by Germany. It would continue after the Dawes scheme had lapsed, and would be directly related to the American obligation. The assumption by France in all circumstances of one-fourth of our obligation to the United States is therefore set up as our first guiding principle.(4.) The French contribution to the British debt payments to the United States should be expressed in terms of Dawes percentages, and should take the form of the cession by France to Great Britain of a proportion of her Spa 52 per cent, share.   But the amount of Reparations likely to be paid
by Germany under the Dawes plan is impossible to predict and will certainly fluctuate. It would be foolishly sanguine to base any scheme of French (or Italian) debt repayments on the normal or maximum Dawes annuities. I therefore propose., for the purposes of this scheme, to assume that only half of the maximum  125 millions payable by Germany under Dawes, i.e., 62^ millions, will in fact be received in the Reparations pool after allowing for the service of the German loan and military and prior charges. (Say  12J millions.) This assumes a total minimum payment by Germany of  75 millions a year for thirty-seven years out of a total maximum of  125 millions under Dawes. The  62J millions assumed to be available in the Reparations pool I shall call hereinafter the &quot; Standard Minimum Dawes Reparations,&quot; or shortly &quot; Standard Reparations.&quot;(5.) It is on the basis of these &quot; Standard Reparations &quot; that the French (and Italian) percentages will be calculated, i.e., 1 per cent, equals  625,000. Thirteen per cent, would yield nearly 8J millions.  8^ millions is one-fourth of the present British annual debt payment of  33 millions to the United States. In 1932 the British debt payment to the United States rises to  38 millions; and as the principle of a one-fourth contribution is to be maintained, the French percentage would have to rise from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent., and the yield from about  8^ millions to about  9^ millions. France would therefore be invited to guarantee to pay to Great Britain a minimum of  8^ millions a year till 1932, and  9-V millions a year till 1984. on account of 13 per cent, and 15 per cent, of standardised Dawes reparations, irrespective of any failure by Germany to reach the standard figure, and irrespective of the possible termination of the Dawes annuities by 1962.(6.) But the Dawes plan may yield larger amounts than the &quot; Standard Reparations.&quot; In this case, the French percentages ceded to us will become more valuable. Should the normal or maximum Dawes annuities be yielded, about  110 millions a year would come into the reparations pool. Thirteen per cent, of this is  14^ millions, and 15 per cent, is  16^ millions. In other words, France would pay Great Britain a minimum of  8^ millions till 1932 and  9-j millions till 1984, or alternatively the aforesaid percentages of the Dawes reparations, which-ever was the greater. A settlement on these lines would of course comprise the waiving by France of all counter-claims in respect of the  53-1 millions gold deposit or any other matters of any kind.(7.) The Italian debt to Great Britain would be treated separately and subsequently, but in a similar manner. Italy receives only 10 per cent, of the Dawes annuities. She has also her own debt to the United States. It would not be practicable in these circumstances to require from Italy the cession of more than 5 per cent, out of her 10 per cent, of her Dawes Reparations. She would be invited to guarantee this 5 per cent, of &quot;Standard Reparations&quot; in the same manner as France, i.e., five units of  625,000 equals  3^ millions. She would pay Great Britain only one-third as much as France, but would, cede twice as large a proportion of her
reparations. As it is not practicable for Italy to pay more&apos; than one-half her share of reparations, she would not be called upon like France to increase her percentage in 1932, The Italian payment of  3^ millions would, however, like the French be guaranteed on her national credit, and would continue during the whole sixty years of the British debt payments to the United States.(8.) Unless the Dawes annuities exceed the &quot; Standard Reparations,&quot; we shall have to face a deficit on our payments to the United States of approximately  11-J millions a year up till 1962, when the Dawes scheme ends. Thereafter until 1982 we should only receive from France and Italy  12f millions, and our deficit would&quot; rise after 1962 to  25J millions. How is this gap to be filled? In my judgment it can only be filled by the full success of the Dawes scheme. Now the full Dawes Annuities rise to  125 millions only in 1929, so that in any case we shall have a deficit for the first four years. But if full Reparations were received from. 1927 onwards, the British receipts from Germany, from France and from Italy would aggregate  44 millions, giving a surplus over our  33 millions American debt payment of  11 millions, and the deficits of the.first four years would be cleared off by 1932. In 1932 under full Dawes receipts and full United States charge we should receive  46\ millions against  38 millions, showing a surplus of  8^ millions. Thus on the &quot;Full Dawes &quot; basis we should have thirty annual surpluses of  8^ millions from, 1933 to 1962. These surpluses, if devoted to the more rapid extinction of the American debt, would constitute a Sinking Fund of very great power. A rough estimate shows that it would reduce the charge falling on us after 1962 by at least an additional  10 millions, leaving us with not more than  158 millions to pay. It would have to be agreed with France and with Italy that this deficit should be a first charge upon any further payments from Germany which may become available after 1962.(9.) The effect of this scheme would be to assign to the United States the British 22 per cent, of German annuities, 15 oer cent, out of the French percentage, 5 per cent, out of the Italian percentage : total, 42 per cent. They would also probably obtain on their claims against France and Italy equivalent contributions from these countries, viz., another 20 per cent,  in  all.    To   this  must  be  added   their   own   newly  acquiredper cent. Thus, when, and if, the Dawes scheme was fully operative, the percentages of German reparations would be as follows : United States, directly or under British, French or Italian guarantees, 64^ per cent.; France, about 22 per cent; Belgium, 4^; minor Powers and adjustments, about 9J; Great Britain, 0; Italy, 0. The United States would thus come obviously and increasingly into the position of being the principal beneficiary to the extent of two-thirds from German reparations. France would, however, have a sufficiently large interest in their extraction to make it worth her while to keep up the military pressure without which nothing will be received. The whole responsibility for this process will rest for generations upon the United States; and it is in this moral pressure,
reinforced by the German-American vote at successive Presidential elections, that the best prospect lies of a reduction by the United States of her claims on Europe. . ,(10.) To encourage this process it might be arranged that any reduction by the United States of her demands should be shared on a basis of full Dawes annuities being obtained in (say) the following percentages: Great Britain, 50 per cent, until she was neither a gainer nor a loser; France, 20 per cent, in any case; Italy,TO per cent.; Germany, 20 per cent.I append a table illustrating this scheme.
