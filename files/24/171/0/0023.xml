THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. JOINT CABINET MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.&apos;  - - QJUVENILE UNEMPLOYMENT. ORET... ----------------&apos; -------p.S5(S5). We should like the Cabinet to consider future policy on this question.The problem Is that children leaving school at 14 and not obtaining work have no incentive to attend Juvenile Unemployment Centres or any form of educational Institution until they come within the scope of the Unemployment Insuranoe Aot at 16.     To meet this problem the late Government proposed to lower the insurance age to 14.     This proposal was rejected by the House of Commons.    Mr. Trevelyan then informed the House that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had sanctioned the expenditure of  440,000 a year in England and Scotland on an extension of educational facilities for the benefit of children between 14 and 16.     He proposed to spend this money in several ways,    of which only one has had any appreciable results. This was the so-called Super-Grant on Free Places in Seoondary Sohools, which is calculated next year to cost from  150,000 to  180,000.     This Super-Grant is open to a variety of very serious objections and the President of the Board of Education has decided to withdraw it.    At the same time Mr. Trevelyan revived the Advisory Committee on Juvenile Organisations and asked it to report upon the whole problem.    This Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir Herbert Lewis, reported soon after the present Government oame into offioe.     They recommended the lowering of the insurance age to 15 and also the re-introduction of Compulsory Day Continuation Sohools, a proposal which is quite impracticable at the moment.    The Committee recommended that their Report should be published and if its publication is pressed for in Parliament it may be difficult to refuse it.    In any case the nature of the Report is sure to leak out.
Mr. Trevelyan also was very anxious to encourage the Looal Authorities to pass Byelave raising the school-leaving age to 15 and he was, in practice, prepared to give a very wide latitude to Local Authorities to exempt employed children from the operation of those Byelaws.     The Board of Education regard such wholesale exemption as being quite contrary to the provisions of the Education Acts, and the President has made a statement to this effect in the House, Two counties have passed Byelaws raising the school age to 15, which have been approved, but very few Authorities will be prepared to follow their example if the Board insist on the strict operation of such Byelaws.It may therefore be charged against the present Government that they have oanoelled what little had been done or proposed by the late Government to deal with juveniles between 14 and 16,     We are also in the position of having received the Report of a Committee, to which at present -ve do not propose to give any effect.In these circumstances we think the question should be considered by a Cabinet Committee with a view, at any rate, to defining the Government^ attitude before we are exposed to criticism in Parliament.The Board of Education have been considering tentatively a possible alternative, namely, to introduce a short Bill giving Looal Authorities power to compel the attendance of unemployed children at Juvenile Unemployment Centres after leaving school, up to the age of 16.    .Such legislation might not be very effective, but Byelaws might be passed in some of the worst areas and their enforcement through the School Attendance service, though it might be dlffioult, oould
20th January, 1926.probably be made fairly effective.      The ooet involved is difficult to estimate, but even if fairly general advantage were taken of such legislation in bad areas, the oost would almost oertainly be considerably less than the money which will be saved to the Exchequer by the termination of the Super-Grant on Free Places.We do not wish to pronounoe any opinion on this proposal at the present moment but we should like it and the Report of the Juvenile Organisations Oommittee to be considered by a Cabinet Oommittee.(Intd.)
