fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]      * &quot; -iSECRET..   asCP. 71 (25).NAVY ESTIMATES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. THE paper circulated by the First Lord to-day will put very plainly before the Cabinet the reality and gravity of the Naval position towards which we are moving. It should be observed first of all that no attempt is made by the Admiralty to dispute the broad truth of the forecast of Naval expenditure set out by me on page 2 of my CP. 39 (25). In this I stated that proceeding on the present lines &quot;the Naval Estimates for 1926-27 would be about  12 millions above those of 1925-26 and those of 1927-28 perhaps  7 millions higher still. This would give us gross Naval Estimates in 1926-27 of  81$ millions, in 1927-28 of  88^ millions and in 1928-29 of over  90 millions.&quot; It is, of course, impossible to forecast the future Naval expenditure of the United States or Japan; but the expenditure for next year of the United States is approximately  60 millions and that of Japan in the current year is about  20 millions. There can be no dispute that a naval policy on this scale will completely absorb our whole available surplus from existing taxation, will prevent any remissions of taxation, not only now, but in the next three years, and will exclude from our pro-gramme any appreciable measures of social reform. There can be na dispute that in these circumstances Naval development will become virtually the sole policy of the Government and that all our efforts will be required to vindicate it.2. Such an immense sacrifice and exertion could be justified only upon the clearest evidence of mortal peril. Parliament and the country would consent to the policy only if convinced of the reality of the peril. They could only be convinced through the full exposure by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary of the profound and incurable character of the antagonism subsisting between Great Britain and Japan and of the increasing menace of the Japanese preparations. Such evidence was adduced before the war, under the necessary reserves of public statement, in regard to Germany, If an equal conviction of mortal peril from Japan is established in the public mind, I am sure the sacrifices will be made, and of course the money must be found. But nothing short of this will suffice to defend Naval expenditure on the scale now demanded.[12661] B
3. I wish to give a precise definition of the expression &quot; mortal peril &quot; viz., a physical assault so sudden and so violent as to deprive Great Britain finally of the -power to convert to war purposes the latent energy of the Empire. This was, in fact, the peril we faced from Germany before the war. Great as are the injuries which Japan, if she &quot; ran&apos; amok,&quot; could inflict upon our trade in the Northern Pacific, lamentable as would be the initial insults which she might offer to the British flag, I submit that it is beyond the power of Japan, in any period which we need now foresee, to take any action which would prevent the whole might of the British Empire being eventually brought to bear upon her. And I believe that this fact, if true, will exercise a dominating influence on the extremely sane and prudent counsels which we have learned over a long period of time to expect from the Japanese Government.4. Against &quot;mortal perils &quot; one must always be prepared, so far as national strength will go. We must, at all costs, be able to see our way, albeit through years of suffering, to a reasonable prospect of ultimate victory. But once the peril is not of a mortal character, the whole argument falls to a very important, but none the less secondary plane. We have to balance annoyance against expenditure, two or three years of vexation against many years of penury. And in casting such balances one is bound to consider not only the degree, but the probability of the danger. The First Lord in his Introductory Note seems to claim that the Admiralty must be the judge of the probabilities of war with Japan. I submit that in this sphere the Foreign Office have the prevailing-voice. It is for them to judge whether deep and active antagonism exists between this country and Japan, or between any groups of Powers with which the fortunes of Great Britain or Japan are inextricably involved. Such antagonisms were plainly apparent between Great Britain and Germany and between the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance for a long period before the war. If the Foreign Secretary considers that a conflict between Great Britain and Japan may well be inevitable, it is for him so to apprise the Cabinet; and it is for the Cabinet to prescribe.to the Admiralty the responsibilities which are laid upon them in the circum-stances. I demur to the claim of the Admiralty to judge the foreign situation.5. I therefore submit to the Cabinet, first, that we are not in &quot; mortal peril &quot; (as above defined) from Japan; secondly, that the statements of the Foreign Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, supported by Lord Curzon, on the probability of a war with Japan ought to be taken as the ruling data on this subject; and, thirdly, that nothing less than clear proof of (a) &quot; mortal peril &quot; or (b) the probability of war within a certain period will be sufficient to satisfy Parliament of the need to side-track all other aims of policy in favour of a vast naval expenditure.
6. Passing from these general observations, I address myself to certain points of detail arising from the Admiralty paper.The tables on page 9 do not give a true picture of relative nava! strengths, actual and potential. Take, for instance, Cruisers. It is true that Japan has laid down 18 cruisers since 1919. It is misleading to state that Great Britain has only increased her strength in the same period by laying down 5. We have, in fact, completed since the war 3 cruisers of 9,750 tons, these being incomparably the most powerful modern cruisers afloat in the world; we are completing another of 9,750 tons and two of 7,550 tons, and we are building 5 more of 10,000 tons. These 11 British cruisers aggregate 1Q4,100 tons; the 18 Japanese cruisers aggregate 102,230. But the picture of relative naval strength cannot be understood if comparison is limited to the years since the war. During the war the Japanese arsenals were profitably occupied in making munitions for the Allies, and in the 5 years preceding 1919 Japan laid down only 2 cruisers. In the same period Great Britain laid down or completed no less than *32. Therefore, taking a ten-year period, the total would become Tons.Japan 20 cruisers, aggregating    ......        109,230Great Britain 43, aggregating 236,1407. Again, consider the Aircraft Carriers. The Admiralty table on page 9 would seem to indicate that Japan possessed or was about to possess 3, the United States 2, while Great Britain was only converting 3. What are the facts ? Great Britain at the present time has 4, the United States and Japan have each 1 small vessel. By the time that Japan and the United States have 3 each we shall have 6, with another completing. Very intricate arguments may be employed on either side upon the qualities of these various aircraft carriers, and the dates at which they will be commis-sioned for service. I will not complicate this paper with their discussion. I court an examination of the statement that our lead and superiority over either the United States or Japan in aircraft carriers and generally in naval aviation is not less marked than the figures here set out suggest.8. I did not and do not contest the argument that further submarine construction is necessary. After all, a submarine is the only vessel in the Admiralty new construction programme (costing  21^ millions) which can strike a decisive blow at a capital unit. All the rest of that immense expense is devoted to ancillaries. None of it would count in that estimate of the strength of Navies on which the prestige and effectiveness of British diplomacy to a great extent depends through long years of peace.* Excluding- the quasi-Battle-cruisers Courageous, Furious and Glorious, which are to bfc converted into aircraft carriers.[12661] b 2
9. The Admiralty paper on page 12 sets forth very truly the great shrinkage of our Fleet from the scale reached on the eve of the war with Germany. In 1914 we were able to maintain in the First and Second Fleets on the basis of full active service crews in war 45 battleships, 7 battle cruisers and 60 cruisers; whereas now we are only maintaining 17 battleships, 3 battle cruisers, 32 cruisers and 10 flotilla leaders in the same status. Moreover, in 1914 we had 151,000 men in Vote A, as against 100,000 now. And finally, we had a new construction vote of  18^ millions, as against a new construction vote this year of less than  7 millions. In 1914 the enormous fleet and new construction were maintained at a cost of no more than  51-1 millions nett; whereas the far smaller Fleets and Establishments of to-day cost in the present year nearly  56 millions. If we deduct from each of these totals the respective new construction votes, the comparable figures become  33 millions in 1914 and  49 millions in 1925. In other words, the general expense of naval administration has advanced so greatly that it costs in 1925 half as much again to maintain less than half the Fleets of 1914. Thus one might say that the cost of the Naval services in proportion to resultant war power has advanced more than three times beyond pre-war conditions. Of course, the cost of everything has gone up. The index figure ruling over the general field is 180 compared to 100 pre-war. But the index figure of Naval economy has deteriorated from 100 to something between 300 and 400. Making every allowance for the growth of non-effective votes, I am convinced that this altogether disproportionate increase in the cost of Naval power is largely due to the natural wish of the Admiralty to have everything superfine and perfect, to multiply every factor of safety at every stage, and to deny themselves nothing which they feel will improve the material and moral efficiency of the great instrument over which they preside.10. The Admiralty are indisposed to reduce their demands for an addition of 4,350 men to Vote A. I am sure that there are at least half a dozen modes of manning the existing Fleet in peace or war on a basis of 100,000 officers and men. I have shown how the pre-war war complements of existing ships were greatly below their present peace, complements, and still more below their approved super-war complements. A revision of the quarter bills of ships in commission, together with the same employment on mobilisation of the men of the Schools and shore establishments as was enforced in 1914, would enable our present Fleet to be maintained in a high standard of commission. But if this were not so, a small diminution of our cruisers on foreign service or of our ships maintained in full commission, and a transference of these vessels to something like the old Second Fleet scale, would provide the necessary saving in man power for peace purposes. The revival of the system of &quot;immediate reserves&quot;  for  a portion of these  ships might well be
accepted on mobilisation in the strategic and political circumstances which prevail.11. When we come to man power the Admiralty comparisons shift from Japan to the United States. They assert that the United States has *115,100 personnel, and they are astonished at their moderation in asking for an increase of 4,350. But the United States terms of service are on a far lower scale than the British. Their men are enlisted for &quot;two, three, four or six years, with the option of re-engaging. Ours all serve for twelve years and a large proportion continue for twenty-one. There can be no comparison between complements containing a large proportion of men serving for only two, three and four years, with complements com-posed entirely of life-long professionals. We must further remember, when reviewing the personnel of the United States Navy for the purpose of a one-power standard, the enormous reserves of trained officers and men and the seafaring population which this island possesses. Finally, it is worth noting that in this year, when we are asked to increase our numbers by 4,350, the United States is proposing a reduction of 1,500.12. I conclude by a general observation. I accept the One-P\ower Standard. I do not interpret that standard as meaning that we should maintain at least an equality in regard to the strongest points in both the American and Japanese navies. I do not interpret that standard in the sense that we should maintain a one-power standard against the United States and, in addition, be capable of levying war upon Japan in her own quarter of the globe. The one-power standard ought to be interpreted as the maintenance by us of a navy which will not, as a whole, be inferior or will not be regarded by foreign Powers or our Dominions as inferior to the navy of any other power, similarly considered as a whole.Endless arguments can no doubt be raised on the different factors going to make up the naval strength of any country. Surely on the whole the truest measure ought to be the money provision. The pay of the personnel of the United States Navy is nearly double our own. By a frugal and searching employment of our naval funds we ought to be able to realise with the same sum of money a far higher development of war power than is possible in the United States. Japan, on the other hand, has very cheap labour and very cheap personnel; but the Japanese estimates are less than  20 millions in the present year and show a reduction to  18^ millions for 1925-26. I cannot believe that on the basis of  57-J millions nett for 1925-26 and a rise to not more than  60 millions (including the Fleet Air Arm) in 1926-27 and succeeding years, it will not be possible for us* The U.S. official.figure seems to be 105,500.
to make adequate provision for Imperial Naval Defence. But to achieve these figures it is imperative (1) that there must be no serious commitments in new construction or new works which will be uncontrollable next year, (2) that there can be no addition to the numbers of men, and (3) that the accumulation of the Oil Fuel reserve must be spread over at least double the length of time now prescribed.&quot; w. s. c.February 7, 1925.
