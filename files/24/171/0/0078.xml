Papers Nos. 535-B, 546-B, 548-B and 552-B.)(Previous References : OLD. Minutes of 187th Meeting, Minute 4, and189th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Secretary covering a Report as to the policy of this country in regard to research work in connection with gas warfare, and also the present state of the preparedness of the Fighting Services in anti-gas measures, which had been prepared in accordance with Minute 4,[126751
Conclusion (iii), of the 187th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 535-B), and Memoranda which had been prepared by the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air on the same subject (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 546-B. 548-B and 552-B respectively).LORD CAVAN explained that recommendations for which the General Staff requested approval from the Committee of Imperial Defence were set out in C.I.D. Paper No. 546-B, a memorandum by the Secretary of State for War. At present there was no definite policy laid down as a guidance to the Fighting Siervices, and he considered that the situation was such as to demand an immediate decision. He then proceeded to detail the four recommendations contained in paragraph 3 of OLD. Paper No. 546-B, for which approval was now asked. He added that the War Office were in agreement with the amendment suggested by the Admiralty in their paper (OLD. Paper No. 548-B), to the effect that stocks should be provided and held in sufficient quantity to bridge over the period required to bring the machinery of production into operation.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the first recommendation put forward by the War Office with regard to the adoption of a formula which should serve as the basis of the policy of this country in regard to research work in connection with gas warfare, and the insertion of such a formula in the Field Service Regulations, &amp;o, of the British Army, had already been approved by the Committee of Imperial Defence during the tenure of office of the late Government. He considered that the previous recommendation of the Committee should be reaffirmed.LORD curzon stated that the recommendations for which the War Office were now asking approval entailed the adoption of a definite line of policy on the subject. He pointed out that such a policy might be open to adverse criticism, but in spite of this he considered that the Committee should give their approval to the recommendations put forward by the War Office and Admiralty. In following such a line of policy we should only be doing exactly what other countries were.doing. He pointed out that on the outbreak of war the Government would endeavour, in agreement with its Allies, to obtain from the enemy Governments an engagement not to use offensive gas as a weapon of war. Should an adverse reply to such a request be received, it was essential that this country should be in a position to take retaliatory measures, and the proposals now before the Committee were in reality an elementary precaution of self-defence.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE stated that the Air Ministry were in general agreement with the proposals put forward by the War Office. They considered, however, that the training of every man of the Home Defence Air Force in anti-gas measures was unnecessary. They considered that such training should be confined to the personnel of those units of the Air Force which would serve with an Expeditionary Force or with the Fleet Air Arm. He pointed out that a large number of civilians would form an integral part of units of the Home Defence Air Force, and expressed the opinion that there appeared to be no valid reason why such civilians should be protected from gas any more than civilians engaged in other essential public services. He considered that the money available in connection with Chemical Warfare would be better employed in research for the investigation of the possibilities of offensive gas measures rather than in laying down large stocks of offensive gas.Mr. BRIDGEMAN stated that he was unable to follow the argument, which had been put forward by the Secretary of State for Air, with regard to the point that it was unnecessary to train the personnel of the Home Defence Air Force in anti-gas measures.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD pointed out that the personnel of the Home Defence Air Force were on exactly the same footing as civilians engaged on vital services, such as fire brigades, ambulance work, police, &amp;c. The question of the protection of the personnel of a vital service as well as the protection of the civilian population as a whole was at present being investigated by the Sub-Committee on Air Raid Precautions. Until the recommendations of that Sub-Committee had been received he did not consider that it was desirable to lay down hard and fast rules with regard to the training of personnel of the Home Defence Air Force.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, January 5, 1925.Conclusions.THE COMMITTEE agreed to recommend-(i.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should approve the adoption of a formula, which should serve as the basis of the policy of this country in regard to research work in connection with gas warfare, similar to the formula which has already been adopted by the French Government and included as a foreword at the beginning of the French Field Service Eegulations (&quot;Instructions provisoires sur 1&apos;Emploi tactique des grandes Unites&quot;), the formula in question reading as follows : Respecting the international engagements to which France has subscribed, the French Government will endeavour at the beginning of a war, and in agreement with its allies, to -obtain from the enemy Govern-ment an engagement not to use offensive gas as a weapon of war. If this engagement is not obtained, the French Government will reserve its liberty to act according to circumstances.&quot;(ii.) That the War Office (and the other service departments) should be authorised to insert a paragraph on the lines of the above-mentioned formula in the Field Service Regulations and such other training Manuals as may appear desirable.(iii.) That the training of every man in the Fighting Services should be con-tinuous throughout his period of service, and should be sufficient to ensure that he is able to perform all his services day and night while protected against gas, and that such training should be considered a fundamental principle of the training in the Army.(iv.) That the question of the necessity or otherwise of the training of the personnel of the Home Defence Air Force on the lines mentioned in the preceding recommendation should be postponed pending the report of the Sub-Committee on Air Raid Precautions, which is considering the larger question of the protection required for all civilians engaged in essential public services.(v.) That all Service schools and commands be authorised to study the employ-ment of offensive gas, since the study of offensive gas is necessary to the study of protection against gas, and also in order that we may be in a position to retaliate immediately should the use of gas be forced upon us by our opponents./vi.) That steps should be taken to ensure the bulk production of gas should necessity arise, and that stocks should be provided and held sufficient to bridge over the period required to bring the machinery of production into operation.
