Agricultural Returns Bill aMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The accompanying Bill to: make compulsory the collection of the Annual Agricultural Returns has passed through the House of Lords in the sessions of 1923 and 1924-, but in each year progress in the House of Commons has bean prevented by the Dissolution of Parliament.The Ministry is required by Section 2 of the Board of Agriculture Act 1839 to collect and, prepare statistics relating to agriculture, but that Act made no provision for the manner in which the statistics were to be collected and the desired returns have been obtained on a voluntary basis.Section 15 of tho Corn Production Act 1917, on which the present 3ill is based, made the returns compulsory, but these compulsor-f powers disappeared when that Act was repealed in 1921.    Every year there are a few persons who decline to m::ke returns, others from whom they are obtained only after repeated application, and some who are careless in cfivinn; the necessary information.    To secure complete and accurate statistics, power to deal with such persons is desired.    This proposal is approved by the principal bodies representing agricultural opinion.Last year the House of Lords made two amendments, the first allowing a period of 28 days in which to make the return which should describe the position of the holding; on 4th June in each year, and be sent in on or immediately after that date.    It is very important to publish the preliminary statement as early as possible and 28 days for making the return is quite unnecessary.    The second amendment]RDT. Copy l!o. 1^,p. 21   (25)CABINET.
