CS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). C R E T.81(25)iC A B I N E T.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.THE CROYDON AERODROME,EXTENSION BILL. Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Air.r J     IiI1. Annexed to this memorandum is a &quot;draft of the CroydonAerodrome Extension Bill.    This is not a final draft, but I ciroulate it in its present form in view of the extreme urgency of its subject matter,    I do not, however anticipate that any but minor verbal amendments will be necessary^whichThe Court occurred atappointed to investigate the fatal accident Croydon on Christmas Eve found inter alia that -&quot;the aerodrome at Croydon is unsatisfactory. This was not the primary cause of the accident and I do not say more than that it may have been a contributory caiise&quot;.3. The enlargement and improvement of Croydon have been inhand for a considerable period, but further progress is impossible until such time as a highway known as Plough Lane can be diverted.4. It was hoped to obtain the diversion of Plough Lane bymeans of an order of ouarter sessions under the Highways Act, 1835, The just ices, however, found themselves unable to sign the necessary certificate for the reason &quot;that the proposed new highway would not be needed or more commodious to the public than the existing highway&quot;5. In these circumstances it is essential to accelerate thepassage of this Bill, which I believe to beventirely non-contro-versial except in so far as it concerns the point raised in paragraph .4 above.    Even so, having regard to the published findings of the Court  lnd the prominence which has been given to this finding in the press in the course of the past few days,  I doubt whether opposition is likely to arise from any quarter.6, At their meeting on Monday the 26th January, the Home ,Affairs Committee placed this Bill in List (C), viz.,  Important Bills mainly non-controversial.0   This classification was subsequently approved by the Cabinet.7. In view of the subsequent developments explained above,  I ask the Committee to authorise -(a)    the immediate transfer of the Croydon Aerodrome . Extension Bill from List (C) to List (B), viz., Essential Bills;(bO)   its introduction at the first possible opportunity.S.H.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.AIR MINISTRY.February 12th,  1925.0 H.A.C. 1st Cons.
