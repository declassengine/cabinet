THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CABINET. 3 f \%/ &apos;-c.p.. 18 (25).SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I desire to obtain an early decision of the Cabinet *m an impor-tant question,  as to the method of procedure, whioh should be adopted to give effect to our Safeguarding of Industries proposals.There is no difference of opinion as to the ultimate object we wish to attain.      That object is to impose general duties in special and exceptional, cases, where It is proved that an efficient industry of substantial importance is seriously affeoted to an abnormal and unprecedented degree by unfair foreign competition;   unfair competition being that kind of competition which was so described by the Prime Minister in his speeches both before the Election and in the Debate&apos; on the Address. There are, however, three alternative methods of attaining this object.In deciding which method to adopt, we should, I think, have a twofold aim:(1)   To carry out the Prime Minister&apos;s pledges in the most effective manner, giving adequate security by means of a duty to those industries where a case is clearly established, while rejecting unhesitatingly claims which are not established:(2)   To avoid misrepresentation by our opponents and misunders tanding among our friends, and to prevent a Free Trade v. Protection controversy developing in the initial stages.
The simplest way to attain the second aim is to confine all discussion and debate to the actual duties we intend from time to time to impose.   If this can be done, we jump no fence until we come to it; we jump no fences we need not jump; aad we give no excuse to anyone to shy at a fence which is not on the course. This appears to me to have every advantage of strategy and tactics, provided It does not prejudice the first of our aims. For the reasons which I give later in this memorandum, I do not think that any just claim would be prejudiced; and I am personally in favour of having no legislation apart from that which is necessary in order actually to impose a duty,   My colleagues may remember that this was the general line I proposed before for dealing with Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,   I attach (Appendix 1) a copy of my former Memorandum on this point (CP.355(23) dated 27th July, 1923).It will be convenient If, before I state the possible alternatives and the arguments for and against them, I raise one question, the answer to whioh may,in Itself, be considered to determine which alternative we should adopt; that is, the ques-tion of whether the new duties must necessarily be Imposed in a Finance Bill.The duties which we propose are general duties. - They are, therefore,  in all respects like the McKenna duties and the duties on Key Industries under Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act,   I believe that there is no precedent for Imposing a general duty otherwise than through the recognised medium of a Finance Bill,    The McKenna duties were so imposed and reimposed year by year in the Budget,   The duties under Part I cf the Safeguarding of Industries Act were imposed substantially in the same manner. They were specifically set out in a Ways &quot;and Means Resolution upon which the Bill was founded; and after the passage of the Resolution,the Bill imposing.these duties passed through all its
stages on the floor of the House of Commons.   Nor did the Government of that day attempt to take any power to add to the Key Industry general duties by the unique method of Resolution under Part II of the Act,   Part II of the Act only gave power to impose discriminating duties against particular countries.    Power was given by the Act to impose these duties by a positive resolution of the House of Commons *I have no doubt that the Treasury would contend that a great weight of precedent and constitutional usage lies behind the practice of imposing general duties by a Finance Bill,   Apart from the question of pure financial praotice, a Conservative Government would probably hesitate before it created the precedent of a short cut to the Imposition of taxation, which might be used by its successors for forms of taxation we should wish strenuously to oppose.If the Cabinet takes the view that general duties must be imposed by a Finance Bill, I suggest that really concludes the matter.    If a Finance Bill be necessary to impose duties, there would be great waste of time in passing^a preliminary Safeguarding of Industries Bill, Nor need the procedure by Finance Bill cause any undue delay, as a special Finance Bill could be introduced if necessary.There are however three possible alternative courses open to us.
1.     No preliminary legislation.      The Board of Trade would order or refuse Inquiries In exactly the same way as they would,  if a Safeguarding of Industries Bill had been passed.     Duties recommended by Committees and approved by the Government would be imposed in the Budget or by a Supplementary .Finance Bill.2.     A Safeguarding of Industries Bui could be passed, giving authority to impose duties by a positive resolution of the House of Commons.      This procedure would follow as nearly as possible that provided by Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.3,     A Safeguarding of Industries Bin could be passed setting out the terms and conditions on which the Board of Trade could order inquiries;   but duties would only be imposed by a Finance Bill.I attach a rough draft of the kind of bill which would be required if either the second or third alternative were adopted.      If the first alternative be adopted no Safeguarding of Industries Bill will be required at all.I propose now to submit some of the reasons which have led me to recommend the first of the above alternatives, and subsequently to deal with the arguments I anticipate might be used against it.     The reasons in support of the first alternative are as follows:(1) The constitutional argument referred to above, that general duties ought only to be imposed by a Finance Bill.(2)     If a Finance Bill is necessary to impose a duty, it would be a serious waste of time to attempt to pass a highly contentious measure, which in effect, would only give the Board of Trade the power to conduct an inquiry, which it could equally well conduct without any statutory authority.
(3)     By refraining from a preliminary Bill we should avoid all genuine fear or wilful misrepresentation that the Safeguarding of Industries Act was to be used as a cloak for a general protective tariff of unknown dimen-sions.     The House of Commons would not be invited to commit itself in advance.     It would only be invited to impose specific duties in proved cases, supported by the full report of a committee;     and to impose those duties by the regular recognised machinery of a Finance Bill,     If we attempt to pass a preliminary Bill, we shall almost certainly have to commit ourselves in advance to a number of definitions and formulae, which would not work in practice,(4)     We should avoid a long series of difficult and academic debates on every word of doubtful meaning in a Safeguarding of Industries Bill:     e,g.     What is an Industry of substantial importance?     What is the precise measure and character of &quot;unfair&quot; competition, upon which we should set our maohinery in motion?     What proportion of the competition must come from a country or countries where the conditions are &quot;unfair&quot;?     In what cases and to what extent would it be legitimate to take Into account a difference In the burden of rates and taxes in competitive industries here and in a foreign country?(5)     Once a Committee has reported, public attention is focussed on the facts of the particular industry in question;   whereas in a preliminary Bill attention is skilfully diverted to &amp; hundred and one difficulties and dangers, which will not arise in practice.
(6) We have actually experienced both methods of prooedure.    The old Safeguarding of Industries Bill was difficult to frame and diffioult to pilot.    On the other hand, we found no real difficulty in appointing the Committee on the   Laoe and Silk Industries; and after that Committee had made its Report, I think the great majority of people were convinced that Lace was an exceptional oase to be treated exceptionally,(7) The Government has a heavy legislative programme in front of it; and the elimination of a oomplioatod and contentious Bill, all the stages of whioh would probably havo to be taken on the floor of the House, will greatly facilitate the passage of other and more popular measures.    In this oonneotion I ought to add that tho position in the Coal industry is far from satisfactory; and it may be neoessary for me to come to the Cabinet for authority to pass legisla-tion before the Mining Wage Agreement expires in July,(8) The course I propose would leave the Chancellor of the Exchequer freer to impose sumptuary import duties, if he so desired, for revenue purposes: Q.g. I can conceive that on pure revenue grounds the Chancellor might wish to impose a duty on luxury motors, even if I could not recommend it on the ground of unfair competition.(9) We shall have to deal with the duties on Koy Industries under Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Aot, as these duties expire in 1926.    I should propose, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer approves, to appoint a Special Committee to report on theso industries, the effect of the duties, and the desirability of their maintenance. It will simplify matters if the prooedure in this case, both as regards inquiry and imposition of duty, is the same as that for safeguarding speoial industries.
(10) If there is a great and general trade revival, we should have no need to Impose- duties, and we should not have wasted time in passing an unnecessary Bill,   If, on the other hand, competition becomes keener and&quot; action is necessary, we should come to-, Parliament for just that action we require in eaoh case,  and no more.Let me now turn to some possible objections:-(a) Will the; course I suggest Involve undue delay? I do not think so.    If there is no preliminary legislation, I can set up the Inquiries at once where I find a prima facie case,.   If reports recommending duties are received between, say, November and April, the duties can be introduced in the ordinary Budget.   If Reports are received between, say, April and October, and cases are urgent, it would always be possible to introduce a Supplementary Finance. Bill.    It will be remembered that, in any case, time would have to &apos;be found for a positive resolution in favour of any duty,(b) Can the House of Commons reasonably claim that It ought to lay downina Statute the  conditions on which an inquiry should be held?    I submit this is an unreasonable claim.   No one challenged the Government when they set up a Committee on Lace and Silk,    Indeed, it is the duty of the Government to formulate proposals based on adequate evidence; and the House of Commons would have complete control over those proposals from start to finish in a Finance Bill, and the House would take Its decision in the light, of a full Report,    Moreover,  I am convinced that the critics who would claim a Bill&apos;are just those who want.a Bill in order to make fictitious capital out of its provisions,
(c) It may be said that the conditions under which an inquiry is to be granted cannot be plainly known unless they are set out in an Act.      The conditions can be stated quite sufficiently in general rules laid down and published by the Board of Trade for their;own guidance and the guidance of their Committees.     I have outlined In Appendix 3 to this Memorandum briefly the tests, which I think the Board should apply in deciding whether there is a prima facie case.     Of course, there will be borderline cases which are difficult to define;     but they are much more difficult to define in theory than to decide In practice.     That is exactly one of the reasons why I do not want a Bill,     For example, I should have great difficulty in framing a definition of what ia an industry of substantial importance;   but I think we should all know one when we saw It.(d) It has been suggested that it might be difficult to refuse unnecessary inquiries if the conditions are not laid down in an Act.      I do not believe that it will be any more difficult to refuse spurious and petty claims, If there is no preliminary legislation.      Indeed, I am not at all sure that, if a preliminary Act was passed, industries, which I wished to turn down, might not base a stronger claim to an Inquiry on the fact that the machinery of inquiry had been established by an Act of Parliament.For all the above reasons, I would recommend the Cabinet to adopt the alternative of inquiries without preliminary legislation, followed, where necessary, by a Finance Bill.P. C-L.Board of Trade, 14th January, 1925.
APPENDIX I.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.355 (25).CABINET&apos;.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES ACT.Memo by the President of the Board of Trade.It is essential that the Cabinet should arrive at a deoision as to the future of the temporary provisions of Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act before we separate. A situation has arisen which makes it imperative for the Board of Trade to take a definite line and to give a deoision in a number of oases.     The attaohed Memorandum sets out the position. To delay further is administratively impossible and politically undesirable.I am definitely of opinion that the exchange provisions of the Act should not be continued beyond the present statutory limit.     I have always held the view that if an industry is to receive proteotion at all, the only feasible method is by means of a duty applied to imports from all sources.     The administrative difficulties of discriminating against imports for particular oountries are familiar to all who have attempted the task.    The Treaty difficulties are set out in the attaohed Memorandum.So long as Germany was the only exporting oountry in which an exchange bounty operated, it was possible to justify and to work the exchange provisions of the Act, though the machinery was oumbrous and troublesome.     But the position has changed.    There is little doubt that such a bounty exists to-day in France, Belgium and Italy, but we are precluded by treaty from imposing a discriminating duty against Belgium or Italy; and if we attempted to do so against France, while leaving other countries free, I think it is oertain that she would retaliate against us.    A general duty, however, on any particular article is no breach of any Treaty.
I suggest, therefore, that we should decide not to renew the exchange provisions of the act, while reserving full power to impose a general duty in the case of any industry where the unemployment due to foreign competition is so serious as to call for special treatment.   Unemployment immediate and prospective is so extensive that I think we should be fully justified in this aotion.   We have already referred the lace and silk Industries to a Committee with a general referenoe. Recent cuts in prices will I fear undoubtedly cause a great reduotion of employment in the tyre industry.   Woollen &amp; Worsted tissues are suffering severely from French competition.   At the same time fresh sources of revenue are required to meet the coat of unemployment relief measures.If the policy I have proposed is aocepted, I should refuse to entertain any further applications under the Safeguarding of Industries Act.   At the same time I should propose that the Board of Trade should accept the responsibility of investigating the conditions of industries which complained that their employment was being seriously and abnormally affected by foreign imports.     If the Board were satisfied as to the facts of the oase, the efficiency of the industry, and the general advantage of imposing a duty, they should reoomraend the chancellor. of the Exchequer to take^action accordingly.    In the term &apos;general advantage1 I include the consideration of the effeot of a duty on any industry which uses the. product of the industry in question in its own manufacture.The silk and Laoe Committee will report before the House reassembles, and it would be possible for the Board of Trade to give an opinion on the few other cases that press at present within the same period. .P.

APPENDIX II. SAFEGUARDING OF t.HDUSTRIBS (AMENDMENT) BILL*1* (1) If, In respect of goods of any class or description (other than articles of food or drink) complaint is made to the Board:-(a) that goods of that olass or description manufactured in a country outside the British Empire are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices ^vhioh are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom and(b) that such low prioes are rendered possible by reason of circumstances which being exceptional give rise to competition which is unfair to manufacturers in the United Kingdom, and(c) that by reason of the severity and extent of such competition employment in the manufacture of such goods in the United Kingdom is being or is likely tobe seriously affected^ the Board, if it appears to them that the manufacture of similar goods in the United Kingdom is, in respect of the volume of employment engaged therein, or of the nature of the goods, of substantial importance, and that there is a-prima facie case for the Investigation of the complaint, shall refer the complaint for enquiry to a committee constituted for the purposes of this Act, unless the Board e.re satisfied that the manufacture of similar goods in the United Kingdom is not being ce,rriecl out with reasonable efficiency and economy, or that the imposition of a duty under this Act on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any industry being&apos;an industry using goods of that class or description in production.No competition shall be taken into account unless the severity thereof is attributable to one or more of the
following causes(i) depreciation of currency? (ii) subsidies, bounties, or other artificial advantages; (iii) burden of taxation as oompared with that in the United Kingdom; (iv) conditions of employment of labour (whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment or otherwise) obtaining amongst the persons employed in the manufacture of the goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the manufacture of&apos; similar goods in the United Kingdom. (2) The Committee to whom any such complaint is referred shall consider the complaint, and if they are satisfied that the conditions specified in Sub-section (1) of this section are fulfilled, and that the manufacture of similar goods in the United Kingdom is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy they shall report whether the imposition of any suoh duty as hereinafter mentioned on all or any of the goods to which the complaint relates is expedient having regard to the conditions above mentioned and the effect which the imposition of that duty on goods of the olass or description in question would exert on employment in any industry, being an industry using goods of that class or description in production.If the Report is in favour of the imposition of a duty that Committee shall specify the rate of duty reoommended, being either 12-g- per cent, or 25 per oent. of the value of the goods, provided that the Committee shall not recommend the imposition of a duty at the higher rate unless they are satisfied, that a duty at the lower rate would be insufficient to prevent such unfair competition as aforesaid.(3) If after enquiry the committee recommend that as respects all or any of the goods of the olass or description in question a duty should be imposed, the Board may, by order
apply this Act, to such goods, and declare that the rate of duty (hereinafter referred to ae the specified rate) applicable to the goods shall be that recommended by the committee.(4) Where the Board propose to make any such orders, drafts of the proposed orders shall be laid before the Commons House of Parliament, and the orders shall not be made unless and until a* resolution is passed by that House approving the drafts either without modification or subjeot to such modifications as may be specified In the resolutloni and upon suoh approval being given, the orders may be made in the form in which the drafts have been approved, and, when so made, shall have effect as if enacted in this Act.2. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, there shall be charged, levied and paid on goods in respect of which an order has been made under this Act on the importation thereof into the United Kingdom, in addition to any other duties of customs chargeable thereon, duties of customs at the specified rate:Provided that in the case of goods whioh are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to have been consigned from and produced or manufactured in the British Empire within the meaning of seotlon eight of the Finance Act, 1919, that Section shall apply as if the goods were specified in the first column of the seoond Schedule to that Act and the rate of duty specified in the second column of that Schedule were two-thirds of the full rate.(2) An Order under this Aot may extend to goods brought baok into the United Kingdom after having been exported therefrom for the purpose of undergoing any process out of the United. Kingdom, but the importer shall, on proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioners of the value of the goods at the time of such exportation and of the Identity thereof, and that no drawbaok has been allowed thereon on the exportation thereof,
be entitled to be repaid by thw Commissioners Buch part o? the duty paid under this Act on the goods so brought back aftex* having undergone such proeess as aforesaid as represents a peroentage, equal to the rate of the duty, of the value of the goods before exportation.and of freight and insurance outwards,3 , (1) A Committee for the purposes of this Aot shall consist of not more than five persons to be appointed by the President of the board provided that no person whose interests may be materially affected by any action which may be taken on the report of a committee shall be eligible for appointment as a member of the committee.(2) A committee to whom any oomplaint is referred under this Act shall determine its own procedurej provided that the sittings of the oommittee at which evidence is taken shall be held in public, exeept that the oommittee shall refuse to allow the public to be present at any proceedings of the oommittee. during the hearing of evidence on matters which, in their opinion, are of a- confidential oharacter.4.    (1) An order made under this Act shall, unlessapreviously revoked by the Board, continue In force for three years, but any such order may, subject to the provisions of this Act, be renewed from time to time for the like period by a further order made in like manner as the original order, and the order may be so renewed either as respects all the goods to which it relates or as respects, some only of such goods, and where the original order imposes a, duty at the higher rate, it may be renewed as imposing either the same rate of duty or the lower rate:Provided that -(a) the Board shall not have power to renew any order either wholly or as respects any goods to which it relates except after reference to and on a recommendation from a committee constituted under this Act, and(b) the Committee shall not reoommend the renewal of
the order unless satisfied -(i) that the conditions exist, or if the order were not renewed would exist, which would justify them in recommending the making of an original order; and (ii) that producers or manufacturers in theUnited Kingdom of goods of the class or description to whioh the original order applied have not taken advantage of the duty imposed in consequence of that order to charge to the detriment of consumers in the United Kingdom prices   yielding /on the average/ unreasonable profits. (2) An order, whether original or renewed, may at any time after the expiration of one year from the making or renewal of the order be revoked by order of the Board either as respects all the goods to which it relates or as respects some only of such goods:Provided that the Board shall not have power to make any such order of revocation except after reference to and in accordance with the recommendation of a committee constituted under this Act, and the committee shall make such recommendation in any case where, if they were considering an application for the renewal of an order they would recommend that the order &apos; should not be renewed.
; ; 104APPENDIX III. .   .Summary of tests to be applied by the Board of Trade before ordering an enquiry.(1) The industry must be of $substantial importanoe either in the number of persons employed, or, in an exceptional case, owing to the particular character of the industry, which makes its retention particularly desirable in the national interest.(2) The scale of imports must be abnormale    In most oases I should propose to apply the following test:-Is the ratio of retained imports to exports greater than the pre-war ratio?   The most correct test would be the ratio of imports to productions   As there has not been a reoent Census of Production, this is a test which the Board of Trade oould not apply. It would, however, be open to an industry to rebut the prima facie case on the ratio of imports to exports, by showing that the ratio of imports to production was substantially greater than   pre-war.The general test of the ratio of imports to exports or imports to production would, I think, bevy - &apos; : &apos; : &apos;r&quot;V    .i&apos;:rV&apos;l&apos;.! -applicable in all oases except where an industry had developed greatly, either in the world generally or in this oountry, since pre-war days. ,(3) Assuming abnormal competition, the.industry must show that suoh competition is coming in a large degree from countries where competition Is &quot;unfair&quot;.   E.g., Even if the competition exceeded pre-war, if that competition were coming predominantly from countries like the United States, where currency was not depreciated and where wages and hours were not inferior to our own, there would be no case for an enquiry.
&quot;Unfair&quot; competition would be defined substantially as the Prime Minister stated In his speeoh on the Address, and as set out In the draft Bill (Appendix II). I think an enquiry should only be entertained on the ground of a difference in rates and taxes, if the industry asking for an enquiry   can show a good prima facie case that the difforenoe in the burdon of ratos and taxes Is a substantial factor In the oomparatlve oasts of production in this oountry and the countries of whioh it complains.Wages and hours.    It is impossible in most oases to ascertain what was the pro-war difference between wagos and hours in this and other countries in the various industries.   I think, however, it is the faot that in most industries wagos have risen and hours havo been reduced to a greater extent in this oountry than thoy have beon in other countries, whore the pre-war wages were lowor and hours longer.   For praotioal pvrposes I am, thorefore of opinion that if an Industry established that tho oompotition was abnormal (see para. 2), and that this competition was ooming largely from an &quot;unfair&quot; oountry, and that wages were lower and hours longer   in that country, there would be a prima facie case for an enquiry.(4) Effioionoy of the industry.    This would generally be a question for the Gommittee once a prima facie case had been referred.    But if the Board were satisfied from evidence in their possossion that a home industry was Inefficient, tho Board should be entitled to refuse to grant an enquiry on that ground.(5) Similarly, tho effect of a duty upon some other
industry, using tho -goods manufactured by. plaintiff industry in its production, would generally be a matter for the Committee to report upon.    But here again tho Board should be   free to refuse an enquiry at the outset, if they were satisfied that the imposition of a duty ought to be rejected by reason of the injury, which the imposition of such a duty would cause to othor industries.If the Board were satisfied that a good prima facie oase had been made out in accordance with the above conditions, an enquiry-&quot;would be granted.   If tho Board were not satisfied that, suoh a prima fade caso had been established, an enquiry would be refused; and there would be no appeal.The-.Committee In oonducting its enquiry would be directed to follow generally the lines laid down in the draft Bill (Appendix II).I should propose to leave it to tho Committee to reoommond tho appropriate rate of duty in any case. The Committee would have Investigated all the relevant faots with regard to tho industry; and the Board of Trade oould supply the Committee with full Information as to the duties imposed on similar articles,in different countries.
