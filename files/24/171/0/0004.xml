CP. 4 (25).cabinet.THE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF GEEMANY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIECULATE for the information of my colleagues a very interesting memorandum drawn up by a representative of the Westminster Bank who recently visited Germany.I would draw attention to the fact that in obtaining consent to its circulation I emphasised that&apos; it would be treated as entirely confidential.w. s. c.Treasury, S.W., January 1, 1925.My ViwSiT to Germany.It could scarcely have been anybody&apos;s imagination that the military victory over Germany could be followed by such a complete economic downfall of that country as has now been reached.That there is fixed wealth in Germany to-day to an extent almost as great as ever, goes without saying : its mines, forests, railways, public works, buildings, factories, farms all these potential wealth creators are still in being, but, unfortunately, like a big concern with no business doing, the relative expenses in many cases render the possessions onerous.But the floating wealth, the money that was deposited in banks, the working capital which enabled industrial concerns to buy material and pay wages to carry out orders, does not now exist, or if it does it is in such minute quantities as to be of little value for the development of trade.How this state of things was brought about is now a matter of history. All efforts to escape from the consequences of a depreciated currency proved useless in the long run, and when everything in the way of money that is, real money was nearly lost, a wave of speculation passed over the country, which resulted in completing the ruin.   I refer particularly to the speculation in French francs.Most of the industrial concerns have lost their working capital and reserves, and try to struggle on as best they can with the limited resources tbey have left and the limited credits granted hj the.banks at 18 per cent, per annum. To add to their troubles taxation costs and public service charges are so heavy that retailers cannot afford to buy their goods, except on credit, which can in only rare cases be allowed. The proportion of bills which have to be prolonged attains sometimes as high a figure as 60 per cent.Baulked in the hopes of doing an internal trade, many manufacturers turn all their efforts to export trade, but the working costs are still so high that only orders for goods in which Germany specialises, such-as chemicals, optical goods, steel rails, cast tubes, china and toys can be secured, and these are largely executed at a loss.Prices for most manufactured articles are well above world prices, while salaries and wages are not more than half what they would be in England. The result is that internal trade is nearly at a standstill.Although in every town that I visited I was told that conditions could scarcely be worse, it would seem that the unemployment figures as regards manual workers [12478] &apos; b
are not nearly so large as in England. In the first place, the Germans seem bent at&quot; all costs on keeping their works going and they are enabled to do this generally by the low wages paid. Secondly, they are willing with the same object to take orders even if their execution entails a loss. Thirdly, any unemployed person in Germany who has a relative able to assist in his support gets no public relief and does not come into the official figures.There is undoubtedly a great deal of distress amongst clerks and shop employees. Of the staffs of banks as they existed a year ago, 75 per cent, have been dismissed and shops and offices no longer want the large staffs they required when business was feverishly active and book-keeping required prompt dealing with unwieldy figures.Taxation. The taxation of industry is very heavy and amounts to about 30 per cent. There is besides a tax on turnover of 2 per cent. The income tax had to be paid quarterly in advance on figures based on the previous year&apos;s trading. This is a severe handicap, having regard to the bad state of trade, and a strain on the slender resources available, besides being likely to lead to difficulties when claims for repayment are made.Railway rates are high compared with those in France and Belgium.These difficulties might all be supported if there were enough money to go round, and this is the one thing which, as far as I can see, will prevent Germany being a. serious competitor of England for some years.The German Government having foresworn inflation, money can only be produced accordingly from the fruits of industry, and industry, as already stated, is working under such disadvantages that amelioration will be a slow process.Credits are being obtained abroad, but they are a mere drop in the ocean in comparison with the requirements.I have no hesitation in believing what German bankers say, viz., that German competition will not take on a serious active character for years to come, and dumping is not even in sight.The mere suggestion of German competition in the world&apos;s markets provoked astonishment from every one of the bank managers, without exception, with whom I spoke, and the few big industrials I questioned seemed just unanimously of the same opinion. Some admitted that they had orders in hand for abroad, but others stated that they were no longer able to offer goods abroad owing to the high costs of manufacture. -Wages. Some of the wages mentioned to me were : Patternmaker, machine works, 60 pfg. (7^d.) per hour. Ordinary skilled worker, 49 pfg. (6d.) per hour.Workers in cast tube factory, 45 to 60 pfg. (5kd. to 7%d.) per hour. Workers in lithographic works, 30 gold marks ( 1 10s. 5d.) per week. Workers in soap factory, 25 gold marks ( 1 5s. 4d.) per week.(The British consul, Frankfort, said the average wage locally was 30 gold marks ( 1 10s. 5d.) per week.)Cost of Living. The official cost of living figures for August last were 116-1 (100 in 1913). Food is 124; clothing, 124-4;..rents, 62; heating and light, 155; travelling, 185-7;&apos; household necessities, 194-2. This does not include taxation, and the official index number referred to is considered to be presented very favourably in order to prevent industrial disturbance by claims for increased wages. The figure for rents is interesting, and shows the desire to placate the working classes. Certainly the prices for most goods in shops seem much higher than in England, but they include the turnover tax, several times applied perhaps, and which was recently as high as 2-3r per cent.The Ruhr. The recovery in the heavy industries situated in this district has been satisfactory, and compared with the average for 1922 91 per cent, of blast furnaces;89 per cent, of steel works;84 per cent, of rolling mills and forgesare working.The extraction of coal is 106 per cent., and production of coke 88-6 per cent., of the 1922 figures. In fact, more coal is produced than can be dealt with and it is accumulating at the mines.
Machinery Works. Tool makers are unable to effect sales, but orders are being executed at a loss for cast-iron tubes, steel rails to Sweden and the Argentine, and railway wagons. ,Toy Trade. A meeting of the chief manufacturers hasj considered the question of the future of their trade and has decided that, inasmuch as they have a world-monopoly of high-class toys, they will not jeopardise this favourable situation by making an inferior article in order to obtain orders -abroad Although the enhanced costs of production will not permit of toys being sold at cheap prices, the feeling is that, in the absence of competition in the world&apos;s markets, the good-class German article will obtain a fairly ready sale.Porcelain, China and Crystalware. -The reports from the towns where these articles are produced show that trade is fair and employment nearly normal.Automobiles. The position of these concerns is said in some cases to be critical. Some of them are immense works, covering acres of land with their buildings, but, at current prices, there can be no question of export in any quantity and the country itself cannot provide an outlet at present.Equipment of Works. On all hands it is admitted that, taking the country as a whole, the situation here could scarcely be better. The latest and most expensive machinery was installed at a time when anything was better than to retain paper marks and no expense was spared to bring works up to date and increase the capabilities of output. This favourable condition of things is bound to help when money becomes easier and the costs of all these improvements generally stand at a nominal value in the books of the concern.The German Working Man. It is said that never for years has the German working man been so docile and at the mercy of his employers, and a simple threat that work will not be sufficient to justify full employment is sufficient for concessions in scales of wages. Owing partly to the monetary inflation and partly to unemployment resulting from industrial disturbance following on political events, the workmen&apos;s unions have lost their funds and the workmen their savings. There is little doubt that any progress on the road to industrial prosperity will be marked by frequent labour claims and disputes until the wages level is brought up somewhat closer to that existing in neighbouring countries.Banks. In the circumstances related, none have felt the effects more intensely than the banks, and how they have been affected will be disclosed when their balance sheets in gold marks have been published. Some already have made up their minds to the extent to which they will reduce their capital, and it is generally surmised that they will put this at a figure on which they can reasonably hope to pay an annual divident of 10 per cent, in future years.The Darmstadter und National Bank have, I understand, reduced their capital from 600,000,000 gold marks to 75,000,000 gold marks, and it is expected that other institutions will show reductions of from 50 per cent, to 90 per cent.The large banks are reported to be in a strong position. They are exceedingly prudent for the time being and are adopting a waiting policy. They have, as stated, an opportunity now&quot; of putting their business on a sound basis Their numerous up-to-date and well-equipped establishments, many of which are remarkable for size and architecture, go into the balance sheets at 1 mark only, and they will certainly write down their investments in drastic fashion. Their interests in industrial concerns will doubtless be a store of hidden wealth for the future, as most of the shares of these concerns will represent values far higher than their present Stock Exchange prices, which, owing to monetary stringency, are remarkably &quot;-*v. Ecj example, many great German concerns of world-wide reputation are rmtting in their balance sheets at 1 mark factories and properties worth millions of marks. All these concerns have freed themselves from mortgage obligations when the paper mark was low it is supposed.The last date for rendering balance sheets in gold marks is the 1st December, 1924, when the present situation of all the banks will be known. Before the war, banks used to have to publish their situation every two months, but this ceased during the inflation period.   It is now expected that the law will again be enforced.The banks have met the present situation by dismissing three-quarters of their staffs, and still find the remaining quarter too many, to carry out the small business being carried on at present. The bank offices in most places in the Rhine provinces are only open daily in the morning, and the salaries of the clerks do not average more than  5 to  6 per month for experienced men. &quot; This is too much to starve on and too little to live on,&quot; as one of the managers said.[12478] ^ b 2
Many of the bank offices are immense new palaces, and it was depressing to walk through the empty halls. The Darmstadter National Bank in Cologne built their immense new premises to accommodate 200 customers at a time, though rarely more than twenty are ever seen in there all at once.They have a new building under construction in Dusseldorf capable of housing hundreds of clerks, but they do not anticipate now requiring more than a very small part of the space.   These are typical cases.The bank managers seemed to be in a lethargic condition and little disposed to discuss business. They nearly all frankly declared that there was none to do. I should imagine that they have all been enjoined to excessive prudence. They discussed at great length the miserable condition of affairs in Germany, and for the most part expressed ho hope of any prompt amelioration.They considered that the advent of easier monetary conditions and the receipt of funds by the banks will be slow, and in the meantime industry will languish.Asked what they thought would enable manufacturers to take their old place in the world&apos;s market, they said there was no question of this for years, but they trusted in the triumph of technical superiority, which it was the intention of German industrials to rely on more and more. Some bankers think that, to bring down costs, many works engaged in the same industry will have to combine together or concen-trate on specialities and certain favourable markets.They stressed the loss of their chief mineral-bearing provinces and of their colonies.The forthcoming elections in Germany and the new commercial treaties now being arranged assist, they say, in keeping business at present in an uncertain condition, and the application of the Dawes plan as regards reparations caused alarm amongst manufacturers.Dawes Plan. This seemed to create but little interest in the bankers them-selyes. As there are no payments to be made for two years, it does not affect present circumstances; and as regards what will happen after that, they considered that German industry would not be able to stand the strain of the charges imposed, and a new arrangement would have to be come to. They naturally expressed satisfaction that the monetary situation had been cleared up, so that at last they know how they stand.Before the war, there were 500 separate banks in Germany; there are now 5,000, and changes, fusions and disappearances may be expected wholesale.German Mark Balances in Banks. I asked if there was any possibility of bank balances in marks which had remained untouched during the inflation period being revalorised, but I was told that this was only the case with savings-bank deposits and advances on mortgages. These will have to be repaid in gold marks to the extent of 15 per cent, of the original amount after 1932. Bank deposits and current accounts 1 are excluded from this arrangement.German Rentes. There is practically no hope of any intrinsic value ever attaching to the old Government loans. The Government has never issued a notice to this effect, but the poverty of the States precludes the formation of any schemes for the purpose.Stock Exchange Values. Astonishment is expressed on all sides that the remarkably low values ruling in the market for most of the finest industrial shares do not induce foreign buyers to take advantage of the bargains available.The lowness of these prices is due not only to the want of money to purchase them, but especially to the fact that during the disaster following the speculation in French francs in April last, immense quantities were sacrificed by their owners to cover differences and these low prices have scarcely showed any signs of recovery since.Present outlook for Banks. It seems hardly likely that for years the banks will recover their former position. Of the commodities they trade in, viz., money and credit, the former is so rare that it remains in trade and does not go tp the banks, while credit is so restricted and dear that \t brings little profit on the whole. The only means of bettering this state of things is to create sufficient liquid capital by work and export trade to enable a surplus amount of cash tp find&apos;its way to the banks. It must be remembered that concerns who formerly worked with their own capital have frequently lpst their reserves, and are now borrowers instead of deppsi-tors. A large bank, with its chief office in Cologne, told me that their deposits in Rentenmarks are increasing at the. rate of about 10 per cent, per month, but apparently this is quite exceptional.
Hope is expressed that English and American banks will continue and increase their aid by granting sterling and dollar credits which can help both the industries and the banks, but the possibility of utilising such credits largely does not seem possible at present, owing to the uncertain trade outlook and doubt as to the finan-cial standing of the borrowers.Credits and Advances by English Banks. Many of the biggest firms, however, are known by their bankers to be in a good financial position, and, therefore, good business can be done with them, as they are willing to pay&apos;12 per cent, per annum for sterling. Some offer as security mortgages on property, and this is by no means suitable to English banks. Even if the concerns are intrinsically good, it seems bad policy to lend money to commercial and other borrowers about whom informa-tion can only be by repute and whose books it would be difficult to examine.The better way seems to be by making advances to, and giving acceptances on behalf of, native. banking institutions, who would furnish full particulars of their customers&apos; requirements and of their financial standing, and be themselves respon-sible for the repayment in a stated period. There seems to be no restrictions on drawing bills in foreign currencies in Germany, and the German banks are often holders of sterling bills drawn and accepted by first-class houses in respect of genuine trade transactions which they have discounted, and these they would often like to discount at about 7 per cent, or 1\ per cent. Thejr are generally payable in London.Opportunities for British Trade in Germany. I anticipate that Germany will become a good customer of Great Britain before very long, provided that no prohibitive tariff is raised. Great opportunities exist there, but it will be necessary for British traders to exercise at first careful choice as to their buyers,. as the past few months, I was told in Cologne, had shown the need for great discrimination, owing to the absence of cash resources and credit. Generally speaking, I should say that means would be found to provide reasonably prompt payment for food-stuffs and raw materials, such as hides, cotton, copper, wool, jute, &amp;c, but to go to the other extreme British motor-cycles for which there is a decided demand, probably the only terms offered would be long credit or payment by instalments. .The question, however, is too big to generalise about, and it would be desirable for traders and trade organisations personally to visit Germany and find out the requirements for themselves, and learn something of the financial condition of Germany.Import and Export Trade.To conclude, a few remarks may not be out of place regarding the comparative figures of imports and exports.The latest figures published cover July and August,&apos; and show a rising excess of exports over imports.These figures, though apparently favourable, are wholly misleading. The import figures have dropped principally because Germany has no money to pay for raw materials, the item chiefly affected, while the exports have slightly increased, owing probably to the necessity to sell at all costs in order to get ready money.
