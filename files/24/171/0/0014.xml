(THIS DOCULfKNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT IflHIC MUSSTY1 S GOVERIIIIEIIT) .SECRET.CABINET.CP&apos;  14f&amp;5) .EOTE OP VISIT TO   AMERICA.By lord Cecil,DISARMAMENT.I saw both Mr * Hughes and Mr.  Coolidge&apos; - theformer at some length - and both spoke to me mainly on the question of disarmament,      They are both anxious to arrive at a fresh agreement with regard to naval disarmament.      They are being pressed by their navy-party to build more cruisers etc, and they are very anxious to avoid anything like a renewal of naval competition, but they find it difficult to defend themselves against the allegation that they are allowing the United States to fall behind the other nations in naval armament^without some international agreement cn the subject.      Mr. Hughes told me he thought there would be no difficulty with either Japan or Great Britain, but so far Prance had shown no sign of agreeing to a further reduction, and he did not see how he could get on without them.      He asked me whether I thought France likely to agree.      I told him I thought not, that in my view the French were profoundly anxious as to their security,  and that they were not prepared to diminish further their armaments except in return for some guarantee.      He gloomily assented to this view,saying that ho had been driven to that opinion*     He then asked as to the possibility of some agreement aboutgeneral disarmament, and said that he was most sympathetic with any attempt Europe might make toarrive at such an agreement, though it would beimpossible for the United States to undertake any
further obligations on the subject.       We talked a little about the possibility of air disarmament as to v/hich he was not very sanguine on the grounds that peace machines can so very easily be transformed into war machines.        I suggested that possibly a solution might be found in limiting the number of trained men,since a peace pilot would not be available as a war pilot without special trainings he admitted something might be done in this direction, though he still remained rather sceptical.        I found both the President and the Secretary of State very much against compulsory arbitration as applied to America, hut both were very anxious that some plan of disarmament should be arrived at in Europe, and rather pointedly stated that they would view any such agreement benevolently.       Mr. Hoover, whom I met for a few moments, was still more emphatic in hoping that something of the nature of the Protocol might be adopted in Europe, which he thought absolutely essential to the peace of that Continent.OPIUM.I also talked to Mr, Hughes about the Opium question. He evidently was not very familiar withits details, though he seemed to accept the view that the Indian Government must be allowed to deal with the domestic consumption of its own drugs as they pleased without international interference.      He spoke of Mr* Campbell as being a great obstacle to agreement, and I replied that I thought   -Mr. Porter and Mrs. Hamilton Wright had not been very conciliatory either.     He seemed to?!K,^llLJULiJjlimMMIMMPIMM i......   II ,        ,    ,
attach groat importance to Bishop Brent rs opinion, and he did not appear to be opposed to the British idea of a Committee of Enquiry,though he had not given it much consideration.      He spoke emphatically of the evils of drug addiction in Arae rica,saying that the drug fiends pushed the sale of heroin even in the schools,LEAGUE OF NATIONS.I had practically no conversation with either th Secretary of State or the members of the Administration about the League, because I felt that their attitude had been definitely taken up and there was no purpose in dis-cusslng it with them.      I found the adherents of the League in very good spirits, believing In spite of the Election that the  League was making way in America.      The all said that there was much 3 ess opposition and greater support - particularly among the churches and the women.        They were most anxious that we should do nothing,  and say nothing that would indicate any anxiety for the United States to come in.       With remarkable unanimity they pressed upon me that every time it was said in England that the league could not get on without the United States,   or even that the presence of the United States in the League was very desirable, it put back the cause of the League in America.      It was interpreted there as indicating that the League ?/as a failure,and the help of the United States was necessary in order to try and set it on its legs, and that that was precisely the thing that the American public was most afraid of,      They have a nervous dread of the skill, and
wickedness of European diplomats, and-regard themselves as in perpetual danger of victimisation by brilliantly unscrupulous Europeans.      Pox what it is worth;my own opinion entirely coincides with the vi ew (apart from the estimate of our diplomacy) which was pressed on me by such widely different people as lvir. Lament,.(a partner in J.P.. Morgan &apos; s.1 ,(;colonel House, and the Bishop of Washington. As far as I could see there was no difference of opinion on this subject,,In spite of the sanguine views of the leaguers my own opinion was that,,as compared with what I found -in America 18 months agot there was less interest in. the League,  though there was certainly less opposition also. It seemed to me  to be- regarded for. the time being as a closed issue..    idr.Hugh.es volunteered the statement that opinion about the League had become crystulised. That may be the explanation,  though I think it i*s  rather owing to the condition of domestic politics,    There is for the time being no effective opposition to the present administration, and all politics,  certainly all foreign politics,  are as it were in abeyance. I was assured that the Churches, teachers and women were, working more vigorously then ever for the League,   the two first being almost unanimous.      It was also said that thf pro-League Campaign was improving and that it was adopting more vigorous tactics:.      The president himself is not thought to be fundamentally hostile to the League, and very ready to co-operate with it in every way short of joining it.    Mr.hughes is regarded as a more dangerous opponent because he was once a supporter,  and has to find reasons for his change of opinion.    Senator Borah, who has become Chairman of the-4-
oenate Committee on foreign Relations, is also very hostile though he is regarded as somewhat more open to conviction than Mr.Hughes.      The difficulty about Senator Borah is that he has never left the United States and is consequently profoundly ignorant of foreign countries-    I think: there is no doubt that the Administration generally is anxious to be on good terms with the League,    They are going to attend-officially the Conference on Traffic in Arms, and Mr. Hughes told me he thought there would be no great difficulty in arriving at an agreement on the subject, as long as our purpose did not extend beyond the control of export and jjublieity.      ne was very-cordial to me personally, and expressed his complete approval of, thoulh not assent to, what I had said in my first Hew Icorkspeech.!     It is also apparently becoming the fashion tomipraise Wilson,    There had been a very remarkable memorial celebration, cn the anniversary of his death, attended by all the official persons,  both political and judicial, at Washington, at which a great eulogy had been pronounced by one of ivir. &quot;Wilson1 s friends, and there was as far as I know, no criticism in the Press of what I said myself in his favour.    So too,  at the xilgrims&apos;  Dinner, Mr.Depew went out of his way to make an eulogy of vvilson, and one or two &quot;society&quot; people that I met seemed to be much more friendly to the League  than they had been eighteen months earlier.    On the whole I am disposed to agree with&apos; the estimate given me by one of my informants that
only about 20% of American political opinion took any interest in foreign affairs, and of these 15% are in favour of the Leaguer    The greater part of the remaining QUfi would follow whatever the Administration of the day thought right,      I ought to add one thing -I found considerable doubt as to the existence of genuine support of the League in Europe, and particularly by the British Governments    This seemed, to be mainly due to misapprehension as to our attitude about Egypt and the Irish Treaty,      It was also no doubt partly due to an impression that the Labour Party was strongly pro-Lea gue and their opponents would,  therefore, be expected to. be less strongly in its favour.      I need no t say that I did my best to  c&amp;rreet this impression,  emphasising particularly the fact that Mr0Chamberlain had thought it right to attend the Council of the League.      But for some reason I did not feel that my words carried conviction.TEE D,CMfea TIG rilTU AT I OH 0The outstanding fact about American politics is the crushing defeat of. the Democrats,.    It was said that MroD&amp;via was not a good candidate,    he was thought to be too much, allied with the plutocrats of jjjsw lorkj for one thing, and he had been too negative and abusive in his campaigno    The deadlock at the Democratic -convention had done much harm and the fact that Mr.MoAdoo, though he -had been beaten, had not been won over and that his influence\had been hostile.      Rather less than bOfo of the voters hpA gone to the Poll and there did not seem for the moment any future for the Democratic party.    It has no distinctive policy and no  defini te leader.    It is in truth.- in part,w5 *-*
as Conservative as the most Conservative Republicans. In part it holds the Liberal creed of vsilson.    Everyone agrees that the attitude of the Democratic Convention to the League was an utter failure, and that either whole-hearted consent or rejection would have been better than the half-and-half position which was assumed. To the English observer it certainly seems impossible for American politics to become reasonable- unless- the parties adopt a definite and distinct policy.      The old&apos; anti-negro position of the Democrats has no particular ..   &quot; meaning now,  and beyond that they really have no.th.ing definite to  say.    Even on tariff it is difficult to say whether they differ in principle from the RepubvLL-cans-,... and&quot; as I have said their half-hearted attitude on the-.Leaguerobe that issue of any value for any party purposes.      Ifthey came cut definitely as a moderate Liberal or progressiveparty they ought to be able to rally round them the supporters of La -&quot; Toilette, and I should imagine a very large number or the non-voters at the last election - particularly iJ-^andwhen there is a slump in American business,    For this administration is a big business administration and will allow trusts and capitalists to have things pretty much their-   own way.      That is a policy which will be widely accepted as long as the country is prosperous, but I should imagine that as prosperity declines it will become less and lesspopular.      In any case there does not appear to be anylegitimate place for the Democratic conservatives,  and \the appearance of La  Toilette1 s party, or rather the moveiae\ twhich gave birth to it,mt&apos;Les it practically certain thatall the Conservatives will vote Republican in the future,as the best way of keeping the Radicals out.(Intdo)  C.January 12th. 1925.
