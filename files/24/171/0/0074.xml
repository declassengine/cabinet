At their meeting on January 21st, 1925 (Cabinet 3(25) Conclusion 6) the Cabinet appointed a Committee to consider the drafting of a Superannuation of School Teachers Bill to amend the School Teachers (Superannuation) Acts 1918 to 1924*The Committee submit the following report together with a Memorandum by the Government Actuary (Appendix I) and a copy of the Draft Bill (Appendix II). 2.     The Question of a Fund0The proposal which has been laid before us by the President of the Board of Education and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is that teachers and employers shall each contribute to the Exchequer five per cent of the salaries of pensionable teachers.     Arrangements would be made for the first two years such as to prevent any burden from falling on the employers and thereafter the employers would be assisted by grants at the same rate as the grants in aid of salary expenditure.  (These grants may be taken at a through average rate of 56 per cent under present Regulations.) It is proposed that the contributions so paid into the Exchequer shall not be funded,  i.e. shall not be invested and separately held, but that they shall be paid Into the Consolidated Fund, so forming part of the general income of the year;    and that an Account  (i.e. a Teachers Pensions and Contributions Account) shall be set out, showing what the position mould be  if the contributions had been carried to a
separate Fund.     In this Account the balance (i.e. the excess of contributions received over the. cost of so much of the pensions as is chargeable against the contributions) will be credited with interest at 3-g- per cent t     The Account will have behind it the guarantee of the State.     The contributions are to be in respect only of future service; the State will bear the whole cost of pensions relating to past service,  without charging any.part of the cost thereof against the contributions.3.     The Secretary for Scotland has represented to us that the contributions of the teachers and employers ought to be funded,, as was recommended by the Emmott Committee.     That Committee contemplated that the teachers should pay contributions of 5 per cent and the employers contributions of 2-jjr per cent;   that these contributions should be funded; and that the remainder of the burden represented by a 10 per cent contribution, namely 2-1 per cent, would be assumed by the State, but would be met not by an actual contribution into the fund but by the payment of one fourth of all the charges arising in respect of future serviee.     The Secretary for Scotland argues that the contributions of the teachers and employers are in the nature of trust monies;    that the teachers would not be satisfied with a hypothetical fund and would object to their contributions being used to meet the state is obligations for back service;    and that any guarantee now given by the State that the Revenue Account would be as safe as a separate fund would be vitiated in the minds of the teachers by the recent history of the State&apos;s dealings with the question of pensions.
40 the course of our discussions it waspointed out to us in favour of the course proposed &quot;by the Treasury and the Board of Education that the method of separate Funds and earmarked investments was wasteful, that the proposed Account would have as much credited to it as would any Fund that might be set up, that the Account would be periodically valued, and that the contributions could be Increased or reduced according to the results of the actuarial investigation.     Further this proposal would do something to prevent the future tax-payer being unduly relieved at the expense of the present taxpayer (heavily burdened by war pensions) without adversely affecting the teachers,,5c As a result of our discussion the majority ofour number were in favour of a Superannuation Account as proposed by the Treasury and the Board of Education and against the establishment of a separate Fund. Provision is made to this effect In Clauses 7 (3), (4), and (5), and Clause 15 of the Draft Bill forwarded herewithc6. We append to our report.an agreed statementprepared by the Government Actuary comparing the effect which would be produced by the two systems, (a) contributions raised ::. s proposed by us and not funded and (b) contributions raised as proposed by the Emmott Committee and. funded.      We understand that the Secretaryfor Scotland will send in to the Cabinet a separate\\  -memorandum setting out his reasons in favour of the establishment of a fund.
Claim as of right to Superannuation Allowances. 7. Our attention was drawn to the desirabilityof strengthening the legal claim of teachers to Superannuation Allowances in the eventiof the method of Account being adoptedr.     At present payment is discretionary and is governed by the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, Section 6. 8, We came to the conclusion that to grant an absolute right to a Superannuation Allowance or gratuity was difficult and undesirable.     We recommend that the substance of Section 6 of the Act of 1918 should be retained, but that Parliamentary Counsel should bear in mind Section 99 of the report of the Emmott Committee where the draftsmen are asked to discover a language assuring to the teachers the rights involved in a contributory scheme without depriving the Board of Education of the judicial discretion implied In the words of Section 6.Qualifying period for an Age Allowance^ 9. Under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Acti1918, a teacher must as a condition cf the award of an age allowance have served at least ten years in recognised service, normally in a grant-aided school, and at least another twenty years either in recognised or in qualifying servioe.     Qualifying service is service either in reputable schools which are not grant-aided or in educational administrative service.     Somewhat easier conditions are prescribed for Certificated Teachers who
were entitled to benefits under the Elementary School Teachers Superannuation Act, 1898, and for women.who leave recognised service in consequence&apos; of marriage.10*      The Ernmott Committee propose to abolish qualifying service, the investigation of which has often been troublesome,&apos; and to make the minimum period one of ten years recognised service.      They propose, however, that the age allowance instead of being as at present available in all cases at the age of sixty shall be deferred to the age of sixty five, unless five of these ten years service have been given after the age of fifty.11.      The President of the Board of Education has represented to us that the Emmott Committee^ proposal is open to certain criticismsfa)     It is desirable to maintain the position that pensionable service should normally be long time service.(b)      If this principle is accepted the best way to give effect to it appears to be to retain qualifying service. The rights of the existing teachers must not be injuriously affected, and since these rights depend on the existence of qualifying service the Board will in any case have to investigate qualifying service in the case of existing teachers for the next 35 years.      The administrative difficulties affecting qualifying service apply in a much greater degree to past qualifying service than to future qualifyingservice..fc)      Serious opposition would be offered by teachers to any provision which requires a teacher who has completed a substantial period of service to wait for a pension until -sixty five unless he has given further service after fifty
At the age of fifty some teachers,  especially women, are exhausted, and wish to retire, and it is often -difficult for teachers who lose a teaching post after middle age to secure another.      It would he a great hardship to oblige such teachers to wait xxntil sixty five for their pensions.fd)      On the other hand,&apos; there are a comparatively small number of teachers, chiefly, in technical schools, who enter the service late in life.     For these a shorter qualification than 30 years is reasonable.12,      The President accordingly proposes to provide that the minimum qualification for an age allowance should be substantially the same as In the Act of 1918 fi,ea, should be 30 years of recognised,  contributory or qualifying service,  of which at least 10 years must be recognised or contributory service) subject to preservation of the existing rights of teachers to whom the Supers annuation Act of 1898 applied, and subject to the two following modifications, viz.,(a) .    That a teacher who has served 10 years in contributory or recognised service should qualify for an age allowance if he has. served three-quarters of the number of years between the. date of his entry,    to contributory or recognised service and the attainment of 65.   .(b )        That there may be deducted from the minimum period of service of 30 years such period not exceeding 10 years as a married woman is absent from service during the continuance of her married state.
13.   WQ recommend that this proposal should be adopted. Provision is made to this effect in Clause Z (l) and (2) of the draft BillAdmission, to. the Scheme of Schools not in receipt of Grant.14.   The Act of 1918 as originally introduced only provided for pensioning ii each ere in grant aided schools. It was urged in the course of debate that it should be extended to cover tesohetfs in other efficient schools.   A provision (Section 18 (vii)) was therefore introduced into the Act enabling conditions to be prescribed on whioh service in efficient non-grant-aided schools, not conducted for private profit ana unable out of their own resources to maintain satisfactory pensions schemes, might be recognised as pensionable.   Some 50 or 60 schools have &quot;been approved for such service by the Tree eury.15.   The Emmott Committee propose to terminate the arrangements of Section 18 (vii)   and to admit to the benefits of the scheme any effiolent non-grant-aiaed school, not eonducted for private profit, whatever its financial position, whioh is prepare a to meet the full cost of pensions through a 5$ contribution from the teachers and a 5$ contribution from the Governing Body. 16.   The President of the Board of Education proposes to adopt this proposal with oertain variations.   L (a)   That the privilege of contributing   10$ should be extended to teachers in proprietary schools, other than teachers interested in the profits of the schools, fb)   That, while the Board of Education should in the first instance endeavour to make arrangements with
sohools on the footing that ail tho teachers in a particular school would enter contributory servioe, the Bill should not exclude tha possibility of accepting contributions from individual teaohers serving in sohools whioh do not join the scheme, fo)   That the Bill should not in the oase of non-grant-aidea sohools attempt to distribute the liability for the 10$ contribution fcotween the teaohers and the governors *17.   The President considers that it is impracticable at this stage to attempt to include In the Bill the detailed provisions whioh will be necessary in order to meet the special peculiarities of service .in non-grant-aided schools, and he proposes to take power in the Bill to make a scheme by Order extending the provisions of the Bill to non-grant-aided sohools, subject to such restrictions and modifications as may appear necessary or desirable, and subject also to the oondition that the Treasury should be satisfied that (as far as can be estimated) the scheme will be self-supporting.18.   We agree to these proposals on the understanding:-fa) That the scheme would need Treasury approval, and that It should be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament:fb) That the scheme should primarily bo designedto provide.pensions for the whole staff of a school, but that in all probability it would be necessary also to
enable individual teachers serving in schools whioh have not joined the scheme to contribute for pension purposes.Provision to this effect is made in Clause 18(1)(a) of the draft Bill.Admission tp the Pension Scheme of Local Education Authority19.     The Act of 1918 applied only to persona in full time teaching service.     The Emmott Committee recommended &quot;by a majority that the term &quot;service&quot; should be given a wider interpretation and should be made to include organising, Inspecting or administrative work done by officers of Local Education Authorities provided that (a) the work is of a bona fide character and (b) the officials concerned have heen teachers included In the scheme.     This recommendation referred to officers to be appointed in future;   the Committee did not regard the position of existing officers as falling within their terms of reference.80.     The President of the Board     of Eduoation has proposed to us to admit to the Pension Scheme officials of Local Education Atrthorlties who hold posts involving the supervision or control of teachers on the footingthat their future- service should be treated as contributoryservice, and that their back service should &quot;be treated earecognised service to the extent of half the aggregate oftheir teaching and administrative service taken together,or the whole of their teaching service, whichever was thegreater.     Objections uere raised to the proposal on behalf ofAuthoritiesthe,Treasury on the ground that officials of Local Education/rco/did be pensioned under the Local Government and Other
Officers Superannuation Aot 1922, and should be left to he dealt with under that Aotj   hut it was pointed out in reply to this that the Aot of 1922 was permissive and had so far only been adopted by a minority of the Looal Eduoation Authorities and that there were praotioal difficulties whioh stood in the way of its being universally adopted. 21.        We recommend that Looal Eduoation Authority officials, including existing officials, should be included in the scheme on the lines proposed by the President, subject to the condition that they must have been employed aa teaohers. Provision is made to this effect in Clause 12 of the draft Bill.8igned on behalf of the Committee CAVEChairman.(Signed)   T.JONES      j     Joint(     &quot;   )   R.J.G.MAYOR)Secretaries.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.(l) March 6th 1925.
APPENDIX   I. TSACBjSPS SUPJgRAfiiiniATion bill Financial Sta t ement py^ the^ Government Actuary.In the appendea Table i show the effect upon the Exchequer charge of the alternative financial arrangements whioh have been before the Cabinet Committee.    For the purpose of framing the estimates i have taken the salaries of teachers as governed by the Buxnham scales but sub3sot to the 5 per cent abatement now in force.    The total salaries, on this basis, of all the teachers who have been brought in under the 19^8 Aot are taken as  50,000,000 a year from 1926-27 onwards.Effect is given in eaoh set of estimates to those recommendations of the Emmott Committee affecting expenditure which the  resident of the Board of Education proposes to adopt. These recommendations relate substantially to the return of contributions (with interest) to teachers leaving the service and to payments at death after such a period of service that the contributions of the teacher (with interest) exceed the present allowance at   death. Basis A.    (Hon-fund ipg,),.The teachers are to pay a contribution of 5 per oent of salaries and under the arrangements made with the representatives of the Local Authorities, the Authorities are to pay another 5 per oent, making 10 per oent in all, but the Authorities contributions are to be treated as expenditure attracting grant-in-aid from the Exchequer on the same basis as the salaries to whioh they are related.   The average grant-in-aia is 56 per cent of salaries ana an Exchequer contribution of 56 per oent of the Authorities 5 per cent is accordingly assumed.   The net effect is to reauce the actual contributions receipts payable into th^ Exchequer from 10 per oent of the salaries to 7.2 per oent. As regards the years 1926-27 and 1927-28 the agreement provides, however for a grant-ln-aia of the full amount of the Authorities sentributions.    In these years the contributions reoeivable into
&apos;\t     the Exchequer will he the teachers&apos;  5 per cent and no more.The contributions being paid into the Exchequer as received, the whole of the expenditure in pensions, gratuities, payments at death and sums representing the return of contri-butions made by the teachers in former years will be paid by the Exchequer as it arises.   As pensions are only payable under the Act of 1918 to teachers who have retired since April 1919 the cost of the pension bill, with the other items of expenditure specified, will increase for many years and will amount ulti-mately to  9f millions a year against a figure of  4 millions for the year 1926-27.    But the contribution income will be practically stationary at about scg^- millions a year and the whole weight of the increase in the charge will therefore fall on the ExchequeroIt is particularly to be noted that the ten per cent contribution is esti-rated actuarially to be worth the whole of the rights to be given in x&apos;espect of future service *   When, therefore,  the present generation of teachers has passed away the teachers and their employers1 who between them are to pay 7.2 per cent of salaries will have paid 72 per cent of the annual bill of 9-f million pounds.    The charge on the Exchequer if the contributions had been funded would thus be 28 per cent of  9f millions, i.e. under &amp;2f millions a year in perpetuity but owing to the method of finance adopted the Exchequer will ultimately have to find,  in perpetuity, the yearly difference between  9-f- millions expenditure and        millions receipts. Basis B (Funding)^The proposal of the Emmot Committee was that the . teachers should contribute 5 per cent of their salaries and the employing authorities Z\ per cent.    The Exchequer was to provide the whole of the &quot;back service&quot; charge and one-quarter of the charges in respect of &quot;future service&quot;.    No part of\the Exchequer contribution was to be funded, the liability whether, for baak service or for future service being met when and as-2- :
the pensions and other items of expenditure on whioh it was based became payable.For the purpose of the present estimates &quot;back service&quot; is taken to be all service up to 31st March, 1926, and payments in respect of back service include the return of contributions paid under the present temporary conditions in the years 1922-26 all of whioh will have been paid into the Exchequer and applied to current expenditure.Apart from the question of Funding the proposals of the Cabinet Committee differ in two respects from those of the Emmott Committee.fi)    The proposal of the Cabinet Committee is that the Authorities contribution shall be 5 per cent but that the. Exchequer shall pay a proportion of this contribution averaging 56 per cent, giving a net contribution from the authority of 2.2 per cent. The Emmott Committee proposed that the Authorities should pay 2.5 par cent.    This is a difference that It should be possible to accommodate if it were decided to adopt a funding basis, fii)    The proposals of the Cabinet Committee fix the grant-in-aid for the first two years at. 1.0-0 per oent of the. Authorities contribution.    The abnormal charge on the Exchequer for these years resulting from this arrangement appears in the Won-funding section of the appended Table, but not in the Funding Section.    It represents  1,100,000 a year, for two years (1926-27 and 1927-28).    The offer to the Local Authorities to make this grant is presumably a condition on which they have consented to contribute, and must, therefore, be implemented.    So far however as the solvency of the Fund is concerned there would be no necessity to provide the additional  2,200,000 in two lump sums
in the years mentioned if a funding arrangement were set up.    It would be sufficient to provide it by an equal annual charge on the Exchequer spread over say forty years;    in this form it WOuld represent  100,000 a year and only to this extent would it affect the figures shown In Cols.  (8) and (9) bf the Table.(Signed) 4oW. WATSON.&apos;25th February, 1925.
