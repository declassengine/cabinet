27 (25).j CABINET,I0)HOW AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.. &apos;PUBLIC HEALTH (SCOTLAND) AMEHDMEHT BILL. Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.I circulate for the information of my colleagues draft of a Bill amending the Public Health (Scotland&quot;) Act, 1597, empowering Local Authorities to provide insulin and treatment to persons suffering from diabetes who need assistance in obtaining, the drug.English Local Authorities have power under Section 133Local Authorities in Scotland have no such power, at present their powers being limited to infectious, epidemic or endemic diseases.     In practice, however, they have&apos;been provic insulin since the early part of 1924 on the understanding that legislation would be introduced to legalise their position and th Bill is intended to effect that object,, it being &quot;provided that it shall have effect as from 1st Marcn, 1924.heMy colleagues will no doubt recollect that a Bill on this subject was introduced by the late Government, passed through the House of Commons and received a Second Heading in the House of Lords.   That Bill authorised the provision of medicines and treatment not only for persons suffering from diabetes bat also for persons Buffering from &quot;such other diseases as the Board may by order prescribe&quot;.&quot; Having regard to the views expressed by a number ox the larger Local Authorities in connection with the Bill of last year, I am of opinion that the present Bill should be limited to diabetes.The Bill is merely an enabling Bill and does not require Local Authorities to exercise its powers.   Nor will Local Authorities be required to^provide the drug or incidental treat-.j- expected to make will be obtained by Authorities and they will work under a scheme made by them and approved by the Board of Health.As my colleagues are aware, insulin is a most potent drug in the treatment of diabetes, persons suffering from it being able, in consequence of the use of the drug, to live ordinary useful lives instead of remaining useless invalids. It is, however, not required to the vast majority of cases which yield to treatment by diet.   It is required only in the severe case.Although the drug is much less expensive than when it was first introduced into this country, the serious financial -eatiire involved in the treatment is that it has to be continued over a very long time if not throughout the whole lifo of the patient.   The present cost of the drug works out at about 4/- or 5/- per week on the basis of two injections per day of 10 cubic centimetres each.Certain/*gjX)Cul!OT: ^ BRITAMIC.MAJESTY1 S GOTOH^SOT.
Certain classes of patients are already provided for out of public funds -(a) Insured persons under the National Insurance Acts:(b) Paupers under Poor Law Medical Relief:(c) Nursing mothers and their infants, and children under Maternity Service and. Child Welfare Schemes.Other diabetics,- principally the &apos; dependants of ihsured persons and those with small inotoes - cannot afford the treatment, even at the present cost bi the drag.If the Bill is approved, it would facilitate, administration were I in a position to tell Local Authorities that the Government intend to $res3 forward the Bill forthwith.&apos;J0HN &amp;ILK0UR&apos;.Scottish Office, Whitehall.21st Jamary, 1925.
