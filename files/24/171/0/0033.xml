*   . 157ill!!Tg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY7S GO^TERNMENT.secret  0 A B I If E I, 1.P.33 (25) .MERCHANT SHIPPING BILL RELATING TO THE RECOGNITION OP FOREIGN REGULATIONS CONCERNING SHIPPING.Memorandum by the President of the, Board of Trade.The Merchant Shipping Aot contains certain Sections providing for the conclusion of agreements with foreign countries for the mutual -recognition of Regulations relating to the Safety of Shipsf the agreement being as a rule limited to cases in which the foreign country in question gives similar terms to British ships.   Su.ch an agreement can be made only where the laws and regulations in the foreign country in ques-tion are equally effeotive with or substantially equivalent ts. our own laws though they may not be necessarily in exact agreement with them.   The power to make these agreements is of great advantage to us as it enables our ships to avoid the great inconvenience of having to go through similar surveys and obtain similar certificates in foreign countries.Recently the French Government passed a law relating to Wire3.ess Telegraphy on ships, which differs&apos; appreciably from our law on the subject.   The French Government offered to make a reciprocal agreement with us providing for the acceptance in French ports of compliance with our law as equivalent to compliance with the French law on the under.-standlng that we   would similarly accept compliance on the part of the French ships with their law in our ports.   Though after some examination we came to the conclusion that the French requirements could be regarded as substantially equivalent to ours we found that we had no legal power to make such an agreement, as our law on the subject of Wireless Telegraphy on ships requires foreign ships to comply strictly with the British requirements while in ports of the United-1-r
Kingdom.    The main object of the Bill is to give us power to make a reciprocal agreement with the French or other Governments on the subject of Wireless Telegraphy on Ships.   At the same time it is desirable to make the power more general as there may be other matters concerning which we should have this power of making these agreements with foreign countries.The condition regarding reciprocity is important as it gives us a very useful bargaining power in relation to foreign countries.   The recent Treaty of Commerce with Germany provides that the contracting parties will, within the limits admitted by their laws and subject to the conditions of equivalence and reciprocity, accept the Regulations prescribed by the other contracting party relating to the measurement, fittings and equipment for safety of ships.   The Bill puts us in a position to carry out this undertaking.The matter is urgent beoause the French law, which comes into force next March, will impose substantial obligations on a considerable number of British ships of comparatively small tonnage, to which the British wireless regulations do not apply, and it is accordingly important that we should be in a position to negotiate an agreement with the French as soon as possible. I suggest that the Bm should be introduced.in the House of Lords at a very early date.P * CL.Board of Trade,26th January, 1925.
