This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government.SECRET.Printed for the Cabinet, February, 1925.Copy No.CP. 66 (25).THE CABINET.ARMY SUPPLEMENTARY  RESERVE.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.A conflict may arise between the Labour Party and the Government over the Supplementary Reserve.I have seen Mr. Cramp and Mr Bevin, and both take the line that their Unions will oppose any of their men joining the Supplementary Reserve so long as there is any chance of these reservists being used to break a strike, or being called on for railway or transport services during a strike.My predecessor gave an undertaking not to call up the Supplementary Reserve in aid of the Civil Power, but maintained undiminished the liability of a reservist, like any other soldier, to perform any duty once he was called up.I propose to take the same line and to send a letter, in the terms of the draft annexed (Appendix A), to .Mr. Cramp (and a similar letter to Mr. Bevin) unless any of my colleagues desire to discuss the matter and so inform me before the next Cabinet.L. W.-E.6th February, 1925.APPENDIX A.Dear Mr. Cramp,I have now had an opportunity of considering the points raised by you in our conversation of 29th January last, regarding the aims, objects and liabilities of the Army Supplementary Reserve.In the first place I find that the Railway Company&apos;s circular does contain the provision regarding the non-enforcement of the liability to be called out in aid of the Civil Power, framed in similar words to those employed in Army Order 347 of 1924. It states that &quot; the liability to be called out in aid of the Civil Power will not be enforced, but after men of the Supplementary Reserve have been called out on permanent service or when they are otherwise subject to Military Law, they are in the same position as men of the Regular forces as regards their being ordered on duties&quot; of this nature. In effect, this means that men of the Supplementary Reserve are treated similarly to men of the Territorial Army in this respect.&quot;in these circumstances I do not think that the circular can be made more explicit on the point in question.As I pointed out to you, there is a legal liability on the part of all Reservists, including Supplementary Reservists, to be called up in aid of the Civil Power under Section 5 of the Reserve Forces Act, 1882. This is the liability which it has been definitely and authoritatively decided should not be enforced.The undertaking that such liability will not be enforced is explicit and unconditional. It has been given by my predecessor as Secretary of State, and I propose to endorse and
reaffirm this undertaking, if ane&amp;essar^j -,in.,,^he ^JSqu^of Corprnons. A solemn pledge of this nature could not be repudiated, and no&apos; Government of whatever complexion could contemplate such repudiation. You asked me whether the undertaking could not be incorporated in the attestation form. I am advised that, although that cannot be done, there is no objection to handing to each recruit a statement to the same effect. I enclose a copy of the proposed statement, and I hope yon will agree that it should leave no doubt in the recruit&apos;s mind that he will not be called up in aid&apos;of the Civil Power.Section 12 of the Reserve Forces Act, 1882, provides for the Reserve being called out by proclamation on permanent service in case of imminent national danger or of great emergency. The Supplementary Reserve . will only be called out under this provision, except for training. As I told you, when the Reserve has been called out the reservists are soldiers, and, as stated in the Army Order, are in the same position as men of the Regular Forces, and can be used for all purposes for which the Regular Army may be used. 1In effect, as stated in the Army Order, men of the Supplementary Reserve will be in exactly the same position as men of the Territorial Army in respect of their employment.You also felt anxiety as to the possibility of the Supplementary Reserve being used for the purpose of breaking a railway, strike. Apart from, the considerations to which I have drawn attention above, I really think that the numbers-,themselves, should be sufficient to allay any anxiety on this score,. So far as the Railway units are concerned, the total number which it is proposed to raise is 71 officers and 3,273 other ranks, and they would be useless for such a purpose.As has been repeatedly stated, the sole object of the Supplementary Reserve is to complete the Regular. Army on mobilization, with technical tradesmen, since our peace establishments combined -with our existing Array Reserves;j do. pot. suffice for the increased numbers of such tradesmen required owing to the modern mechanicalizationof the Army.   This Reserve will be divided into two categories - , &apos;.   .....(1) Those who will not be required to train in peace time owing to their peace professions being similar to the duties which they would have to perform after mobilization ;-it,   &apos; 1 and -(2) Those who will have to be trained in peace.Some complete units will &quot;be&apos; raised, while&apos; on the other hand a large number of tradesmen will not be formed in units at all during peace.Railwaymen showed no unwillingness to respond to the call made to them to serve during the late war, and if the .iinhappy necessity ever arose, they would I am sure be equally ready to serve their country ; but what is wanted is a cut and dried scheme developed in peace, so as to avoid what might be a fatal delay on mobilization.I have gone into the main points in which you are interested at some length, because I want to make it quite clear that the War Office has no ulterior motives and because I am most anxious to have the advantage of the sympathy and support of your Union in promoting the success of. the scheme which is of vital importance in our military organization.Proposed Statement referred to in Draft &apos; Letter to Mr.&apos; Cramp.v ui A:lt^ou^1 b7 virtue of this Enlistment; No.........
