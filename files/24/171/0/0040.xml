THIS DOOTJMMT 13 THE PROPERTY OF ElS BRITMNIC^-MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.AIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.; The present situation in regard to Airship Develop-?irient is that the Admiralty is extremely anxious to revert to a Cornmerciikl Scheme on the 15aies of that put forward by  leutanantCommander Burhey in 1923, in order that there may be provided in peace time large numbers of Airships suitabla for use in war; for Ocean Naval Reconnaissance, in the sajfle way as Merchant Ships are used as Auxiliary Cruisars in war time.Unfortunately the late Government, early in 1924, Scrapped this scheme, the contract for which was on the point of being signed, and introduced one of. St^te Control instead, and decided to have only one Commercial Airship built by Burney1 s Company, while the Air Ministry was to build a War Airship whose primary function was. to be Naval Reconnaissance.The latter scheme is far more expensive to the country arid no proposals have been put forward for establishing Commercial Airship lines.Furthermore, if persisted with, this scheme commits the country to a Policy of War Airship construction, Just at a period when every endeavour is being made to reduce war commitments to a minimum.The primary use of Airships in War is for Ocean Naval Re conns, isaanae.   Hydrogen filled Airships are an easy prey to shore based aircraft.   The U.S.A., the only existing source for Helium in hulk, are only able to provide enough Helium Gas for a few of the U.S.A. Airships.What the Admiralty desire is a large number of commercial Airships with Naval Reserve crews, )Which could he utilised in war time foi Ocean Naval Reconnaissance.   Wheh large numbers of Airships have been produced and proved reliable, riTmsy be possible for the Admiralty; to suggest a consequent redaction In their Cruiser building programme.The Admiralty and Air Ministry are cordially co-operating in an endeavour to make a success of the working of the Agreement in regard to the Fleet Air Arm;   but the late government&apos;s schema of State Control of Airship Development is viewed with concern by the Admiralty.The whole state of the case is clearly described in the attached memorandum by the Naval Staff.I earnestly hope that the Cabinet will see its way to adopt the Admiralty proposals whioh will be of far reaching and lasting benefit to the whole Empire, including the saying of large sums of money and a reduction of our war commitmenTs.(Intld)   W.C.B.Admiralty, S.W.28th January 1925.
AIRSHIP DBYBLOPMEM5.The Admiralty view with concern the present situation in regard to Airship Development.The policy which is being worked to at present is a reversal of that adopted/by H.M. Government in 1923, which latter in the opinion of the Admiralty was likely to meet Naval requiremants to a greater extent than can be achieved by the former.This memorandum has been prepared with a view to laying the salient facts of the case before His Majesty&quot;s Government.2,   Past Airships should be of great value to the Empire from a commercial point of view in peace and for Ocean Reconnaissance duties as a part of Naval operations In war.The introduction of airships, if stiffioiently developed to reach a reliable stage before any future war breaks out, should greatly strengthen the power of the Navy to protect our great Ocean trade route.There are two ways of approaching the problem -one, by the development of War airships whose principal function would be Naval Ocean Reconnaissance;     and the otherr. by the development of commercial airship services for the carrying of mails and passengers in peace, which in war would be available for Naval Ocean Reconnaissance on the great Trade Routes.In deciding which of these, or whether both of these courses should be pursued, It is necessary to realise the considerable expense of design Staffs andDrawing....
/Table overleafDrawing Offices, as literally thousands of detailed drawings are required for any new type of rigid airship and large numbers of contractors and suh-oontraotors are involved in the supply of material for the various portions of the ship.      The expense of bases and mooring masts is also very considerable.The financial straits in which we find ourselves at present do not justify large sums of money being devoted to war airship construction when it has been stated by the Admiralty that their requirements will be largely met If commercial airship, services are developed and encouraged.3.    Before proceeding-to enlarge on ,that side of the question, it is as well to survey briefly the history of rigid airship construction In England.

4. In 1921 the Admiralty re/fretfully agreedto the: suspension of the Airship Service in order to obtain their requirements in heavier-than-air Aircraft and in that year the Government made a public offer to the effect that they would hand over the existing- airship bases and material to any person or company, free of cost, in consideration of airships being1 developed as commercial vehicles0 Up to March 1922, ho person or company came forward to take advantage of that offer&quot;, and instructions were in consequence given for all airships and their bases to be turned over to the Disposals and Liquidation Ooranission for sale at scrap prices.5. At the end of iferch 1922, Lieutenant CommanderBurney made an offer to the British Government to take,; over all airships and their bases, and to form a Company to run commercial airships between this country and India on certain terms. Negotiations between Lieut. Commander Burney and the Government proceeded for many months, and in the latter part of 1923 an agreement was on the point of being concluded.6. The basis of agreement was as follows:-A Company called &quot;The Airship Guarantee Company&quot; was formed with the support of those experienced ship and airship builders the vast Engineering firm of Messrs, Vickers Ltd,, and with the Airship Guarantee Company&apos;s offices in Messrs. Tickers&apos; headquarters, Sir. Trevor Dawson,, the Managing Director of Messrs. Tickers is the Chairman of the Airship Guarantee Company.This Company undertook to provide half a     , million of money in Ordinary shares, the Government contributing  2,800,000 on loan secured as debentures issued by an Operating Company which was to be formed. The loan was to be spread over seven years in three stages andsubject.. ..
- 5 -subjeot to the Company achieving1 certain progress in each stage iaOa a certain minimum number of airships operating oh the Indian Route in each stage.   The loan to be made as follows,  400,000 in the 1st stage and  i,200,000 in each of the second and third stages if the progress agreed to had been achieved.Then following1 on that there;was to b8 a maximum Annual Pee by the Government of  350,000 or at the rate of  41,666 on each Airship in commission up to a maximum of 6 airships. All profits of the OperatingCompany after providing for Reserves were to be divided equally between the Operating Company and the Government until such time as the British Government had been repaid the whole of the  3.800,000.The Government Airship Stations at Oardington and Pulham were to be leased to the Operating Company at a Peppercorn Rent with an option to the Company of purchasing for half a million pounds.   The Airships, Airship material etc. at Car ding-ton and Pulhani to be delivered free of cost to the Operating Company.7. The Company were to provide the followingfacilities.-(a) All information as to construction, maintenance and development to be available for the Government.(b) The Government to be entitled to use bases at a cost to be decided.(o)   The Government to have rights as regards patents under Patent and Design Act.(d) The Government to have power to use any invention .in any part of the world without any profit being made by the Airship Company.(e) Everything to be delivered to the Government on a National Emergency, and the Government to be sole judges in this respect.(f) The Company to provide Government with all plans.(g) The Company to maintain complete sets of drawings etc. free of charge.(h) The Company to allow Government officers and ratings to train in their Airships.

Emergency.(1)   The Company to carry mails whan required on terms to &quot;be agreed.(m)   The Company to place the whole; of its facilities at the disposal of. the Government for manoeuvres.The total number cf airships initially provided were six5 and thereafter two per year, depreciation &quot;being taken as 33j$.The fee payments for any Airships actually in commission were to run during such portion of the 1st fifteen years after the signing of the agreement as the Company had a Satisfactory Indian Airship Service running,8o Allowing five to seven years for the. &quot;building-of the initial six airships, some twenty six to twenty twoairships in all would have, &quot;been but.l,ti during the period covered &quot;by the Agreement, namely 15 years^ and after the initial 5 - 7 years at any one moment a fleet of at least6 airships should have been in beings ;If, .therefore3 these vessels were run successfully from the commercial point of view the total iAnnual cost, of the Airship service to the Government was limited to a quarter of a million pounds sterling which was the limiting&apos; amount of fee payment.9o The above terms having &quot;been agreed between theTreasury and the Airship Guarantee Company, the draft contracts were actually in print, and provisional arrange-ments made for the Company to take over Oardington.At this moment, at the end of 19S3, however, the Government went out of office and the succeeding Government immediately decided not to agree to the contract &quot;being signed, but to alter the. whole scheme to conform to*tt ll6 *****
- 7 -the idea of State Control *10.&apos;        A scheme was then put forward and passed through Parliament author1!sing-  l ,350*000 for the const motion of only two airships one of which was to he a war airship by the Air Ministry and the other a commercial airship by the Airship Guarantee Company, The Air Ministry also to construct bases in England, ISgypt and India.   They are also to carry oui some experiments with the existing Airship ,rR.33&quot;, which could equally well be Carried out by the Airship (Guarantee Company.The revised scheme entails considerable unnecessary expense to the Government, since it involves tho creation of two separate designs and drawing staffs and, as already stated, literally thousands&apos;&apos; of detailed drawings are required for any new type of rigid airship. Further, it is considered that we can only expect to&apos; achieve the best results by concentrating the available knowledge of airship construction in one body of designers.11.       Up to &quot;date all British airships have been designed either by the Admiralty, who have the necessary technical construction and engineering1 experts, and long experience in connection with the design and construction of engines and ships of all types, etc., in Dockyards and other Government establishment and various contractors and sub-contractors, or by Messrs. Vickers, whose engineering and shipbuilding transactions are also well known. The building of all British airships heretofore has been carried out by the great engineer-ing and shipbuilding firms shown in the table in par.3.The war airship is to be built by the Air Ministry, who have no experience of such work (other than having completed the building of &quot;R.33&quot; which had been 1/3 built by Shorts), &quot;and have no engineering or constructiondepartments....
departments, but rely on private firms for engines andaeroplanes.     Many years must elapse and much money be expended by the Air Ministry before they Can hope to approach the position already occupied by. the Admiralty with regard to airship designers and constructors.Consequently, if -Var Airships are required to be designed and built by a Government Department, it would appear that the Admiralty should be empowered to undertake the work, more especially in view of the fact that the Airships are required for Naval Reconnaissances12. &quot;Pile late Government fs scheme for thecompletion at the best of only two airships, will, as stated above, cost  1,350,,000) and of this sum  350,000 has been voted by Parliaments ,   It is understood that this is being expended as follows:-. 150,000 has been paid to the Airship Guarantee Company as part payment for the commercial airship.and the  200,000 remaining is being.utilised by the Air Ministry for enlarging Cardington Airship Shed, the re-conditioning .of &quot;R.33&quot; for experimental trial, purposes and for the provision of.3 mooring masta, one each for Cardington, Egypt and India.13. It appears certain that the existing arrangement will prove to be expensive because (a) No scheme of commercial development is. foreshadowed, but an option is given.to the Airship. Guarantee Company to repurchase the. Airship built by them, for  150,000.     The^whole^cos^of  li350iQQQi-iherel,ore-f allonly be repaid the  150,000 mentioned above iB. he..uBli^l$Air. Ministry are building up a large staff which will mean standing charges over a long period.   For instance, it is understood that large numbers of Officers and men have already been engaged at Oardington .which station has been retained by the Government,   (c) The Cardington Airship is intended &quot; .  . .   &apos; /to
to be designed for the primary purpose of Naval Ocean Reconnaissance and not primarily as a commercial airship and consequently it may not be of sufficiently suitable type for commercial purposes to enable it to be run profitably with mails and passengers, with the result that this Airship if built may always entail Government provision for its maintenance, (d) The cost of the annual maintenance of the bases which it is intended to build will fall on theGovernment observing that these bases may not be suitable for the operating of commercial airships.     The most suitable positions for such bases can only be selected by companies operating airships after careful investigations regarding the particular Commercial Interests they will serve.I - JL oul cL t he r e f or e ^ gpoe gr . thaJ_not_0.nljL.c2n. 1 i  $le-0E..S2..I S  ur^^ c .n  gmplsi e d*-b.ul, chaC^S- or-stafl^and-mgin .14.

On the other hand, the airship being built by the Air Ministry has not yet been laid down ?nd it is apparently unlikely that construction can commence before the latter part of 1925.15. In order to correct what in the opinion of theAdmiralty is a lamentable position as regards airshipdevelopment, there would seem to be two courses open; either the Government must:-(1)   Contemplate an expenditure running into millions a year, for the purpose of keeping up bases all over the world; together with a fleet of airships for naval purposes, or(2)   Modify the existing scheme and agree to turning it into a commercially opposition whereby the expenditure of the British Government on Airships themselves could be limited to about a quarter of a million per annum./if
- 10 -If the second,of these courses is adopted it would seem that a saving to the Government of some  780,000 could be made (see below ), in addition to the sum up to --.500,000 for which Cardington and 1&apos;ulhom could eventually be sold to the Airship Guarantee Company.&apos;Zhe adoption of Course 2, furthermore has the great advantage that, while with airships in considerable number it would link up the Empire with a system of rapid communication which should be of immense value commercially. it should provide at the comparatively small cost&apos;of a quarter of a million per annum a valuable scouting force for the Kavy in time of war*MfvTI-i: Whichever course is authorised the Monitors with Mooring Ivlast? will be required.In these days when it is increasingly difficult to persuade the uninformed that we have no desire to becomemilitarists, but are only anxious to be in a position to protect our Umpire and its trade routes against aggression, . it: is particularly important to limit the expenditure on (-he Armed E^rces of the Grown to the lowest possible amounts6 The adoption of Scheme Z would be very helpful in thedirection of achieving this and would enable the British Empire to enter the next Disarmament Conference practically unfettered by military commitments in this sphere of activity.16. It is desired to emphasise that, the only realuses to which airships can be put at the present time are for the purposes of Imperial communications in times of peace, (ioe. the carrying of passengers and mails), and long distance and sustained naval ocean reconnaissance in time of War.   The carrying of war material and other subsidiary service by Hydrogen filled airships is unlikely owing to their vulnerability to attack when operating within reach of enemy shore based aircraft, and in any case these functions are of minor advantage compared with Ocean Naval Reconnaissance./The
- ii - &apos; -. 212The &quot;immense value in, commercial trims no t i ons-Jii the rapid transport of mails %s obvious.In this, connection, although ah airship   which is built primarily for natal ocean reconnaissance may be unsuitable for conversion for commercial use, on the other hand, en airship which is built lor commercial purposes may readily be utilised tor ocean naval reconnaissance provided in the original design this possible alternative has been taken into consideration.   In other words, it would be intended that in :;/ar a. commercial airship would, be utilised as an auxiliary in much the same way as a merchant ship is adapted for use as an auxiliary cruiser.17o If airships are to be used by the Navy in time ofwar floating bases are a necessary requirement and it is, therefore, essential that the mast fittings which may be used for mooring airships must be common to those of the masts erected on shore or in ships so that the airship may be moored to a shore base or floating base as required.   It follows that the construction of the airship must be such that it can be moored to a floating mast as well as to a shore mast.    These important details have yet to be settled and it is urged that the construction of Shore Masts should be held up pending a decision on the points.It is understood that the only facilities which the Airship Guarantee Company require in order to test the route between England and India are two Naval Monitors fitted with mooring masts.   The Admiralty are holding 3 Monitors available for this purpose.These mobile bases could be moved as desired, which would enable the airships to be tried out for Naval Ocean Reconnaissance as might be desired by the Admiralty.With the collaboration of the Colonial Office, demonstration airship voyages could be made by the ships of the Airship Guarantee Company to each of the Dominions in/turn
- 12 -21tarn, with, the Monitors suitably placed en route.     This would give the greatest possible impetus to the Dominions to support the development of a commercial Airship Servioe. 18. The Admiralty desire to emphasise that they require a large number of airabipa for use in War end as. owing to financial stringency, there does not appear to be any possibility of realising this object within a reason&amp;bl period of time, if the present scheme is adhered to, they propose the following aption(a) Ho further contracts other than those for the Oardington Shed and the construction of the&apos;&quot;&quot; mOofiag &quot;masts,&apos; which It Is understood have been placed, to be entered into, but the mooring mast construction must conform to the remarks in para. 17(b) The Air Ministry War Airship (to be built at Cardizigton) to be o&amp;noelled, observing that it has not yet been laid down.(o)   The Airship Guarantee Company to be aafced to put forward again proposals for the establiahmeht of an Imperial Airship Company to operate airships on the lines which were generally approved by the Government ih 1923; with the following important alterations t-(1)   That the direction of design in regard to war qualities including fitments and arrangements to enable Armaments to be instalieds should be vested solely in the hand.3 of the Admiralty.     Beyond this directing power by the Admiralty it is not intended or desired that the commercial aspect should be interfered with more than is neoessary, so that the freedom and initiative of the commercial companies may be preserved.(ii) That the personnel of Airships and their bases should inolude a large seafaring nucleus the whole crew being affiliated to the laval Reserves.     (The enrolment and training of the administrative, executive and technical personnel in the Reserve Forces of the Crown *  was included in the 1923 Scheme.)The necessity for this proposed alteration will be apparent when it is remembered that airships whether employed on Imperial Coimunic&apos;sitTonsi or Naval ^oeffl^^omaiss^e wiTT makefile ir passages partly over the&apos; gr eat&quot; oceana and iSaF^tEey will neqe^arTly IBTTfootherod^^yTfae&quot;&quot;Spyal Navy.  &quot;The personnel&apos; must therefore be&quot; brought1 up in &quot;close touch with the Navy and havo a good knowledge of the sea for application both while in flight and when coming to their moorings.     Further the cloae resemblance betweenthe
13 -the Steamship lines of the present and the jlirship lines of the future mafces it logical to. assume that the war policy and requirements should in each case be framed by the some Government Department, via,-the Admiralty,both the Steamships and Airships being regulated in Peace by the Board of Trade.(d) Two Monitors each with Mooring Mast and Gas Fiant to be provided by the Admiralty and the coliabora-tion of the Colonial Office invited to interest the various Dominion Governments in trial flights to the Dominions.(e) The existing Airship &quot;R.33&quot; to be lent, or sold,to the Airship Guarantee Company to recondition and utilise for preliminary experiments including mooring and other tests,19 * The Admiralty suggest that the commercial development of airships should be encouraged and madepracticable by means of a system of loans and subsidiesas this will result in more airships being obtained thanthe State by itself could possibly afford to produce.Commercial enterprise ought to have a free hand and besubject only to such directional control as far as theAdmiralty is concerned as is neoe3Sary to ensure that thuairship as developed will be of real use to the Navy in emergency,20. Sufflmarising the position from the financial pointof view, the saving whioh could be effected by these suggestions would be approximately as follows:-Expenditure already        (Cost of Airship Guaranteeincurred by Contract.

Annual Payments of  400,000.If, arid when, Stage 2 of the 1923 scheme is successfully met by the Airship Company9 the Government then advance another  1,200*000 by Annual Payments of  400,000.The above further advances totalling  2s400s000 to be repaid by the Airship Company out of the profits.IPnrtharmore, it must be remembered that eventually the Government should receive a sum up to  500,000 for the sale of Cardington and Pulham.Also, as soon as the Airship Operating Company took: over Cardington and Pulham (at Peppercorn Rent) for tho repair of their Airships, the annual upkeep of these 2 establishments would be saved to the Crown.If
If,  and when;, the Airship Operating Company have succeeded in maintaining, en Airship Service to India on the basis of 8 passages in each direction during each&apos; calendar month, the Government would have for the remainder of the 15 years, a number of Airships suitable for Naval Ocean Reconnaissance in war at the small cost of  41s666 per Airship per year up to a maximum total for all Airships at  250,000 per year.218 It is understood that it would be possible afterthe demonstration flights have been made, for the company to commence building 8 Airships - 4 from each of tho Howdeh shedsper annum, retaining the shed at Cardington for repairing theAirships in service.E2* The late Govel-nment^s ,,SpheTO ^sjfes^ 1 ,,350,pOOA-&quot;ofwhich nothing is to be paid back under any ciroumstanGes except  150 ^COO in the very unliliely event of the Company repurchasing their Airship .23. As has been stated above the Admiralty requirenumbers of airships to be available in a reasonably short space of time from now, and, assuming that commercial develop-ment produces reliable and efficient Airships and that the Admiralty is given every facility to try these out as may be required, it can be contemplated that expenditure on fiiture cruiser construction could be ourtailec&quot;1-. ... But until definite and actual proof of reliability is. obtained the aotual substitution of cruisers by airships cannot be considered.The cheapest method of obtaining: proof of reliability is by means of the development of Commercial Airship lines.
