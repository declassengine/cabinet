Secret. Copy No,_CP.95 (25).-- CABINET.PROPOSED CONFERENCE ON AGRICULTURAL POLIGf. Memorandum by the Minister cf Agriculture.Q1, I have at length received, replies from all the organisations who were invited to nominate representatives on the Conference of agricultural interests which it was proposed should be set up on the basis of the Memorandum on Agricultural Policy which was published in the press on November 28th last (CP. 504 (24)).m        r, - -2. The landowners&apos; organisations at once accepted myinvitation and nominated their representatives.:     TheINational Farmers1 Union, after raising a number of controversial points on the scope of the proposed Conference, finally agreed, with some reluctance, to participate in it and sent me the1names of their nominees.     On the other hand, the NationalIUnion of Agricultural Workers and the workers1 Union, each ofIwhich was invited to nominate three representatives, have definitely declined, to do so.2. It is important to recollect the principal objectfor which the Conference idea was originally put forward.    ThisIwas to secure, if possible, agreement within the industry, in order that such agreement might serve as a basis of agreement between political parties.     It was a means to an end.     The, refusal of the Labour Unions to participate is a pretty sure indication that no conclusions at which the agricultural industry might arrive would have any chance of securing the impartial consideration, much les^ the support,, of all parties; and this obviously affects the question of whether it is profitable to pursue preliminaries that, are morally certain, from the point of view of their ultimate object, to be abortive.1.1  1...-..V-I -jut-.

4. In these circumstances we have to consider what    58action we should take. I leave aside the possibility ofremitting the task of examining the agricultural situation to a Royal Commission or some such tribunal.     This has already-been done in one form or another several times in the last few years, and   further ploughing of that ground is not likely to bring us any nearer to the main ob;feotivo of, poiitical agreeinent to which I have referred in paragraph 3. It accordingly appears to me that there are four possible alternatives, via:-(a) to go on with the Conference without anyrepresentatives of labour,(b) to nominate six representatives of labourourselves,(o) to invite the National Union of Landworlsers to nominate six representatives,(4) to abandon the Conference. 5. Both of the first two alternatives are in ray opinionundesirable and indeed impracticable.     A Conference without labour could not claim to represent the views of the industry as a whole and any recommendations it made would carry little weight with the general public.On the other hand, nomination of labour representa-tives selected by the Ministry, even if suitable men were willing to serve, would destroy the representative character of the Conference, for the labour members would represent no one but themselves.       Moreover,  I am confidentially informed by the leaders of the National Farmers&apos; Union that If the Labour interest were represented only by nominees of the Government/ they would feel bound to advise the Union to withdraw their representatives, and they have not much doubt that their advice would be accepted by the Council of the Union.     They undoubtedly fear that to ignore theofficial organisations of Labour today would be to establish......        . &apos;. &apos; .     -a precedent for ignoring the official organisation of Farmers tomorrow.     I suspect too that the National Farmers * Union2.
are uneasy;    they dislike the whole Idea of the Conference       -K 0 *fjj Q land would welcome airy opportunity of getting out of it. 6. The third alternative of inviting representatives from the National union of Landworkers also raises difficulties which appear to me to preclude Its adoption.     The union cannot, I am afraid, be regarded as a bona fide organisation of agricultural workers.      It is well known that it collects practically no subscriptions from its members, and that it is largely dependent on financial support from employers. For this reason the Union has never been recognised&quot; by the Ministry of Agriculture, as entitled to representation on official bodies.     Sir Robert Sanders declined to give them representation on the Agricultural Conciliation Committees and they are not represented on the present Agricultural Wages Boards.     The National Farmers1 Union, the National Union of Agricultural Workers and the Workers&apos; Union have consistently declined to recognise or to have any relations with the National Union of Landworkers, and if this Union were given representation on the Conference, the National Farmers1&apos; Union would undoubtedly withdraw.7. I have taken the opportunity of ascertaining theviews of the Unionist Agricultural committee of the Rouse of Commons.     There is considerable difference of opinion, though the Committee will be ready to accept whatever decision the Government arrives at.     Those who wish to go on with the Conference are,  I think, more numerous, though not perhaps more weighty, than those who wish to drop it.     The desire to go on is based upon -(1) Having made a good deal of the Conference idea atthe Election, which was found to be generallyattractive;(2) -In assumption that if the Conference is dropped, it will be tantamount to an admission that we can do nothing;(2) Unwillingness to change our professed policy owing to the wrong-headed, action of unrepresentative Agricultural Unions.
8, After giving the best consideration that I oan toall these arguments, I adhere to my original view that we should not endeavour to proceed with the Conference as originally proposed, and that the blame should, be put upon the Labour Unions for their refusal to participate.     But considerable importance will attach -(1) to the form in which we announce our decla?on, (2) to the action that the Goveiruaont can take in matters affecting agriculture, g. As to the first I suggest that I shxniid giva thefollowing reply to a question in the House of Commons&quot;In view of the refusal of both of the Labour Unions to take part In the proposed Conference of agricultural interests, tiie Government has oome to the conclusion that it is impossible to establish a Conference on the lines originally suggested.      It was proposed by the Government in the hope that if an agreement between the different sections of the industry could be attained, this might prove the foundation of an agreement between political parties, as to a permanent national policy.The refusal of the Labour Unions to participate in the Conference has destroyed this hope.The Government does not propose to abandon its declared intention of consulting representatives of the different sections of the Industry, but, in the circum-stanoes which have arisen, it will be its duty to seek the best advice available and to frame its own proposals, always having regard to the necessity of protecting agriculture from the danger of sharp reversals of national policy.&quot;10, As to the seoond the course of events in connectionwith the proposed Conference has in my opinion had the effect of guiding public and agricultural opinion away from any general policy of subsidies to farming and has thereby achieved one of the principal objects which I had In mind in proposing it.      The agricultural policy of the Government must therefore
be founded on the assumption that the industry will have.-&apos;main to be conducted on an economic basi^s-^^^and^that heroic remedies involving substantial burdens on the Exchequer, with no guarantee of permanence, such as must depend on general agreement, are not at present within the realm of practical politics.     But I cannot emphasise too strongly to my colleagues that the abandonment of the Conference will, in public opinion, impose a very definite responsibility upon the Government to do everything that it can within these limits, and I propose to oirculate a later memorandum suggesting ways in which the Government can and ought to assist agriculture.11. I understand that the Secretary for Scotlandproposes to proceed with the Scottish Conference in spite of the refusal of some of the organisations to nominate representatives.     Scottish agriculture has however always been in a some?i?hat different economic position from agricul-ture in England and Wales, their problems and conditions are quite different and have always been dealt with on different lilies.      I understand also that from the first he has made It clear that his intention was to call a Conference of leading agriculturists belonging to the various sections of the industry, without necessarily confining himself to reprssenta-tives appointed by the organisations.     In England on the other hand the Conference has always been conceived as a Conference of organisations in order to secure members who could spea*c with the weight of organised opinion behind them and not merely as individuals.     I do not feel, therefore, that different action in Scotland, while it must necessarily excite comment, need cause serious embarrassment to the Government in deciding to abandon the English Conference.E.F.L.W.
