pHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.miR HOUSES.Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland.iscebt.Lp. 49 (25).I&quot; (1)   I &quot;have recently had brought boforo my notice questions &quot; which have arisen in connection with the proposals&apos;of certain Local Authorities in Scotland for the erection of Weir houses.     These -questions relate to the conditions of employment undor which&apos;work-men engaged in connection with the manufacture and oroction of Weir houses are employed and the wages paid to them.   This natter is approaching an acute stage in the City of Glasgow where it has alroadv formed the subject of discussion by the Town Council who appointed roprooentativos to meet and discuss the matter with representatives of the firm of Messrs. G. &amp; J. Weir. Ltd.   No agree-nent was reached a-s the result of the meeting and the Town Council have recently approached the Scottish Board of Health on the questions in diepute. -(2)   The circumstances under which those questions have arisen are as follows:-   The houses supplied by Messrs. Weir are timber frame houses with an outer covering of steel platos.   Practically all the parts of the house are standardised and are factory made, the labour employed except as aftor explained, being unskilled.   The only skilled labour required in the manufacture&apos;and erection of the house is that of a few carpenters, etc., for the purpose of making the templates, etc., necessary for producing standardised parts of the house and also for the purpose of demonstrating in the factory to the men employed exactly how the work of construction and erection should be&quot;&quot;carried out.   These skilled carpenters, etc., are paid at the stanjard rate for their craft.(3)   Messrs, Yfeir claim that this io an entirely new industry and that, it is not house building in the ordinary sense, but the manufacture of houses under factory conditions. , They  therefore, propose to pay the men employed, with the exception or the skilled carpenters referred to above, at the recognised rates Obtaining in their particular trade, e.-g., engineering, fitting, etc., whicn, generally speaking, may oe^put &apos;at l/2i per hour.   Men who show special aptitude for the work are given an increase of Id. per hour and it is&apos;the intention of Messrs. weir to put suitable men on a piece rate ultimately which will at least yield them weekly earnings equal to or in excess of the weekly earnings of skilled building trade craftsmen.   The number of hours worked is 47 per week, as corn-pared with 44 hours per week in the building trades.   Tho rate paid to labourers engaged in connection&quot; with Weir houses is the standard rate for the engineering trade, viz., 10 d, per hour.(4)   Representatives of the building trades, both masters and men, have recently made it clear that they will resist to the utter-most any attempt to erect houses, no matter what the form or type of construction may be, where the operatives engaged m connection with the construction and erection thereof aro not employed under the conditions and wages obtaining in the building trades. i There aro, however, several master builders who do not support tnis attitude. At the present time the wagss obtaining in the building trades for skilled craftsmen are framed according to various grades and run from l/9d, per hour to&quot; l/6d. per hour.   Labourers aro paid 75 per cent, of the skilled rates.(5)   The communication from the Glasgow Corporation to the Scottish Board of Health requested the observations of the Board as/ to/
(; r f(j 3to  the - eligibility of tho Weir house for subsidy and to bo informed whether the Board proposed to take up with the Buildinp I Trade Operatives Federation tho matter of their objections to the I terms on whioh Messrs. Weir propose to erect tho houses.The Board, after consulting the Minister of Health and 1 the Minister of Labour  have replied to the effect that if tho Corporation undertake to ombody in their contract a lair Wasps - -    ------ ------^.......-------j.   ^ *w ii----of Condonsi Contracts they will pay subsidy in respect of tho houses erected 1 under ouch a contract&apos;   and that thoy are advised that tho.matter 1 of the operatives1 objections to the terms upon which Messrs. Woir 1 propone to erect houses for the Corporation is not one which falls I within the scope of thoir admini strati on,A copy of tho Board&apos;s letter is attached.(6)   I understand that the intention of the Building Trades I Unions is that if any Local Authority enters into a contract with I Messrs. Weir for tho erection of Weir houses under which Messrs. Weir are not taken bound to observe the conditions and pay the rates of&apos;wages obtaining in the building&apos;trades, the operatives engaged on other building work for the Local Authority&apos; concerned will be immediately withdrawn.   In Glasgow, where tho dispute is   * rapidly approaching a crisis, no contract has yet been entered into and it may bo that no &quot;contract will be entered into in viow of tho difficulties which have arisen,&quot; (7)   In the Middle lard of Lanarkshire tenders for the erection of 100 houses by Messrs. Weir have been accepted and&quot; the work in connection therewith is now in progress.   I anticipato that when Messrs. Woir start to the work of erection in the iii dale Ward I action will be taken by the operatives and that the country will then I be face to face with an industrial dispute which will seriously I affect the output of houses in Scotland in the coming year and which may determine the f ato of Woir houses as an auxiliary to the present methods of building construction.,     I should Gseplain that while there I are other firms in the market for now methods of construction, such j as Atholl Steel Houses, Ltd., and the Caledon Shipbuilding, Co., I Ltd,, Dundee, for steel houses and Glasgow Roofing Go, for concrete I and steel houses, the questions which have arisen in connection with 5 Weir houses do not appear to affect these firms, as I am informedthat building trade rates are being paid by them to the skilled I oraftsman engaged in connection with the construction and erection I of these houses,   These conditions, however, are reflected in the prices which are presently being asked for, Messrs. Weir&apos;s price Deing at least  90 per house lower than the lowest price quoted by those other firms for a house of three apartments with scullery, bathroom, w,c, etc.   This difference, however, is not wholly due to the higher rate of wages, but is to a considerable extent accounted tor by tho lighter method of construction adopted by Messrs. Weir.r(8)   If the dispute cannot be settled between the parties concerned   4 * - - u n j. ai. - n------------a h-------1- jA-ofmea-s possiDio^m order that thoy may consider the possibilities of the situation likely to arise wit A the view of determining the course to ve followed by them should Government intervention in the&apos; dispute become necessary.
(9)   For some time past building trade costs have shown an upward tendency and the Scottish Board, of Health with the view to preventing an extravagant riso in price such as took place under the,Aadison scheme have found it necessary to refuse their approval to the greater number of tenders whioh have been submitted by Local Authorities to them during tho last six months.   It&quot;is, therefore absolutely necessary that other suitable alternative methods of construction shall be encouraged and that anything which tends to inflate prices unfairly shall be discouraged.: If the building trades representatives succeed in their opposition.to Messrs. Weir, it is extremely unlikely that Messrs.. weir will agree to go on with the supply of Wfdr houses as an increase in the wagesSaid to their operatives engaged in the construction of ouses would have a re-percussion on the wages paid by them to tho operatives, engaged in their primary business.(10)   It is,-therefore, for consideration -(a) Whether in the event of the building trade representatives succeeding and Messrs. Weir deciding to abandon their project for&quot;tho manufacture and&apos;erection of Weir houses, the Government aro prepared to accept this situation.(b) Whether in the event ot the. dispute becoming acute where a Local Authority is willing to proceod on Messrs, Weirfs terms and as a result thereof find themselves penalised by tho withdrawal of all the building trade operatives from their other building operations any assistance can be rendered to such a Local Authority and if so what form that assistance should take.&quot; (c)   Whether Government intervention is desirable e.t any stage in the dispute and if so when and how that intervention shall take- place.&apos;J0HN (ELMOim1Scottish Office.28th January, 1925.

January, 1925.Sir,I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 19th instant and to reply thereto as follows(1)   If the Corporation undertake to ombody a FairWages Clause, which complies with the requirements of tho House of Commons Resolution with regard to the Fair Wages Clause in Government Contracts, in any contract to be ontered into with Messrs. Weir, the Board will pay subsidy in respect of tho houses erected under that contract.(2)   This Board have bef oro them the CorporationStanding Ordors and Instructions re.
