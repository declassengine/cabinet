(THIS DOOUMSHr IS TUB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOYURHLG3NG?) .SECRET. CABINET.CP.  19(25).&quot; RETURN TO GOLD STANDARD.Telegram from the Governor-General of the Common-wealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for tho Colonies, dated 8th January, 1925*(Circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies)Present quotations of exchange between London and New York and between Australia and London show that the Australian Pound is now at about par with the sovereign.     If the quota-tions of sterling in terms of the dollar improve and the Australian exchange rate unaltered import of gold into Australia will probably take place and Australia probably could adopt the gold standard before return to gold by the Mother Country.      Of course this might be prevented by bringing the Australian exchange with London nearer par and the whole matter is being carefully watched by the Commonwealth Government.      In these circumstances it is highly desirable to know whether any definite steps may be expected to be taken shortly by Groat Britain towards return to gold payment and my Ministers v/ould be greatly obliged if you would furnish any available information on the subject.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. January 15th. 1925.
