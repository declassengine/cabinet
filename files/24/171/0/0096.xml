[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesr/g Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925.SECRET.Copy No.   8,9:CP. 95 (25).CABINET.AIRSHIP. DEVELOPMENT.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith a-memorandum by Sir George Barstow regarding the finance of the Burney Airship Scheme. My colleagues will remember that Sir George was very closely concerned in the negotiations with Commander Burney.IT would be a mistake to assume that the Treasury were satisfied with the finance of the Burney scheme.The draft agreements were drawn up in pursuance of a decision by the Cabinet (20th July, 1923) that an agreement should be negotiated with Commander Burney and his associates for the formation of a Commercial Airship Service which should operate between this country and India. The general outline of the scheme had been laid down by a Committee of Imperial Defence Sub-Committee, with the proviso that the financial liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government was to be reduced during the negotiations, if possible. Commander Burney was at that time the only person in the field with any pretence of financial backing, and it was quite evident that no responsible financier in the city was prepared either to risk his own money, or still less to invite the public to subscribe money, for an undertaking so hazardous commercially. Although individual flights of long duration had been made by various large British and German airships, there were no data to justify the hope that a fleet of airships could be run over the long distances proposed with the safety and regularity which would be necessary to secure commercial success, or that even if safety and regularity were attained, a revenue sufficient to cover expenditure would be earned.On the other hand, there were certain definite advantages to the State which would be secured if a permanent service could be inaugurated, which no doubt weighed with the Cabinet in authorising the scheme. On the civil side, the estab-lishment of a new industry and quicker communication with the Dominions and India for passengers and mails; on the military side, the outstanding advantage was the use of airships in scouting over large ocean spaces.The Treasury, in negotiating with Commander Burney, endeavoured to secure three main points. Firstly, an investment by Commander Burney and his associates of a substantial sum, which was fixed at not less than million of their own money. Secondly, the division of the scheme into three stages and the limitation of the Exchequers advance in each stage, a test of performance by the Airships being required at the end of each stage before the next could be entered upon. Thirdly, the repayment out of profits of the Exchequer advances which were to be made on non-interest-bearing debentures. These requirements were all more or less met in the draft agreement, but the private money,  ^ million, was only to be subscribed by Commander Burney and his friends in stages pari passu with the Government advances totalling  2,800,000.   A feature of his finance was the formation of twoW. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1 February 17, 1925.Airship Development.[12706]
Companies : (1) an Airship Guarantee and Finance Company, and (2) an Airship Operating Company.The upshot of the scheme was unquestionably that Commander Burney would have had a very fine speculation, mainly at the Governments expense. If the scheme failed he would lose at the worst only the comparatively small amount put in by him and his friends in the early stages, against which losses might perhaps be set various profits which they might have made by the way. If it succeeded he might have earned enormous dividends on the relatively small private capital invested. One-half of the profits of the Company, after provision of a lirnited sum for reserves, was set apart for repayment of the Government advance, this arrangement being a very great improvement on that originally suggested.The weakness of the Government position was that they were trying for national reasons to push on a commercial scheme in advance of any conviction in any part of the investing public that the scheme could succeed, and the reasons for the absence of such conviction were the novelty of the enterprise and the absence of data, especially as to the safety and regularity of the service. There is, therefore, much to be said for the Government proceeding further with a demonstration by actual performance of one or more airships that a safe and regular service can be set up. The investing public and, in particular, the big liner steamship companies, will watch this experiment with interest, and if it succeeds it may be hoped that progress will be fostered, and the number of commercial airships be greater than if the whole business had been entrusted to a monopolist company supported by public funds in the first instance.G.
