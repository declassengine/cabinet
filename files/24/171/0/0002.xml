THIS DOCUMENT 13 THai PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S&quot; GOVERNMENT.CABIN3 T.SECRET.CP.2.(25) .Export of Arms to Russia.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.With reference to the Cabinet decision of the 12th November, /&quot;&quot;Cabinet 59(24) Conclusion 1 7 that it would be inconsistent with the attitude towards Russia taken up by members of the present Government during the recent Election to sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with arms and ammunition of British manufacture, I have taken steps to ensui e that licences will not be issued in the future for the export of further war material to that destination.I am not sure how far the above decision, which was taken in connection with a proposal to supply arms and ammunition to the Soviet Government to the value of  7,500,000 was intended to apply to the export of arms already licensed, in regard to which special considerations arise which I think deserve attention.   I append a Schedule giving particulars of (1) licences which have expired and which in ordinary circumstances would have been renewed, and (2) a licence which is still valid.    It will&apos;be observed that the outstanding cases relate to goods valued altogether at less than  50,000 and include - 3 machine guns, 200 Lewis guns and a quantity of spare parts.Export Licences are normally issued for a period of three months and are moreover subject to cancellation before that period expires.    It is however,  altogether exceptional for a licence to be withdrawn, or for the renewal of a licence already issued to be refused.   Having secured the licences tha firms concerned pro-ceeded with the orders presuming that should the delivery of the goods exceed the period specified on the licence, the licence would be renewed, and in fact the licence now valid has already been once renewed (in October last) for a further period of three months.-1-
1st January, 1925,All the material concerned is In an advanced state of preparation:    some of It Is ready for shipment, and If it is not allowed to be exported to the Soviet Government, Messrs. vickers and B.S.A. Guns Limited, will be faced with a serious loss since It will be Impossible, I understand, for them to dispose of the material elsewhere.I feel considerable difficulty in refusing to permit a transaction expressly authorised by the late Government, where a firm has incurred financial committments relying on that authority - I think in the.se circumstances the firm might well contend that if the Government for reasons of high policy decide to prohibit a transaction authorised by a previous Government/ the firm should be compensated for any&quot;loss It sustains.   A possible way out of the difficulty might be for the War Office or the Air Ministry to \take over the material If it is of standard type.It is important that the two firms concerned should know where they 3tand*    I shall therefore be glad of an early decision as to whether the licences are to be renewed, and. If not, whether His Majesty1s Government is to purchase the material or to offer any compensation.P. C-L.
