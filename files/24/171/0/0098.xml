[This^ Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;)Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1925. SECRET. &apos;: : ,c.i\ 97 &quot;.,!:&apos;&apos;.&quot;!!;,      &quot;...    *% h&apos; MEMORANDUM BY&quot; SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.: . &quot;&apos;Geneva Opium Conference.As the papers circulated from time to time during the past three- months ;inay,&apos;.not have enabled my colleagues to follow clearly the course of events at Geneva, I have, thought it desirable to circulate for information a brief Memorandum explaining the decision reached on the proposal made by the American Delegation that the production of opium should be limited to the amount required for strictly medical and scientific purposes.In my Memorandum of the 2nd December 192-1 (CP. 520 (24-)) I explained how important; this proposal was to India, as the American redraft of Article 1 condemned by implication the practice of opium eating in India, a matter which has always been regarded as one of domestic and not of international concern. I also explained that the Indian Delegation had, with my approval, raised the question of the competence of the Conference to deal with this matter and that by a large majority the Conference had overruled this objection. The American redraft of Article 1 was their remitted, to a sub-Committee for examination and lengthy discussions have taken place since December last. It soon became apparent that no State except America could - accept the draft Article unconditionally or without reservations unless it was clearly laid down that it applied only to the export trade ; and although various proposals, which I need not detail, were put forward, an agreement was found to be impossible and the-sub-Committee rejoorted accordingly.The draft Convention therefore placed, before the Conference did not contain the American Article I, and as the American Delegation (for reasons unconnected with this question) had left the Conference, it was anticipated that there would be little difficulty in safeguarding the Indian position. Several proposals were before the Conference one that the American Article should be adopted intact; another : that the Article should be accepted in principle, the possibility of reservations by individual States being mentioned; another, made by India, that the words &quot; for export &quot; should be inserted; and a fourth, made by the French, that the original Article 1 of the Hague Convention should be retained. The Indian proposal was withdrawn in favour of the French proposal, which would have been entirely acceptable to the Government of India, and I am informed that had the French proposal been put to the vote it was not unlikely that it would have been carried.. As, however, some delegations, possibly in the hope of placating American opinion, were anxious that the new Convention should contain an affirmation of the principle to which the Americans attach such importance, and as, at the same time, there was no wish to interfere in the domestic concerns of any country, an attempt was made to reconcile these somewhat inconsistent points of view by adding a proviso which would allow any State to contract out of the Article. On this proposal vny instructions had been asked for before the debate took place, and I had authorised the Indian Delegation in the last resort to accept the Article&apos; if the following words were added : &quot;Further, any contracting party may declare, at the time of its signature of or accession to the present Convention, the limitations subject to which it accepts this Article as regards the production and distribution of raw opium for consumption in its territories. If such a declaration be made the other contracting parties agree that this Article shall only apply in the &apos; case pi the contracting party making the declaration, subject to the limitations contained in that declaration.&quot;This authority was given on the distinct understanding that it was quite impossible to induce the Conference to drop the Article altogether or to secure an amendment of the Article as desired by the Government of India.I have now received a report from Geneva that the Conference has adopted the Article with this addition, except that the words &quot;for consumption in its territories &quot; have, in deference to Turkey, been omitted. 161      100   2.25
Although I was unable to consixlt the Government of India before instructing the Indian Delegation I do not suppose that they will hesitate to accept the Article as it now stands, seeing that it completely safeguards the Indian position. It will UOw be possible for India, when acceding to the Convention, to declare that the principle stated in the Article cannot be accepted in so far as opium eating is concerned, and, still more important, other contracting parties will be precluded from challenging such a declaration. It would thus appear that the position of India will actually be strengthened, as opium eating in India can no longer be the subject of international criticism. In effect,.the adoption of the Article in its present form is the acceptance of the reservation made by the Indian representative to the resolution adopted by the Opium Advisory Committee in June 1923 (printed as an appendix to my Memorandum of 2nd December) that the use of raw opium according to the established practice in India and its production for such use are not illegitimate under the Convention.The omission, however, of the words &quot; for consumption in its territories,&quot; though in no Avay weakening the Indian position, seems from the broader point of view to be-a retrograde step. 1 understand, however, that an attempt will be made to insert words which will prevent a State from contracting out of obligations already assumed under the Hague Convention.Although the Indian position would appear to be completely safeguarded, I still, think that the wiser-&quot;course would have been to drop the American Article altogether, or to limit its application to the export trade, since an international agreement which solemnly affirms a principle, and at the same time binds the contracting parties to accept the declaration of any State that the principle cannot be applied, seems peculiarly open to criticism. I cannot bring myself to believe that the affirmation of the principle in this emasculated form will placate American opinion.BIRKEN HEAD.Since the above was written I have received a report from Geneva that the Conference has reversed its decision,.and has accepted the proposal of the French delegation that a text,&apos;differing little from Articled of the Hague Convention, should be inserted in the Convention.   This result I regard as highly sat is factor v.B.18th February 1925.
