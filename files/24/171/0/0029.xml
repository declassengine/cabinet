THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER IT 07 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT] C R E T.. 29 (25)CABINET. *COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS.    . WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY AND SIGNALLING BILL. (Memorandum by the Postmaster   General)The object of the present Bill is to make permanent and to amend the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904.      The Act of 1904 was regarded as of an experimental character and was limited in duration.      It has been extended from time1Sto time by Expiring Laws Continuance Acts, and^ unlessfurther extended,  comes to an end on the 31st December1 iinext.      It has been felt for a long time that the Actshould be amended in certain particulars and made permanent,and a Bill on the general lines of thepresent Bill passed the Committeo stage In the House of Commons in 1922, but was then dropped owing to the dissolution.      A similar Bill &apos;was about to be introduced by the late Government at thetime of dissolution.The Act of 1904 was necessary because the PostmasterGeneral&apos;8 powers of control under his ordinary telegraphmonopoly do not extend to wireless stations intended for communication outside this country,  or to wireless stationsintended for communication of a purely private character(e.g. between the different branches of the same firm).Such powers of control were necessary, first from a strategic point of view, and secondly because,  in theabsence of control,  chaos would inevitably have resultedowing
owing to the interference of one station with another.   All civilised nations have found it necessary to exeroise such control, and in some countries the control is much more stringent than here.The principal amendments of the original Act included in the present Bill are as follows:-Clause 2 gives the Postmaster General control over the use of wireless apparatus in. ships and aircraft.      The provision as to aircraft is new and has been approved by the Air Ministry.      The provision as to ships is more restricted than in the principal Act,  since ships registered in the Dominions and Colonies are now exempted from the Postmaster General&apos;s control,  except when within the territorial waters of this country.      This modification is made at the request of the Colonial Office.Clause 3 empowers the Postmaster General to make regulations on specified points of detail.Clause 4 (1) makes a licence necessary for the maintenance of a wireless station as distinct from its installation or use.      Proof of illicit use would be very difficult to obtain,  especially in the case,of receiving stations.Clause 5 removes doubts which have been suggested in regard to(a) the Postmaster General&apos;s power to charge a reasonable fee to cover expenses in connexion with the grant ef licences to experiment;(b) the necessity for a licence to receive wireless signals as distinct from transmitting them.The Postmaster General has been proceeding in the past on the assumption that he has these powers under theoriginal
original Act, and he is advised that he has proceeded correctly, hut there is .a certain element of doubt in each case which it is desirable to remove.      This is particularly important as regards the necessity of a licence for a receiving station, as wide publicity has been given to the doubt and the broadcasting scheme as a whole depends upon&apos; the Postmaster General&apos;s powers in this respect.With regard to thelatter point, it will be noted that while paragraph (b)  of Clause 5 is retrospective,  it contains a proviso that nothing in the paragraph shall render any p-ersqn-liable, in respect of any act - or omission prior to the 12th December,  1924, to any penalty to which ho would not but for this paragraph have been liable.      A definite declaration on the subject was made in the House of Commons on the date mentioned, and it is not considered desirable to take any legal action in respect of the use of wireless apparatus without a licence before that date.Clause 6 imposes penalties for the sending of false or misleading signals of distress;    for the improper divulging of wireless messages overheard by persons for whom they are not intended;    and for the transmission of indecent or offensive messages or messages &quot;subversive of public order&quot;.Clause 7 gives the Postmaster General (in Scotland, the Lord Advocate) power to accept compromise fines in oases of minor default as an alternative to prosecution.      This jjrovision has been made at the suggestion of the Broadcasting Committee of 1925  (see paragraph 51, Command Paper 1951 of 1923) in order to facilitate the treatment of oases of evasion of licences in connection with the broadcasting scheme.Clause 8
ip.se 8pise 9Base 10Clause 8 makes the Postmaster General&apos;s licence necessary for visual or sound signalling stations established for communication with ships at sea.      Stations in ships or aircraft, Lloyd&apos;s signal stations and stations under the control of the Board of Trade or a Lighthouse Authority are exempted.      This clause is inserted at the request of the Admiralty and with the concurrence of the Air Ministry and the Board of Trade.      Its object is to prevent the establishment of illicit signalling stations which might be used for the purpose of communication with the enemy in case of war.Clause 9 extends the provisions of the principal Act to the installation and working of apparatus for the wireless transmission of energy as distinct from messages. This is necessary because the same interference results whatever may be the purpose for which the etheric waves are used.      This amendment has been discussed with representatives of the Railway Companies and with the Electricity Commissioners, and has been agreed to by them.Clause 10 aims at simplifying the arrangements for more stringent control in case of national emergency.      The Postmaster General is given, power in such an event to make such rules as he ma,y consider necessary with regard to the possession and sale of apparatus, as well as its installation and use.      This provision is based on a recommendation of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Wireless Licences in 1919 on which the Admiralty, Air Ministry, War Office, Home      --Office and Posh Office were represented.W.
