-9 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC M\majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT).1.     Thv fail is and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, introduced certain measures for the Improvement of the milk supply!   but for the present purpose its main point is that it postponed until 1st September, 1925, the operation of the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915,  and of the corresponding Scottish Act, which would otherwise have commenced not later than one year after the end of the war.2.     The 1915 Act conferred on Local Authorities powers to step the supply of milk likely to cause tuberculosis;   made it obligatory to inspect cattle in dairies suspected of producing such milk:    and prohibited, under penalty, the sale of tuberculotxa   milk.   The effect of these provisions would, bo to put out of use for the production of milk, and indirectly to compel the slaughter of, any cow which is giving tuberculous milk or is suffering from certain specified diseases.    The Act itself provided no compensation to the owner of an animal so put out of usej   but it could not be enforced without compensa-tion, and it was accordingly proposed, When the time approached for putting It into operation, to revive the Tuberculosis order of 1914 (which does provide such compensation) as a necessary complement to the Act.   An undertaking to this effect was givon in Parliament on the 8th May, 1919.   The whole question however dropped for the time on the passage of the 1922 Act.3.     The question now arises what action is to be taken in view of the fact that, unless legislation is passed, the 1915 Act will automatically come into operation on the 1st September next.p. No. 13(25)*CABINET.Milk Legislation.Memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Minister of&apos;Agriculture&quot;and FisheriesT
4*       Our Departments have consulted together on this question, and ws are agreed that the best course is to allow the 1915 4ct to oome into operation.     Tills proposal in Itself involves no legislation:   but It does involve the revival of the Tuberculosis Order of 1914, a measure which from the point of vlev.&apos; of public health has of late been strongly urged upon the Ministry of Agriculture by the Association of Municipal Corporations, which may be regarded as representing most of the totais, as ??ell as by a large number of individual Local Authorities including twenty County Councils.5.     That Order (made under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894) required the slaughter of tuberculous cows, and provided compensation to the extent of ttiree-fourths of the market value of an animal if certified to be suffering from tuberculosis (not advanced), and ona-fourth if from advanced tuberculosis. Payment of this compensation Is primarily an obligation of the Local Authorities, but under pressure from them the Treasury agreed in 1914 to refund to them from the Exchequer three-fourths of the gross conipensation paid by them for animals slaughtered. The Order -was, however, only issued on the 25rd June, 1914, to corao into force on the 1st July, 1914j    and it ^aa suspended on the outbreak of uar, as the services of the Veterinary Surgeons and the Police re-iuirsd to \io?k the order then ceased to be available.6.     If, (as the Ministry of Agriculture eoiisiders essential) the refund of three-fourths is retained, the annual cost to the Excuequer of reviving the Order is estimated at approximately  50,000 per annumj   and to Local Authorities at a.17,500 par annum plus administrative costs but minus tha receipts from the carcases.     The Ministry of AgriculUire has recently approached the Treasury on this question, but has
received the reply that they are not prepared to authorise a charge on the isxohequer for compensation without legislation.7.      In these circumstances we propose (a) that the Act of 1915 shall be allowed to come Into operation,  (b) that the Ministry of Agriculture in consultation *fith the Treasury shall prepare and Introduce the Bill stated to be necessary for the revival of tha 1914 Order with an Exchequer contribution. &amp;uoh a Bill would presumably be non-contentious.8.     A copy of this memorandum lias been submitted to the Treasury who have no objection to its circulation to the Cabinet.H.
