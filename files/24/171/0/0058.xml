DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HIS BRITANIO MAJESTY15 GOVERNMENT).copy no.   9C R ST. r&quot;&apos;- CABINET.58(25J..INTER&quot;ALLIED DEBTS. REVISED DRAFT REPLY to M. c&amp;EMENTBL.His Majesty&apos;s Government adheres to the principle     ?;: of the Balfour note.     Much of the substance of this note was repeated in Lord Curzon&apos;s note of the 11th August, 1923, more particularly In paragraphs 2 and 8 to 11 of the enclosure.     But paragraphs 6 and 7 of the enclosure, which refer to Mr.Bonar Lawfs proposals of January 1923, are clearly no longer applicable to the existing facts of the situation. These paragraphs were written before the framing of the Dawes plan and on the assumptions that the total German liability would be fixed at a figure less than that adopted In the Dawes plan, particularly In the earlier years,  and that bonds of the kind contemplated In Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s plan,  with the rights of redemption given in that plan, would be issued.     These assumptions are not now tenable.     It follows that Lord Curzon^ statement cannot, therefore, in this respect be reaffirmed by His Majestyfs Government.The principle of the Balfour note is that Great Britain should receive from Europe payments equivalent to those she is under obligation to make to the United States of Amerioa,     His Majestyfs Government cannot accept a position in which this principle could only be achieved upon the basis of the full normal yield of the Dawes annuities or by taking at their face value debts whioh cannot be at present treated as good assets.
His majestyls Government have already consented not merely to reduce their claims against the Allies to an amount jiecessary to cover their own payments in respect of the British war debt to the United States Government,, hut actually .to apply the whole of the United Kingdom share of German reparations to that purpose..     This means that Great Britain not only takes to her own charge the whole of her own war damages hut also the value of the very large amount of foreign securities devoted to the general effort before the United States entered the war.In the application of the Balfour note to the existing situation among the Allied and Associated Powers and with regard to Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Government, remembering that war debts between Allies have been incurred in a common cause, have been prepared to consider proposals under which the existing French debt to Great Britain would, he reduced provided that the principle of a definite payment by Prance from her own national resources, fixed with due regard to her relative wealth and taxpaying capacity is assured without reference to reparations.They are of opinion therefore that the French payments should be divided into(a) a fixed annual amount to be paid by France irrespective of the ac tual receipts from the Dawes annuities in a particular year; and(b) a further fixed annual charge on the French share in the Dawes annuities.It would of course be understood, first that all counter claims by France against Great Britain would be superseded; and   sec oudly    that if and when the payments, derived by Great Britain from all European sources ware
sufficient to provide for the full discharge of the British obligations towards the United 3 ta t e s over the full period of such obligations, including the payments already made, any surplus would be used diminish the burden resting upon BritiJln&apos;s Allies,,They would be glad to receive proposals from the french Government for settling the question on these lines0
