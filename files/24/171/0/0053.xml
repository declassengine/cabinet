document is the property of His Britannic Ma je sty&apos; s Government.)0 A B I NET.53 (25).NORTHERN IRELAND. UNEMPLOYMENT I HSU RAH CE FUND; SUGGESTED ASSISTANCE FROM GREAT BRITAIN.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I agree with the statement in the Memorandum (CP.  37 (25) of the Minister of Labour that the case against granting financial assistance to the Northern Ireland Unemployment Fund is &quot;formidable&quot;.    In my view the case is conclusive - for the reason that any form of subsidy is incompatible with the scheme of self-government for Northern Ireland.The scheme of the Government of Ireland Act Is that (within the limits of the Act) Northern Ireland shall control its own policy and rely on Its own resources.    Delegation of -power is accompanied by corresponding delegation of financial responsibility.    For the transferred services provision is to be   made by the Parliament of Northern Ireland &quot;and any grant or contribution out of revenues provided by the Parliament of the United Kingdom so far as made for those  services shall ceaae.&quot;    (Section 21 (2)).    An arrangement by which the Government of Northern Ireland should control a service,  but any deficit in the provision for such service should be made good by Great Britain, would be contrary to the scheme of the Act and irreconcilable with any workable system of Home Rule..The Memorandum of the Minister of Labour shows clearly that any plan for pooling the liabilities of the two Unemployment Funds while retaining separate control would be &quot;thoroughly vicious&quot;.    But the same consideration applies-
to any system of Exchequer grants.    Unemployment expenditure is largely affected by methods of adminlstra-tion.    Over administration in Northern Ireland the Imperial Government would have no control.    How in such circumstances could Imperial subsidies be justified to the House of Commons?   And what incentive to methods of vigilance and economy in administration would Northern Ireland have,  if they could draw on the resources of Great Britain to balance their Unemployment Fund?And Unemployment Insurance is only one of many services to which the same &quot;thoroughly vicious&quot; system will be applicable if the contention of Northern Ireland is accepted in this case.    The present request of Northern Ireland is not for an exceptional grant,  given as an act of grace:,  to meet some special emergency.    It is a claim for continuous assistance and is based on a principle which is applicable to others of the transferred services.    The present application,  therefore,  stands on a very different footing from the    applications for grants in aid of the Special Constabulary or for the earlier grants in aid of Unemployment.The principle on which the Government of Northern Ireland bases the present claim is that social services in Northern Ireland must be maintained on the same level as in Great Britain and that if the proceeds of taxes or contributions levied in Northern Ireland at the same rate as in Great Britain do not suffice for this purpose,  the difference ought to be mad 3 up from the resources of Great Britain,If this principle is admitted as regards Unemployment the same claim will be made in the future whenever new developments of social legislation occur,  and the cost of keeping pace
with Great Britain strains the resources of Northern Ireland.      In every such oase    the same representations will fce made that the inhabitants of Northern Ireland ought to fce in no worse position than the inhabitants of England and if these representations are accepted the Northern Government will become  increasingly dependent on the Exchequer of Great Britain for financing services over which the Imperial Parliament and the Ministers responsible to that Parliament exercise no control.Tho Minister of Labour suggests that the Northern Ireland Government have a strong case &quot;on grounds of political equity&quot;  - the case &quot;being that because the Six Counties accepted self-government reluctantly,  they ought to be relieved of the consequences of self-government in so far as those consequences may fce to their disadvantage. Such a line of argument must lead to impracticable conclusions.      whatever theoretic considerations can bo advanced in support of the view that Belfast should be in th the same position as Sheffield in respect of its social services,  the fact remains that Sheffield and Belfast are, in respect of social services under separate Governments having separate resources.      Tho consequences of that fact cannot fce evaded;    and any attempt to evade.them must load to a position which is logically indefensible o,nd fraught with practical difficulties..VI.J.E.February,   1925.
