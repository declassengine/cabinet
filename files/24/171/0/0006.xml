I 11 25teis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERFMENT.).gCKET... &apos; Jy0 A- B I N E- T&quot;. /[.-p. 6  (25).MERCHANT SHIPPING (INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS) BILL.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.This is a&apos;Bill, whioh was mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech,for making the necessary amendments in our law, to give effectto oertain International Conventions for the benefit ofMerchant seamen.The Conventions in question are three in number, and were adopted by the International Labour Organisation of the Leagueof Nations in 1920 and 1921.    They are:-(l) Convention, adopted in 1920, providing that a- seaman&apos;e-wages shall run on for a-maximum period of two . months from the date of the loss of his ship.Under the present law, a seaman&apos;s right to wages terminates when his ship is lost, and this causes a oertain amount of hardship.    The idea underlying the Convention is that the man should continue to receive wages until he has time to be able to get home to look for employment again.(2) Convention fixing minimum age for trimmers and stokers employed on shipboard: this was adopted in 1921, and-fixes the minimum age at 18.(5) Convention, adopted in 1921, providing for the medical examination of boys under 18 before they can serve on board ship, and thereafter once a-year till they reach the age of 18.The three Conventions were signed by (among others) all thei British representatives at the respective Conferences, i.e.,the representatives of the Government, the employers and the seamen, but they have not been ratified by His Majesty&apos;s-Government pending legislation necessary to give effect to them under the late Government the Bill passed all stages inthe Lords, and Seoond Reading and Committee in the Commons, but was awaiting Report at the time of the dissolution.-  An amendment was made in the Lords in Clause 5- toexoept from the provisions of the B-ill tugs, dredgers, barges and similar craft which only go to sea occasionally.    It-1-
appears to the Board of Trade, who have given careful consideration to the question, that the effect of this exoeption is wider than was intended by the mover of the amendment, and that the exception may make it difficult for His Majesty&apos;a Government to ratify the Conventions without some reservationi the Ministry of Labour share this view.   It is aooordingly proposed to omit this amendment when the Bill is again introduced, A further amendment was made in Committee of the House of Commons by whioh Clause 1 of the Bill is not to apply to fishermen remunerated only by share in the profits or gross earnings of the working of the boat.   As the olause can only apply to seamen remunerated by wages which aoorue from time to time, this amendment does not really affect the scope of the Bill, and it is accordingly proposed to retain it,    A copy of the Bill, In the form in nvhich it is proposed to re-introduoe it, is attached.I suggest   that with a-view to relieving pressure of business in the House of Commons, the Bill might be introduced in the Lords soon after the Christmas Reoessj and it might aooordingly be referred, in the first place, to the Home Affairs Committee as soon as possible.(Intld.)P*C*-L.1/1/35.Board of Trade
