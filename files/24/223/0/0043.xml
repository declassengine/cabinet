HIS. ,BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT,o^the. copy no. gECONOMY BILL.Scope of powers to be sought by Order in Council under the Bill to facilitate the savings in expenditure required from the Road Fund,.MjBmoran; um &quot;by the Jtflnxster of Trap3por t. In order to effect the required savings in Road expenditure it may become necessary for works to be stopped where contracts for their execution have been entered into but the work has not commenced, and also to stop works already commenced where this can be effected without unduly impairing the value of the expenditure already incurred.      It will further be necessary to slow up the acquisition of land in connection with the proposed improvements.I have carefully considered whether any powers should be taken by Order in Council to enable Local Authorities to break contracts and to vary the law with regard to compensation payable for breach of contract in such cases, and I have come to the conclusion that such powers are not necessary except with regard to Notices to Treat for the compulsory acquisition of land.The standard form of contract reoommended by the Ministry of Transport since 1929 for adoption by Highway Authorities contains a &quot;Break Clause&quot; which enables the Highway Authority to terminate a works contract on one month&apos;s notice, without compensation for loss of profits on the portion of the works discontinued.     This form of contract has been widely adopted although there may be cases where.the Highway Authority have not thought it desirable to Insert such a provision. I do not, however,  think it necessary to take powers to override contracts of this kind.     The White paper has already indicated that assistance will be given from the Road Fund at the rate
agreed for the scheme towards any expenditure or liability actually incurred hy the local authorities and they can well &quot;be left to deal with particular cases on these lines.Where binding contracts for acquisition of land have been made, I think they must be left to stand..\7here Notices to Treat for the compulsory acquisition of land have been served, bub no entry has been made upon the land, and where the amount of compensation to be paid to the landowner and other parties concerned has not been finally assessed, I propose to empower the Highway &quot;luthority to withdraw them c-ii payment of compensation, limited to expenses reasonably incurred by the person on whom the Notice has been served, but excluding compensation in respect of any loss of profits which might have accrued if the owner had been free to accept a more advantageous offer for his property.The Local Authorities have asked that I should take this power, and I think it reasonable to do so since once a Notice to Treat is served, the person on whom it is served can enforce specific performance of the contract to purchase. In present circumstances, neither the Local Authority nor the Road Fund ought to be committed to expenditure consequent on an easily revocable preliminary of this kind.I have considered whether it would not be sufficient in these cases merely to authorise Highway Authorities to withdraw these Notices to Treat, but I am advised that this would not meet the case because it would deprive the person on whom the notice was served of any claim for reimbursement of expenses which he had incurred as a result of being served with the notice.I am taking the opportunity of the debate on the Economy Bill to indicate to Parliament the lines on which it is intended to proceed and subject to what may then arise propose to have the Order in Council drafted accordingly.(INTD.)     P.JSP.28th September, 1931.
