is Document is the. property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government Roneographed for the Cabinet.     September, 1931,CABINET.iCRET.Copy No. 8 P.254 (31).REDUCTIONS IN SERVICE-PAY AND PENSION^. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.The First Lord in his memorandum No.C,P,252(3l)raisestwo questions on which I regret to find myself in disagreement withthe     recommendations of the Admiralty as I understand them.   Thefirst concerns the interpretation of the Cabinet&apos;s recent decision that the transference of personnel at present drawing 1919 rates of pay to 1925 rates shall not involve a reduction of more than 10$.   The*^        * _.....second is whether the decision of His Majesty1s Government on thepensions of the fighting services promulgated in the White Paperformulating the &quot;Measures proposed for securing reductions in national Expenditure&quot; (Cmd. 3952 page 3 para, (iv)) is, or is not *to stand - a question which, so far as I am aware, has not yetbeen before the Cabinet at all,1*   The interpretation of the 10 per cent, decision.The Air Ministry have throughout assumed this to be a measure taken to relieve hardship, on which ground indeed it can in my judgment alone be justified.    My views on this point will be ^lear rToWfhe&quot; remarks below read In conjunction with the extracts annexed as an appendix to this memorandum from a letter which I wrote to the First Lord on the subject immediately I heard of the interpretation which the Admiralty put on the Cabinet&apos;s decision... i ..........-aau-.... .-......, &quot;i,---^.\Naturally, from one point of view, I should be only too glad to procure the most favourable terms possible for Air Force personnel. But at this time of extreme national emergency I feel bound to ask myself whether the concession proposed (1) is necessary to relieve hardship (2) is fair to the Exchequer (3) will be likely to produce repercussions in other quarters and (4) can be met from savings elsewhere on Air Votes.
As regards (1) I find it difficult to see how any question of &quot;hardship&quot; (by this I mean such a degree of hardship at the present juncture as requires special ameliorative action) or &quot;commitments&quot; can be said to arise if a man is guaranteed (which is what I propose and how I have read the Government1s intention) that he shall in no circumstances receive a lower rate of pay than //his current 1919 rate less 10 per cent.   It is important In this connection to bear in mind that pay is only one element in a sailorb, soldier!s or airman&apos;s emoluments and that the actual cut on his total remuneration (whether received in cash or kind - and there are substantial cash elements in addition to &quot;substantive&quot; pay) will probably be between 5 per cent, and l\ per cent. - in the lower paid groups even less.     As to (2) and (3) It must be remembered that this cut of 10$ on pay only (say 5$ to 7^% on total remuneration) is on rates fixed In 1919 when the cost of living figure was 115 above pre-war.    The corresponding figure today is 450   There was no Air Force in 1914, so I am compelled to take my further illustrations from the Navy.   The average pay of typical lower grades of naval ratings was (according to the report of the Anderson Committee of 1923, para. 12) increased in 1919 by approximately 170$ above its pre-war level, though considerable increases had been made in the pay of most ratings over the 50 years preceding 1914 (ibidem, page 14).    It is from these 1919 rates (on an average, as above stated, 170$ higher than those prevailing in 1914 in the case of the lower grades) that the present small deduction, falls now to be made.     Further, according to the May Committee&apos;s report (page 38) the average total remuneration of naval ratings would, even if the decision to effect a complete transference to 1925 rates had stood unaltered, have remained at a figure nearly 116 per cent, above 1914 and some 15 per cent, above the corresponding figure for the Royal Air Force.
The &quot;manipulative&quot; grades in the Civil Service who are very roughly comparable to the lower ranks in the fighting services, have, as I recently pointed out to the Cabinet, since 1921 lost some 40 per cento of their total remuneration.   I frankly fear that further concessions (see also what is proposed in regard to pensions in II below) made to one category of Crown servants may produce grave reactions amongst these poorly paid civil servants, of whom some 180,000 are now receiving an average inclusive wage of only  2,10.0 per week - or less than 100 per cent,   above their admittedly inadequate pre-war remuneration.   My colleagues will no doubt have remarked the hints in this sense which have already been let fall by certain members of the House of Commons, one of whom has legitimately pointed out that Civil Servants in the London district have all the housing difficulties and hire-purchase commitments which I understand to weigh so heavily upon naval personnel - but have nevertheless already undergone incomparably heavier &quot;cuts&quot;,   I need not elaborate the complete disorganisation of the machinery of trade and Industry which would result from anything like direct action on the part of those employees (e.g. of the Post Office) who are particularly affected.As regards (4) It is fortunate that in the case of the Royal Air Force the sums involved by these concessions are materially lower than in the case of either the Navy or Army, but at present I frankly cannot see where even the smallest additional savings are to be found, and rises actual and pending in the prices of such commodities as petrol are already confronting us with problems to which I can see no solution. The increase In the petrol tax will cost Air Votes  40,000 per annumj   if there is (as forecasted) a rise of 2d In the price In addition, this will bo increased to  80,000,   It must, moreover, be borne In mind that the Royal Air Force is an expanding service. I have   in 1932   to provide for a full year&apos;s maintenance of 3 new squadrons formed this year.
311OilIf this pay concession is given to the Navy it will, of course, have to be applied equally to the Army and the Royal Air Force.   I must further make it plain that Its effects will necessarily be (l) to perpetuate the existing anomaly of men working side by side on the same jobs at different rates and (2) that personnel in all three services shall, on receiving an increment or promotion, be allowed to draw either 1919 rates less 10 per cent, or 1925 rates, whichever are the more favourable. This Is the only possible solution, since in the case of many of the key personnel of the Royal Air Force in the more technical trade groups (whose efficiency involves vital safety considerations) transference to 1925 rates involves a cut of less than 10 per cent., though in the lower and less-skilled groups there are numerous cases ?;here the reductions amount to anything between 10 and 31 per cent., and where the decision to confine them to 10 per cent, will be in consequence a very welcome relief.   I understand that transference to 1925 rates also entails a cut of less than 10 per cent, to the higher grades of Engine Room Artificers in the Royal Navy, who will thus be similarly situated.   In consequence a decision that on increment or promotion 1919 rates less 10 per cent, should be drawn without the option of 1925 rates in lieu would entail -(1)    That instead of His Majesty^ Government1? latestdecision representing a concession,    the important categories of personnel concerned in the Navy and the Royal Air Force would be worse off than under the original decision and further -(2)    That these categories would actually receive in future lower emoluments than those already on 1925 rates. It will be apparent that this would be an altogether impossible situation, and I asaume that it is the AoLmiraltyrs intention that the option of 1925 rates shall continue to be given throughout a manfs career until re-engagement.
II Pensions .(a)       It would appear that the view of the Admiralty is that the decision in the White Paper (Cmd. 3952) which I have already quoted should be cancelled at least as far as concerns men already re-engaged or re-engaging before October 1st or some other date in the early future to be determined and that the future as well as the past service of these men shall reckon for pension at 1919 rates.     I should not have thought that there could be any question of hardship, if the concession that service prior to October 1st  (or the date specified) shall count at the 1919 rates stands - as I think it most certainly should.     For in almost every case of a man retiring within the next 10 years, inasmuch as  (a) the average difference between old and new rates of pension Is 18 per cent. (May Committee&apos;s report, para. 170), and (b) more than half his service will reckon at the old rates, the reduction involved should be materially less than 10 per cent.     In the case of men retiring within (say) two years the reduction would not on the average be more than lj per cent.     As the cost of living has fallen 33 per cent, since the 1919 rates were fixed, I confess that I can see nothing intrinsically unfair in the decision taken by His Majesty*s Government and already duly promulgated. The Admiralty justly observe that it has hitherto been the practice to give a soldier, sailor or airman &quot;the benefit of the pension schemes offered to him when he first entered the Service&quot;.     I must point out that,  in the case of the senior man (whose position the Admiralty particularly stress), the scheme in force at the time of their entry was Infinitely less favour able than the     1919 scheme of which they now claim the benefit; It was indeed much less favourable than the 1930 scheme, under which (if the Government&apos;s present decision stands unaltered)
it is now proposed to reckon their fut ureter vice only. I suggest we must not argue from the latest decision on police pensions for these (1) are, unlike those of the fighting services, cased on pay (2) are contributory, a 5 per cent, deduction being made from pay in respect of them and (3) there is not already in existence a recognised lower 1930 pension rate, as in the case of the Navy, Army and Air Force.     Moreover, analogies can be adduced from outside the fighting services (whose pension schemes are sui generis) in the opposite sense - e.g. Civil Service pensions, which do vary with the cost of living; or teachers1 pensions which (I understand) are to be based on the salaries cut by 10 per cent, and will be reduced accordingly.    I share, therefore, what I understand to be the view of the War Office that the decision announced in the White Paper should stand unmodified except for the point dealt with in (b) below.(b)       As regards the three months&apos; &quot;period of grace&quot; suggested by the Admiralty, the Air Ministry understood that the concession that men re-engaging before October 1st should reckon their previous service at the old rates of pension was intended to meet the case of men who had intimated their Intention to re-engage, but whose re-engagement had not been approved owing to the time taken for their papers to reach home from distant stations overseas.     We had proposed accordingly to meet the difficulty by arranging that every man who had intimated his intention to re-engage before October 1st (and was otherwise acceptable) should be given the benefit of the concession, whatever the date of receipt of his papers and consequent final approval of his re-engagement.     This proposal seems to me to meet the case adequately, but, if the Admiralty set store by the concession, I do not want to put any difficulties in the way of Its adoption.     The same concession will, however, have to be made
Air Ministry,September 29th, 1931.to the Royal Air Force, and I fear that the result may he to encourage applications from men, who might not otherwise have done so, to re-engage and secure the benefit of the higher rate of pension.A.
APPENDIX.EXTRACTS FROM LETTER FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO-FIRST LORD DATED 24TH SEPTEMBER.&apos; * * * * * * *There are two points In particular on which I am some-what exercised, and I therefore think it best to write to you at once and place my views upon them before youe(1)   The first relates to personnel who, under this 10$ ruling, are not forthwith brought down to. the normal 1925 rate appropriate to their rank.       The question Is whether they shoult not, so soon as by means of (a) increments in their existing rank or (b) promotion to a higher rank they are brought on to a 1925 rate which is in excess of their present 1919 rate less 10$g forthwith receive that 1925 rate unaltered. I understand your advisers are disposed to think that, instead, they should continue to receive 1919 rates - increased by increments or promotions - less 10$, and that In the case of the lower deok ratings this process should continue until re-engagement.   I must confess that I myself find it exceedingly difficult to justify any such thesis.   There is surely no suggestion that the 1925 rates are inadequate (particularly since the cost of living has fallen over the last six years from 173 to 145), and that new rates should be Introduced in lieu of them.   The essence of the Government^ decision, as I understand it, is to mitigate the hardship to classes of individuals who have entered Into commitments in the expectation that they would continue to draw the 1919 rates by providing that, In no case5 shall any man be asked to undergo a reduction greater than 10$.   But for this, the deolsion as to transference from 1919 to 1925 rates stands unaltered.* * * * * * * *The Right Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P., etc.,THE ADMIRALTY,S.W.JL,
If, on receiving an increment or on being promoted in the future, a sailor, soldier or airman will on the 1925 rates get more than he will now (on October 1st) be getting on the 1919 rates less 10% - will, In other words, be better off than he will be from October l3t onwards under the modified cut - can it be argued that there is any special hardship involved because of commitments he has entered into before getting such Increments or promotions?******Lastly, on the broad equities of the position, I must again emphasise that, in my view (leaving out of account the &quot;vested rights&quot; issue, since as to this the principle remains the same whatever the size of the cut) the fighting services would have received not unfavourable treatment, even if the original decision to transfer all ranks forthwith from 1919 to 1925 rates had been maintained   unaltered   -   though I have all along realised that this would entail a certain degree of hardship, which I should naturally have been glad to see alleviated so far as reasonably practicable, but not by the present 1force majeure* decision to confine cuts to 10% of pay only.* * * * * *
