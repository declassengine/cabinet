[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1931.SECRET.Copy No.3CP. 259 (31).CABINET.THE LIMITATION OF SEABORNE AIR FORCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. THE prospects of the forthcoming Disarmament Conference producing concrete results do not at present appear very promising, owing alike to the complexity of the issues involved and the divergent interests of the principal participants.In these circumstances, as there is no longer a special Sub-Committee dealing with Disarmament Policy, I think the Cabinet may wish to have their attention drawn to one direction in which it appears to me that there is a primd facie possibility of effecting an important measure of disarmament a measure which should, moreover, mean prospective savings to the Exchequer of some millions of capital and recurrent expenditure.I refer to a suggestion put forward this summer that negotiations should be opened with the U.S.A. at a very early date for the limitation of ship-borne aircraft on a parity basis.2. In June last the Chancellor of the Exchequer made to the then Foreign Secretary (in his capacity as Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Disarmament Policy) a proposal for the total abolition of ship-borne aircraft. The Naval, General and Air Staffs were all agreed that this proposal was open to insuperable objections, but at the same time the Chief of the Air Staff prepared a reasoned memorandum advocating that, the abolition of this category of aircraft being ruled out, their drastic limitation should be separately considered. It has been suggested to me that this memorandum should be laid before the Cabinet and I circulate it herewith accordingly.3. I need only add the following brief comments to the Chief of the Air Staffs memorandum : (a) If we do not achieve the limitation of ship-borne aircraft, the Exchequerwill, on the present programmes of the principal Naval Powers, be faced before long with an additional expenditure running into millions in respect of the construction of carriers, the alteration of capital ships and the provision of aircraft.(b) Aerial disarmament is, in my view, more likely to be achieved in thissphere than in any other, since the aircraft carrying capacity of Fleets is relatively easy of limitation.(c) Subject to further exper ^examination, the British Empire would appearto have much to gain from such limitation.(d) The present appears to be a not unfavourable moment for taking theinitiative. I note, for example, that the President of the U.S.A. is reported to be insisting on the curtailment of American naval expenditure.(e) Whilst I do not suggest that there are not many difficulties, political andtechnical, to be surmounted, negotiations would at least be free from some of the complications which unfortunately beset the wider problems of disarmament. For example, inasmuch as the ship-borne aircraft of France and Italy are at present negligible quantities, the[6007]
U.S.A. and ourselves are the countries primarily affected and bi-lateral are undoubtedly far simpler than multi-lateral discussions. It would, of course, be for consideration at what stage Japan should be brought into the picture.4. The matter is one which, whilst it interacts closely on aerial disarmament as a whole and in particular upon the problem of the air defence of this country, is primarily the concern of the Navy; and until the Naval Staff have considered and commented on the proposal, it is hardly ripe for fuller examination by the Cabinet. It is, however, one of such far-reaching importance alike from the aspects of disarmament and economy, and the need for early action is so vital, if we are going to move in the matter at all, that the Cabinet may wish to consider remitting it in the first instance to a small Committee for urgent examination.(Initialled) A.Air Ministry, Gwydyr House, S.W.I., October 6, 1931.Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff.Projected Increases in Seaborne Air Forces of Foreign Naval Powers.1. THE Air Staff have had under consideration for some time the formidable expansion of seaborne air forces which is contemplated by the United States of America.The present first line strengths of the seaborne air forces of the principal Naval Powers are as follows : Great Britain : 153.U.S.A. : 314 (excluding 84 temporarily based ashore). Japan : 107.The first line strengths projected by 1937 are :   Great Britain - 219U.SA. : 400 (estimate in 1929-Paper No. F.S. (29) 9).782 (estimate of June 1931-Paper No. F.S. (29) 44). Japan: 185 (inclusive of 1931-32 programme only; later programmes not known).Note. The figures in respect of U.S.A. and Japan are those put forward to the Fighting Services Committee of the Cabinet by the Admiralty in F.S. (29) 9 and F.S. (29) 44.Increases possible under existing Treaty Limitations.2. The limitations imposed by the London Naval Treaty as to numbers and categories of ships would in no way preclude expansion of seaborne air forces up to and even beyond the figures quoted above. Increases in seaborne aircraft may be effected by (i) the building of additional carriers.(ii) technical development of carriers, and of the methods of operating aircraft from them, by which a larger number of aircraft can be carried for the tonnage allowed, (iii) the construction of aircraft platforms in certain vessels to which the limitations fixed for carrier tonnage do not apply.3. As regards (i) : the total carrier tonnage allowed to U.S.A. and Great Britain by Treaty (Washington Treaty, Article VII) is 135,000 tons.
Of this tonnage, there is constructed or under construction, inclusive of carriers classed as experimental vessels -Thus under Treaty limitations new carrier tonnage may be.constructed in excess of present tonnage :  4. As regards (ii) : technical advances in design already in progress will make it possible for a much larger number of aircraft to be carried within a given total carrier tonnage. For example, the existing US.A. aircraft carrier &quot;Lexington,&quot; with a tonnage of 33,000 tons, has an aircraft capacity of 70, whereas the new carrier &quot;Ranger,&quot; to be completed in 1934, will have, for a tonnage of 13,800 tons, a capacity of 76 aircraft. On this basis, the aircraft carried within the carrier tonnage limitations imposed by &quot;the Washington and reaffirmed by the London Treaty could be more than doubled.5. As regards (iii) : the London Naval Treaty allows of the fitting of aircraft platforms to all future capital ships, to future cruisers up to a quarter of the total cruiser tonnage and to all destroyers. These platforms make it possible for ships not categorised as carriers, and not therefore limited under the total carrier tonnage limitation, to operate aircraft in large numbers. A capital ship so fitted might operate 24-36 aircraft, and a cruiser 18-24 aircraft. An extract from the relevant clauses of the London Naval Treaty is attached (see Appendix 1).6. The Air Staff do not wish to present an alarmist view, and they realise that many years must in any event elapse before the U.S.A. Fleet could contain a substantial proportion of warships fitted with aircraft platforms.When all allowances are made these facts, however, remain : (i) that the programme of development projected by the U.S. Naval Authorities represents a formidable expansion over present strength. If, for example, the first line strength of the sea-borne air forces of the U.S.A. was to be raised to 500 aircraft (i.e., to only two-thirds of the estimate of 762 which has been put forward by the Admiralty), the maintenance of parity in naval air forces would entail our own Fleet Air Arm being increased, not by 50 per cent, over its present strength (the figure mentioned by Mr. Snowden in his letter to Mr. Henderson proposing the abolition of sea-borne aircraft), but by more than 200 per cent.(ii) that further increases over any at present envisaged are possible within the ambit of the London Treaty and without any exclusive concen-tration upon &quot;air&quot; as against other naval requirements. The construction of one ship fitted with an aircraft platform is already projected by the Navy Department. Recent public and official statements by Mr. Ingalls (Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy for Aeronautics) and by Rear-Admiral Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, made it only too clear that there are powerful influences working for a large expansion in the seaborne air forces of the United States. Extracts from these statements are attached as Appendix 2, which also contains some extracts from an unofficial article in the periodical &quot;United States Air Services&quot; by the President of the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America. The significance of this article lies in its contention that the period before the London Treaty is due for reconsideration, in 1935, should be used by the United States to build up to the maximum limits permissible under the Treaty, with the object of forestalling proposals for reduction.U.S.A.

The bearing of the sea-borne air strength of U.S.A. upon the Air Defence ofGreat Britain.7. The Air Staff have elsewhere drawn attention (see D.C. (P) 36, para-graphs 7 and 8) to the bearing of the programme of expansion for the naval air forces of the U.S.A. upon our own air requirements, and, in particular, upon those for the air defence of Great Britain.   It may be briefly explained here.The defence of London and other industrial centres against air attack is vital to our security. London is an immense target in a peculiarly vulnerable position, and its defence is a task of exceptional difficulty.For defence against air attack we need effective parity of strength with the strongest air power within range, i.e., France. &quot;In determining the quota to be fixed on this basis, however, we are obliged to include the Fleet Air Arm in our figures, although it is an adjunct of our naval forces, and, therefore, may not be available for Home Defence. Fleet Air Arm aircraft are, moreover, subject to certain technical restrictions, and are less effective for air operations than ordinary land aircraft.In any comparison of air armaments for limitation purposes at the Disarmament Conference we are thus placed at a disadvantage by the inclusion of the Fleet Air Arm on equal terms with French land planes.If we are to accept this disadvantage and to be able to secure Great Britain against air attack, with our total air forces limited on a parity basis with those of France, it is essential that Fleet Air Arm requirements should not absorb too large a proportion of the numbers fixed.8. The size of the Fleet as a whole is determined upon a parity basis with America, and1 by analogy there are primd facie reasons for an equivalent parity arrangement in respect of seaborne aircraft. On this assumption, if the increases which are already contemplated by the U.S.A. were realised in any substantial measure, the residue of primary Home Defence types left under a parity agreement with France would be inadequate for security against air attack. Equally it is impracticable to fix the limiting figures for our air forces upon two independent standards of parity with France and with U.S.A. at the same time.These considerations led the Air Staff to suggest in D.C. (P.) 36, para-graphs 7 and 8, that the maximum allowable aircraft-carrying capacity of the Fleets of the two countries should be reduced to a level more in keeping with the present actual strengths. As the seaborne air forces of the U.S.A., actual and projected (vide paragraph 1 above), are larger than those of Great Britain, the solution of the problem lies in inducing the United States to fix a low limit for the aircraft-carrying capacity of their Fleet.Conclusion.9. The Air Staff would accordingly urge that negotiations should be opened as early as possible with the U.S.A. for the drastic limitation of the aircraft carrying capacity of the Fleets of the two countries on a basis of parity and at as low a level as can be secured. It would be necessary at some stage to bring Japan and the other naval Powers into the negotiations, but the major problem is an Anglo/U.S.A. settlement. In making this recommendation they are not unmindful that it may be considered undesirable to open at the present time discussions affecting in any way the naval agreements already reached between the great naval Powers, but they feel compelled to emphasise that expansion in seaborne air forces is proceeding at a rapid rate, and that the need for its limitation is urgent.J. M. SALMOND,Chief of the Air Staff.Air Ministry, October 2, 1931.
APPENDIX 1. (Secret.) -Extracts from the London Naval Treaty, 1930.Article 3.1. For the purposes of the Washington Treaty, the definition of an aircraft carrier given in Chapter II, Part 4, of the said Treaty is hereby replaced by the following definition : The expression &quot; aircraft carrier &quot; includes any surface vessel of war, whatever its displacement, designed for the specific and exclusive purpose of carrying aircraft and so constructed that aircraft can be launched therefrom and landed thereon.2. The fitting of a landing-on or flying-off platform or deck on a capital ship, cruiser or destroyer, provided such vessel was not designed or adapted exclusively as an aircraft carrier, shall not cause any vessel so fitted to be charged against or classified in the category of aircraft carriers.3. No capital ship in existence on the 1st April, 1930, shall be fitted with a landing-on platform or deck.Article 16.5. Not more than 25 per cent, of the allowed total tonnage in the cruiser category may be fitted with a landing-on platform or deck for aircraft.APPENDIX 2. (Secret.) -(1)Extracts from Statement by Rear-Admiral Moffett, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, U.S.A., to the House Naval Affairs Committee, 1930-31..... THE only remaining means of materially increasing the heavy striking, the offensive power of the fleet is by means&quot; of aircraft. Therefore I believe that, unless aircraft are added in the greatest numbers possible, the Nation will have neglected to provide itself with weapons permissible under existing commitments and which can be obtained without any sacrifice in other categories......... every ton permitted in every limited category should actually be laid down as early as financial considerations permit. One of the difficulties encountered at the London Conference was preventing the reduction in the air-cftaft carrier category. Certain powers desired to reduce the carrier tonnage from 135,000 to 100,000, their representatives stating that since the United States had not built up to its limits, it was apparent that so high a limit was unnecessary and that this should be reduced......... Very strong effort was made at the London Conference, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that our delegates succeeded in preventing the 135,000 tons being reduced. It is of vital importance to the United States that the 135,000 tons be not reduced by a ton......... Furthermore, there will probably be an effort made to reduce the percentage of cruisers which can be fitted with landing decks. At the London Conference the United States proposed that landing decks be allowed on all
combatant vessels. This proposal met with great opposition and resulted finally in the proviso allowing landing decks to be placed on only 25 per cent, of the allowed total tonnage in the cruiser category......... Therefore, admitting they (aircraft) have value, and will increase the power of our offense, we should use every possible means of adding to their numbers. This is of great importance when we realise that with all other types limited by treaty, there remains to us only this one method of strengthening our fleet. I urge that on all vessels we place as many aircraft as will add to our offensive power as a whole......... The flying-deck cruiser can carry from 24 to 36 airplanes, and each airplane can carry one 500-pound bomb......... I am satisfied our experts can construct flying-deck cruisers that will be entirely successful in every way and add greatly to the offensive and defensive power of our fleet......... We have no limit as yet on numbers and types of aircraft.(2)Extracts from Statement by Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy forAeronautics, 1931..... The whole of the naval aviation is dependent upon the number of aircraft carriers.   The United States is woefully lacking in these ships......... Therefore, to accomplish complete construction of carriers and flying-deck cruisers under. the London Treaty, and assuming the now accepted size vessels, we must construct four additional carriers and eight flying-deck cruisers. No other construction is as essential to our fleet in order to give it parity with the fleets of other countries and to make it a Avell-rounded unit.Appreciation of this fact appears in the measure for new construction offered to the last Congress by the Navy Department. The principal features of the Bill were the construction of an aircraft carrier, a flying-deck cruiser, and additional airplanes. The hearings before Congress disclosed a unanimous appreciation on the part of naval officers of the necessity for an expansion of aviation at sea.(3)Extracts from Article in &quot; U.S. Air Services&quot; of September 1931, entitled &quot;Linking Aircraft Programs to Navy Treaty Strength,&quot; by Charles L. Lawrance, President, Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce of America, Inc..... We must have a fleet powerful enough to assume the offensive immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities. For that purpose we must have aircraft in sufficient mimbers to take command of the air in the various theatres of the war. This means that our naval air forces must be large enough to defeat not only the craft of an opposing fleet, but enemy aircraft that may be sent qut from shore bases.. . . . So far no limitation has been placed on the number of naval aircraft a nation may possess, and I believe that if we are wise we will seize the opportunity while it exists of building up our air strength..... But it is now found that the 1,000 useful airplanes provided for in the procurement program are not sufficient to go around after furnishing craft needed by the training station at Pensacola, the United States Naval Academy, and two new cruisers.It is well known that it was only with great difficulty that the United States was able to prevent a reduction in carrier tonnage at the London Arms Limitation
Conference. Certain powers sought to reduce it to 100,000 tons, arguing that the 135,000-ton limit was excessively high, are evidenced by the fact that we had not built up to it.....Naval students tell us that we must build up to the tonnage limit for aircraft carriers to forestall a reduction in this category when the next disarmament conference under the London Treaty meets in the Spring of 1935, and this is tmdeniably true. The issue may even be forced at the conference to be called next year by the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament of the League of Nations. We may also expect a reduction in the percentage of cruisers that may be fitted with flight decks. All the weight this nation could bring to bear was necessary to force an agreement that 25 per cent., 80,750 tons, of the total cruiser tonnage, might be of the flight-deck type. I believe it is of vital importance to national defence that no further reductions be made in these categories..... Navy officials have recommended the construction of four more vessels of the same displacement tc fill the remaining 55,200 tons of carriers allotted to us under the treaties, thus providing the country with a total of seven useful carriers.There is no question that we should build as many platform cruisers as possible.....o
