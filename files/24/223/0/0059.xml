Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1931.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 264 (31).CABINET.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.Budgetary Limitation for Air Forces.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.1. THE then First Lord of the Admiralty circulated a few weeks ago to the Sub-Committee on the Disarmament Conference certain observations* on the subject of budgetary limitation as related to the Navy; and in the present Memorandum I wish to bring to the notice of the Cabinet similar and additional considerations relative to budgetary limitation proposals in connection with air forces.2. The Air Ministry has consistently expressed the opinion that budgetary limitation, as applied to air forces, will be both ineffective as a form of restriction, and particularly disadvantageous to this country as compared with the chief European Powers. On the other hand, the Air Ministry has always been in favour of a system of full budgetary &quot; publicity &quot; for all air expenditure.3. It will, I think, be of assistance to the Cabinet if, at this point, I refer to the proceedings of the Preparatory Commission during its last Session at Geneva in November 1930. The Commission had, previously, rejected by twenty-two votes to two the principle of budgetary limitation, but being unable to agree to any form of direct limitation for land armaments adopted, on this occasion, the principle of budgetary limitation and proposed a Total-Defence-Vote limitation covering the expenditure on all three arms. At the same time they rejected proposals for the separate limitation of the three arms, and, while adopting budgetary limitation for land and naval war material only, rejected a similar proposal for the limitation of air war material.America is opposed to all and any form of budgetary limitation. In opposition to budgetary limitation of air war material we find America, Japan and France.The Draft Disarmament Convention provides for the. direct numerical limitation of air (and naval) armaments and personnel, but, as regards land armaments, only provides for direct limitation in respect of personnel. As regards land forces, therefore, budgetary limitation has been adopted in substitution for direct limitation, whereas, in the case of air (and naval) armaments, it would be superimposed upon direct numerical limits.4.   With this preliminary explanation I will proceed to summarize the * reasons which, in my opinion, make it undesirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to endeavour to amend the decisions of the Preparatory Commission and to seek to apply budgetary limitation in relation to either air forces as a whole, or to expenditure upon air war material:  (A) In General.(i) Budgetary expenditure is not *a reliable index of effective military strength. For example, since 1925 we have in this country substantially increased our first-line strength, although we have actually reduced&quot;our gross expenditure.&quot; Circulated to the C.I.D. Sub-Committee as Paper No. D.O. (P.) 48.[5702]   [6061][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]
(ii) The budgetary limits proposed by the different countries would inevitably be too high to be of any practical value as a general method of disarmament, although, for the reasons set out in the following paragraphs, the system -would definitely work to the disadvantage of this country. Budgetary limitation would have to be related to the first-line strength, and to the scale of reserves of aircraft, and would have to allow a margin against contingencies, and for variations in purchasing power, &amp;c. For these reasons it is- inevitable, therefore, that all countries will state budgetary limits at figures in excess of their actual requirements.(iii) Budgetary limitation would not accurately be related to the other direct limitations, and (except in the case of land forces) is superimposed upon them. Whatever the intention may be, it will inevitably become a standard of comparison as between one country and another. In this connection I quote the observations of the Chairman (Lord Cecil) of the C.I.D. Sub-Committee on Budgetary Limitation at its first meeting on the 14tti April, 1930, as to the procedure in fixing budgetary limits : &quot; In the first place, each country would suggest its own budgetary limits for the period of the Convention, the second step would be a comparison of these figures; and the third, the most difficult, step would be an attempt to reduce them.&quot;(iv) Budgetary   limitation   detracts   from   the   value   of   budgetary publicity &quot; under articles 30 and 52 of the Draft Disarmament Convention.If budgetary limitation were established, expenditure below the maximum sum provided thereby could clearly not be questioned, and for the reasons stated in (ii) above it will be inevitable that the budgetary limits to be claimed by each country will provide for a wide margin of expenditure in relation to the numerical limits on air-craft and personnel. This is a point to which I wish to draw the particular attention of the Cabinet, since, once this is conceded and it is, as I under -stand, not in dispute the loss of power to question and draw attention to increases of expenditure which is otherwise inherent in the &quot;publicity&quot; system i(in conjunction with article 52) becomes a matter of extreme importance.(v) A budgetary limit must inevitably bear differently as between countries with different standards of living and of wages, and as between conscription and voluntary service countries. In general, it favours countries with conscripted forces and with the lower standards of pay, feeding and accommodation which goes with conscription.(vi) The imposition of budgetary limits would immeasurably complicate the problem of international agreement. The difficulty of negotiating the London Naval Treaty would have been immensely increased had it been necessary to obtain an agreement not only in relation to the tonnage, &amp;c., of ships, but also in relation to budgetary expenditure. Such difficulties will be very greatly intensified at the Disarmament Conference, where there will be a much larger number of conflicting claims to be reconciled.(vii) Subsidies, taxation, and rates can be manipulated to affect the cost of armaments, and, in general, countries which desire to evade a budgetary limit will have little or no difficulty in &quot; camouflaging &quot; their expenditure.(B) As regards Air Forces.(viii) Expenditure upon civil aviation aircraft, civil aviation industries, ground organization and equipment, is organically inseparable from expendi-ture upon and from the military potentialities of air armaments: budgetary limitation has no effect on these factors, which are, however, of substantial importance in assessing a country&apos;s effective air strength, and which might be of vital importance in time of war.(ix) In the present state of development of air armaments it is impossible accurately to budget for future financial requirements, even when the require-ments are known in advance.  &quot; Margins &quot; will therefore inevitably be large.(x) Increased expenditure on air armaments might represent increased safety (in general it does, since improved engineering and aeronautical technique spells increased cost), and not necessarily an increase of aggressive force.(C) As regards Great Britain&apos;s Air Armaments.(xi) We could not with safety accept a budgetary limit which did not make adequate provision for reserves of aircraft and equipment corresponding to
whatever first-line strength we were allotted. As we have not hitherto made any provision for war reserves we should without any increase in our present strength be placed in the embarrassing position of having to demand a limit at a figure very much above our present expenditure. Moreover, under a budgetary limit our lack of reserves would become apparent to potential enemies when the discrepancy between our annual expenditure and the permissible budgetary limit was scrutinized.(xii) We are not likely to develop an internal civil aviation and the industry which goes with it on the same scale as our continental neighbours. This is a disadvantage which is reflected in the increased cost of air armaments in Great Britain.(xiii) Because of our standards of living and of wages, on account of our voluntary as opposed to the conscription system, and because of higher standards of safety, the overall cost of our Air Force is very much higher (per aircraft) than, for example, the French. Our claims would therefore produce an unfortunate impression; and whatever the intention comparisons between one country and another would, as I have observed before, become inevitable.5. The effective limitation of air forces, in so far as that is possible, is primarily and mainly dependent upon the negotiation, agreement and enforce-ment if necessary under &quot; supervision &apos; of international obligations, as regards first-line strength and personnel. In my view, the imposition of supplementary forms of limitation and the introduction Of a further (Budgetary) standard will add nothing to disarmament, and will provide no additional guarantee against expansion or aggression. On the contrary, Budgetary Limitation will intensify the dangers to be apprehended from civil aviation, since it would prevent us improving our military aircraft so as to keep them abreast of technical developments; it would place us in the very embarrassing position of having to state a limit very largely in excess of present expenditure; it would, in my judgment, go far to prevent the possibility of negotiating satisfactory agreements as to air armaments; and I am unable to see how it could operate otherwise than to our disadvantage in relation to powers, e.g., France,. whose existing strength and state of preparedness for war is superior to our own.6. Our air force ranks fifth among the air powers. Our first-line strength is little more than half that of France. We are more exposed to air attack, and we stand more in need of adequate and efficient air defence than any other great Power. These facts are realities which, unless we are to acquiesce in a state of permanent air inferiority, must inevitably cause grave difficulties and embarrass-ments in negotiating satisfactory limiting figures at the Disarmament Conference. Any proposal which widens the field of negotiation must increase these difficulties.Accordingly, I cannot recommend that as regards the limitation of air forces His Majesty&apos;s Government should attempt to supplement the recommendations of the Preparatory Commission, nor do I consider that the imposition of a Budgetary Limitation for air forces could serve any useful purpose, or could operate otherwise than to our disadvantage.A.Air Ministry, October 7, 1931.
