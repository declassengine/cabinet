UNEMPLOYMENT   INSURANCE.Rates.of Benefit and Financial Position,;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. (Circulated in accordancemwith Cabinet 50 (31).  Conclusion 14.)1.    RATES OP BENEFIT.1. The Cabinet have asked to be furnished with astatement showing the effect of hutting rates of unemployment benefit by 10% on each item.      The rates so reduced are shown in the second column of figures in the table below.2. An unemployed /person may be entitled to one, two,three, four, five or six days&apos; benefit in a given week. While, therefore, the rates of unemployment benefit mentioned in Statutes are weekly rates, the Employment Exchanges necessarily work on daily rates.Ordinarily therefore the weekly ratesmust be multiples of 6d. The only way of making a cut of exactly 10$ - would be by fixing daily rates which are not exactly ono-sixth of the weekly rates but are calculated to the nearest penny.      The practicability of this is being considered.3. The following table shows :-A. the present rates of benefit;B. the present rates reduced by an exact 10 per cent.C. the reduced rates rounded off to the nearest 6d.D. the reduced rates rounded ujo to the 6d. above.

If the Cabinet wish it I will submit a memorandum indicating possible lines on which further economies can be effected. 6. The foregoing relates to next year (1932-33).Further provision of upwards of twenty millions will be necessary for the current year.    If further borrowing power are not to be sought,  this money must he voted in Committee of Supply.    The matter is being studied with the Treasury.(Intialled)    H.B.B.nistry of Labour,1st September, 1931.
