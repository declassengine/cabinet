As a result of their examination of the Statement of theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Committee now submit to the Cabinet the economies set out in     -. Appendix I to this Report. The Cabinet will observe that the economies contained in this Appendix amount in the aggregate to a sum of  70.34 m.  or approximately the same figure as the total given to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on August 26th,  1931.3. The Committee have only modified the proposals as originallysubmitted to them in the&apos;following respects -(a) University Grants;    the cut of  250,000 in the case of the Vote for Universities and Colleges has been deleted from the list.(b) Air Ministry Votes;  the supereut of  1,000,000 has been reduced to  500,000 on the understanding that this reduction can be effected without increasing the risks of service personnel. - -(c) Unemployment Insurance:    Reduction of benefits:    the Committee have accepted a scheme, proposed by the Ministry of Labour, approximating (in round shillings) to an 11 per cent, cut in &quot;benefit other than children&apos;s benefit;    the saving by the adoption of this scheme is estimated at  14,800,000.
4. The following points emerged during.- the - C^mmitrtee-&apos;&quot;-^consideration of the list of proposed economies. (1) Education (England and Vales)(a) the Ocmmittee were informed that the saving of  500,000 recommended in the Majority Report of the May&apos;Committee (in respect of reduction of grants for higher education in consequence of increase of school fees) would only he slowly achieved and would he Ivery controversial, and they accordingly agreediiot to include this item in the list of proposed&quot; savings.(b) The saving on Education  England and Wales) will be  JL. ^millions with discretion to the Board of Education, in consultation with the Treasury,  as regards the details of how precisely this total saving will be made up. Grants will be calculated on the assumption that teachers&apos; salaries are reduced by 15% and the Grant in respect of salaries reduced to 50/o, &quot;but adjustment will be made through theTfrant formula to prevent transfer ofthe charge to rates.    The deficiency Grant will be abolished, for which purpose legislation i will be necessary.(2) Education (Scotland)The provisions  regarding England and Vales will apply mutatis mutandi3 to the Education Vote fpiv Scotland.(S) Fighting services the Committee were assured that the three Service Departments could effect the super-cuts now proposed of  2 millions,  2 millions and  500,000 in 1932 without dischanging personnel, and were&quot;&apos; also informed that under the&quot; late -Government the Departments had stated that they could hold out no hope that these reductions could be realised in sub-sequent years, k *(4) geaith.The Minister of Health expressed the opinion that in future years economies would be realised if it was decided to pay a reduced subsidy on houses &apos; approved&apos;  after a&quot; certain date and work was suspended en the recent Rural Housing Act.    He also thought thats The First Lord of the Admiralty,  the Secretary of State for :vau and the Secretary of State for Air^huve been invited to attend the Cabinet with a view to a final decision being reached in regard to the reductions to be made in the Votes of their Departmentsrespectively. ---2-
as regards National Health Insurance the doctors could he persuaded to accept a capitation rate of S/- instead of 9/- and that some similar reduction could he effected as regards the rate for chemists.    Other possible economies might be realised by allowing the Prolongation of Insurance Act to lapse and by dropping the Exchequer grant in aid to the approved societies Central Fund,The Committee invited the Minister of Health to furnish the Cabinet with further information on these matters at the meeting on Monday nest, August 31st, 1931.(5) Unemployment Insurance;    Transitional Benefit.Some discussion to-9lc place in regard to  the question of transitional benefit.    It was urged; -m the one hand,  that the Unemployment Insurance Fund could not be placed on a satisfactory insurance basis unless a genuine attempt was made to deal with the persons who had fallen cut\ of benefit and who were therefore outside the *&quot;   &apos; insured category.     Moreover,  it wooTd&quot; be administratively inadmissible to duplicate the work now being done&apos;&quot;efficiently by the existing machinery of the Public Assistance Authorities, especially in view of the fact that no sharp i dividing line could be drawn between personsentitled to transitional &quot;benefit and Public ,  Assistance Authority applicants.    Attention was I   also drawn-to the very large savings which, it was claimed, could be realised if use were made of the Public Assistance Authority machinery,,On the other hand, the Committee were warned by the Prime Minister that he and his Labour colleagues in the Government would be placed in a most difficult position if it was decided, ineffect, to transfer persons in receipt of transitional benefit, to the Poor Law, and his views in this respect were shared by the President of the Board of Education.    The Prime Minister suggested, however,  that it might be possible to devise a scheme whereby the Ministry f of Labour   wao   responsible for the applications 1 and actual payment of benefit, while the benefit itself was assessed by the Public Assistance Authoritiesr**The Committee requested the Minister of Health,  in consultation with the Minister of Labour to prepare a scheme on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister for the eon-sideration of the Cabinet at their Meeting on Monday, August 31st0NOTE,    The Minister of Labour has been specially invited to attend the Meeting of the Cabinet in question for the purpose of the  consideration of this and other questions affecting his Department.
(6) Unemployment Insurance;    Anomalies.The Committee agreed to adopt the  5,000,000 cut in respect of the anomalies under the recent Act in view of the very controversial and difficult character of the legislation that would he required to effect further savings under this head.(7) Reduction^in Salaries of Ministers and other Public Officers.The Committee were informed, that it is proposed, in the case of the salaries of Ministers and other Public Officers (including Judges), that the following cuts should be applied;-Emolnments.
