THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HISBRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.P56T3DRET . opyCABINETCGLORADO BEETLE.Prohibition of Imports of Potatoes gtc . from Franca.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The rapid spread of the Colorado Beetle in France towardsthe Channel has caused much alarm among potato growers here;    it undoubtedly constitutes a real dangor to our industry.     Where the Beetle is established, a crop can only be obtained if sprayed at least twice during the summer, at a cost which may be roughly estimated at about  2 per acre.     (The area under potatoes in Great Britain [excluding allotments] is approximately 570,000 acres, and in Northern Ireland 110,000 acres).     Many small growers would probably give up potato cultivation.     Our export trade to other countries might be considerably diminished, or even stopped altogether;    its value in 1930 (for the United Kingdom) was.  250,000.At the end of 1930 the Beetle had reached a point in Vienne, some 10 kilometres south of the Loire.     During the summer just ended it has appeared 200 kilometres north and north-east from that point - a much greater advance than has ever previously been recorded in one year.     7 Departments north of the Loire are now infected.      There has been an outbreak 90 kilometres from St. Malo, the main port of the great potato exporting district of Brittany, and 65 kilometres from the boundary of that district.potatoes, nursery stocks and tomatoes grown within 40 kilometres of an outbreak.     In the spring of this year my predecessor increased this distance to 75 kilometres.     The alarming spread of the Beetle during this summer compels us, in my opinion, to impose much more drastic restrictions.From 1923 to 1930 we prohibited the entry of French
I sun advised that for the protection of our cropo the following measures ought, to be taken:-(1)   Complete prohibition of the entry of French potatoes, for the whole year..^y, :\.t;2.(2)    Prohibition of the entry of nursery stock and living-plants, if grown within 200 kilometres from an outbreak, also for the whole year.(3)    Prohibition of the entry of raw vegetables (including salads, tomatoes and aubergines) if grown within 2C0 kilometres of an outbreak, but only for the period from the 15th march to the 14th October, when the Beetle is active.I am advised further that if the French press us, one or two trivial concessions might be possible on the above proposals, without any grave addition to our risk;   but nothing really material could be conceded.The value of the imports of  &quot;ranch potatoes last year was  874,000]   this trade would be entirely stopped.   It is impossible to say with any certainty what would be the value of the other trade stopped, but it might perhaps be In the region of  150,000.     The total effect of the measures indicated above would therefore be to keep out French Imports to the value of about  1,000,000, or slightly more.   Cur total Imports from France last year were  49,000,000.There is a small treaty complication.   Under a Treaty of 1882, the French might claim that any restriction we impose on Fi*ench produce should be imposed on produce from other countries where the Colorado Beetle is established, namely the United States and Canada.   For some six years past we have prohibited potatoes from the two last-named countries, but not nursery stock, living plants, etc. - there being no trade worth considering.   If the French do raise the point (which the Beard of Trade think unlikely) we may have as a matter cf form to bring our Orders relating to the United States iLMiwamMiiiiilii. Into line with our Orders relating to France.
Ministry cf Agriculture and Fisheries 30th September, 1931.rMy Department has been in touch with the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, who I understand strongly support the measures proposed above;   and also with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, who do not object to them If they are considered necessary.In all probability no precautions will avail to prevent sporadic appearances of the Beetle here sooner or later - it may be next year or It may not be for ten years; preparations have been made to suppress outbreaks at once when it does come.   But we are clearly bound to do cur utmost to delay Its arrival and to diminish the severity of its attack. . The French Ministry of Agriculture have asked to be allowed to discuss the whole subject with us before we take action;   and I am expecting to see their representatives In London early next week.     Before I see them I shall be glad to have the general approval of the Cabinet to the proposals stated above.(Intld.)   J.G.
