(THIS DOGUIyESKT^ IS TH^ )SECRET.CF.   250 ( 51:). copy NO.  g_C A B I N E T,.RELATION OF UNEICPLQYMSNT BENEFIT TO COST 0? LIVING.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Labour.In the debates on the Economy Eill stress has been laid on the fact that the cut in unemployment benefit was justified by the Prime Minister on the ground of the fall in the cost-of-living.      The question has been pressed whethers  if the cost of living rises, the rate of benefit will be correspondingly increased.It will he necessary for me to make some /reference to this point when I make my reply to the Debate about 7 o!clock tonight,  and I ask for Cabinet instructions as to what I should say.      If it meets with the approval of the Cabinet I propose to reply on the fallowing lines:-&quot;There has not up to the present been any increase in the cost of&apos; living,  and the question is therefore a purely hypothetical one^ But, leaving&apos;this aside,  it is necessary to bear in mind that the cost of living is notthe only factor to be taken into account.The reduction of Benefit was not made only because the cost-of^living has fallen, though the fall in the cost-of-living mitigates the effect of the reduction.
Z 8 5There is another and very important reason, and that is that the Fund will not carry Benefits on the present scale without recourse to &quot;borrowing - which it is absolutely imperative to stop - or without such an increase of contributions as would   ibe quite unjustifiable in relation to the &quot; / resources of those who have to pay these contributions while&apos; they are at work.&quot;(Intld)    H.B.28th September,1931.
