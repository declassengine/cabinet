This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government. 317Printed for the Cabinet, September, 1931.SECRET. 0 -- 5Copy No.CP. 255 (31).THE CABINET.REDUCTION IN SERVICE PAY AND PENSIONS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR-Pat.The  question  at  issue, as  to i the  interpretation  of the   Prime  Minister&apos;s      30 announcement of 21st September, is explained and discussed in the memorandum of  General the First Lord of the Admiralty, CP. 252 (31) dated 28th September, 1931. 8642Briefly, the question is whether (A) the limitation of the reduction to 10 per cent, is to be interpreted as applying only to the individual in his present circumstances, so that no individual shall suffer a reduction of his pay to an amount less than nine-tenths of the rate he is receiving at the present moment, or (B) whether the limitation is to be applied to the whole scale of pay to which he may look forward on promotion.The position immediately before the Prime Ministers announcement was that the Government had decided, and announced, that from 1st October, 1931, all members of the Services who had been exceptionally promised in 1925 that they would retain their 1919 scales of pay for the rest of their service would&quot;-now be&apos; brought; from 1st October, 1931, on to the 1925 rates which apply, to&apos; everyone who has entered the Service since 1925.Is the meaning of the new decision (A) that the Government still adhere to this termination of the promise of 1925, subject only to the proviso that none shall suffer a sudden reduction of more than 10 per cent., or (B) that the Government have now decided only to terminate that promise to the extent of reducing the 1919 scales of pay by 10 per cent. for members of the Services who. still enjoy those scales during the currency of their present engagements ?The matter was discussed at a meeting between the First Lordof the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air and myself, with our advisers, on the 28th instant, and after hearing the First Lord&apos;s presentation of the Admiralty case I feel bound to range&apos; myself with him in favour of the more liberal interpretation (B):   I recognize that the view at (A) is not without a logical basis, and from&apos; the point of view of Army&apos; Estimates I view with concern the extra cost (see below) involved in (B) over (A), but my military advisers hold that this is the sense in which the Army will read the Prime&apos; Ministers announcement.   It goes without saying that all three services must be treated alike in this matter.The three Defence Departments are agreed, in any case, that on entering into a fresh agreement, that is to say on extension of service, on re-engagement to complete&apos; 21 (or 22 or 24) years&apos; service, or on continuance in the service after 2L(or 22&apos;Or 24) years, sailors, soldiers and airmen who enlisted before October, 1925,&apos; shall come on to the scales of pay introduced with effect from that date.&apos;On this condition it is estimated that if the personnel concerned are allowed to&apos; remain on the 1919 rates (less 10 per cent.) on promotion it will cost for the Army  35,000 in 1932 and  83,000 in 1933&apos;more than if the&apos;1919&apos;rates (less 10 per cent.) are, restricted to; the. ranks, in which the personnel., affected are now serving.   The additional annual cost/jwill rise somewhat after 1933-to perhaps  150,000s but will entirely disappear; by. 1940,. when the men concerned either will - all have extended; I re-engaged, &amp;c, and will have thus come on to the mew rates of pay, or will have left1 the Colours,; whilethe officers by&apos;that date: will all have over 15 years- service and will-thus.cease to be,affected by the new rates, of pay.*.* The whole cost of the inew 10 per cent, limitation on the basis of (B) is  370^000 a year for the Army; that is, the annual saving of  990,000 which was to be secured by bringing all personnel now on the 1919 rates down to the 1925.rates on 1st&apos;October, 1931, is reduced by  370,000 in 1932  assuming the above-mentioned stipulation as to re-engagement, etc, , These losses arising out of the 10 per cent, decision would be lessened, if the question now submitted were decided in the sense of (A), by&apos;the figures so far as the Army is&apos;concerned-shown in the&apos;text.(B31/S)   80   9/31   W.O.P.   5795
Pensions.The Army Council, while recognizing that the Admiralty proposal may be the more intelligible to the individuals concerned, feel hound to point out that there is a sound basis in logic for what the Government, following the recommendation of the May Committee, have decided in this matter. The question cannot be understood without somewhat close analysis.It should be observed that soldiers have a contractual right (laid down in the Pay Warrant) only to the pension rates that were in force at the date of their enlistment, and not to any better terms that may be introduced in the course of their service, though it has been the practice, hitherto, to grant them any such better terms. Consequently, the great majority of the men already re-engaged, as they enlisted before September, 1919, have no contractual right to the terms introduced in that year, but only a traditional right.In their decisions in regard to pensions the Government are really doing two things : (i) They are taking certain exceptional action to reduce emoluments which havenot followed the fall in the cost of living this is the meaning of the decision that service from 1st October, 1931, shall count towards pension only at the lower rates introduced in 1930 though in this case it must be realized that the resultant saving will only come gradually.(ii) They are modifying, in the interests of future economy, the rule in regard toentitlement to pension rates in future by basing the pension on the scale in force at the date of re-engagement and not that of the date of enlistment.The Government are not obliged to bring any exceptional action they are taking under (i) within the ambit of any general decision under (ii), and, accordingly, there is no compelling reason why the basis of reduction under (i) for men already re-engaged should be made the same as that which will obtain in future under (ii). Existing re-engaged men are not being treated unfavourably as compared with future re-engaged men (who are to acquire a right to the terms in force at the date of re-engagement); it is true that their vested right is less favourable, but they will have a higher actual rate of pension preserved to them.Further, there is another class which should not be forgotten in any proposal to benefit the re-engaged man, viz., the man who has extended his colour service (^the number is limited by a special quota) to 12 years with a view to re-engagement in due course. In future he will know that his pension terms are not fixed until he actually re-engages, but, as things now stand, he has already taken a deliberate step towards pension and has almost the same expectation of pension as the re-engaged man. To benefit the re-engaged man, as the Admiralty propose, is to increase the relative hard-ship of this man. This point is of some importance, though the Army Council would not in any case propose any alteration of the Government decision as regards such extended men.If a certain scale of pension is reserved to a man merely because he is serving in the expectation of that scale, it may be asked why the Government do not do the same for pay, instead of cutting it by 10 per cent.The extra cost for the Army of the concession proposed by the Admiralty would be about  .1,000 a year in 1932, rising to some  60,000 a year in 10 years&apos; time and thereafter in due course disappearing.Period of grace for men to decide as to re-engagement.On this minor point I agree generally with the proposal of the First Lord of the Admiralty that men already eligible te re-engage should be allowed some period after 1st October within which to decide whether to re-engage, and that if they do so within that period they should be allowed to earn pension at the same rates as men already re-engaged. That is to say, for service prior to October, 1931, the pension would be at the 1919 rates ; for service thereafter they would be governed by the decision now to be taken on the question dealt with in the previous paragraphs.Reserve Pat, &amp;c.I take this opportunity of informing the Cabinet of the course which the War Office (and, I understand, the Air Ministry) are proposing to take as to the Reserve pay and emoluments of kindred classes.
These rates are to apply to men now in the Reserves as well as those who may pass to the Reserves in the future.The new rate of 9d. a day is 50 per cent, above the pre-war rate and corresponds with the present cost of living as compared with 1914, and although the point was not mentioned in the Warrant announcing the reduction it was in fact on tbe basis of the fall in the cost of living that the reduction of 25 per cent, was made. (The full 25 per cent, reduction was not made in the Reserve pay of Section A because it was desired to maintain for that Section their lead of 6d. a day.)Although designated pay, and expressed as a daily rate in common with all other forms of pay drawn by soldiers, this emolument is in fact intended as a retainer and is issued quarterly in arrear.The Army Council are disposed to the view that the limitation of reductions of pay to 10 per cent, need not be applied to pay of Army and Air Force Reservists. The Air Council are less concerned ; the Admiralty hardly at all.The quarterly bounties paid as retainers to officers and men of the Supplementary Reserve have also been reduced by 25 per cent, with effect from 1st October, 1931. It is similarly proposed that this reduction shall stand.The saving to be made by reducing the Reserve Pay, &amp;c, as decided by the Government last month, was  600,000 a year for the Army, beginning at once. If the 25 per cent, reduction were now to be limited to 10 per cent., this saving would be reduced by  350,000, i.e., to  250,000 a year.C.The War Office,29 th September, 1931.Before the War the rates of Army Reserve pay were s. d.Section A (relatively small in number)      ...       ...       ...   1 0Sections B and D     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   0 6After the War they were raised to Section A      ...      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ....   1 6Sections B and D     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   1 0In accordance with the Governments decision the following reduced rates as from 1st October, 1931, have been announced s. d.Section A      ...       ...       ...       ...      ....       ...       ...   1 3Sections B and JD     ...       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...   0 9
