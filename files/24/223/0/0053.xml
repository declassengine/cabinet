THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1931.SECRET. Copy No.    8CP. 258 (31*.CABINET.LIMITATION OF NAVAL ARMAMENTS.Memobandum by the Fiest Lobd of the Admiralty.MY predecessor has already drawn attention to certain aspects of Budgetary limitation in a memorandum for the Three Party Committee, D.C. (P.) 48, and has pointed out that a decision as to the policy to be pursued at the Disarmament Conference is urgently necessary. Somewhat similar decisions must be taken in regard to the figure which can be accepted for the limitation of Effectives. It may therefore be convenient to recapitulate and amplify the late First Lord&apos;s memorandum.Budgetary Limitation.2. The Admiralty have always taken the view that the only really effective method of naval limitation is a limitation of size and tonnage as in the Washington and London Naval Treaties. Budgetary Limitation was accepted by the Cabinet, with the acquiescence of the Admiralty, in view of the War Office insistence that this was the best method of limiting land armaments. This country is, however, only committed to Budgetary Limitation for naval matters if all the principal maritime Powers agree to accept it. The Admiralty note that the British reservation on this point is made in the Draft Convention specifically in regard to Article 24, Limitation of Naval War Material, but obviously the reservation applies with equal force to Article 29, Limitation of Total Naval Expenditure. This view is confirmed by the general statement made by the British representative at the 9th Meeting of the 6th Session of the Preparatory Commission, copy annexed.3. The Admiralty presume that the agreements already entered into by certain Powers limiting their naval armaments will form the starting point of the discussions at the Disarmament Conference, and that this was the reason which led the Imperial Conference in 1930 to agree that it was desirable that the period for which the Disarmament Convention should last should be until the date of the expiry of the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty, namely, the 31st December, 1936.4. On that basis it follows that, in the first instance, all the Powers parties to those Treaties must claim budgetary freedom to build and equip ships up to the limits imposed by such Treaties; no Power can be expected to accept Budgetary Limitation preventing it from taking steps specifically provided for by existing Treaty unless and until the provisions of that Treaty are altered by a multi-lateral agreement equally binding on other Powers.5. Obviously, some Powers, including ourselves, are below the strength permitted by Treaty in ships, and the appropriate quota of men or munitions. The Budgetary Limitation figures must clearly, then, be such as will not prevent such Powers from making good all their, deficiencies. So far as this country is concerned, the only meaning that can be attached to the &quot;ten years peace rule &quot; as the basis for service estimates is that, in the event of the political horizon clouding over, increase of expenditure would be contemplated with a view to catching up arrears in preparedness for war.[6040] b
6. Our Naval Budgetary Limitation figures must, therefore, be computed on the basis of our requiring to be able (1) To build as quickly as practicable up to the limits allowed by theWashington and London Naval Treaties should the political situationrender such a course necessary. (2) To man fully the ships as they are built, as well as existing ships (atpresent many of our ships as a matter of economy are only partiallymanned).(3) To equip the ships with full allowances of ammunition (the allowances are temporarily reduced as a measure of economy).Nor does it appear to the Admiralty that Budgetary Limitation should be accepted which would limit our right to adequate replacement of reserves or development of auxiliary services, even though, as a matter of economy, we are not at present taking such action. In this view, the slackening of the develop-ment of the Singapore base must be regarded as a domestic matter and not one to be enforced upon us by a Budgetary Limitation figure; so must the delay in the building up of oil fuel reserves, and the completion of coast defences.7. Attention has already been called to the grave inadequacy of our coast defences (D.C.P. 6, Appendix II), and it is evident that provision must be made, wuthin any Budgetary limit which might be adopted, for putting them in a reasonable state of efficiency. The Experts&apos; Report recommends that coast defence services should be treated as part of the naval forces for Budgetary Limitation purposes (Chapter 11). To this proposal I see the gravest objection from the point of view of practical administration.It also appears, in fact, to be quite unnecessary for Coast Defence expenditure to be included in the limitation figure for the same service in all countries, since it has always been maintained that Budgetary Limitation figures will not be comparable as between different countries.8. It will be evident from the above that there is likely at any time to be a considerable margin between the Budgetary Limitation figure acceptable to a country and the current Budgetary Publicity figure (i.e., actual expenditure), whether for naval war material or for total expenditure. It also appears that the less ready for war a country is in peace the greater the margin will be.9. On the other hand, as this margin increases so the value of Budgetary Limitation is reduced, as was stressed by the Budgetary Experts in Chapter 25 of their Report.10. It wTould appear., however, that efforts to reduce the margin and so increase the value of Budgetary Limitation would lead to the following-paradoxical results : (1) It would favour the country which in time of peace maintains its armed forces in a state of constant readiness for war. (2) It would invite and indeed necessitate an immediate increase in peaceexpenditure on the part of countries like our own which are atpresent the least ready for war.11. The Budgetary Limitation section of the Disarmament Convention must also contain provision for implementing the &quot; escalator &quot; clause of the London Naval Treaty (Article 21), if this is found necessary.12. The proposals already made provide that virement may be permitted in the following ways : (a) Between the land, sea and air forces (Chapter 15 of the report of the budgetary Experts).(b) Over each consecutive period of 4 years (Chapter 17).(c) For naval expenditure between the different parts of the British Empire(Paper E. (30) 27 of the Imperial Conference, 1930).13. The Admiralty suggest that as it is proposed that the Convention should end in 1936, it might be more convenient to substitute for (b) a proposal that each State should undertake during the period of the Convention to maintain the average level of its annual expenditure within the limits laid down in
Articles 10, 24 and 29. But they point out that in certain circumstances it may not be possible to determine whether, in fact, the average has been exceeded until after the Convention has lapsed. The further proposal of the Experts that each State should undertake not to exceed during any given year its average limit by more than a fixed percentage is not desirable, since, for the reasons stated above, the hypothesis on which it is proposed that the limitation figure should be based implies that there may be a rapid rise in naval expenditure.14. Virement between the Services as proposed by the Experts is highly undesirable, first, because the Washington and London Naval Treaties assign a definite quota of naval strength in ships and tonnages to the British Common-wealth of Nations as a whole, and this should be provided for within the total figure set for the navy; secondly, because our naval needs bear no relation to the strength of our military forces.Limitation of Effectives.15. As already stated, the Admiralty!s view is that the most satisfactory method of limiting naval forces is by limiting tonnage, but the limitation of personnel was introduced and accepted by the Preparatory Commission in order to allay the apprehension felt in some conscript countries that a surplus of naval effectives might be worked up for use as soldiers.16. The Admiralty have assumed that the limitation of personnel will be related to the limitation of tonnage in such a way as to admit of manning fully the whole fleet allowed by the Convention. Whatever may be the maximum personnel required to be borne during any year during which the Convention is in force in order that the whole fleet may be fully manned will thus form the limitation figure. The grounds for making this assumption are as follows, although it is recognised that if our figure is calculated in this way there will be a considerable margin between the limitation and publicity figures.17. It has been generally accepted at Geneva during the discussions of the Preparatory Disarmament Commission that the limitation of naval personnel does not affect the lawful claim of a country to maintain in commission a fleet adequate to guarantee its security.18. The better prepared a country&apos;s navy is for war in respect of personnel the smaller will be the acceptable margin between its &quot; publicity&quot; and its &quot; limitation &quot; figures for effectives.19. The discrepancy need not, and usually does not, exist in such an acute form in the case of conscript navies, since in their case the expense entailed by making provision for fully manning their fleets is much less than in those countries which adopt the voluntary system.20. For example, the Japanese Estimates for 1931 allow for a total number of naval effectives of 90,700. which figure is based on the requirements to man their whole fleet. If a comparison is made between the total tonnage of the British and Japanese Fleets, a figure for us comparable to the above far exceeds our present numbers.21. In calculating the United Kingdom figures the Admiralty assume full crews for all seagoing ships of the peace fleet, including ships in reserve, with the necessary margins for leave, sickness, crossing reliefs, &amp;c. They provide for any necessary increase in harbour establishments due to higher numbers under authorised scales, e.g., Instructors, Cooks, &amp;c. They provide also for the necessary increase in numbers of recruits and numbers under training.22. On the above-mentioned assumption, the maximum personnel for th* United Kingdom during the period of the Convention will be 113,700.(The number of naval effectives included in the publicity statement recently sent to the League was 96,042.)23. The number of recruits included in this limitation figure is based on the arbitrary assumption that on the 31st December, 1936, the fleet becomes stable and that the personnel remains unaltered in the years immediately following.
24. The inclusion in the limitation figures of any provision in respect of reserves is dependent upon the method upon which figures are calculated. Full provision being taken for the manning of the whole fleet and naval establishments with whole time effectives, the reservists intended for these duties will, having regard to the method laid&apos; down in the draft Convention for reckoning the number of effectives, be more than amply covered, and it seems unnecessary, in calculating the United Kingdom figure, to make specific provision for any reservists.25. The Admiralty have suggested to the Dominions Office and India Office that the other members of the British Commonwealth, who are members of the League, should communicate to us their limitation figures for naval effectives on the above basis, as a preliminary to a settlement of the outstanding questions of principle mentioned in this memorandum.Question of a Single Quota of Naval Strength for the British Commonwealth.26. It is pointed out that the idea of a single quota of naval strength for the British Commonwealth of Nations, though embodied in the London Naval Treaty, has not been adopted generally for future purposes nor, indeed, in any other connection than the ships and tonnages in the Washington and London Naval Treaties. In fact, when each member of the League of Nations was recently asked to render a return of its naval strength, the Irish Free State demurred to the suggestion that there should! be any adding up of the total strength of the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, showing in a single aggregate the various quotas of the Dominions and United Kingdom; and Canada and the Union of South Africa then took up a similar position.27.   A summary of principal recommendations is appended.A. C.Admiralty, September 30, 1931.Summary of Principal Recommendations.1. That budgetary limitation shall be accepted only if all the principal maritime Powers agree.2. That the Washington and London Naval Treaties shall form the starting point of the discussions at the Disarmament Conference3. That consequently there must be a single limitation figure for the tonnage of the naval forces of all the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, with powers of virement between them. Similar principles may have to apply to the limitation of effectives and of expenditure.4. That provision must be included in the Disarmament Convention for implementing the &quot; escalator &quot; clause of the London Naval Treaty so as to provide for additional tonnage, effectives and expenditure if necessary.5. That budgetary limitation and limitation of effectives shall not be such as to prevent steps being taken, if the need should arise, at once to increase our existing collective strength up to the limits allowed by the treaties, and to man fully the ships permitted by these treaties.6. That consequently there must be a considerable margin between our &quot;limitation&quot; and &quot; publicity&quot; figures, both for effectives and for expenditure.7. That no virement shall be allowed between expenditure on land, sea and air forces.
s8. That, budgetary limitation shall apply to the average annual expendituie during the period of the Convention, instead of the four-yearly period proposed by the budgetary experts.9. That there shall be no undertaking not to exceed in any year this average by more than a fixed percentage.Extract from Minutes of the Ninth Meeting of the Sixth Session (Second Part) of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference.Lord Cecil.^c- -X- -X&quot; -k- -X&apos; -k*In absolute candour, I think that I ought just to add this : the British Government are in favour, as I have said more than once in this Commission, of a complete system of budgetary limitation. But it is quite evident that, if budgetary limitation be rejected, say for naval matters, by other great maritime Powers, it would be very difficult for the British Government to accept Budgetary limitation for naval matters. There is a very complete specific limitation of fleets already existing, and that would, of course, remain. I think everyone will agree that it would be a very difficult proposition for the British Government to say that they accepted, not only a specific limitation of their fleet, but a budgetary limitation also, whereas other Powers accepted a different standard.o(5040
