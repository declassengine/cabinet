this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/S GOVERNMENT62Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1931.SECRET. copy No     8CP. 212 (31).CABINET.THE STATUTE OF WESTMINSTER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. IT is, of course, now a matter of history that the Imperial Conference of 1926 defined the constitutional position of Great Britain and the Dominions.2.   The terms of the definition may be quoted : &quot;They are autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to&apos; another &quot;in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs though united by a common allegiance to the Crown and freelyTtssociated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;This definition left, and necessarily left, several problems of importance unsolved, and several anomalies existing, particularly in relation to the legal position.3. Broadly, the questions involved were, first, that there remains a consider-able body of law passed by the Parliament at Westminster which still applies to the Dominions and cannot be repealed or modified by them; secondly, that under the existing system the Government at home retains certain rather ill-defined powers with reference to Dominion legislation;&quot; andj thirdly, that whereas the Parliament at Westminster can&quot;,&quot;unquestionably, legislate with extra-territorial effect there were doubts as to the powers of Dominion Parliaments in this respect. These questions proved so complex and intricate that, owing to the short time available at the meeting of the 1926 Conference, it was not thought possible, or indeed safe, to make any immediate pronouncement beyond a statement of certain underlying principles; it was considered that the best course would be to set up expert bodies to enquire into and report upon the matters concerned. The Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference accordingly recommended (Cmd. 2768, pp. 16 to 18), and the Conference agreed, that steps should be taken by Great Britain and the Dominions to set up a Committee with terms of reference on the following lines : &quot;To enquire into, report upon and make recommendations concerning (i) Existing statutory provisions requiring reservation of Dominion legislation for the assent of His Majesty, or authorising the disallowance of such legislation.(ii) (a) The present position as to the competence of Dominion Parlia-ments to give their legislation extra-territorial operation.(b) The practicability and most convenient method of giving effect to the principle that each Dominion Parliament should have power to give extra-territorial operation to its legislation in all cases where such operation is ancillary to provision for the peace, order and good government of the Dominion.(iii) The principles embodied in or underlying the Colonial Laws Validity Act, 1865, and the extent to which any provisions of that Act ought to be repealed, amended or modified in the light of the existing relations between the various members of the British Commonwealth of Nations as described in this Report&quot; [i.e., the report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee).[5931] b
4. I ought, perhaps, to summarize the statements as to underlying principles referred to above.(a) With regard to powers of disallowance-and reservation of Dominion legislation, the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee proposed that it should be placed on record that, apart from provisions embodied in Constitutions or in specific Statutes expressly providing for reservation, it is recognised that it is the right of the Government of each Dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating to^hjts, own affairs. Consequently it would not be in accordance with constitutional practice for advice to be tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain in any matter appertaining to the affairs of a Dominion against the views of the Government of that Dominion.. &apos; (b) Withhregard to projected legislation in one of the self-governing parts of the British Commonwealth which might affect the interests of other self-governing parts, the appropriate procedure was defined as being &quot;previous consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the several parts concerned.&quot;In this connection it was suggested that, in future, uniformity of legislation as between the different self-governing parts of the Commonwealth could best be secured by the enactment of reciprocal statutes based upon consultation and agreement.(c) With regard to the legislative competence of the self-governing members of the Commonwealth other than the United Kingdom, the Conference thought that it should be placed on record that legislation by the Parliament at West-minster applying to a^Dominion would only &quot;he passed with the assent of the Dominion concernedT5. Further, the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee pointed out (Cmd. 2768, -pp. 18 and 19) that, while uniformity of administrative practice was desirable, and, indeed, essential, as regards the Merchant Shipping Legislation of the various parts of the Empire, it was difficult to reconcile the application, in their present form, of certain provisions of the principal statute relating to merchant shipping, viz., the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, especially sections 735 and 736 (which confer powers on Dominion Parliaments to legislate in regard to merchant shipping, but prescribe certain limitations) with the constitutional status of the several members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Committee, therefore, recommended, and the Conference agreed, that the general question of Merchant Shipping Legislation should be remitted to a special Sub-Conference, which should meet at the same time as the Committee on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, referred to above; and that the Sub-Conference (which would include representatives of India, as well as of Great Britain and of the Dominions) should be invited to advise on the following general lines : &quot; To consider and report on the principles which should govern, in the general interest, the practice and legislation relating to merchant shipping in the various parts of the Empire, having regard to the change in consti-tutional status and general relations which has occurred since existing laws were enacted.&quot;6. The meeting of the proposed Committee and sub-Conference was held in the autumn of 1929. Their report was published in 1930 under the title of Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation, 1929 (Cmd. 3479). The United Kingdom was represented at the Conference by the then Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Lord Passfield) and the Attorney-General (Sir W. Jowitt); but it should perhaps be mentioned that during the progress of the Conference the most important constitutional questions which arose were brought before the Government as a whole. It was with the full authority of the Government that the United Kingdom representatives signed the Report, which was unanimous.7. The recommendations of the Report were stated (paragraph 126 of Cmd. 3479) to &quot; have been framed with the object of carrying into full effect the equality of status established as the root-principle governing the relations of the members of the Commonwealth, and indicating methods for maintaining and strengthening the practical system of free co-operation which is its instrument.&quot; Some of these recommendations, relating to Disallowance and Reservation, and to uniformity of legislation in regard to merchant shipping, involved only administrative action, or at any rate did not require immediate legislation; but
others involved the passage of legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament forthwith, in order to give effect to the principle of equality of status. A Bill was accordingly drafted in order to show the legislative action which would be required to give effect to the recommendations in this respect. The provisions of this Bill, which was not of course published, formed the basis of discussions at the Imperial Conference, 1930.8. The following Resolutions were passed by the 1930 Conference (pages 18 and 19 of Cmd. 3717) :-&quot; (i) The Conference approves the Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation (which is to be regarded as forming part of the Report of the present Conference), subject to the conclusions embodied in this Section.(ii) The Conference recommends (a) That the Statute proposed to be passed by the Parliament at Westminster should contain the provisions set out in the Schedule annexed.(b) That the 1st December, 1931, should be the date as from which the I proposed Statute should become operative. j(c) That, with a view to the^fealisation of this arrangement, Resolutions passed by both Houses of the Dominion Parliaments should be forwarded to the United Kingdom, if possible by the 1st July, 1931, and, in any case, not later than the 1st August, 1931, with&quot;, a view to the enactment by the Parliament of the United Kingdom of legislation on the lines set out on the schedule annexed.(d) That the Statute should contain such further provisions as to its application to any particular Dominion as are requested by that Dominion.&quot;9. As regards (c), the required resolutions have been passed by all the Dominion Parliaments, with, in certain cases, the addition of special clauses relating&quot;&quot; to&apos; the circumstances of the particular Dominion as contemplated under (d).10. It remains, therefore, for the United Kingdom Parliament to take steps to give effect to the recommendation under (b) before the 1st December. It will be seen, therefore, that the matter is one of considerable urgency.11. The draft Bill attached has been revised to incorporate the clauses agreed to at the Imperial Conference last year (schedule on pages 19-21 of Cmd. 3717), and certain new clauses dealing with the position in Canada, Australia and Newfoundland, which have been inserted at the request of the Dominions concerned.  12. My colleagues are, I think, well aware of the importance of the issues involved in this Bill, which will undoubtedly be a document of the highest constitutional significance, and it would therefore seem appropriate, if circumstances permit, that it should be introduced into Parliament under the auspices of a National Government.13. I would call special attention to the fact that, in accordance with the recommendations of the 1929 Conference, the position of the Crown is safeguarded by the recital, in the preamble of the Bill, of a &quot; Constitutional Convention &apos;&apos; that legislation affecting the Succession to the Throne and the Royal Style and Titles should require the assent of the Parliaments of all the Dominions, as well as of the United Kingdom. Detailed notes on this and the other recitals and clauses of the Bill, which explain their origin and scope, are in course of preparation.1-1. There is one point of some constitutional importance, to which special attention should be drawn, as it may give rise to discussion. It will be seen that clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill provide express safeguards for the Constitutions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but that no such safeguard is provided in the case of the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland.15.   This point was considered (except as regards Newfoundland) at the Dominion Legislation Conference, 1929, and it was in accordance with the express wishes of the representatives of Canada, Australia and New Zealand [5931] b 2
that these clauses were included in the recommendations of the Conference (paragraphs 62-66 of Cmd. 3479). It was equally in accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the Union of South Africa and of the Irish Free State that no similar clause was included in their case. (Newfoundland was not represented at the Conference.) As regards the Union and the Irish Free State, it is stated in the Report (paragraph 67 of Cmd. 3479) that &quot; The Constitutions of both countries are framed on the unitary principle. Both include complete legal powers of constitutional amendment. In the case of the Union of South Africa, the exercise Of&quot; these powers is conditioned only by the provisions of Section 152 of the South Africa Act, 1909. In the case of the Irish Free State they are exercised in accordance with the obligations undertaken by the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty signed at London on the 6th day of December, 1921.&quot;16. So far as the Union of South Africa is concerned, Section 152 of the Act of 1909 provides, briefly, that that Section and certain other sections of the Act may not be amended by ordinary legislation of the Union Parliament, but only by legislation passed by two-thirds of the total number of members of both Houses sitting together. The effect on that section of the legislation now proposed was discussed in the Union Parliament in May this year. The view was strongly expressed by the present Prime Minister of the Union (General Hertzog) that, notwithstanding the provisions of clause 2 of the proposed Statute of Westminster, the Union Parliament would not be able thereafter to repeal Section 152 of the Act of 1909 (or the other sections protected thereby, commonly called the &quot;entrenched clauses&quot;) except by the procedure laid down therein, and that the passage of the Statute would not encroach at all on the protection in Section 152. In order, however, to meet certain doubts which had been expressed, it was agreed to place this view on record as a constitutional convention in the Union, and the following words were added at the beginning of the resolution of the Union Parliament approving the proposed Statute of Westminster : &quot;On the understanding that the proposed legislation will in no way derogate from the entrenched provisions of the South Africa Act.&quot; It was made clear that this part of the resolution was not intended to be incorporated in the proposed Statute, and a statement to this effect has since been officially communicated by the Union Government to the Government here. The Parliament of the Union of South Africa has thus, in the clearest manner, taken upon itself full moral responsibility for the safeguarding of the entrenched clauses. Whether or not this undertaking has any legal basis may be a matter for argument. But it seems, at any rate, clear that there is no place for any further action to be taken by the United Kingdom Parliament in the matter.17. The position of the Irish Free State is somewhat different. It is understood that their contention is that the Colonial Laws Validity Act does not at the present time apply to the Irish Free State, and that therefore the repeal of it by Clause 2 of this Bill makes no difference so far as they are concerned. But, whatever may be the position as a matter of law, the real point of importance is the maintenance of the Articles of Agreement of 1921. The Irish Free State view is that the sanction of the Articles of Agreement rests on the very fact that they represent a, solemn agreement, and is a moral sanction superior to that imposed by any law; and that therefore it is irrelevant to consider whether the view that the Articles of Agreement are binding on them by virtue of an Imperial Act, protected by the Colonial Laws Validity Act, is correct or not. The matter was considered carefully in the light of these views at the time of the Conference of 1929 and the conclusion was reached with the full authority of the Govern-ment that, provided that the Irish Free State adhere to the obligations undertaken in 1921 (as the present Irish Free State Government have adhered throughout under &quot;circumstances of the gravest difficulty, including the assassination in 1927 of one of their principal members), it would seem unnecessary to suggest the addition of formal legal safeguards and impolitic to do so against their express request. On the other hand, it was clear then, and is equally clear now-, that if at any time the Irish Free State should deliberately intend to repudiate those obligations, they would not be deterred from doing so by the existence of an Act of Parliament.18.   If any attempt is made to secure the inclusion in the proposed Statute of Westminster of a clause designed to safeguard the Articles of Agreement,
I see no practicable alternative to resisting it on the above grounds. There can be no doubt that the inclusion of any such clause would lead to an acrimonious dispute with the Irish Free State.19. It should perhaps be added that the only point on which it has been: seriously suggested that the Irish Free State have contemplated departing from the Articles of Agreement is in respect of the question of Appeals to the Judicial Committee; and it may therefore be suggested (as, e.g., by Lord Danesfort in a recent letter to the &quot; Times&quot;) that the claim of the Irish Free State that they have the right to abolish the Appeal is tantamount to a claim that they have the right to abolish all or any of the Articles of Agreement. This does not necessarily follow, since the whole position of the Irish Free State is that the abolition of the appeal would not, in fact, be contrary to the Articles of Agreements20. The Constitution of Newfoundland does not depend, except in certain minor respects, on Statute law either of the United Kingdom or of Newfoundland, but on prerogative instruments, viz., the Letters Patent constituting the office of Governor, and Royal Instructions to the Governor. No question of safeguarding existing legislation therefore arises.21. I ought to add that there is still one point outstanding in connection with the drafting of the Bill, namely, the precise form of clause 9, which deals with the position in Australia as between the Commonwealth and the States. Pressing representations have recently been made to me by some of the State Governments expressing anxiety lest the Statute should prejudice in any way the maintenance of the existing constitutional position of the States, which, in the matters falling within their exclusive jurisdiction, are not subordinate to the Federal&quot; Government, but are in direct relations with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament. I am in urgent telegraphic communication with the Commonwealth Government (who are consulting with the State Governments), and I hope that a satisfactory agreement will shortly be reached on the basis of the clause as now drafted. This differs from that approved by the Commonwealth Parliament, and would therefore involve a further reference to that Parliament,* Note.-This point is one of some difficulty and gave rise to lengthy discussions at the secret meetings of the Imperial Conference, 1930. It depends on the interpretation of Article II of the Articles of Agreement, which provides that &apos;&apos; the position of the Irish Free State in relation to the Imperial Parliament and Government and otherwise shall be that of the Dominion of Canada, and the law, practice and constitutional usage governing the relationship of the Crown or the representative of the Crown and of the Imperial Parliament to the Dominion of Canada shall govern their relationship to the Irish Free State.&quot; The Irish Free State representatives at) the 1930 Conference developed the view that this article has a reference to &quot;status&quot; and that &quot; law, practice and constitutional usage &quot; was to be interpreted in the light of subsequent developments of &quot; Dominion status,&quot; especially, of course, the declarations of the Imperial Conference of 1926. Whatever, therefore, might have been the position in 1921, they held that constitutional usage in 1930 would mean, for example, that if Canada (and the other Dominions) wished to get rid of the right of granting special leave, it was within their &quot; constitutional right &quot; to do so, and presumably to obtain, if necessary, the co-operation of the United Kingdom Parliament for this purpose. It is clear that- at the time of the Agreement of 1921 the Parliament of Canada had no right to abolish the right to grant special leave; and the United Kingdom Law Officers in 1923 advised, as a matter of Laav, that the position of the Irish Free State under this article falls to be interpreted by the position of Canada in 1921, without reference to subsequent developments in the case of Canada. In the circumstances, the United Kingdom representatives at the 1930 Imperial Conference refused to admit that the Irish Free State had any constitutional right to abolish the right of granting,special leave without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom Parliament; they refused to promise such concurrence on the part of the United Kingdom Government, and indicated their view that such concurrence could not...be obtained from the United Kingdom Parliament. They expressed the view that, in the circumstances, attempt on the part of the Irish Free State to abolish the granting of special leave to appeal might be regarded as a breach of the Agreement of 1921; but, in order to settle this point, offered that the question should be referred to the new Commonwealth Tribunal, provision for which was included in the recommendations of the Conference or to any other acceptable form of arbitration. The Irish Free State representatives, in view of the vital importance which they attached to this question, declined to accept any form of arbitration; they indicated that they would find themselves compelled, in the absence of agreement, to take unilateral action to secure the discontinuance of appeals to the Judicial Committee.   This question still remains outstanding.    -
which meets again on the 16th September; it would, in those circumstances, be necessary to defer Parliamentary action here until after that date.22. I ask for the authority of my colleagues for the introduction of the Bill into Parliament as soon as possible in the forthcoming session, with the object of securing its passage, in accordance with the recommendation of the Imperial Conference of 1930, by the 1st December next.J.
