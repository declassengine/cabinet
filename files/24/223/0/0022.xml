September 1931.Copy No........CABTNET.Indian Financial Position.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.As my colleagues may imagine, I have been deeply concerned since I went to the-India Office with the question of Indian finance. As a basis for my discussions on the subject, I have had prepared the following memorandum. It appears to me so clear and instructive that I am circulating it to the Cabinet. I may add that the Finance Department of the India Office and the Treasury are at present discussing the whole situation, and that I intend to report more fully to the Cabinet upon the subject in the near future.S. II.India Office, 10th September 1931.Note by Financial Department, India Office.&quot;Home Charges&quot; and Remittance.The revenues of India are collected almost entirely in rupees, whereas a considerable amount, of expenditure out of these revenues is incurred externally, i.e. in sterling. In a normal year the net amount of sterling required for expenditure, exclusive of the repayment of maturing loans, is in the neighbourhood of  35 millions, these requirements being normally met by remittance through the market in the following manner: Indian exports of merchandise have in the past commonly exceeded imports by some  50 or  60 millions. This favourable &quot; visible balance of trade&quot; creates a surplus of sterling credits beyond those required to finance imports, and a proportion of the sterling so available is purchased by the Government and paid for in rupees. The whole of the sterling credits representing the excess of exports over imports of merchandise is not necessarily available for this purpose, since there are other items including exports and imports of treasure, and the so-called &quot;invisible&quot; items, e.g. investments overseas by Indians and investments of external capital in India, ocean freights, pa\rment of dividends abroad, remittance of savings abroad. &amp;c. which all enter into the final balance of payments.The world-wide slump and fall in price levels, which has hit with peculiar severity the primary producing countries such as India, has brought about a serious decrease in Indian exports, but this has been partially counterbalanced by a falling-off of imports, so that there has still been a substantial, though reduced, &quot; visible &quot; balance of trade. Normally, this should have enabled Government to continue to meet its sterling commitments, wholly or to a great extent, by remittance. In actual fact, however, the net amount of remittance which it has been possible to secure since February 1930 is nil.   The reason for this is indicated in the next paragraph.Exchange.There has arisen in India a lack of confidence in the future financial stability of Government and, in particular, a lack of confidence in the stability of the rupee exchange. There has been for a number of years an agitation, largely fostered by interested parties, aiming at the abandonment of the present exchange ratio of Is. OcL to the rupee. Until recently this was concentrated on a demand for reversion to the pre-war ratio of Is. id., but the present tendency is to press for the removal of all currency control and for the rupee to be left completely unstable. Many people believe that the new Federal Government will be unwilling or unable to maintain the existing ratio. The natural result of all this is a flight from the rupee, i.e. an attempt on the part of those whose capital or savings exist in the form of rupees to convert them into external currency. Fortunately, owing perhaps largely to. the conservatism of the Indian public, this movement has not yet attained unmanageable dimensions. If it were to become unmanageable this would involve for India an economic .catastrophe of the lirst magnitude.307      75   9.31secret.cp. 226 (31).
From the particular standpoint of the. Governments sterling requirements, the effect of the movement to export private capital from India is that the surplus sterling which would normally be available for purchase by Government, is acquired instead by private parties and Government is. able to make little or no remittance. In ease of a failure of remittance there are two methods open to the Secretary of State for obtaining funds to meet his sterling requirements : (a) by drawing on the currency reserves ; and (b) by borrowing in London. The employment of either of these courses is subject to certain limitations, explained below.Currency Reserves.The currency reserves form the baching to the Indian currency (i.e. the note issue and the silver rupee) and constitute the basis for public confidence in the stability of the currency. Thus, if the total amount of g&apos;ild and sterling held in the reserves were reduced below a certain point, this would undoubtedly create a widespread impression that it would become impossible to maintain the stability of the rupee, thus bringing about a rapid acceleration in the flight from the rupee. It is impossible to say in advance -to what point the reserves could be reduced without producing such a result, but it is quite certain that it would occur long before they were finally exhausted. Substantial inroads have already had to &quot;be made on these reserves, the gold and sterling holdings of which (including gold held in India) stand to-day at about  50 millions as compared with  70 millions in June 1929. A much more serious depletion of the reserves has only been avoided by borrowing in London on an abnormal scale.Sterling Borrowing.As regards borrowing in London, it is undesirable, and it is not the practice of the Secretary of State, to raise loans to meet ordinary current expenditure. It has been usual in the past to incur a great deal of sterling capital expenditure of a reproductive nature, eg. on railway equipment, which it has been possible to finance in part by funds remitted from India, the balance being legitimately provided by borrowings in London. Recent circumstances, however, have obliged the Secretary of State to raise loans on a scale far beyond current capital expenditure. Between January 1931 and May 1931 public issues aggregating  52,000,000 (including , 5,000,000 for conversion purposes) were made on the London market. Even if the market had continued a willing lender, it would not have been in accordance with sound financial principles or common prudence to continue such a course indefinitely. As a matter of fact, the London market and the investing public had, by May 1931, become quite alive to the position. The issue in that month of  10,000,000 Indian G per cent. Bonds of only 2-J- to 3-A- years&apos; currency had in the main to be taken up by the underwriters, and stands to-day at such a discount that the return on it is about (if per cent. British Bonds, with a similar date of maturity, would yield about 4f- per cent., and this difference illustrates the. depreciation of Indian credit. In this connection it has to be borne in mind that in January 1932 a loan of  15,000,000 is due for repayment, while sterling loans maturing within the next seven years amount in the aggregate (including the above  15,000,000) to no less than  67,000,000.Position in Jane 1931.The difficulties of the financial position, already great, were intensified and emjfliasised by the failure of the latest Bond issue and by the depreciation in lndia&apos;s credit which that failure represented. It was realised that in the event of remittance not being forthcoming, sterling borrowing being impracticable, and the sterling-currency reserves having been drawn upon to the practical limit, there would remain, as things then stood, no alternative method of providing funds to meet the obligations for which the Secretary of State for India is liable. In other words, he would be obliged to default. Not only would such a contingency be disastrous for India, but an Indian default would deal a shattering blow to British credit and would produce widespread loss and ruin in this country.It was felt that the root difficulty was. lack of confidence iii the future financial stability of Government, and particularly in the stability of exchange ; that this lack of confidence was attributable to the political situation, and that, uncertainty was likely to prevail until at least the reassembled Round-Table Conference should have accepted effective financial safeguards. The Government of India represented that the financial situation was essentially the result of political policy, and that His
Majesty&apos;s Government being responsible for that policy could not divest themselve of the responsibility for framing the comprehensive financial policy.Prime Minister&apos;s Declaration of 26th June 1931.It was felt that if stability of exchange was not maintained, there was little hope of proceeding with constitutional reforms until the finances of India had been rehabilitated, and that sooner or later His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably be faced with the choice between giving some measure of financial support to the Government of India to tide over the present period of uncertainty, and abandoning for an indefinite period the project of constitutional reforms. The matter was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and on 26th June the Prime Minister made the following announcement in reply to a question in Parliament : &quot;The financial strain on the resources of the Government of India, already great owiug to the world economic depression, has been accentuated by uncertainties which have attended the discussion of constitutional changes and more particularly the consideration of the provisions to be embodied in the new Constitution to ensure financial stability. It will not be possible to introduce the proposed constitutional changes if financial stability is not assured, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined not to allow a state of affairs to arise which might jeopardise the financial stability and good government of India fur which the Secretary of State is at present responsible. They have therefore decided that, should the need arise, they will apply to Parliament for the authority necessary to enable them to give financial support under suitable conditions to the Government of India for the purpose of maintaining the credit of the country pending the settlement of the constitutional problein.and the formulation of provisions which wall ensure the maintenance of India&apos;s credit in the future.&quot;This declaration was made subject to certain understandings, which were accepted by the Secretary of State and communicated by him to the Government of India. These were embodied in a letter from the Treasury, dated 4th July, as follows : &quot; My Lords consider it desirable to put on record that They have agreed to this declaration, which involves a very serious contingent liability upon British funds, on the following understandings, viz. :  (1) That the Government of India will use its sterling reserves freely to maintain the exchange and that Parliament cannot be approached unless and until there is serious danger of these reserves being exhausted.(2) That the Government of India will take firm and effective action with a view to restoring and maintaining a sound financial and monetary position in India both as regards making good the Budget deficiencies by economies or by increased taxation or both and as regards contracting the currency to such extent as may be proved necessary.(3) That the Treasury will be kept in close consultation as regards the practical measures to be adopted for the above purpose as well as in regard to the provisions to be embodied in the future settlement of the constitutional problen so as to ensure the maintenance of tndia&apos;s credit in the future.My- Lords will be glad to know that these understandings are acceptable to your Department and They would be glad if the Government of India could be informed of them as constituting the essential basis of the declaration.&quot;Revenue and Expenditure: Central Government.The following are the recent revenue and expenditure figures of the Government of India :  RevisedAccounts, Estimates, Budget,1929-80. 1981-31. 1981-32.Rs. crores.*      Rs. croros.       l&apos;s. crores. Revenue       - - -   132*69 123-44 I34-S7Expenditure - - -   132-12 136-12 134-86Surplus (f) or deficit (--)   + Q-27     -   -12 - OS       -   +0-01
The Budget of 1930-31 had anticipated a small surplus, but the Revised Estimates for that year disclosed a very large deficit, as shown above. When it came to the preparation of the 1931-32 Budget, it appeared that on the basis of existing taxation and expenditure the still larger deficit of Rs. 17&quot;24 crores had to be provided for. Exceptional efforts were called for to meet, this situation, and eventually measures were passed which produced a balanced budget, the gap being-bridged by savings and new taxation as follows : Rs. crores.Reduction of military expenditure (including savings from further extension of the &quot; stabilised military budget &quot; period)      2 &apos;35 Reduction of civil expenditure - - - - -      1&quot; 13Increased customs and excise duties    - 9&apos;82Increased taxes on income 3&apos;95Total   - - - 17-25* Note. Rs. 1 erore = Rs. 1,00;G0,000 (100 lukhs) = [at Is. 6d. per rupee]  750,000.In the early summer it had already become apparent that owing to the difficult economic and political conditions of the year, even the drastic measures taken would not suffice to produce a balance between revenue and expenditure. Reliable figures are not yet available, but in June the Government of India made a rough estimate that the revenue deficit might be as large as Rs. 10 crores. In addition it was thought likely that the railways would show a deterioration .of a further 10 crores which, owing to the exhaustion of the Railway Reserve Fund, would in practice have largely to be borne by general revenues.Provincial Finance.The revenue and expenditure of the Provinces is kept separate from that of the Government of India, and each Province is responsible for balancing its own budget. But the resources of the Provinces are merged with those of the Central Government,, so that the latter acts in effect as their banker, and any Province which is in deficit becomes a drain on the Ways and Means position of the Central Government. Provincial revenues, like those of the Central Government, have been seriously affected by the difficulties of the year ; and it was estimated in June, by the Government of India, that the out-turn of the year, as regards provincial finance, would show a great deterioration, roughly estimated at Rs. lO crores.The Present Emergency.The Government of India are thus faced with a probable Central deficit of, say, Ks. 20 crores (including railways), and with having to find in addition Rs. 10 crores for the Provinces; they are burdened with a floating debt in India of over Rs. 80 crores, part of which has been due to the need of drawing funds off the market as a measure of currency control, and part to the financing of their own deficits and those of the Provinces ; the sterling reserves for the maintenance of the currency standard have been materially depleted ; exchange is weak ; there has been abnormally heavy sterling borrowing, with little prospect of the renewal of borrowing in this market until conditions change; and there remains, in spite of the Prime Ministers declaration, considerable lack of confidence owing to political uncertainties.These factors make it necessary to consider special steps to restore the situation, and this need is further emphasised by the undertaking implied in the acceptance of the Treasury letter of 4th July. Measures both of retrenchment and of increased taxation are being considered, and the Treasury are being kept in consultation as to the measures to be adopted.The Government of India were at first inclined to propose a programme which involved relying this year almost entirely on retrenchment and postponing additional taxation until&quot; the introduction of the regular Budget next February. It is cpute certain, however, that retrenchment alone can only go a short way towards bridging the deficit, and the Secretary of State accordingly informed them that lie could not accpiiesce in such a programme and &quot; must ask that taxation proposals be put before the Legislature before the end of the calendar year.&quot; This would involve a choice between prolonging the ordinary Simla session of the Legislature and convening a
special session at Delhi in October or November. The Government of India have now intimated, that, if action along these lines is to be pursued, they consider the latter alternative the only feasible one, and would hold a special session at Delhi in early November.A full report on the whole situation is expected shortly from the Government of India when they have had&apos; an opportunity of considering it in the light of the four-monthly revenue estimates and of interim reports from the various retrenchment committees. The present position in respect of the principal measures, of retrench-ment and taxation respectively, which have been under consideration, is briefly sketched in the following two paragraphs.Retrenchment.Military. It is recognised that the safety of India is the overriding consideration. The Army authorities have accpiiesced in proposals saving Rs. 107 lakhs. In addition cuts none of which the military are yet reported to have recognised as possible -have been under investigation, totalling approximately Rs. 16S lakhs; and non-committal reference has been made to the possibility of cutting out all provision for the &quot; extraordinary charges for re-equipment, &amp;c,&quot; totalling Rs. .175 lakhs.Railways.-Certain changes in rates have already been adopted earlier in the year. Any general raising of goods rates at the present time is thought by the Government of India to be impossible. It seems probable that the most important saving that can be hoped for is by application to the railways of any cuts in pay adopted for Government servants generally.Posts and Telegraphs. Some extra charges of a minor nature have been imposed, and others which do not require legislation are being considered. Small increases in letter and postcard rates, for which legislation is required, would produce about Rs. 78 lakhs per annum, and the Secretary of State has urged that these changes should be included in the comprehensive scheme.Civil Departments. Retrenchment schemes are under consideration by the Government of India which may produce as much as Rs. 250 lakhs per annum. These, it is stated, will involve huge dismissals of staff, including some for whom the Secretary of State is responsible.Cuts in Pay. The benefit from any- general reduction in salaries would accrue mainly to the Provincial Governments ; but the Central Government would obtain some pecuniary saving by this means, and it has also been urged that the passage of unpalatable measures of taxation, &amp;c, may be smoothed if they are coupled with a reduction in the pay of the higher officials in particular. The question of reductions in the pay of the Services is fully discussed in a separate note which is being prepared by the Services and General Department. It is sufficient to remark here that it would be scarcely practicable to reduce the pay of subordinate staffs while leaving untouched that of the classes of higher-paid officials whose remuneration is protected by Statute, and that any question of reducing the pay of the protected Services brings in (1) the doubt whether Parliament would take the action required, and (2) the risk that there would be a rush of retirements, resulting in paralysis of the administration. The Government of India have not yet made a definite recom-mendation, beyond asking that a legislative measure should be got ready in case of need ; but the Finance Member has made it clear that in his view any comprehensive scheme for dealing with the present situation must include general reductions in the pay of the Services. The alternative which has been under examination is a general increase in the rates of taxes on income, which would hit the higher-paid officials in common with the rest of the community coupled with actual reductions of pay for the lower-paid Government servants not affected by income-tax. The pay of police and certain other of the lowest-paid grades would probably in any case have to be left untouched.General. As regards Public Works, nothing more was included in the Budget than grants for works in progress, and the position is again under review. The Hoover plan should result in a relief to revenue of Rs. 40 lakhs. It would be possible to cut out the optional portion of the provision for reduction and avoidance of debt amounting to Rs. 265 lakhs, but this, which is a measure of the same nature as raiding the Sinking Fund, while it would produce an apparent improvement in the Revenue Budget, would do nothing really to alleviate the position.307 - b
Provincial Governments. A Conference with the Finance Members of - the Provinces was held in May. Retrenchment campaigns are proceeding in all Provinces, and the Central Government are beeping in touch with developments.Taxation.Income-tax. The possibility of enhancing the rates of tax is referred to above. Apart from the advantages of this as an expedient for dealing with the difficulties involved in reducing the pay of the protected services, the measure should in itself produce a substantial sum. As a separate and additional measure, the question has been considered of reducing the minimum of incomes liable to tax. This would apparently produce only about Rs. 17 lakhs net, but even so may be worth considering.Salt. A potential increase in the salt tax has been generally regarded as a &quot;tax reserve&quot; for emergencies, and as such it would seem reasonable to call upon it at the present crisis. It is, however, of course, highly controversial. The Secretary of State has informed the Government of India: &quot;I see no alternative to a substantial enhancement of the salt duty. I realise that this proposal will excite intense opposition, which is an element we should have to consider, but when heavy sacrifices are being called for from the upper and middle classes it might have to be accepted.&quot;Apart from the question of raising the rate of tax, steps are being taken to abolish the salt credit system. This should result in additional revenue of Rs. 1 crore this year and Rs. I crore in 1932-3. If, in addition, the tax were doubled, a further Rs. 112 lakhs might be anticipated this year and as much as Rs. 5 or 6 crores next year.Customs and Excise. The general level of Customs duties is already high, and the Government of India feel that in most directions the economic limit has been reached. They are, however, considering the possibility of new or additional duties on dyes, raw cotton, cotton yarn, artificial silk yarn and piece-goods. The Customs and Excise duties on kerosene and motor spirit were increased in the last Budget, but the&apos;Secretary of State has suggested that a further increase should be considered.The Government of India have expressed apprehensions as to the attitude of the Legislature to measures involving increased taxation. In this connection the Secretary of State, in a telegram dated 31st July, observed : &quot;In dealing with the question of taxation and other measures for increasing revenue, while it is of the highest importance to do everything possible to cany the Legislature with us, the mere opposition of the Legislature would not necessarily preclude us from adopting measures which in this emergency we consider essential.&quot;India Office, 2nd September 1931.
