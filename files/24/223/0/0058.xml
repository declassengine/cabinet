(TIiIrl D0GUL3?7:p IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS, BRJ.TANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S CtOVERNMENT)346SECRET,CP.  265 (81). COPY NC     ^CABINS T.PI 6ARMAME NT s    PROCEDURE..Note by the Seeretary.I- The question of Disarmament was last raised in cabinet on the 22nd September (Cabinet 62 (31) Conclusion 5) but was postponed pending the circulation of certain further memoranda,,2. If the transaction of ordinary Government businesshad not been interrupted by a General Election,  the Cabinet would shortly have been in a position to discuss the papers on the Cabinet Agenda as well as the following papers, which will soon be circulated, dealing with various aspects of the Disarmament question -(a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(CP.  239 (31)).(b) A Report on the French Memorandum from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.(CP. 213 (31)),(c) A Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the practicability of a distinction between offensive and defensive armaments.(CP.  253  (31)).(d) A Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty on the Limitation of Naval Armaments.(CP.  258 (31)).(e) A Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff on the Limitation of Seaborne Air Forces.(CP, 259 (31)).(f) A Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff on the application of Budgetary Limitation to Air Forces.(CP. 254 (51)).
(g)   A Memorandum &quot;by the Chief of the Air Staffon the application of Horse Power Limitation to Air Forces.(CnPc  265 (31)).3o It would appear desirable to press on with thedepartmental preparations for the Disarmament Conference of next February.     The best course with a view to facilitating the co-ordination of their work, might be to establish some machinery to handle the preparatory business, so that, whenthe Cabinet are able to give the matter fuller consideration,the problems can be presented to them in concrete form,There is in existence a Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence, composed as follows -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, (Chairman) The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty,,The Financial Secretary to the War Office.The Under Secretary of State for Air.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs. The Rt. Hon. Viscount Cecil of Chelwood, K.C. The Australian Liaison Officer in London for external Affairs, The High Commissioner for Hew Zealand, The High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa.It will be noticed that all the Dominions, except Canada, and the Irish Free State are already represented. The late High Commissioner for the Irish Free State was a member, but his successor has not ;/et been nominated to serve on-this Sub-Committee.       There would be no difficulty in arranging for a Vice-Chairman in case the Secretary of State is too busy to attend all the meetings.The terms of reference of the Sub-Committee are -&quot;To study the various problems which will arise in the near future in connection with proposals for naval,  land and air disarmament- and to make such recommendations as may be required from time to time through the Committee of Imperial Defence to the Cabinet.&quot;One course open to the Cabinet would be to entrust
tlie above Sub-Committee with the work of preliminarypreparation for the Disarmament Conference and to refer to it all Disarmament questions now awaiting consideration.(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY. Secretary.  Cabinet.2, &quot;,7hi t eha 11 Gar dens, S. W. 1. 6th October,  193lo
