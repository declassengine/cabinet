HANKEY,Secretary^, Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.,, September 15th,  1931.
GBSNERAL POoT OFFICE,  LONDON,  .C.1. 11th September, 1931.Dear Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer,I understand from Sir Maurice Hankey that I am to report to you the result of my negotiations on behalf of the Govern--ment with the British Broadcasting Company.The task was not made easier by the fact that the May Committee omitted to invite evidence from the. B.B. C., who claim that they could, if they had been asked, have produced facts and figures which might have caused the Committee to modify their recommendations.The May Committee recommendations envisaged a large saving by the granting of a Government guarantee of their capital expenditure in order to enable them to borrow over an extended period of years.      They also recommended an alteration of the present agreement fixing the percentages of the revenue received from -wireless licences by the State and the B.B.C  respectively.May I say, at the outset, that I could not see my way to support either of these proposals. Indeed I understand that the Treasury itself takes exception to the proposal.; involving legislation, for guaranteeing the loans raised by the 3.B.C,, in connection with their capital developments, at any rate at present. This matter will therefore be left open for future consideration.Accordingly I was compelled to seek other alternatives. I was confronted at the outset by the fact that it was only a few weeks ago that the B.B,C. had approached you with regard to their project for commencing Empire Broadcasting;, involving a capital expenditure of  40,000, and an annual charge of
9 9 9 640anything up to a maximum of  42,000.      This project for long distance short-wave broadcasting at hours suitable for reception in Canada, South Africa and India would require three separate transmissions.      In view of similar developments of by other countries, notably Russia and Holland, I understand you agreed that, now that the preliminary scientific and technical difficulties have been overcome,  the provision of an Empire Broadcasting service should not be further delayed, I need hardly say that, in my opinion, this new development is of the utmost political as well as commercial importance to this country, and is-  if I may say so,  long overdue.    I made it clear, therefore, that I should not be a very willing partner in any idea that this new development should he further postponed.After a series of discussions between Mr.Whitley and Sir John Eeifch on behalf of the B.B.C.  and officers of my department and myself on behalf cf the Government, the B.E.C are willing to forego,  cut of their proportion of the revenue from wireless licences under the scale new in force,  50,000 by March 31st,  1932, and a further  150,000 in the course of the following financial year 1932-53.They also assure me that they will not postpone their intended commencement of Overseas Broadcasting, and will not ash for additional revenues to finance it.I should like to emphasize my opinion that the B.B.C. have acted generously in making this offer, and that it is fully as much as they can fairly be asked to surrender wlth-out serious reductions of programmes or efficiency. Indeed the finding of  200,000 in cash and  the commencement of Overseas broadcasting, without additional revenue or entended borrowing.
will strain their resources very considerably, in view of the various commitments already entered upon and of certain further outlays which cannot be deferred without detriment to the existing standard of their service.    This is also the opinion of my adviser who at my request went more closely into detailed figures with the officers of the 3-b..I understand that you approve this offer and I recommend its acceptance by the Government-    I should not feel justified in pressing the BcB,C. to do more, as any serious diminution of the quality or amount of their programmes or reduction in the area, of satisfactory reception might well lead to a falling off of licences.I understand from Mr. Whitley that their offer to the Government will in any case involve a reduction of the emoluments of the staff of the Corporation,Yours sincerely,(Signed) Wo  OE&amp;oSBY-GORE.The Right Hon .Philip Snowden , M*P. ,Chancellor of the Exchequer.
TEEASUHY CHAMBERS .14th September, 1931,Dear Postmaster-General,I am very much obliged tc you for your letter of the 11th September telling me the result of your negotiations on behalf of the Government with the British Broadcasting Corporation.      Please let me congratulate you most warmly on the success of your efforts *      I agree with you in thinking that the offer mads by the B.B-.C as a result of your discussions with them is a generous one,  and I shall give my full support to your recommendation that it should be accepted by the Government.I am sending a copy of your letter end of this reply tc Sir Maurice Hankey for the information of the Cabinet oYours sincerely,(Signed) PHILIP SKQWDEH^The Eight Hon.
