Memorandum by the Minister of Labour^I circulate herewith for approval (subject to minor and drafting amendments) a draft of the above-mentioned Order in Council to be made under the Economy Act and an Explanatory Memorandum.

9 Q f d *J iTRANSIT! OKAIi    PAYilEKTS.    DRAgT    OEDSR    INCOUNCIL3EXPLANATORY   MHviORAi-iDUM.1.      The following paragraphs describe in outline the principles and procedure laid down by the draft Order in Council for the payment of transitional payments.2.      As from 2nd November, 1931,   the Order abolishes transitional benefit and provides also that a person who has received 26 weeks benefit in a benefit year shall be ineligible for benefit until a new benefit year has commenced and he has paid ten contributions since the last of the 26 weeks of benefit.      The persons concerned may however claim transitional payment (which will not exceed the ordinary rate of benefit as a. maximum)  if they are in need of assistance while unemployed. In order to be eligible for such payments they must satisfy the conditions now applying to transitional benefit and must prove their need to the satisfaction of the Public Assistance Authori ty.3o     Applications for transitional payment will be made at the Employment Exchange, and will then be passed to the Public Assistance Authority in the area.    The Authority will investi-gate the circumstances of the applicant in the same way as they would, investigate them in the case of an able-bodied applicant for public assistance.    In the majority of cases this will probably mean a visit by the relieving officer tc the house of the applicant,  as is the practice in the case of public assistance, and it will also mean the interview of applicants by public Assistance Committees, so far as this is judged necessary or advisable,
4.     After investigating the needs of the applicant, the Public Assistance Authority will determine the amount of the transitional payment (if any)  that should be made, on the same standard as they would apply to one of their own cases, subject to the appropriate rate of benefit as a maximum,.    The amount so determined will be paid in cash, and paid at the Employment Exchange;    there will be no assessment in kind,, or partly in kind and partly in cash, and no conditions as to test work, relief on loan etc. can be imposed by the Public Assistance Authority in respect of the receipt of transitional payment.    Nor, of course, will any of tie disqualify,cations e.g. from service on a Local Authority,   or  the operation of the Law of Settlement, which may follow upon the receipt of poor relief, apply to recipients of transitional payments because of those payments,,5.      The Public Assistance Authority in each area will take into account everything which they would take into account in one of their own cases, and to such extent as is their present practice.    The existing practice of Authorities varies considerably, not only from area to area, but also according to the circumstances and needs of each case.     Any departure from the principle of leaving the assessment of need and the method of making it in the hands of the Local Authority would quickly involve the Minister of Labour in the issue of regulations having far-reaching effects upon the administra-tion of Public Assistance, and in the creation of a &apos;national scale of maintenance&apos;  and a second Poor Law.    It is proposed in this matter that Public Assistance Authorities should followoc o
the principles laid down in January 1930 by the lateMinister of Health in a circular to Local Authorities, of whichthe relevant paragraphs read:&quot;4.    In assessing the amount of relief to be afforded the general principle is that income and means from every source available to the household must be taken into account,  subject to the statutory exceptions contained in section 75 of the Poor Law Act,  1937.    It should, however, be remembered that where certain classes of income are concerned,  such, for example,  as disability pensions or blind pensions, the disability in respect of which the pension has been awarded may be such as to call for a greater measure of assistance than would normally be appropriate.Again,  it is proper that the earnings of widows and children should be taken into account when relief is assessed, but it would be reasonable not.to deduct the whole amount of such earnings from the relief which would have been afforded had the earnings not existed. 1((The reference    to section 76 of the Poor Lav; Act is to deductions in respect of    National Health Insurance payments or sick pay from a friendly society).6.      The cost of transitional payments will not fall upon theLocal Authorities but upon the Exchequer, and any additionalapproved expenditure for the extra work falling upon theAuthorities will be reimbursed to them from the Exchequer,,7.      Requests have been made in the House of Commons and willprobably be made by some Local Authorities that applicants fortransittonal payments.should be interviewed by the PublicAssistance Authorities at the Exchange and.not at the usual  ....-offices of the Public Assistance Authority.    For the present,ihis is impracticable in most of the big areas;    the pressure;   the Live Register upon the premises of the Exchanges is muchLoo.- heavy.      It will be for the Public Assistance Authority todecide,  subject to reasonable economy, where the interviewingof applicants is to take place.    If they wish    the interviewingto take place elsewhere than at their usual offices (whether
because these offices form part of the Poor Law Institution, or for some reason of administrative convenience) they will be permitted to use the Exchange premises if accommodation is available there or, failing this,  to take other premises. 8.      It is contemplated that the procedure will come into operation as from tho 2nd November.    That will be the first day upon which the Public Assistance Authorities will beauthorised to consider  the circumstances of an applicant, and transiticna.1 payments Will first be made at the next appropriate day after the 2nd November.,    Provision is made for a transitory period of two months after that date (with power to e xtend for a further two months in any area) for the examination of tho large number of applications that will have to be considered at the outset;    during this period transitional payments at the rate of benefit will be made where no assessment has yet been received.    For later stages provision is made for interim determination (and for payment for six days even without an interim determination), in order that no applicant may fail to obtain payment because the ordinary machinery has not operated. Probably an appreciable proportion of those now on transitional benefit and those likely to be affected by the 26 weeks rule will not in practice apply for transitional payments, some because they object to the inquiries into their circumstances,  others because they know that their circumstances are such that they would not be able to pass the test of need.      This will apply particularly to married
womenj and young men and girls living at home.    Such classes are, or course, not disqualified in any way from transitional payments, if they need them.9.      Power is also taken to deal with the case of an Authority which does not or does not  efficiently     carry out the duties imposed upon it.    Such a power would he exceed-ingly troublesome to operate end it Is hoped that it will not have to be used, but it is clearly necessary to have such a power.    If the power has to be used the Minister of Laboxir will have to make special arrangements in the area concerned.    These will n -t involve the supersession of the Public Assistance Authority in its own functions, but the transfer of the limited agency functions imposed under the Order from it zo some other persons-    These persons will have the same functions in respect to transitional payments as the public Assistance Authority.In CP. 211 (31)  attention was called to the necessity for providing safeguards in the scheme, because the Authorities will be assessing payments of money which they will not themselves have to find, subject of course to the maximum of the appropriate benefit.Under the Order the Authority is required to deal with applications for transitional payments in the same way as it deals v/ith applications for public assistance from able-bodied persons.    Apart from methods of administrative pressure, exercised mainly through the inspectors of the Ministry of Health,  the only remedy against a troublesome or inefficient Authority is to supersede it,  if it does not carry out its duties (i.e.  in practice flagrantly fails to do so) or performs them inefficiently.      The Minister is not required,
or empowered, to examine whether the existing standards of public assistance are extravagant or harsh.    The dilemma that would he created if wider powers were granted is obvious, and on the whole the limitation is preferable.    But the Minister of Labour will,  of course, be exposed to criticism because he cannot call upon an Authority to adopt a more generous standard; nor can he protect his expenditure from an Authority that has an unnecessarily lavish standard. 10.    The discussions with the representatives and officials of the Public Assistance Authorities suggest that co-operation will be forthcoming, and that a practicable system will emerge from experience.u o
