-    264(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government SECRET.C.p.   244. CAB  I N E T. COPY NO.       /  .GOVERNMENT INFORMATION FOR THE GUIDANCE OF THEFOREIGN PRESS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-.I am anxious to draw the attention of my colleagues to the great importance which I attach at the present time, when the daily quotation of the exchange value of the pound depends so directly on the trend of opinion in the different foreign countries, to every assistance being afforded to the foreign press correspondents in London with a view to their proper guidance as regards any developments which may take place in this country.In the course of an interview which I accorded to the foreign press correspondents in London on September 22nd, several of them drew my attention to the subject. They referred in particular to the accusation that it was reports sent by the foreign correspondents in London regarding the unrest in the Navy that had created panic abroad and had aggravated financial difficulties here. The correspondents pointed out that they rather resented this accusation, as the trouble lay in the difficulties they encountered in receiving definite information and official guidance.     They emphasized the fact that they were anxious as a body to avoid sending any reports from London likely to add to the complications of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but insisted that in order to ensure this they must receive proper official assistance.They .&apos;..
They referred to the help which they always receive in regard to foreign affairs from the News Department of the Foreign Office and suggested that it would meet their point of view if the activities of that Department could he extended to cover all tranches of the Administration; in other words that the Foreign Office Press Department should he transformed into something in the nature of a Government central press bureau.I am impressed hy the views expressed hy the foreign press correspondents.     In my view it is of the utmost importance during the next few months to do every-thing we can to control the reports which are sent from this country to the press abroad, hut I do not feel that the actual suggestion made hy the foreign correspondents is either desirable or practicable.     I do not think it desirable that the Foreign Office should attempt to give guidance to foreign correspondents on matters which lie outside its province and I consider that the arrangement, by which each Department of the administration informs the British and foreign press of matters which concern it, should be continued.     At the same time, I feel that the point made by the correspondents should be further examined and that each Department should be requested to consider what improvements can be made to provide such publicity facilities as will meet the wishes of the foreign correspondents.I am aware that most Government Departments have already certain arrangements for publicity, but in view of the representations now made to me, it is evident that the foreign correspondents do not feel satisfied that they are always received with the sympathy and understanding ...
understanding necessary if they are to interpret correctly our internal problems.     The News Department of the Foreign Office, with their closer contacts with the foreign press, are only too ready to provide informa-tion to other Departments about foreign correspondents in London and the standing of their newspapers.     I would suggest that on occasions when a foreign cor-respondent wishes to make special enquiries on some matter falling within the province of some other Government Department, he should apply in the first instance to the Foreign Office and state the nature of his enquiry.     The Foreign Office could then effect an introduction for him to the competent officer of the Department concerned, thereby assisting in any way possible both the Department and the journalist. It is evident that, in present circumstances, the Treasury will prove to be the Department to which such introductions will be most frequently requested.I suggest that each Department should give the subject immediate consideration.(Signed)      HEADING.25th September, 1931.
