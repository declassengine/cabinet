In the first, the proposals of His Majesty * sGovernment to secure reductions of expenditure areexplained and a summary of their effect is given.

They may,however,  continue to receive assistance in cash at the same rate as under the Insurance Scheme if they shew that they arein need of it.      Payment will be made at the Employment I   Exchange and the recipients will attend there to prove I   unemployment as at present.    The amounts so paid will be aeha r ge &quot;on the Exchequer .The procedure will be that when unemployed persons
come to the end of their insurance benefit and desire to claim further assistance their claims will be referred to the Public Assistance Authority for the district to assess their need,  and to determine the amount payable  (not exceeding their rates of ordinary benefit)-      The determination of the Authority will be final.The estimated saving under this head is 110,000.000,,I (5)    provision will be made ifor dealing with the entitlement to insurance benefit in cases in which persons with broken periods of employment and unemployment drtrw^^t^slfl^tial wages.&apos;    There are not sufficient dat^ifor estimating the saving under this head, $which, however will not be large in amount * V.I
SbASIAKY OP UM^employment  INSURANCE EINaNCE.On the basis of the continued payment of Benefit  (including Transitional Benefit)  at the rates and on the conditions at present in force, and with an average live register of 3,000,000, the financial position of Unemployment Insurance in 1932-33, apart from economies would he approximately as follows  :- .Benefit at existing rates 130,500,000Interest on debt at  115,000,000 5,700,000Administration __7 ,100,000Total expenditure 145,300,000Towards this sum Employers and employed persons would contribute at existing rates 28,500,OOPSum to be provided by Exchequer lu:-hff feejaioaujag,        -**  -- 114,800,000The savings proposed to bo effected,  includingthe removal of anomalies by regulations underthe Unemployment  Insurance  (No,  3)  Act,  1931,will reduce this  expenditure as follows  :-pRemoval of Anomalies,  under theAct  of 1931, 5,000,000Needs test for transitional payments administeredAg^^*;a^jS3^AAitiiQ^i^&apos;&quot;e s 10,000,000Reduction in rates of benefit          12,800,000              .W 25,600,000r 89,000,000Increase in Contributions ofEmployers &amp; Employed Persons 10,OOP,000Leaving as a cnarge on theExchequer in 1932-33, after allowing for economies 7 9.OOP,000This charge would be made up of three partsas follows  :-Exchequer contribution on  .the  1Equal Thirds&quot; basis.        19,300,000Deficiency grant,  being the*-*.......&quot;sum re&apos;qu iredtp.... b a 1 anq,e,..t.heUnemployment Fund for tneTransitional Payments 37 , 500 .000 _^.,.,r.*,*&apos;-&quot;&quot;:y:---v.-.,,-79, 000, 000The saving to the Exchequer is thus  114,600,000 minus  79,000,000, (or  35,800,000.    /
ROAD PDgD.The expenditure from the Road Fund in 1932 was estimated (if existing policies remained unaltered) as  27,865,000 plus the general exchequer contributions paid under the Derating Scheme from the Road Fund.      This sum of  27,865,000 will he reduced to a round figure of  20,000,000 -a saving of  7,865 ,000 .It was estimated that the Road Fund would have required a loan from the Exchequer next year of  10,000,000 to enable it to meet its obligations, and under existing practice, the Exchequer would have itself borrowed this  10,000,000 in order to lend it to the Road Fund.      The sum required from the Exchequer will now be reduced to  2,135,000 and this sum will not be borrowed       the Exchequer but will &apos;be provided out of a vote of Parliament.It is intended, also, that in the current year the sum which the Road Fund will require will he provided by a Vote and not borrowed by the Exchequer.In order to secure the reduction of Expenditure which is essential in the altered financial circumstances new schemes must, of course, be postponed and many schemes in progress slowed down or curtailed ^arsffyTSr^S^-^s^ee^er?&quot;
MINISTRY OF Hg^LTII ANb iKPART-:Et&apos;iT  OR BHA.LTH FOR SCOTLAND,.The savings to be secure a on these votes will amount to about  1,250,000 in a full year and. to about  475,000 in the remainder of the financial year 1931/52cNational Health Insurance.Remuneration of Insurance Doc tors, and Chemists.,Since the 1st January, 1924,  the remuneration of insurance doctors has been at the rate of 9s,0do a year for each insured person included in a doctor&apos;s list.It is proposed that the rate of 9s,0dc,  should, from the 1st October-  3.931be made subject to a deduction of one-ninth; and that the product of this deduction should be applied towards meeting expenses of administration of the National Health Insurance Acts which are now met out of moneys provided by Parliament.The amount which will be realised by this percentage deduction is estimated for Great Britain at  425 ,,000 in the financial year ending on the 51st March, 1932,  and at  850,000 in a full year0A similar percentage deduction wil3. also be made as from 1st October, 1951, from the remuneration at present payable to insurance chemists and the sum realised by this deduction will also be applied towards meeting the expenses o: Health Insurance administration at present borne by the Exchequer,.      The sum which will be realised by this deduction-is estimated to amount to about  50,000 in the financial year 1931/32 and to about  120s000 in a full year,  subject so far as England and &quot;Vales are concerned to the reconsideration of the present contract with the chemists which expires in
Exchequer Grant to the National Health Insurance Central FundnIt is proposed to withdraw the grant of  142,000 per annum which would he payable to the Central Fund as from 1st January 1932 under the provisions of section 68 of the National Health Insurance Act 1924. The Government are, however,  anxious that this Fund, which was constituted for the purpose of assisting Approved Societies who are found to be in difficulties on valuation, should be in no way weakened.      They propose therefore that the Health Insurance part of the contributions payable by the employers of insured persons over 65 years of age which at the present time is paid into the Pensions Account under the Widows1, Orphans&apos;  and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, should be transferred to the Central Fund.    The sum which will be transferred, amounts approximately to  300,000 a year. Mi s cellaneous.It is expected that there will be some slowing down of *h^rar^ld--expaiisdrorr--of^hous-in-g expenditure as the result of the measures for regulating development of expenditure which are being taken by the local authorities.    It is  estimated that the savings on this account will amount to about  150,000,
Reductions of Salaries of hindstere /and, Members of Parliament, Judges; Civil Servants and Members of the Fighting ServicedThe Government propose that during the period of the present emergency all ministerial salaries shall be reduced;.- by 20% on salaries of  5,000 a year and over, by 10/S on salaries of  2 ,,000 a year and ever ? but less than  5,000 a year, by on salaries of  1,000 a year and overbut less than  2,000 a year?    and that the allowances now-payable to members of the House of Commons shall be reduced hy 5%\They propose further that abatements on the same graduated scale - 10% or 20?$ as the case may he - shall be made from the salaries of Judges and of officers of the four Crown Services whose substantive pay is  2,000 a year or more.With regard to the remuneration of members of the Crown Services whose pay is less than  2,000 a year the Government have decided to follow throughout the recommendations of the Committee on National ExpenditureIn the case of the Civi3. Service, the index on which cost of living bonus is based fell by 10 points on the revision made on 1st ^S^tembe^-^S&amp;O and by a further 5 points on the revision made on 1st September 1931,  these reductions involving a total saving to the Exchequer at the rate of  4,800,000 a year, of which the most recent revision accounts for a saving at theVrate of  1,600,000&apos;&quot;&quot;a&quot;year0 )In the case of the Fighting Services, the changes to be made will take effect as from 1st October and are briefly as follows:-(i) Steps will be taken through the normal negotiating machinery to review a pre-ferential bonus of fx&apos;om 2/- to 4/-- a
week which has &quot;been paid in the Hoyal Poet-yards and. Ordnance Factories since 1924t(11) New rates oi pay, introduced in IS25for the men and lower ranks of officers in the services, were not then applied to the existing personnels The 1025 rates will now he applied to all personnel, (iii) Deductions made from tiis pay and pensions of officers in respect of the fall in cost of living since 1919 will be revised and brought into harmony with, the current cost of living Index,,      The deduction fromthe 1st October 1931 will be based on the average of the index figures published for the six months let March to Slat August 1931? and will bo llg instead of  h the G70 now in forcec (iv) The pension rates cf men in. the Services will in future be determined by T,he Scheme in force at the date when the man. enters upon his final engagement which qualifies him for pension,      lien who before the 1st October-- 1931, had entered upon their final engagements to complete time for pension will be entitled to reckon service prior to that date on the rates introduced in 1919cThe total savings in. 1332 compared with the estimates for 1931 arising from the reductions of salaries of Ministers, Members cf Parliament, Judges, Civil Servants and Members of the Piglai-illg Services are estimated to be  4,054,000,,
A total reduction, including the reductions in pay already specified; will be made in the Estimates for the Fighting Services in 1952 cf  8,600?COO.The Service Departments will secure savings on services other than pay and pensions to the amount of approximately  &amp; - millions.      They will secure these reductions in ways which will have the least effect on the efficiency of the Services but it must be appreciated that in view of the extensive reductions which the Services have made in recent year a $. these further re due-tiens can only be secured with great difficulty and many cf the reductions made will not be of a continuing characters-Poll bey(A paragraph on Police Savings will be inserted later when the Home Office and Scottish Office have seen the Representative Bodies), \\\\\N\X\\\\\\
Education.i total saving of  9.4 millions in a full year will be made in the expenditure of the Board of  Education *(i)    Grants in respect of the salaries of teachers will he calculated on the assumption that as from 1st October , 1931.. there is a deduction from the e-ggregate salary bill.The May Committee recommended that such deduction should be 204. The Government has carefully considered the position and has reached the conclusion that the deduction should be(ii)    The Grant in respect of elementary teachers&apos; salaries is 60%.    This grant will now be reduced to 50$* hut as this reduction of percentage would, notwithstanding the reduction of salaries; Increase the salary charge borne by local authorities, adjustment will be made elsewhere in the grant formula with the object of meeting this difficulty(iil)&quot;  The present SGyo minimum limit of grant for elementary education will be abolished.(iv)    In addition to the above specific measures, by a general slowing down of the service and other economy measures the increase in the Education Estimates in 1932 compared with 1931, which would other/vise have been  2,250,000, wilT he restricted to  1,000,000 - a reduction of  1 /250,000..The reductions of expenditure made in England and Yvales will Involve automatically a. reduction of li/SO ofthe savings in the grants made for Education in Scotland.The financial effect in the first full year of the proposals which have been adopted is as follows;-

It is estimated that the savings in thecurrent year will be approximately  3.5 million in England and Wales and  .5 million in Scotland.University Grants. The Vote for grants to Universities and Colleges will be reduced in 1932 by  150^.000.      The above sum of  150.000 represents an accumulated balance which would normally be used for norr-racurront purposes and can be withdrawn without reducing the annual recurrent grants to any of the University institutions.
1 0 1lotMinigt 12y__0_f__4.gri cult ure and Pi she r i e s.The provision for 1932 will be reduced by  580,000.        This T7.H1 involve the discontinuance of grants to landowners for field drainage and water supply schemes,  a reduction in the sums available for the assistance of Drainage Authorities and Catchment Boards, the postponement of new developments in agricultural research, and a reduction in the scale of grants to local Authorities for the provision of agricultural education.        Expenditure on National murk publicity will be reduced,  and it will be necessary to postpone the Government grant towards the cost of reconstructing the Royal Veterinary College.It is not proposed to ask iarliament to vote a Supplementary Estimate this year for the purposes of the Agricultural land (Utilisation) Act,  and no provision will be made in 1952 for the purposes of this Act.On the Fisheries side it will be impossible to include provision in 1932 for maintaining the new Fisheries Research ship.      The possibility of placing this ship at the disposal of the industry for research purposes is being examined.Agriculture  (Scotland). A. saving of  75,000 will be made in the case of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland on somewhat similar lines.Fprestry.The expenditure of the Forestry Commission in 1932 will be reduced by  478,000.        This reduction will be secured by restricting afforestation work and acquisitions and by suspending the provision of forest workers holdings. Care will be taken that the Commissioners1 nurseries of young plants are not prejudiced.
Empire Marketing; Board.The grant to the Enpire Marketing Board will he reduced next year by  250,000*      This reduction is&quot;-saw&quot;&quot;&quot;1&quot;additional to savings which will he secured on the gross Votes for,, the. Agriculture Departments in respect of services now financed by grants made by the Board through those Totes.Colonial Development Fund.The grant to the Colonial Development Fund will be restricted to  750,000 next year  (saving  250,000). The Advisory Committee will be invited to concentrate their recommendations on schemes which will give the greatest and speediest benefit to this country.
UNT3IPL0YMi2?T GRANTS.As decided &quot;by the late Government the last date for applications &quot;by Local Authorities to theUnemployment Grants Committee for grants towardsm^^ff^^y^^^ Muteschemes of work for the relief of unemployment was50th June, 19.31,  though in exceptional  circumstances applications after that date in respect of work to begin before 31st December, 1931, are being entertain provided that good reason is shown why earlier application could not be made.    There are at present approximately 900 applications outstanding of an estimated value of about  14,0003000,      The rates of grant are being reduced and,  except in regard to schemes for which a grant has already been definitely promised., the revised rates will in no case exceed25 per cent,  of the cost of the scheme.    It isanticipated on this basis that only schemes of the highest economic value will be proceeded with,  and this factor coupled with the reduction in the rates of grant will result in ah estimated saving to the Exchequer of  500,000 in 1932/5 as compared with the amount which it would have been necessary to provide had existing rates  of grants been continued.
The Treasury has issusd a circular to GovernmentDepartments calling lor a stringent, review of their expenditure with a view to supplementing by further***** fc^j^S^economies,  the specific decisions of the Governmenton major issues.Amongst other economies, a saving of  250,000 \ will be obtained in 1932 by a slowing down of the I work of Land Valuation.It is expected that this review of miscellaneous economies will produce a total of savings next year of  2,500,000.
