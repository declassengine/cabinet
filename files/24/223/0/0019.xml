Memorandum on the Measures proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure Reductions in National Expenditure.The following memorandum is divided into two parts. In the first, the proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure reductions of expenditure are explained and a. summary of their effect is given. In the second, the points which require legislation in connection with these economies are set out and explanation given of the action-which will be taken under the powers squght in the National Economy Bill.Summary of Effect of the Measures foe Reduction of National Expenditure explained in the Succeeding Paragraphs.It is intended that the economies in pay, &amp;c, shall take effect from the 1st October, 1931. Effect will be given to the other economy measures at the earliest possible dates and consequently, in addition to the savings shown below for 1932, there will also be a substantial saving in the current financial year. The exact figure cannot be precisely estimated, but it is anticipated that it will bo some  22,000,000.   The full saving for 1932 is as follows :-Saving in 1932.Reductions   of   Salaries, of  Ministers,   Members   of   Parliament,   Judges, Civil Servants and Members of theDefence Services     ...       ...... 4,534,000Defence Services (in addition to reduc-tions   of   3,(514,000  in   pay   and pensions)............. 5,000,000Education (Great Britain)        ..... 10,300,000Ministry of Health and Scottish Depart-ment of Health       ...       ...... 1,250,000Police (Great Britain)   ......      ... 500,000University Grants......... 150,000Agriculture (Great Britain)      ...       ... 655,000Forestry................ 478,000Empire Marketing Board        ...... 250,000Colonial Development Fund    ...... 250,000Unemployment Grants ...      ...      ... 500,000Unemployment Insurance (a) Reduction of  expenditure fromthe Unemployment Fund   ...      25,800,000(b) Increased income of the unemployment-ployment Fund from contri-butions   of   employers   and workmen      .:.   &apos;   ...      ... 10,000,000Road Fund        ...      ......... 7,865,000.--     Miscellaneous     ...      ...      ...     &quot;... 2,500,000Total70,032,000
Reductions op Salaries of - Ministers and Members of Parliament, Judges, Civil &apos; Servants and Members of the Defence Services. -The Government propose that as from the 1st October, 1931, all ministerial salaries shall be reduced : by 20 per cent, on salaries of  5,000 a year and over, by 10 per cent, on salaries of L&apos;2.000 a year and over, but less than  5,000 a year, by 1\ per cent, on salaries of  1,000 a year and over, but less than  2,000 a year; iind that the allowances now payable to members of the House of Commons shall be reduced by 5 per cent.They propose, further, that abatements on the same graduated scale 10 per cent, or 20 per cent., as the case may be shall&apos;be made from the salaries of Judges and of officers of the four Crown Services whose substantive pay is  2,000 a year or more.With regard to the remuneration of members of the Crown Services whose pay is less than  2,000 a year, the Government have decided to follow throughout the recommendations of the Committee on National expenditure.In the case of the Civil Service, provision has already been made in the 1931 Estimates by the late Government for a 10-point drop in cost of living bonus as from the 1st March, 1931, and for a further 5-point drop as from the 1st September. Assuming continued payment of bonus at the rate to which it was reduced on the 1st September during the whole of 1932, there will be a further saving that year of  800,000, in addition to that, secured on the estimates for this year.In the case of the Defence Services, the changes to be made will hike effect as from the 1st October and are briefly as follows : (i) Steps   will   be   taken   through   the   normal   negotiating machinery to review a preferential bonus of from 2s. to 4s. a week which has been paid in the Eoyal Dockyards and Ordnance Factories since 1924.(ii) New rates of pay, introduced in 1925 for the men and lowerranks of officers in the services, were not then applied to the existing personnel.The 1925 rates will now be applied to all personnel.(iii) Deductions made from the pay and pensions of officers inrespect of the fall in cost of living since 1919 will be revised and brought into harmony with the current cost of living index. The deduction from the 1st October, 1931, will be based on the average of the index figures published for the six months the 1st March to the 31st August, 1931, and will be 11 per cent! instead of the. 8 per cent, now in force. ;(iv) The pension rates of men in the Services will in future bedetermined by the Scheme in force at the date when the man enters upon his final engagement which qualifies Wt.- so 40 9/31 F.O.P. 5955 n 3
him for pension. Men who before the 1st October, 1931. had entered upon their final engagements to complete time for pension will be entitled to reckon service prior to that date on the rates introduced, in 1919. (v) The increased rates of reserve pay authorised in 1919 for Army and Air Force reservists will be reduced as from the 1st October, 1931, by 25 per cent.The total savings in 1932 compared with the estimates for 1931 arising from the reductions of salaries of Ministers, Members of Parliament, Judges, Civil Servants and Members of the Navy, Army and Air Services are estimated to be 14.534,000.Defence Services.A total reduction, including the reductions in emoluments and pensions already specified, will be made in the Estimates for the Defence Services in 1932 of  8,600,000.The Service Departments wall secure savings on services other than pay and pensions to the amount of approximately  5 millions. They will secure these reductions in ways which will have the least effect on the efficiency of the Services, but it must be appreciated that, in view of the extensive reductions which the Services have made in recent years, these further reductions can only be secured with great difficulty, and many of the reductions made will not he of a continuing character.Education.A total saving of  9,400,000 in a full year will be made in the expenditure of the Board of Education.(i) Grants in respect of the salaries of teachers will be calculated on the assumption that as from the 1st October, 1931, there is a deduction from the aggregate salary bill. The May Committee recommended that such deduction should be 20 per cent. The Government has carefully considered the position, and has reached the conclusion that the deduction should be 15 per cent.(ii) The Grant in respect of elementary teachers&apos; salaries is 60 per cent. This grant will now be reduced to 50 per cent., but, as this reduction of percentage would, notwithstanding the reduction of salaries, increase the salary charge borne by local authorities, adjustment will be made elsewhere in the grant formula with the object of meeting this difficulty.(hi) The present 50 per cent, minimum limit of grant for elementary education will he abolished.(iv) In,addition to the above specific measures, by a general slowing down of the service and other economy measures the increase in. the Education Estimates in 1932 compared with 1931.
which would otherwise have been  2,250,000, will be restricted to  1,000,000-a reduction of  1,250,000.The reductions of expenditure made in England and Wales will involve automatically a reduction of 11/80 of the savings in the grants made for Education in Scotland.The financial effect in the first full year of the proposals which have been adopted is as follows : ......      . 4(1) Abolition of 50 per cent, minimum limit of grant for elementary education     ...       ...       1,450,000(2) Reduction of 15 per cent, from the aggregate, of teachers&apos; salaries and revision of grant formula for elementary education (i.e., 50 per cent, for teachers&apos; salaries and revised capitation grant per unit of average attendance) and allowing an increase of grant to poor areas   ...       ...       ...       ...      5,987,500(3) Reduction of grants for higher education in consequence of 15 per cent, reduction from the aggregate of teachers&apos; salaries...... 712,500(4) Reduction of growth of education expenditurein 1932 ...       ......       ...       ...       1,250,000Total        ..........9,400,000Add 11/80 in respect of savings in Scotland      1,300,000Total        ............     10,700,000Owing to the manner in which Government grants are paid, only 90 per cent, of these savings will accrue in the financial year 1932, and, after allowing for the effect on grants in 1932 of the savings to be made in the current year, the saving in 1932 will be  10,300,000.The reductions are to come into force as from the 1st October, 1931. It is estimated that the savings in the current year will be approximately  3 - 5 million in England and Wales and   - 5 million in Scotland.University Grants. 1The Vote for grants to Universities and Colleges will be reduced in 1932 by  150,000. The above sum of  150,000 represents an accumulated balance which would normally be used for non-recurrent purposes and can be withdrawn without reducing the annual recurrent grants to any of the University institutions.
Ministry of Health and Department of Health for Scotland.The savings to be secured on these votes will amount to about  1,250,000 in a full year and to about  475,000 in the remainder of the financial year 1931-32.National Health Insurance.Remuneration of Insurance Doctors and Chemists.Since the 1st January, 1924, the remuneration of insurance doctors has been at the rate of 9s. a year for each insured person included in a doctor&apos;s list.It is proposed that the rate of 9s. should, from the 1st October, 1931, be made subject to a deduction of one-ninth, and that the product of this deduction should be applied towards meeting expenses of administration of the National Health Insurance Acts which are now met out of moneys provided by Parliament.The amount which will be realised by this percentage deduction is estimated for Great Britain at  425,000 in the financial year ending on the 31st March, 1932, and at  850,000 in a full year.A similar percentage deduction will also be made as from the 1st October, 1931, from the remuneration at present payable to insurance chemists and the sum realised by this deduction will also be applied towards meeting the expenses of Health Insurance administration at present borne by the Exchequer. This sum which will be realised by this deduction is estimated to amount to about  50,000 in the financial year 1931-32 and to about  120,000 in a full year, subject so far as England and Wales are concerned to the reconsideration of the present contract with the chemists which expires in December 1932.Exchequer Grant to the National Health Insurance Central Fund.It is proposed to withdraw the grant of  142,000 per annum which would be payable to the Central Fund as from the 1st January, 1932, under the provisions of section 68 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924. The Government are, however, anxious that this Fund, which was constituted for the purpose of assisting Approved Societies who are found to be in difficulties on valuation, should be in no way weakened. They propose therefore that the Health Insurance part of the contributions payable by the employers of insured persons over 65 years of age which at the present time is paid into the Pensions Account under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, should be transferred to the Central Fund. The sum which- will be transferred amounls approximately to  300,000 a. year.&apos; t
Miscellaneous.It is expected that there will be some slowing down of expenditure as the result of the measures for regulating development of expenditure which, are being taken by. the local authorities. It is estimated that the savings on this account will amount to about  150,000.Police.The expenditure on the police falls half on the rates and half on I he Exchequer and the Exchequer consequently receives half the benefit of any savings secured in the expenditure on this service. Savings in expenditure amounting to  2,000,000 are to be made in two equal instalments, the savings to the Exchequer being thus  500,000 in the first year and  1,000,000 in the second year. Some of this reduction of expenditure will be secured by the introduction of lower rates of pay for new entrants to the service and various administrative measures, but savings of this order cannot be secured without substantial sacrifices on the part of serving members of the forces. The May Committee recommended a reduction in the pay of all ranks at the rate of 6J per cent, in the first year and .121&quot; per cent, in the second year, but after consultation with the English and Scottish Police Councils, on wdiich the police authorities and all ranks of the Service are represented, it has been decided to make instead supplementary deductions from pay on a graduated scale according to rank, commencing at 5s. weekly for constables, whose scale ranges from 70s. to 95s. a week. These deductions will continue for a year from the 1st October, 1931. The detailed measures for effecting the additional savings of similar amount to be secured to the second year are reserved for further consideration.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.The provision for 1932 will be reduced by  580,000. This will involve the discontinuance of grants to landowners for field drainage and water supply schemes, a reduction in the sums available for the assistance of Drainage Authorities and Catchment Boards, the postponement of new developments in agricultural research, and a reduction in the scale of grants to Local Authorities for the provision of agricultural education. Expenditure on National Mark activity will he reduced, and it will be necessary to postpone the Government grant towards the cost of reconstructing the Royal Veterinary College.It is not proposed to ask Parliament to vote a Supplementary Estimate this year for the  purposes of the. Agricultural Land
)(Utilisation) Act, and no provision will be made in 1932 for the purposes of this Act. ...      :, -:. On; the Fisheries side it will.be impossible to include provision in 1932 for&quot; operating the,new Fisheries Research ship. The possibility of placing,.thisi,ship, at the disposal of the industry for research purposes is being examined. . ,   ^      &apos;i   b -. ...- . Agriculture (Scotland).-A saving of  75,000 will bo made in the case of the Department of Agriculture for Scotland on somewhat similar lines.Forestry.The expenditure of the Forestry Commission in 1932 will bo reduced by  478,000. This reduction will be secured by restricting afforestation work and acquisitions and by suspending the provision of forest workers holdings. Care will be taken that the Commissioners&apos; nurseries of young plants are not prejudiced.Empire Marketing Boakd.The grant to the Empire Marketing Board will be reduced next year by-  250,000. This reduction is additional to savings which will be secured on the gross Votes for the Agriculture Departments in respect of services now financed by grants made by the Board through thbse Votes.Colonial Development Fund.The grant to the Colonial Development Fund will be restricted to  750,000 next year (saving  250,000). The Advisory Committee will be invited to concentrate their recommendations on schemes which, will give the greatest and speediest benefit to this country.Unemployed Grants.As decided by the late Government the last date for applications by Local Authorities to the Unemployed Grants Committee for ; grants towards schemes of work fpr; the relief of, unemployment was .,the. ,,30th , June,   1931, , though ,. hi ... exceptional   circumstances applications after that date, in respect of, work to begin before the 31st December, 1931, are being entertained, provided that good reason is shown why earlier application could not be made.   There &apos; are ; at&quot; &quot;present approximately ,900 . applications outstanding of an
estimated value of about  .14,000,000. The rates of grant are being reduced and, except in regard to schemes for which1 a grant has already been definitely promised, the revised rates will in jro &quot;case exceed 25 per cent, of the cost of the scheme. It is anticipated on this basis that only schemes of the highest economic value will be proceeded with, and this factor coupled with the reduction in the rates of grant will result in an estimated saving to the Exchequer of  500,000 in 1932-33 as compared with the amount which it would have been necessary to provide had existing rates of grants been continued.Unemployment Insurance.The measures proposed in respect of Unemployment Insurance and the estimated. economies(l) in the financial year 1932-33 are as follows : (1) A reduction of weekly benefit rates (except that for the dependant child) by 10 per cent, rounded off to the nearest 3d.The following table shows the present and proposed weekly rates for the several classes of insured persons now entitled to benefit, together with the present weekly rate : 	Present		Proposed	Bates.

&apos;. The present and proposed weekly rates of contribution for the several classes of&apos;insured contributors are as follows: Contributor.

They may, however, continue to receive assistance in cash up to the same rates as under the Insurance Scheme if they show that they are in need of it. The procedure contemplated is that when unemployed persons come to the end of their- insurance benefit and desire to claim further payment, they wdll attend at the Employment Exchange to prove unemployment and satisfaction of other conditions as at present. Under the pro-cedure referred to, the Exchange will request the Public Assistance Authority for the district to assess their need and to determine&apos; the amount payable (riot exceeding the rate&apos; for ordinary benefit) and such determination will be final. The amount, so determined will be paid by the Employment&apos; Exchange and the payment will be charged on the Exchequer.The estimated saving&apos;under this head is .- 10,000,000

Finance.On the basis of the continued payment of Benefit (including Transitional Benefit) at the rates and on the conditions at present in force, and with an average live register of 3,000,000, the financial position of Unemployment Insurance in 1932-33, apart from economies, would be approximately as follows :   Benefit at existing rates     ............     130,500,000Interest on debt at  115,000,000 .........        5,700,000Administration        ...............        7,100,000Total expenditure      ............     143,300,000Towards this sum Employers and Employed persons would contribute at existing rates ...       ...     .28,500,000Sum to be provided by Exchequer   ...      ...      ...     114,800,000The savings pnrposed to be effected, including the removal of anomalies by regulations under the Unemployment Insurance (No. 3) Act, 1931, will reduce this expenditure as follows :  Bemoval of Anomalies, under the  Act of 1931      .........       3,000,000Needs   test   for   transitional   pay-ments      ......... 10,000,000Beduction in rates of benefit      ...     12,800,000 .---      25,800,000
The saving to the Exchequer is thus  114,800,000 minus  79,000,000, or  85,800,000.Road Fund.The expenditure from the Eoad Fund.in 1932 was estimated (if existing policies remain unaltered) as  27,865,000, plus the general Exchequer contributions paid under the Derating Scheme from the Road Fund. This sum of  27,865,000 will be reduced to a round figure of  20,000,000-a saving of  7,865,000.It was estimated that the Road Fund would have required a loan from the Exchequer next year of  10,000,000 to enable it to meet its obligations, and under existing practice, the Exchequer would have itself borrowed this  10,000,000 in order to lend it to the Road Fund. The sum required from the Exchequer will now be reduced to about  2,250,000, and this sum will not be borrowed by the Exchequer, but will be provided out of a vote of Parliament.It is intended, also, that in the current year the sum which the Eoad Fund will require will be provided by a Vote and not borrowed by the Exchequer.In order to secure the reduction of Expenditure which is essential in the altered financial circumstances certain new schemes must, of course, be postponed and schemes in progress slowed down or curtailed.Miscellaneous.The Treasury has issued a circular to Government Departments calling for a stringent review of their expenditure with a view to supplementing by further economies the specific decisions of the Government on major issues.It is expected that this review of miscellaneous economies will produce a total of savings next year of  2,500,000.II. Action to be taken under the Powers sought in the National Economy Bill.It is proposed that Orders in Council should be made to deal with the following matters (described in more detail in the first part of this memorandum), in respect of which statutory powers are required before. the economy measures proposed can be carried into effect:- ./&quot;1. iReductions of Salaries, dc. . .(1) Authorising reductions of salary on the scale proposed in oases where such salaries are fixed by statute.(2).Repealing .an existing provision fixing soldiers&apos; pensions on .the scale in force at the time of their first enlistment. :
2. Education. ,  .    &apos; :(1) Abolishing as regards Elementary Education the obligation to pay a minimum 50 per cent, expenditure grant to Local Education Authorities under section 118 (2) of the Education Act, 1921.(2) Scaling down by 15 per cent, the existing contractual rights to salary of teachers in grant-aided schools or institutions.3. National Health Insurance. . .   -  &apos;&apos;    ...... : ..(1) Applying the saving in the cost of medical benefit (doctors and chemists) towards &apos; the payment&apos; of the expenses incurred by Government departments in the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts.(2) Withdrawing the Exchequer grant to the National Health Insurance Central Fund under section 68 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924.(3) Transferring from the Pensions Account under the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act to the Central Fund the health insurance part of the contributions payable by employers in respect of insured persons over 65 years of age as from the 1st January, 1928.I. Police.(A note will be inserted later if it is found that the economies proposed in the case of the police require legislation.)5. Unemployment Insurance.(1) Reducing the rates of benefit.
