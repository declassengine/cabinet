APPENDIX .3.UNSMPIQYI-.1PNT INSURANCE ANOMALIES ADVISORY COMM1TTBREPORT.?o Sir Henry Bo Betterton, G.B.E.,M.P. Minister of Labour.Sir,1.      We were appointed by you on the 1st September,  1931,  under Section 2 of the Unemployment Insurance (No.3) Act,  1931,  as an Advisory Committee to be consulted with regard to the Regulations to be made under Section I of that Act.      We attach,  as Appendix I to this Report the draft Regulations which you have-submitted to us.     We here taken the draft into consideration and have the honour to make the following report thereon as required by Section 1(6) of the Act.Draft Regulation 1.2.      This draft Regulation relates to the class of persons defined in Section 1(2)  (a)  of the Act as follows&quot;persons who habitually work for less than a full week, &quot;and by the practice of the trade in which they are &quot;employed nevertheless receive earnings or similar &quot;payments of an amount greater than the normal earnings &quot;for a full week of persons following the same &quot;occupation in the same district&quot;.5.      We doubt whether any Regulation under this paragraph of Section l(2)  of the Act can have any effect.      The paragraph, by its requirement of high earnings,  is clearly not intended to apply to the ordinary short-time workers included among anomalies by the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance, and, by the use of the limiting words &quot;following the same occupation&quot; equally would not apply to occupations,  such as those of coal trimmers and certain other special classes of port workers in which relatively large earnings are obtained not by a few individuals but by most people in the occupation for working less than a full week.      The only case that occurs to us as possibly within the Statute would be the case of people (if there are such people) who, working regularly each week for more than two days,  are obtaining for those days more than the full wage of the normal week.     We are not aware that such people exist but if they do the draft Regulation seems reasonably well adapted to give effect to the very limited purpose allowed by the Act of Parliament.Draft Regulation 2.4-      Thin draft Regulation relates to the class of persons defined in Section I (2)  (b)  of the Act as follows&quot;persons whose normal employment is employment for &apos;.&apos;portions of the year only in occupations which are &quot;of a seasonal nature.&quot;5.      The effect of Paragraph (i) of the draft Regulation is to require workers in seasonal occupations to prove certain additional conditions before they can draw benefit during the off-season.      One suggestion we considered was whether the payment of contributions by seasonal workers during those times of the
year when they have little or no risk of being unemployed should not give them a right to draw a limited amount of benefit during the off-season, without the application of special conditions, in order that they might have an opportunity of showing that they intend to obtain other work during the off-season-     We have, however,  come to the conclusion that this is not necessary provided that the special conditions to be applied, during the off--season are reasonable,  and we agree that they should be applied ss from the beginning of the off-seeson.      We feel that the requirement that the seasonal worker, before being entitled to benefit during the off-season,  should prove that he has been employed in ihsurable employment during the off-season to a substantial extent during each of the three preceding years is a higher test than is needed and we recommend that a. period of two years be substituted for a period of three years.6.      Subject to this alteration of the period we are in general agreement with the draft Regulation.     ?e are, however,  of the opinion that it leaves in some doubt the manner in which persons who follow a seasonal occupation in more than one district are to be treated when,  as in the herring curing industry,  the seasons of the different districts do not coincide.     We also feel doubt whether the Regulation is suitably drafted to deal with the anomaly of benefit being allowed during off-seasons to persons whose normal employment is at holiday or health resorts during holiday seasons only.7.      For these reasons we recommend that draft Regulation 2 should be replaced by a Regulation in the terms of Appendix II which are based on an alternative draft which has been prepared by your officers at our request.Draft Regulation 3.8.      This draft Regulation relates to the class of persons defined in Section I (2)  (c) of the Act as followss-&quot;persons whose normal employment is employment in en &quot;occupation in which their services are not normally &quot;required for more than two days in the week or who &quot;owing to personal circumstances are not normally &quot;employed for more than two days in the week.&quot;9.      We are in no doubt that the number of persons within this class will be small.10.    We have considered carefully whether there is any danger of this Regulation being so interpreted as to be applicable to persons who have in fact in the past worked for a full week when a full week5 s work has been available for them,  and would do so again, but, because they cannot find full work,  are forced to be content with one or two days&apos;  work a week.      We do not think that there is any serious risk of this,  as the draft regulation applies only to persons whose normal employment is of the kind specified, and we assume that this will be interpreted to apply only to persons who,  either from the beginning of their industrial careers if they have not been long in employment,  or by long continued practice, have worked on not more than two days each week,.      On this assumption we agree with the draft regulation.
Draft Regulation^.11.    This draft Regulation relates to the class of persons defined in Section I (2)  (d)  of the Act as follows&quot;married women who,  since marriage or in any prescribed &quot;period subsequent to marriage? have had less than the &quot;prescribed number of contributions paid in respect of &quot;them&quot;.&quot;Provided that this class shall not include married &quot;women y/hose husbands are incapacitated from work or &quot;are unemployed and not in receipt of benefit&quot;.12.    In considering the form which the regulation to be made under this paragraph should take, we thought it was of special importance to examine carefully the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance on this point.13.    In paragraph 117 of their Report55,  the Royal Commission note the points which differentiate the position of married women workers from that of other insured contributors.,      These points are (l)  that &quot;it is a common,  end perhaps a growing practice among employers to refuse to engage married women and to dismiss women from employment on marriage11;    (2) that &quot;it is a common practice for women to withdraw from industry on marriage if their husbands are able to support them&quot;;    (3) that &quot;in many cases married women who might wish to seek employment are prevented by their domescic responsibilities from doing so &quot; (4) that statistics show chat -1it is the exception rather than the rule for women after marriage to earn their living by insurable employment&apos;1 .14.    In examining this part of the Royal Commission1s Report we first considered whether they intended that benefit should be denied only to those married women (a) who have abandoned insurable employment voluntarily,  or (b) who because of an industrial practice not to employ married women,  cannot reasonably expect to obtain further insurable employment in the district where they live.     Alternatively,  did the Royal Commission intend that where a married women has no reasonable expectation of obtaining further insurable employment because of prolonged industrial depression,  she should be deprived of benefit?15o    The Royal Commission after drawing attention in paragraph 118 to the disproportionately high number of claims from married women as compared with those from single women, proceed in paragraph 119 to draw the conclusion that &quot;there are many married women receiving benefit who have not since.marriage worked in an insurable trade ancV in their existing circumstances, have no intention of doing so.&quot;16.    The Royal Commission then proceed in paragraph 120 to make their recommendation as to &quot;the best method of eliminating those claims by married women which are not reasonable&quot;.17.    Their first recommendation is that a married woman should be called upon to prove that she has not abandoned insurable employment,  and we have no difficulty in understanding this pert of their recommendations which follows logically upon the description of the anomaly given in the preceding paragraph of their Report.s First Report of the Royal Commission on Unemployment Insurance (1931)  (Cmd. 3672) H, I/I. Stationery Office.
18.    The second, recommendation of the Royal Commission is that a married woman should he called upon to show &quot;that having regard to her industrial experience and to the industrial circumstances of the district she can reasonably expect to obtain insurable employment in the district in which she is residing.&quot;      We would call special&apos; attention to the words &quot;having regard to........ the industrial circumstances of thedistrict5&apos;1..      Does this refer solely to the industrial practice in the district where a married woman resides of refusing to employ married women,  to which the Commission had previously referred,  or was it intended to include such circumstances as the depressed state of trade in the district which is,  in terms,  certainly an industrial circumstance which might deprive a married woman of any reasonable expeetatiion of obtaining insurable employment in the district where she resides?19.    Turning from the Royal Commission5s Report to the Statute, we note that it does not follow precisely the Royal Commission5s recommendation but excludes from the class intended to be covered by this regulation married women whose husbands are incapacitated from work or ere unemployed and not in receipt of benefit.      This exclusion may perhaps be an indication that Parliament at any rate,  intended regard to be had. not only to the Question whether the married women had abandoned insurable employment, but also to their domestic circumstances.      If this is s correct interpretation it would be in accordance with the intention of Parliament to exclude from benefit those married women who have husbands in a position to support them,  even though it is industrial depression,  rather than the normal pract ce of the trade, that deprives them cf any reasonable expectation of obtaining insurable employment.      The words of the draft Regulation appear to be appropriate for that purpose.SO.    If,  on the other hand,  the intention of the Royal Commission or of Parliament was not to disqualify for benefit married women whose inability to obtain insurable work is due to industrial depressions  it might be in accordance with that intention to substitute for the words &quot;industrial circumstances of the district in which she re-sides&quot; in draft Regulation 4 (ii), the words &quot;industrial practice of the district in which she resides,  in the occupation in which she has been accustomed to work.&quot;    The object of doing this would be to permit benefit to be paid to those married women desiring work who had been accustomed to work in occupations in which,  in the district where they reside,  it is the practice to employ married women. Their title to benefit would not be affected by the fact that owing to industrial depression the prospect of their obtaining employment in their normal occupation was somewhat remote. An alternative method which was suggested, with the same object in view was to introduce words that would allow account to be taken only of normal industrial circumstances in times of good trade.
21.    In. view of the close &quot;balance of argument, however, we have thought it right to leave the matter without e definite recommendation to the decision of the Minister.      The actual decision in the first instance is perhaps less important than that the working of this regulation in particular, however phrased?  should he closely watched with a view to revision if it appears after experience either unduly lax or unduly harsh.22.    We are all agreed that,  in proposing to exclude from benefit married women who are not normally employed in insurable employment,  or will not normally seek to obtain their livelihood by means of insurable employment or who, owing to domestic circumstences or an industrial practice not to employ married women cannot expect to obtain insurable employment In the district vhere they live,  the draft Regulation is in accordance with the proposals of the Royal Commission,  and we assume it is also in accordance with the intentions of Parliament.23.    Some of us, however, while not objecting to the application of the Draft Regulation as it stands,  to married women who have exhausted their rights to benefit under the First Statutory Condition, would find it difficult to agree to its application to those who have paid 30 contribution during the preceding two years,  if,  as seems likely.,  they would be called upon to show that having regard,   amongst other things,  to the state of trade they have a reasonable expectation of obtaining insurable employment in the.district where they li&quot;ve.      Others of us are of opinion that the draft Regulation - y^hich applies only to that section of married women who husbands are either earning wages at work or drawing Unemployment Benefit - should apply to that section of married women whether or not they have paid 30 contributions during the preceding two years.     Those of us who hold that view have in mind not only the features described by the Royal Commission differentiating married women as a class from other insured contributors, but also the further consideration that married women as a class cannot be &quot;available&quot; for employment in the same sense as other insured contributors in respect that their availability for employment is necessarily restricted and confined to the particular district in which their husbands seek to earn their livelihood.
24o     We have considered whether we should recommend some alteration of the cor.tr i out ion testa proposed in tho- draft Regulation; either hy extending the period during which (after six months have elapsed since marriage) eight contributions must have been paid,  or by reducing the number of contributions0 The Statute itself, by limiting the application of special conditions to married women who fail to satisfy certain contribution tests since marriage is more limited in scope than were the recommendations of the Royal Commission which proposed special conditions for all married women.      This restriction of the scope in itself leaves open the possibility-lity of a married woman continuing; in exceptional oases, to draw benefit for a substantial period after she has abandoned insurable employment, without having to satisfy the special conditions.      A relaxation of the contribution tests would increase the risk cf the anomaly persisting,      We do not therefore recommend any alteration, in the contribution tests proxoosed in the Draft Regulation and. v/e would point out that the effect of the regulation is hot to exclude from benefit automatically, but to require those married women who have not paid the required number of contributions to fulfil the additional  requirements,25,      In the interests of simplicity we recommend that the condition set out in Draft Regulation 4 (i).  instead of referring to Section 14(2)  (b) of the Unemployment Insurance Act;, 1087,  should he framed as follows-;--&quot;.4(i)s    That she is normally employed in insurable&apos; employment and will normally seek to obtain her livelihood by means of insurable employment&quot;.This is a drafting change and not one of substance,Draft Regulation 5086,      Again in the interests of simplicity we recommend that the definition of insurable employment should be changed to the following;-&quot;the expression 1insurable employment&apos;  in relation to an insured contributor means such employment as would make him an employed person within the meaning of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920.&quot;General,,27c      In conclusion we wish to call attention to the experimental nature of the Act and the Regulations, which seems to us to make it desirable that a careful watch should be kept on the way in which the Regulations work.     We suggest that after a convenient time a report on the working of the Regulations should, be laid before Parliament by the Minister.Signed, on behalf of the Committee..(Signed)    BURNHAM   (Chairman,),(Signed)    1 H.H.WILES.
