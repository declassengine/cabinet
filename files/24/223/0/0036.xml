GAB X N E T.OEET. .2^1)..LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL,  1931.Copy. No.Memorandum by the Ministeg-of Transport.Parliamentary Counsel has been asked to advises-(1) whether a motion in the terms of the annexed draft, (See Appendix I) which is modelled on that passed in 1903 in &quot;the case of the Port of London (Hybrid) bill (See Appendix II) would enable consideration of the London Passenger Transport (Hybrid) Bill, 1931, to be resumed in a new parliament at the stage at which it is left in the present session,   and(2) whether the contents of the present Bill afford any reason for not treating it in this respect as a private Bill.Parliamentary Counsel has replied as follows:-(1) The effect of an Order in the terms of the draft motion would be to enable the Bill to be resumed at the stage which it has now reached, notwithstanding that a dissolution of Parliament intervenes.     The draft motion provides that the Order Is to be &quot;a Standing Order of the House&quot; , and the Standing Orders are not affected by dissolutions;    see Campion - Introduction to the Procedure of the House of Commons, p.227 :-&quot;In order that they may not lapse when 1 &quot;Parliament is prorogued or dissolved, all Suspension 1 &quot;Orders are made standing Orders of the House&quot;.(2) The present Bill is, as regards the greater part of it, essentially of the character of a private Bill, though-it also contains some provisions&quot; which, if they had stood alone, would probably have been dealt with in a public Bill.     But substantially the argumenlr&quot;adduced in 1903 applies in the present case, and the carrying forward of this Bill could not be used as an argument to support a proposal to carry forward public bills. -^--^*sHWW*fcw*It will &quot;Be^seen, therefore, that, although in thecase of the Port of London Bill, 1905, there was no dissolution inthe following year and the Bill was not in fact proceeded with,there is precedent for a motion of the kind now suggestedcarrying forward a Hybrid Bill into a new parliament.     In theevent of a dissolution, resolutions carrying forward ordinaryPrivate Bills would presumably in any case be required.22nd September,(INTLD.) P.J.P.
APPENDIX I.LONDON pa6seng3r TRANSPORT BILL,. Draft Motion for carrying-over.That further proceedings on the London Passenger Transport Bill &quot;be suspended till the next Session of Parliament.That on any day in that Session a Motion may he made, after notice, by a Minister of the Grown, to be decided Without Amendment or Debate, that proceedings on that Bill may be resumed, and if that Motion is decided in the affirmative the said Bill, as reported from the Joint Committee, shall stand committed to a Committee of the whole House in like manner as if the previous proceedings on the Bill or in relation thereto had taken place in that Session in due compliance with all Standing Orders.That this Order be a Standing Order of the House.
APPENDIX II.&quot;Ordered, That further proceedings on the Port of London Bill he suspended till the next session of Parliament.Ordered, That on any day in that Session a Motion may be made, after notice, by a Minister of the Crown, to be decided without Amendment or Pebate, that proceedings on that Bill may be resumed, and if that Motion is decided in the affirmative the said Bill, as reported from the Joint Committee, shall stand committed to a Committee of the Whole House in like manner as if the previous proceedings on the Bill or in relation thereto had taken place in that session, after due compliance with all Standing Orders.Ordered, That this Order be a Standing Order of the House.(Mr. A-J-Balfour)&quot;.In announcing the intention of the Government to put down the Motion, the Prime Minister (Mr.A.J.Balfour) stated&quot;I have to say that I do not think it would be practicable at the present period of the session, and in the present state of public business, to proceed with the discussion of this Bill on Report.      On the other hand, it  is quite clear, I think, that the Bill, for all essential purposes, ought to be ranked as a private Bill and treated as a private Bill, so that^He^Imaiense exuenditure^rTciarred by persons interested in the Bill should, not &quot;he entirely thrown away, as it would be if the Bill were dropped.      I propose, therefore, to apply to this Bill the practice which the House has so long sanctioned in regard to private Bills, and I shall put dovm a Motion the effect of which will be to carry it over to next session,  to enable the Government to resume it next SesSTon. at the precise point we leave it this session&quot;(Parliamentary Debates, 4th Series, Vol.127, Col.687). In answer to a question during the course of the debate on the Motion, the Prime Minister indicated that the Motion would   have effect &quot;quite irrespective of a dissolution&quot;.(Parliamentary Debates, 4th Series, Vol.127, Col.1114).
