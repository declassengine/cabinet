Confidential.National Economy Bill.NOTE  BY PARLIAMENTARY COUNSEL.The terms of the attached draft Bill have been provisionally approved by the Cabinet, and directions have been given that the draft is to be circulated to all the Departments concerned.The intention is that such of the economies decided on by the Cabinet as can be effected by administrative action without legislation shall be so effected; the pur-pose of the Bill, therefore, is only to enable Orders in Council to be made removing such obstacles to admin-istrative action as arise by reason of existing statutory provisions or contractual obligations.First drafts of the Orders in Council proposed to be made under the Bill are being prepared by the Parlia-mentary Counsel on the basis of the instructions received from Departments, and will be circulated to them at the earliest possible date. Meanwhile, it is of urgent importance that Departments should consider (a) whether there are any services administered bythem with respect to which statutory Orders in Council may be necessary, in addition to the services named in the Schedule to the draft Bill; and(b) whether the draft Bill is drawn in sufficientlywide terms to confer power to make statutory Orders in Council in respect of all matters for which such Orders may be necessary.The terms of the Bill must be finally settled by Tuesday next, and it is the special desire of the Cabinet that no amendments should be necessary on the Committee stage.In order to save time, it is requested that the observations of Departments upon these points may be addressed direct to the Parliamentary Counsel as soon as possible.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall, S.W. 1.September 3rd, 1931.199-2a
