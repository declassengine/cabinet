(raiS^DCCJjm^ GOVERNMENT)SECRET.CP.  250 (.51). COPY NO.    ^C A B I NET.NEGOTIATION OF THE BRITISH TREASURY CREDITS IN THE UNITED STATES Aid IN FRANCE .Note &quot;by the Chancellor- of the Exchequer.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a Memorandum prepared in the Treasury,(Intd.) P,B.September 15th,   1931.I,    Tho Credit in the United States of America. The negotiations for a credit in the United States were formally opened on the 25th August when the. Treasury,  acting on the inetructions of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer3 requested Messrs. Morgan Grenfell to aporoach Messrs. J.P.Morgan and Co., New York, with a view to an immediate arrangement for a credit for a sum of $200 mills.    The Treasury suggested that the credit should be made available for use as and when required, any suras drawn to be covered by the deposit with Morgan Grenfells of 3 months Dollar Treasury Bills of an equivalent value with an option of renewal up to one year in all.On the same dajr Morgan Grenfells reported that the procedure proposed by New fork was that J.P.Morgans should agree to purchase Dollar Treasury Bills as and when required by the Treasury to a total sum of 0 200 mills.,  such Bills to be renewable up to a period of one year in all.
-    16 6The terms suggested were ( 1) Commissions amounting to l-Ho to he paid forthwith on the  total amount of the credit whether used or hot,  and (2) Bills to he disco unted at a rate of 1/j over the official discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 90 days commercial paper at the date of purchase,  subject to a minimum rate of perannum and a maximum cf 6;i per annum unless the Federal Reserve discount rate exceeded 6^j.      In that event Bills were to be discounted at the Federal Reserve Rate,(These terms were  the name  is those which applied to the credit arranged with Messrs.  J.P. Morgans    in 1925 upon the return of/this country to the Gold Standard,  except that in that case interest was payable on any advances at a minimum of 4;;o against the 4:Vh&apos; now suggested.)Strong efforts were mode to secure a reduction of the 4&quot;2;i minimum rate.    The first reply from New York was that the 4-g/&apos;o was fixed by reference to Bill rate in London and by the worsening conditions of this country.    It was strongly urged from this side that these arguments had little force particularly as,  since the credits is ere repayable in dollars, there was no exchange risk.    It was then reported from New York that there was great difficulty in securing so large a sum as 02QO millions.      A credit of this size made it .necessary to bring into the scheme something like a hundred banks and finance houses in New York..    Moreover,  the. participants would have no means by which they could re--aiscount their liabilities and since many of them were already-loaded with frozen assets representing German obligations, the business had little attraction for them.    It became a question of taking say $100 millions at (possibly)  a slightly lower rate,  or paying 43$ to secure the sum desired.
It is understood that even on the latter basis the American group had considerable difficult-;/- in keeping the participants in line.The American agreement tc a credit was conditional upon the arrangement of a credit for a similar amount in Prance.,    During the period of negotiations in that country efforts continued to be made to obtain a lower minimum rate from the United States but without success.    At the last moment we were faced with a further difficulty.    The broad terms of the French credit (given below) became known in New York on the 28th August.    When it was seen that tehnic-ally the French credit was firm only to the extent of  20 millions,  the balance depending upon public  subscription, the American consortium threatened to break up.    Eventually a solution was found by our agreeing not to draw upon the American credit in excess of the firm French credit plus the proceeds of the public, issue in France.    Arrangements were made for the contingent re.tu.rn to us of a proportion of the commissions payable, but the success of the French issue makes these provisions inoperative.The commissions and interest payable on the credit Lave already been given,.    Other details of the transaction are;-(l)    The credit is a revolving one,  i.e. we may draw up to $200 millions at any one time.(2)   -The Dollar Treasury Bills are,  at our option,  of a currency of 50 days, 60 days or 90 days.(5)    Repayment of Bills is to be made in New York.(4)    Bills must be renewed on expiry if we so demand but so that no bill matures later than 28th August,  1952.(5)   Delivery of Bills is to be at J-LMorgans1   office in New York, but delivery to Morgan Grenfells    in London with instructions to forward them to New York at the expense of the Treasury is to be deemed delivery in New York.
II.the French. Credit.The British Treasury credit in France is in two parts;    in the first place, a revolving credit entitling the Treasury to draw on a group of French Banks on current account up to an amount of 2,500 million francs outstanding at any time,  interest at 4^% net being payable on any amounts actually drawn for the period during which they are outstanding; and in the second place,  a public issue of one-year british treasury Bills payable in francs for a total amount of a further 2,500 million francs.    The public issue was not under-written, as this is not the practice in France&quot;, the Banks stated that they felt practically certain of being able to sell Bills for 2,000 million francs ( 16 million) and very hopeful of being able to sell the whole issue of 2,500 million francs ( 20 million).      As  explained above,  this caused difficulties in the negotiation of the credit in America.If and insofar as the bonking credit is drawn upon, 4 % British Treasury Bills payable in francs in the same form as those issued to/the public are to he deposited as collateral to cover the amounts drawn and outstanding from time to time.    The franc Treasury Bills sola to the public are in denominations of 2,000 francs (about  16),  10,000 francs (about  80) and 50,000 francs (about  400),      The British Treasury Bills issued as collateral are for the most part to be in large denominations,  from one million francs upwards.Commission at the rate of 1%$ has been paid both on the Treasury Bills for 2,500 million francs issued to the public,  and on the amount of the banking credit,  namely, 2,500 million francs.    Nothing is payable by the Treasury in respect of French taxation on the banking credit as it is in the form of an overdraft on current account and thus does not
attract specific taxation in Prance.    On the public issue the Treasury is responsible for the expenses of the issue including French stamp duty at the rate of 50 centimes per 2,000francs or 0.C25L and  coupon tax at the rate of lSJa on the discount of 44^ or 0.76;o on the capital.    The total expenses of the public issue amount to under 0.SL on the amount of the issue.    Thus the total cost  of the banking credit is:-Interest on the cred.it,  if andinsofar as drawn upon 4.25%Commission (already paid) 1.25%The total expenses of the public issue are  :-44-^1 discount equivalent to interest at 4.44%Commission 1.25,0French Taxes and Expenses 0.8Total ( in raund f igur es ) 6.5%.Neither the United States of America credit nor the French credit are liable to British taxation unless held by or on behalf of persons who are liable as being resident or domiciled in this country.    Every effort has been made both in the United States cf America and France to prevent the sale of these credits to persons in this country.The public issue in France was open to subscription on September 2nd and was fully subscribed by Sept-ember 8th. The attitude of both the French Government and. the Bank of France was extremely helpful,  in particular the French Government themselves suggested a form of Treasury Bill (a Ed 11 payable to the British Consul General in Paris or order and endorsed by him in blank) which attracts French stamp duty
at  the low rate of  .025% instead of the rate of I.: payable on ordinary foreign loans in Prance.    They also agreed that the 13% coupon tax should not bo paid at the time of subscription but at the  end of the twelve months,    V/e have reserved the right to appeal to the French Government not to charge this coupon tax hut the French Ministry of Finance explained that the tax could not be waived except by special legislation and they could hold out no hope that the French Government would be able to forego payment of the  tax at the end of the twelve months.    The Bank of France, besides giving great assistance in the conduct of the negotiations,  agreed to act as our fiscal agents and also facilitated the banking credit by offering tc take over from the French Private Banks their share in the previous credit of  25 millions to the Bank of England,No political or other condition cf any kind was made in connection with the credits.    The French Minister of Finance expressed the hope that we would co-operate closely with the French Government as regards reparation but said specifically that this was in no way a condition of the credits.    The terms of the credits are not of course particularly cheap, but the French banks were perfectly well aware of the terms on which wo were borrowing in New York. As regards the public issue, we were assured that the rate of commission charged was low  judged by French standards: while,  as to the rate of discount, when we pressed for a reduction,  the Banks replied that they would try to place an issue at 40u,  instead of 4-1% if we so desired, but they expressed the strong view that such a reduction might seriously impair the success of  the issue.    The Bank of France agreed with this opinion and advised us to accept it.
*        It was enviously essential that the issue should not fail and it therefore seemed the right policy to agree to the rateof 4%;y,Of the proceeds of the public issue about 15 million were paid over on September 14th and. thebalance of about  4 million will be paid over on September 19th.The banking credit was available as from September 10th. but has not been drawn uponto the present.A list of the French Banks with which the banking beencredit has/negotiated and which have placed the public issue ----        is attached..Use of the credits. In both cases,   the foreign currency resulting from the credits will be sold to the Bank of England and I used, by it to meet demands on the Exchange,  as and when required.    The Bank of England will credit H.i.1.Government with the sterling equivalent of the foreign currency which it receives from time to time and this sterling equivalent will be used to reduce our floating debt at home.Treasury Chambers , S.
