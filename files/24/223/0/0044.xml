[This document is the Property o  His Britannic Majesty?s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1931. ^3*^MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.The Indian Budget Cotton Duties.The following telegrams exchanged with the Viceroy on 26th September are circulated for the information of his colleagues by the Secretary, of State for India, with reference to Cabinet 64 (31), Conclusion 1.28th September 1931.9 U. Private and personal. Your telegram of the 25th September. Cotton duties.I fully appreciate the difficulties of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and I am most anxious to help when I can ; but the proposal you have placed before me presents, I fear, insuperable difficulties. On two occasions the Government of India have induced the Legislature to pass measures conceding a differential rate of duty in favour of British goods, but in both cases the sole ground of differentiation was the interests of the consumer in India. The passage of both measures was exceptionally difficult, and the political reactions after the Cotton Bill of March 1930 were most unfortunate. If my Government were now to put forward a measure involving an increase of preference for British piece-goods, the political effect would be disastrous. Neither Schuster nor Rainy, whom I have consulted, can find any ground on which the measure could be supported as being in the interests of India. The mill owners have not asked for additional protection against Japanese goods. The depreciation in sterling and the rupee imposes an extra handicap on Japanese competition, while the maintenance of the Is. Qd. ratio leaves British goods unaffected by the fall in the gold value of the rupee ; and if a 40 per cent, duty were now to be imposed on Japanese goods, all that has been said in the past about the interests of the consumer would be universally held to have been exposed as hollow. The measure would therefore have to be justified on the ground that it was desirable to make a new departure, and grant a preferential rate of duty to British goods, not in India&apos;s interests but in those of Great Britain. This would be wholly inconsistent with the previous declarations of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Government of India on the subject of Imperial preference so far as India is concerned, for the line taken has always been that preferences for British goods granted on Imperial grounds must be offered spontaneously hy India, and not imposed upon her from outside.I cannot conceal from you the fact that &quot;the insistence by His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot; on any scheme for increasing the British preference on cotton piece-goods would place yet another severe strain on the unity of my Government. I could not ask my Indian colleagues to undertake the burden of defending a highly unpopular measure which they themselves would feel to bo conceived purely in British interests. But the difficulty does not stop there. Both Rainy and Schuster feel that ihey could not, after the speeches they made in March 1930, sponsor the measure desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government, without completely losing public character. You might refer especially to Rainy*s speech on the Cotton Bill, 27th March 1930. Whereas, in other matters, the position seems to me that the Government of India are ultimately bound by the orders of the British Government, in tariff matters they have been granted freedom to arrive at their own decisions, and cannot shelter themselves by any plea, expressed or implied, that they had to carry out the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Nothing they could say would convince anyone that the plan had not been dictated from Great Britain, and the controversy would react very harmfully on the discussions about commercial relations at the Round-Table Conference. It is not at all impossible that India might adopt a general measure of Imperial preference as a voluntary act in the future.   An attempt nowFrom Viceroy, 26th September 1931.349      75   9.31
to enforce such a measure would destroy this hope, and it might even revive a controversy which would make the retention of existing measures of preference impossible.   The political results would, of course, he grave.Finally, there are two arguments which, to my mind, are conclusive against your proposal. It is highly improbable that the measure could be passed by a majority in the Assembly, &apos; and certification, therefore, would be necessary. I could not possibly interpret my powers under section 67b of the Government of India Act as authorising me to certify a measure of this kind. In the second place, the measure, if passed into law, would not improve the position of British cotton goods, but make it very much worse ; for the agitation which woidd follow would result in a tightening of the boycott to a point far in excess of anything we,have yet seen.It is with great regret that I find myself unable to meet the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government at a time when their difficulties are so great. But I am bound to let you know my clear conviction that what they are asking me to do is an impossibility. I have considered whether there would be the slightest chance of getting an unofficial member to propose an amendment to the Finance Bill on these lines ; but I am afraid that there is no chance of inducing even a representative of the Bombay mill-owners to do so.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 2Qth September 1981.15 U. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram, 26th September. Cotton duties. Cabinet naturally feel grave disappointment at attitude you have found yourself compelled to adopt. They recognise, however, that they cannot impose their view upon you, and in the circumstances have no alternative but to acquiesce.
