HANKEYsSecretary,  Cabinet,Whitehall Gardens;  S0W. 1. September 14th,  1931.
The seriousness of the financial difficulties which are engaging public attention is perhaps not fully realised because of the constant use of technical terms such as the &quot;gold standard&quot;,  &quot;depreciated currency&quot;,  &quot;flight from the p ound &quot; ,  1&apos; i ill&apos; la t i o n &quot; ,  &quot;ex cha nge s11 e to.It may therefore bo useful briefly to set out the elementary fa cts 0Great Britain is a very small country of under 90;000 square miles with a very large population cf about 45,000y000.With the exception of coal the scarcity of natural resources within her own borders is such that she has to rely on other countries for the bulk cf the raw materials required for her industries;    and the measure of her dependence on other countries for food supplies may be illustrated by the fact that for ten months in the year her broad comes from abroad in other words Great Britain,  in order that her populatlon may live at all, has to obtain from other countries the basic necessaries of existence.,      And in the extent and nature of this dependence on other countries Great Britain :1s quite unique.These other countries require of course to be paid for the commodities we need from them.Originally the only method of payment known to man (when he dicta.&apos; t thieve) was the barter or exchange of one person&apos;s handiwork or produce for another1sj    but with the gradual development and therefore increasing intricacy of production and trade at home - and later, as intercourse between different countries grew, of what we now call inter-national   trade - this simple system of exchange proved in-adequate.      So it was found necessary to introduce a special
intermediary which we call money and this token came to be known as coins and later, more comprehensively, as currencies. It served the double purpose of providing a measure of value and of opening up limitless opportunities of exchange (buying and selling);    in other words it made possible a generally understood price and easy trading.In the course of time this special intermediary, or medium of exchange, became identified with the precious metals, gold and silver;    and for many centuries purchases were effected with coins made of these two materials.      (Other metals like copper - or more recently nickel - circulate internally as a subsidiary coinage).      The scarcity of gold gave it the higher and more stable value, and therefore by degrees it came to be accepted as the international measure of values and medium of exchange.      Its very scarcity, however, coupled with its weight and bulk made its everyday use as the medium of trade, and especially of international trade, increasingly difficult as that trade developed;    and in time it came to be replaced by paper tokens such as bank notes, cheques and other bills of exchange - that is undertakings in writing to pay - which of course have no value as mere bits of paper but only in so far as they correspond with real values in goods (or services) and ultimately in gold.     Each country has its own currency - e.g. dollars, francs, pounds -and so long as the currency of a country    (whether in the form of bank notes or cheques and other bills of exchange) is accepted internationally as the equivalent of gold or its value in goods or services, as is at present the case with these three currencies, the capacity of that country to purchase abroad on the strength of its paper undertaking to pay is exactly the same as if it had actual gold to ship.
This practice of using pieces of paper like cheques and other bills of exchange -- or in toe case of small trans -actions bank notes - for effecting payments must., Iroweye&apos;r, not be allowed to blind us to the fact that the goads supplied to us by other countries are really in exchange for goods which we supply to them or work which we do for them or represent payment for interest due from them to us on our investments.-abroad.      If these goods and services provided by us are not enough, gold has1to be paid *      Other countries will only supply us with goods to the combined value of these ingredients of purchasing power and no amount of pieces of paper., however binding their terms, will secure anything for us  except to the extent that the paper represents real values and therefore commands conf 16 ones *7,. Of the work which we do for other countries enimportant part is to act as a sort of international banker, in which capacity we receive    on deposit very large sums of foreign money.    This foreign currency is, on receipt by us j converted into English currency and we use the money in just the same way as aa ordinary bank or savings bank uses the money of its customers,- namely we re-lend It at a profit for the purpose of financing all kinds of commercial and other transactions. This use of foreign money banked here is of great value to us all and xs far more than just a means of livelihood for the people actually engaged in the business;    for it enables  60,000^000 cf our import requirements  to bo paid for and we should have to do without them if this particular type of business were lost.8. This &quot;invisible export&quot; as it is called is one ofour ways cf paying for imports, but its contJ.nua.aee depends on our retaining the confidence of our foreign depositors.    This means that they must feel sure that whenever  they want their money back In full they can be certain of getting It
.....    184(reconverted of course into their own currency):.      Here again we see the comparison w ith a bank or savings bank;    for, if the institution is sound in itself, no difficulties arise un-less the depositors get doubtful or f right en ed about    the safety of their deposits in the bank, when at once a &quot;run&quot; commences and the bank has to put up its shutters,  as the proportion of the money which the bank has kept in hand,  i. e. does not put to profitable use by lending;,  is quite insufficient to meet the demands of its customers for immediate repayment of their deposits in full.In other words the foundation cf all banking business is the confidence of the customers in the bank&apos;s stability; it is this confidence which leaves the bank free to -put most of the money entrusted to its care to profitable use.The moment that the owners of the foreign depositsin London begin to feel any doubt about the safety of their money,  they want to have their money back and a &quot;run&quot; commences. And, as they of course want that money in the currency of their own country,   it is no use offering them  1 or 10s/- notes or cheques drawn in our currency, for these are (or may become) from their point of view mere pieces of paper. 9. Now the self-same reason which makes the foreigndepositor nervous about the security of his money here makes it difficult for us to obtain the necessary amount of foreign currency (e.g.  dollars or francs)  to repay him on demand.That reason is that the combined aggregate of the ingredients of purchasing power (other than gold) mentioned in paragraph 6 above by means of which we pay for the goods we have ordered from abroad is insufficient to pay for the goods ordered,  and therefore we have been buying goods &quot;on tick&quot;. This means that we owe foreigners on balance more than they owe,-4- :&quot; &apos; &apos;   &apos;
us,  and that consequently we are short of dollars or francs. Such a state of affairs,  if it continues,  eventually reacts on the foreign deposits banked with us;    for it begins to raise a doubt in the mind of the depositor whether he can get back his money (in his own currency) whenever he wants it. A &quot;run&quot; therefore  starts:    and as in consequence of our being &quot;down&quot; on balance in our international trade there are no dollars or francs owing to us (but on the contrary we are in debt),  we cannot lay hands on these foreign currencies and have to pay out gold in the foreigners woo are calling in their deposits.And as the total of these foreign deposits here is equivalent to several hundred millions of gold pounds, it is clear that, even if we parted with the last ounce cf our gold reserve,  we should still be quite unable to repay in full trie majority of our foreign creditors.10. Unless the position can be rectified in time so asto  stop the &quot;run&quot;  the result would be that we  should have defaulted and these unfortunate people who had relied on the traditional fair name and credit of this country would have been bilked of at all events some of their money.11. It will have been seen from paragraph 9 above thatthe root cause of the &quot;run&quot;  on the part of the foreign depositor is the fact of our living beyond our means as evidenced by our ordering from abroad more goods than we could pay for,  and therefore our owing to other countries more in dollars and francs than they owe to us in sterling.12. Closely associated with this fact in the foreignmind is the question of cur national Budget.      After the wara certain number of countries continued tc have difficultiesin balancing their budgets and instead of pulling in theirbelts resorted to the expedient of meeting deficits byprinting innumerable bank or currency notes.      V/he never this-5-
was done, the national currency lost much or all of its value i,e., purchasing power,  and with tho corresponding rise in prices hardship, even hunger, was widespread.      At the same time the foreign investor in the country lost most if not all of his money.      Consequently, when any of these countries subsequently desired financial assistance from other countries before the citisens of the latter could be induced to lend, they insisted on the borrowing country balancing its budget. And no one was more emphatic than ourselves in preaching this doctrine.A national Budget has thus come to be regarded as a touchstone of a country&apos;s financial stability second only in importance to its international balance of trade;    and if, as the case at present with us, we are &quot;down&quot; on our balance of trade with other countries, foreigners to whom we owe money automatically turn a microscope on to our Budget.      And if the Budget is not really balanced, but  is merely dressed up to look as though it were;    or again if the national expendi-ture is of a scope and type such as to involve  (by means of taxation) taking people&apos;s saved up capital and spending it as if it were recurrent income, the distrust abroad of our soundness would be intensified.And any expectation that we might continue  on a &quot;rake&apos;s progress&quot; would complete the destruction of inter-national confidence and thus result  in the final collapse of our greatest asset,  i.e.,  our credit.The picture described in the preceding paragraphs is that of a densely populated country practically devoid of natural resources  (except coal)  and therefore unable to exist without importing food and raw materials which have to be s bought from other countries - and this country ordering from abroad more goods than it can pay for, being called on to repay in full the foreign deposits entrusted to  it,  and
simultaneously indulging in an unsound Budget.A country consequently with its international credit undermined.Up to this time its currency  (or medium of exchange as described in paragraph 6 above), -viz; the pound sterling, has for international purposes been valued and accepted as the equivalent of a gold pound or of 4. OS dollars or ,124 francs.Once, however,  the facts of our international trading position make it clear to foreign countries that the 17th century taunt&quot;In matters of commerce the fault of the Dutch&quot;Is giving too little and asking too much&quot; is coming home to roost,  ana that neither as traders nor as bankers are we any longer able to pay  in full what we owe to foreigners,  there will be a drain on our gold reserves until we cease to be able to supply gold to meet the balance of our liabilities.        Then the link between sterling and other currencies will be broken ana the value of the pound in relation to those currencies will fall.       (This is what  is called going off the gold standard).      It will not be possible to stop this fall so long as we still have to pay foreigners more than they have to pay us;    while  its pace will be accentuated by the legitimate desire on the part  of foreigners with deposits or other convertible assets in sterling to change them into currencies which have a stable value,  such as dollars or francs.The point or points to which the pound will be written down will depend on a combination of factors;    but,  if (say)   it were to sink to a value of 2.43 dollars  (or 62 francs) in effect a nominal ill will as a measure of value have become an actual 10s/-,
i-bus? fov examplej Americans would find that for every pound that they have on deposit here (at 4,86 to the pound)  tho3r would only get back the equivalent of 2,43 dollars,  and they woul naturally be reluctant to run the risk of a similar experience in. future.15o    With the   sterling reduced by half as a measure of value,  its purchasing power over foreign goods is also halvedj and therefore,  whereas hitherto  25 would secure 120 dollars&apos; worth cf goods  the  same number of pounds would now secure only 60 dollars&apos;  worth.As we are dependent for our existence on imports fromabroad the price of such commodities here is doubled and the amount we can buy for a    pound is halved-    The  extent of the drop in the purchasing rower of each pound may be influenced by other conditions as well;  and one of the most important of these if the pound is not to sink to nothing -. is  the readiness on the part of us all to continue working for the same number of nominal pounds as before the slide In its value (called depreciation) had commenced.-    Mow suppose  1 becomes equivalent to 10/- this would mean not only that food,   clothing etc; will cost us twice as much; but   that everyone who has put his savings in Savings Certificates,  or on deposit at Savings Banks or in any other form of security will have been deprived of half its value cIf in an attempt to relieve  this position we proceeded to print sufficient additional   notes so that each of us should have  2 for every  1 which we previously had.  (a process known as inflation),  we should merely make matters worse; the value of the   might be further reduced in relation to dollars or francs  (i,e*  the equivalent of gold) and the number of  &apos;s required, to obtain goods abroad would be increased accordingly;  at the same time the price of  articles in terms of the   would  again rise,  and consequently the purchasing power
of the pound would sink again (say)  to 5/-*    And so on. 16c    The remedy is to reverse the process which has been responsible for the trouble,  and this means that?  instead cf living at a level which has entailed ordering abroad more goods than we can pay for, we must relate our orders to our capacity to payable    And unless we can produce and sell abroad more goods (including &quot;services&quot;) than we have been doing, wo shall be forced to cut down our orders abroad,  and our standard of living must be reduced accordingly., 17,    Provided that we do this - and also abstain from unsound Budgets - the international value of the   will not deteriorate further; and,  although the cost of our imports reckoned in terms of pounds will continue higher than hitherto it has been,  this may be offset by the fact that the foreigner may be ready to buy more of our exports than before as instead of having to pay 4o86 dollars or 124 francs for  1&apos;s worth of commoditier3,  he will not have to pay more than (cay)  2o43 dollars or 62 francsoThis latter result is, however,  conditional on foreign countries not raising their tariff walls so as to preve: what they might regard as &quot;dumping&quot;o18o    Two very important heads of our export trade (which are Included in the expression &quot;invisible exports&quot;) will, however,  in any event have been crippled,  probably for ever.As already mentioned in paragraph 7 above, London has for many generations been regarded by the world as a sort of international Lank (or safe),  and in that capacity has received on deposit very large sums of foreign money which have been put to profitable use by re-lending and have earned some 60,000,000 a year towards the payment of our imports^
Obviously if we fail to repay tho foreign depositor, or only repay him part of his deposit, he is not in future going to entrust his ircney to us; and by degrees, and sooner rather than later, he will choose a centre , e,g, Now York or Paris, where he can leave his money without the risk of being defrauded,,19. The other part of our export trade lust referred tois the interest due to us from our investments overseas.    This has helped in tho past to pay for some of the imports we need to  an extent exceeding  200,000,000 a year.    As most of these investments are in the form of sterling, and the interest is therefore calculated in pounds, the immediate result of a fall (say) by half in the international value of the   would be that we should receive commodities to the value of little more than half what we hitherto have had, perheps not much more than  100,000,000 worth.20. Thus our capacity to purchase.se what we need fromabroad would, be reduced, under these two heads alone, by about  160,000,000 a year if we failed (and it would ha^e been through our own fault)  to maintain the international value of our   sterling.Therefore our standard of living -- which has been higher than that in Europe largely because of those receipts from abroad on account of our past loans and. of cur special banking services - would change for the worse, cm-n though we were to  succeed by self-denial in diminishing the adverse balance of trade in the sphere of visible exports and Imports ice. of commodities. 21. And our prestige duo to  the universal belief over thecenturies that we are eommerci ally and financially honest will
have been destroyed for ever0    The epitaph of us English of to-day will be written by historians to come in Shakespeare&apos; words (Richard II, Act 2, Scene l)  -&quot;England, bound in with the triumphant sea, &quot;whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege &quot;Of watery heptune, is now bound in with shame, &quot;With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds: &quot;That England, that was wont to conquer others, &quot;Hath made a shameful conquest of itselfc&quot;T r e a sury Ch ainb e r s,u o d JoSeptember 11th, 1931.
