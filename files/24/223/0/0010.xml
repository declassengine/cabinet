G^A B i N E j\C.P-214(31) Reasons for proceeding with the LONDON Copy No. ^PASSENGER TRANSPORT BILL daring the forthcoming special Session of Parliament.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTRY OP TRANSPORT,1.    The Bill was subjected to a most exhaustive and critical examination by a Joint Select Committee representative of all parties.     The Committee proceedings occupied 35 Parliamentary days, spread over a period of 3 months.     If the Bill is dropped, the large amount of time, money and effort expended on its promulgation would he wasted.     Apart from the heavy costs incurred by the various petitioners, some  35,000 expended in connection with the Bill in the shape of Counsels&apos; and Accountants&apos; fees and similar items would fall to be borne finally by the Exchequer instead of being recovered from the Transport Board, as provided in the Bill.2.    During the proceedings in Committee, agreements were reached between the Minister and by far the greater majority of the interests concerned.(a) Complete agreement was reached with the UndergroundGroup of Companies, (railway, omnibus and tramway companies) both on the principles of the Bill and the terms of transfer.      These companies represent over 75 per cent, of, the interests proposed to be merged under the new Board.(b) Apart from the objection of the London County Councilto the proposed composition of the Transport Board to which reference is made later, practically complete agreement has been reached with the 14 local authorities owning tramways in the London Traffic Area.
Xnew Company has been inserted by agreement inXthe Bill.The Committee listened to prolonged arguments on theclaim to be paid in cash.     All the other interests concerned (except the small independent omnibus proprietors, who are given the option of cash) have agreed to accept stock of the new Board, and to require the Board in the early days of its existence to raise on the market in cash the amount required to satisfy the Metropolitan ordinary v stockholders would he unreasonable.     Sir WilliamMoLintock very strongly took this view.In the case of the XortcLon County tknrncril and theCounty Councils of Middlesex and Hertfordshire, the terms of transfer have been agreed and the exact amounts of stock to he issued are specified in the Bill.In the case of Bexley and Ilford, their opposition has been met by providing that the terms upon which their tramways undertakings are to be transferred to the new Board shall, failing agreement, be settled by the Arbitration Tribunal.All the remaining local authorities concerned are in complete agreement with the Bill as it now stands.The main points made by the Metropolitan RailwayCompany were:-(l) that they should be excluded from the compulsory merger of London Passenger Transport interests and treated as though they were a main line, or(2) that, if included in the merger, theirshareholders (or at least their ordinary shareholders)  should be given the option of taking cash or stock.  -They also objected to the taking over by the new board of their Surplus Lands Committee.The last point has been conceded and the necessary machinery for converting this Committee into a
In the event, It was successfully contended bythe Promoters that the Metropolitan shareholders would suffer no injustice in being required to take stock in the new undertaking in exchange for that now held in their own undertaking.   This follows the precedent of the Railways Act,1921. The claim that the Metropolitan Railway Company Is a main line and should bo treated like the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, for example, Is untenable,    Its small goods traffic, which consist mainly of coal,  is hauled for about 2 miles only over a section of the Inner Circle.   The great bulk of its traffic Is purely suburban passenger traffic and the average fare per passenger Is 2^d. Any scheme which proposed to coordinate London transport and left the Inner Circle and other sections of the Metropolitan line in independent hands would be a makeshift and incomplete arrange-ment and the complete absorption of the line presents no difficulty.It may be added that no single Interest called any traffic witness throughout the proceedings to contest the principles on which the Bill is based and which require the complete fusion of all the interests other than those of the main lines, whose suburban lines cannot be physically separated from the rest of their undertaking and can, therefore, only be brought within the scope of the co-ordination through a pooling of receipts, (d)   The Tilling Group of Omnibus Companies have   all along accepted the general scheme of the Bill and the only question outstanding with them was
that of terms.     The Bill leaves the terms to be determined, failing agreement, by the Arbitration Tribunal under directions settled by the Joint Committee after hearing the views of all parties. This, it is understood, removes any further opposition from the Tilling Group.Complete agreement has been reached with theimportant Provincial Omnibus Companies who operate in the areas contiguous to the London Traffic Area. This agreement includes the Main Line Companies in so far as they are financially Interested in the operations of these Omnibus Companies.With regard to the smaller omnibus and coachcompanies affected by the Bill, all points of substance in their opposition have been met and the Joint Committee were obviously satisfied that the interests of the smaller men and companies would be adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the Bill as amended.Tho interests of the manufacturers, gas water and electricity undertakers, who petitioned against the Bill, have been adequately safeguarded by amondments or clauses inserted during the Committee stage. In most cases the amendments or new clauses were agreed with the interests concerned.
^      7 8(h) Since the Bill received a Second Reading,complete agreement has heen reached with the four Amalgamated Railway Companies,   The Bill, as now amended, sets up a pool of passenger receipts betv/een the Board and these companies and this scheme of compulsory pooling constitutes one of the most important and far-roachlng proposals in the Bill.    It is an arrangement to which the Amalgamated Companies attach the utmost Importance as safeguarding them in future from uneconomic road competition.    It also provides the best prospect of further suburban electrification otherwise than by the aid of State subsidies.(i) Complete agreement has been reached with the variousTrade Unions and Associations representing the officers and other employees of the various undertakings to be transferred, with regard to terms of transfer, superannuation funds, etc. Agreement has also been reached with all the important Unions concerned for the establishment of a Statutory &apos;.wages Machinery relating to certain grades.   These arrangements are accepted by the National Associations of Local Government Officers, (The Clerical staff of the London County Council claimed special rights of representation which the Joint Committee decided not to allow,)It will be seen that the criticisms made against the Bill on Second Reading have been largely met. Agreement has been reached as to terms cf transfer with interests representing over 90 per cent, of the passengers carried in the area and 82 per cent, of the capital Involved.       As regards remaining
interests,  the directions to the Arbitration Tribunal as to compensation have been modified by the Joint Committee to meet objections raised.      The power to manufacture has been deleted (apart from a circumscribed right to manufacture bodies of omnibuses as is now being done on a large scale by the London General Omnibus Company in its existing shops at Chiswick). In various other directions, amendments restricting the powers of the Board and clauses protective of special interests have been inserted.      In particular the powers of the Minister have been curtailed and his power to order the provisions of new facilities is restricted so that he must have regard to the desirability of the establishment and maintenance by the Board of an adequate reserve fund and is debarred from making any order which would preclude the Board from complying with their obligations to meet the various charges on their revenue or would necessitate the raising of additional capital, save with the 3oard&apos;s consent, or an application by the Board to Parliament for additional powers.The only important points which may be said to be possibly still at issue are:-(i)    The proposal of the London County Council that the new Board should be subject to an over-riding authority composed as to one-third of Local Authority representatives, the remaining two-thirds being found from representatives of finance, labour and the central Government. This proposal was debated very fully before the Joint Committee and definitely rejected as an unsuitable type of organisation for managing and directing the business of London Passenger Transport.
The Committee very fully considered the suggestion, which was not pressed, that the Board should contain an element elected oy the stockholders or certain classes of the stockholders.     It was pointed out that this would go far towards depriving the Board of its character as a public authority.      Neither in the case of the Central Electricity Board, nor the Port of London Authority, nor any of the Statutory Dock Commissioners is provision made for election by holders of the Authority&apos;s stocks.     Moreover, it was pointed out that if partial representation was accorded to the stockholders it would not be possible to refuse representation to labour, to local authorities in the area and possibly to other sectional interests.     The whole conception of management by a business board would then be destroyed.It was further pointed out that it would not be practicable to confer monopolistic powers over the very wide area involved upon a body controlled by the stockholders through election of the Board, unlest extensive powers of regulation and control were invested in the Minister, a course which was open to objection on many grounds.After seeking various alternatives the Joint COi.jaitteeeventually accepted as the mo&amp;t appropriate the scheme propounded in the Bill.(ii) The claims of the Metropolitan Railway Company to be satisfied in cash or to be treated as a Main Line Railway Company and included in the pooling arrangement may be revived out they will receive no support from the liain Lines or other interests and have been definitely rejected by the Joint Committee.
The financial settlements with the Underground-Group of Companies have been based on the assumption that the undertakings of these companies will be transferred to the new Board on the 1st January, 19:52-     The settlements with Local Authorities assume that transfer will take place on the 1st April, 19^2.Any postponement of the Bill may, therefore, affect the financial structure of these settlements and might result in the re-opening of the whole question of terms.It would, in any case, be necessary to embark at considerable expense upon further investigation of current figures and to keep some check upon the financial operations of the companies.Moreover, delay in putting the Bill upon the Statute Book and in setting up the Board would leave an interval during which, as the experience of the last two years has shewn many awkward questions may arise from the settlement of which the Government could hardly hold aloof.      In undertakings of this scope and variety business cannot stand still, and the management is forced to take action in many ways which may affect the interests of a future Board. Lord Ashfield has made a practice of consulting the Minister before taking any steps v/hich might he held prejudicially to affect future public policy and would no doubt continue todo   SO.Finally, it may be urged that the very real advantage of complete co-ordination ought not to be postponed.     The economic waste involved by the present system delays and obstructs much needed public improvements and the position of the Main Line Companies will be increasingly serious if they are left exposed to the intensified competition of the &quot;Green Line&quot; and other coach services in the suburban area.
5.1 at August. 1951 .In view of the entire absence ef serious objection to the traffic principles on which the Bill is based and of the very large measure of agreement reached as to financial terms, it is submitted that any opposition to the Bill proceeding through its further stages can be confined to very narrow limits, even if it cannot be removed altogether.There are certain matters in which the late Government might have wished to alter some of the amendments made in Committe The power to manufacture bodies of motor vehicles is so restricted as to be illogical, inconvenient and uneconomical, The Arbitration Clause, as it now stands, may possibly have the result of enabling the independent omnibus proprietors, for example, to secure compensation on a basis which would not ordinarily be accorded by a commercial arbitrator to undertakings of that kind. There&apos; flfcay be a few other points upon which, apart from drafting, amendments would be desirable in the interests of the Board, but, generally speaking, it is thought that- the Board might start its existence substantially on the terms of the Bill as amended in Committee and be left to seek any additional powers or protection it may require by promoting subsequent legislation of its own in due course as it v/ould be entitled to doIt may be added that the scheme embodied in the Bill entails no charge on public funds and no burden on public credit.(lntTd) C.&quot;&apos;Y.H.
