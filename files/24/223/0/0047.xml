The Enquiries at tho home Ports into eases of hardship arising out oi the changes in Service pay, etc 0 which the Board of Admiralty wore authorised to hold by Cabinet Minute of the 15th instant were completed on tho 23rd instant,  and the Commanders-iu-Chiefs1 Reports have received careful consideration Pay.Very large numbers of men submitted detailed balance sheets showing their present and probable future financial condition, and many of them vhese cases were typical of large classes wore examined as witnessescThe in.Iox-mat ion. obtained, entirely here out the representations previously received that very great numbers of men,  owing to family and other commitments entered into In the belief that their scales of pay were secured to them, would be involved in most serious financial difficultios if reduced to the 1925 rates, and that even the reduction of 10$ from the 1919 rates will involve them in very serious difficulties.,   The evidence also makes it clear that a main factor in the case is tha great difficulty in obtaining married quarters at the Naval Ports, which results in the lower paid married men having to pay enormous rents or to enter into heavy commitments for the purchase of houses.    I would point out  (because it explains a great deal ) that this is a hardship which does not affect the other Services to anything like the same extent.At the same time there was a practically universalrecognition of the fact that sacrifices were required fromeveryone 0.*lent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government. )^        R^BUCTICbG IN SERVICE PAY Allf^ PahSIOUS. Memo rand uiq by tne Pirst Lord of the^ Admiralty,
- Z-everyone and th--.it the Navy mast take its fall chare, and the publication, of the Prime minister1 s announcement of the 81st September, ,\&apos;hich was telegraphed in extenso tc the Ports, had an immediate effect  in allaying anxiety and unrest and was recognised as being a fair solutionoIt must be emphasised, however, that the inter-protation put upon this statement by the men., by the officers and by the Admiralty representatives ares that the men now receiving the 1919 scales of pa- would continue to receive these scales of pay for the future and in whatever rating they might hold,  subject to a reduction which would be limited to 10$.,   No other interpretation was ever in the mind of the Boar of Admiralty when making their recommendation which led to the original cuts being modified, and our calculations of the cost of the concession were based on this reading of it.My attention has since been drawn tc the fact that the Air Liinistry consider that tho concession announced oy the Prime Minister was intended merely to limit the immediate reduction to be suffered by an individual on the 1st October next and that it doss not secure to him the continuance of 1919 rates less 10$ on completion of a further incremental period or on promotion to a higher rating. *I desire to represent most earnestly that if this interpretation is now applied the disappointment in the Naval Sarviee will be intense.    It will be felt that a concession which met the needs of the case satisfactorily has been sub-sequently whittled away into one which is quite inadequate, and I fear that influences will be quickly at work amongst the men suggesting that they have been subject to a clever deception on tho part of the authorities aI cannot overstate the importance of net appearing at this moment to take away with one hand, a large part of what has just been given with the other0The ....
The Board of Admiralty do not see the  samo objection to a limitation of the concession to a man.Ts present Service engagement.    Even this restriction will be unexpected and will cause some disappointment;, but on the other band., the Enquiries showed a general appreciation amongst the men of the fact that though it m?.y be unwelcome it is nor, unfair that a. man should be required to accept changed conditions as regards pay and pension when he comes to re-engage for a further period. Pensions.The Enquiries have also revealed the existence;, particularly amongst the older men, including the Chief Petty Officers and Petty Officers,  of a deep feeling of grievance at the decision zo change pension conditions for men who have already entered into their final engagement to complete time for pens!on0It will be recollected that hitherto it has been laid down that a sailor,  soldier or airman is entitled on finally leaving the Service of the Grown to the benefit of the pension scheme offered to him when he first entered that Service.   The May Committee recommended that this undertaking should be repudiated, and in accordanca with their recommendation, the White Paper has laid down that 17the pension rates of man in &quot;the Services will In future be determined by the scheme in &quot;force at the date when the man enters upon his final engagement &quot;which qualifies him for pension&quot;.   But although this principle has been laid down,  it has bean at once departed from by the Government decision that men already in their final engagement qualifying them for pension shall not have the bans fit of the scheme in force when they entered upon that engagement, but shall be pensioned on a different basis which reduces the amount of pension in some cases by as much as l&amp;fc0It was evident at the Enquiries that the Navy as awhole regarded the decisions as to Service pensions in ad i fforoutvj.
diffarent light from those as to Service pay.    In the case of pay it was recognised that the Government has been compo.ll.od to cancel what wore intended to be binding promises, because ox the existence of a national crisis which could bo mat  in no other way, and the obligation on the Services to make thai, contribution to the needs of the country was fully admittedv although it was urged that the burden originally pat upon tha was unfairly adjusted-    In the case of pensions, on the other hand,  it was pointed out that the reductions mada will not have any appreciable financial results for some years and therefore can have no relation to the present crisis, end tha question was asked whether in those circumstances it is just that the Q-cyer.mae.1958-59; should so flagrantly brook faith, with the Services0   finally, it was urged that a man, at the time when he is required to decide whether to re-engage for pension or not,  should know for certain what pension scheme will bo applied to him, and that he should not thereafter ba prejudic by any subsequent change of scheme 0    In other words., the man asked that the principle recommended by the May Committee and laid down in the Government1 s White Paper shall be observed,, I confess that I find the merits case unanswerable * I would observev too, that it was anr.oo_n.ced in the House of Commons last Friday that in the case of the Police r has been decided that the reductions in pensions which formed part of the May Committee1s recommendations shall not be carried out, and that &quot;police pensions arc to be left &quot;unimpaired by the economies now being made0;;sTrue, the systems upon which police pensions and Service pensions axe awarded are different, and I do not pretend to have studied tha case sufficiently closely to know what bearing these differences have upon it,    But I am sure that the publication of this decision at this moment will have made a great impression in the Ifavy9 where the treatment
of these re-engaged men is a banning quest ion,I urge strongly therefore that the pensions of men in their final engagement,  or eligible to re-engage before the 1st October, shall also &quot;Tbe left unimpaired by the &quot;economies now being madeDnPeriod o:g Oraoefor men to decide as to re-engagement,This is a minor point, but one which, I think, shoul be mentioned to the Cabinet 0In view of representations made at the Enquiries. it is considers! very important that men eligible to re-engage on or before the 1st October should be allowed a period of grace in which to decide whether to do so cr not *In view of all that has occurred, the date 1st October gives quite insufficient time for men approaching the end. of their first engagement, particularly those serving abroad,, to weigh up the effects of the changes and to decide whether to re-engage or net o    A rigid, adnerenee to the 1st October would, undoubtedly result in many men hastily deciding to leave the Navy who would re-engage if they could give the question mere mature consi&amp;ex*ation without prejudicing their conditions of service after re-engagement 0    It is props ed therefore to grant three months1  grace in which to decide whether to x*o-engage as frcm the 1st October to men. eligible to re-engage on or before that date e    It is understood that th War Office also propose to give a period of grace suited to th needs of the Army,    It is not a matter in which absolute uniformity is of importance.(Int d ).
