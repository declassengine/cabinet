THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.C R &amp; T  .COPY NO,247 (51).CABINET.. NOTES BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON A GENERAL ELECTION.I.Between last Monday when I went out of action and Friday when I returned, I found that contrary to my expectations the controversy about a General Election had increased rather than abated.      I have got in touch with well-informed people and have considered the position during the week-end.I think the Government ought to have striven to effect some measure of Currency stability and show its ability to meet some of the new problems before going to the country, because with no achievement except cuts and extra taxation, we shall be. open to a serious attack, especially amongst the great mass of people who even now do not understand what all the bother is about and who are more confused than enlightened by what is to them a most unnatural political combination.      An Opposition which can use platforms can make so much play with this that the verdict may not be quite so emphatic as would justify an immediate appeal in order to give a Government power and confidence in itself.      This consideration has become more important since last Monday. Moreover we cannot now avoid prices rising whilst the election is proceeding, and in addition to the political handicap which
this will be  it will lead to promises being given by candidates of all parties which will present the new Government with serious difficulties.      The pure case for and against an election has been changed during the past week,I am assured, however., that the unsettlenient in the public mind has gone so far on account of propaganda in favour of an Election that it has become politically impossible for this Government to continue in office for any length of time and that it must venture now.      I must draw attention to the effect upon the financial risks, however.      It may affect, most seriously, for the time being,  international confidence,  and whilst that unsettle-ment exists markets may well be disastrous.      On the other hand,  If we continue to hang on whilst the Opposition pursues its propaganda,  the law-and-order condition of the country deteriorates; and the newspapers conduct their campaign for and against a General Election,  a state of un-settlement more prolonged than the former and equally disastrous will have to be faced.I hope that a decision in favour of an Election will not be taken lightly and without a most  careful re-survey of the political situation.
ZllSupposing vse agree that an Election has become inevitable, we have settled very little and we must face election problems:(a)    How are we tc go to the country?      Quite obviously, if we cannot go as we now exist,  se go weakened as an embodiment of national unity.      If, for one reason or another,  the attack of the present Opposition is augmented by any section of the Liberal Party, a national appeal suffers in its force and.becomes much more a Party appeal both in its accents and its spokesmen.      This is how the battle-fronts will  be composed:      In Opposition... the whole Labour Party with its machine and about half the Liberal Party;    for the Government, the whole Conservative Party, the rest of the Liberal Party - some Members of which have already to all intents and purposes left that Party - and something like a score of independent Labour candidates without a machine and without an organised political existence.      It would be quite impossible to make that battle array appear to any of the solid mass of electors as anything but a Party fight.    The influence which some of us may have on account of the proofs we have given that, in view of the present crisis we are out for national interest and are unmoved by Party consideration , would be greatly diminished in such a contest, and the ordinary person who has got no great faith in political leaders of any kind w-uld just say that we were either a. lot of boobies allowing ourselves to be used for other people&apos;s purposes, or that ..e had sold the pass.
I put the question to rnys-elf whether--such a fight as that -would he in the national interest or would maintain the splendid reputation which this country has gained all over the world owing to what has happened recently,  and whether in the long run it would be good for any Party or for the political life of this country.      I have to answer these questions in  the negative.A national appeal must be made by those who have formed the National Government.(b) Can we go t&quot; the country as we are now and maintainboth the appearance and the reality of a Government united in facing the immediate problems which surround us? I  think we could if we had sufficient confidence in,  and thoughtfulness for,  each other ana the country.We should have to lay down quite definitely that circumstances were such as to necessitate a vote of confidence from the country;    that, because situations changed from day to du.y and problems altered their aspects very frequently during such times of change as these, whatever Government is in office requires not only to feel that the country is behind it In dealing with these changing problems, but that it has an unchiftable majority in the House of Commons fresh from the electors,  and not from a parliament which has already lived half its life and which keeps the Government in office by a combination which was not contemplated until quite recently*The purpose of  the new Government will be to continue the work of setting the finances of the country in order and putting them on a sound foundation.      It must keep certain obligations firmly in front of it such as balancing the Budget, creating a favourable trade balance,
stimulating our home production, taking both the domestic and international steps necessary to protect us against a recurrence of our difficulties. For instance,  itmust he able to watch movements regarding prices, financial operations which are not in the interests of the whole nation,  and even the operation of the cuts which were so essential when our financial troubles recently overtook us,  and it must have power to deal with problems as they arise.        Quite specifically amongst those powers must be that  of using a Tariff should the financial and industrial conditions require it.(c)        I    would beg the Cabinet to consider whether a statement on such lines could receive general  . assent. -If it cannot, then I do not see how a General Election is possible except,  as the result of the break-up of the present combination, and I hope nobody will be under any delusion as to what that would mean.      If we could discover a common ground upon which to fight, the Government which would then be formed could last until the financial position was somewhat stabilised,  could see in operation a sound financial policy, and could summon and conduct the international financial conferences which must be promoted without delay.      I know it is difficult to see very far ahead but I believe that there is so much important work to  do for at least six, twelve or more months upon which we could all agree,  that  it would be in the national interest that we should try and do it together. Consider alternatives ;One is as I have described:      a division now,  a General Election fought as near as may be on old Party lines, a victory say for the general policy which we are now pursuing together,  and then a situation which must soon bring the resignation        /
of the pclitj.oa3.lj/ unattached Ministers and theestablishment of the rule of one Party originally elected to maintain a national&apos;combination.      Such an endingis impossible.      The other alternative is an election fought in combination,  a programme of workon the lines above sketched out, and in due time a division and a return to Party positions..Neither is ideally good,      But the former is mostobjectionable because it will break up national unitybefore it ought to be broken up and will put the sections which will unite as a Government duringthe Election into tne unfortunate position of eitherhaving to finish their co-operation under conditionsof a futile anti--climax or unite themselA^espermanently with the predominant Party.      The lastis impossible for some of us.       \there as, thesecond alternative  could provide for a businesslike finishto the co-operation, and an orderly return to theessential conflicts vhich arise    in the governmentof a State.1C Downing Street,(Intd,)    J.R.M.26th September, 1931.
