THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTLEAGUE OF NATIONS. July i6, 1931.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[W 8237/47/98] No. 1.Lord Tyrrell to Mr. A. Henderson. (Received July 16.)(No. 762.)Sir, Paris, Jidy 15, 1931.I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith the French text of the French Governments memorandum on the Disarmament Conference which was communicated by M. Briand to the Secretary of State to-day.(&apos;) I also enclose three copies of an English translation of this memorandum prepared in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.2. The memorandum is confidential until Friday evening, the 17th July, when it will be communicated to the press in order that it may appear in the newspapers of Saturday morning, the 18th July.I have, &amp;c.TYRRELL.Enclosure in No. 1.Memorandum.(Translation.)THE Governments that are due to take part in the General Conference for the Limitation and Reduction of Armaments nave been requested by the Council of the League of Nations to forward to the Secretariat-General before the 15th September certain particulars concerning the state of their armaments and any information of a nature to enlighten the conference of 1932 concerning them.Without awaiting the complete compilation of the figures they are desired to communicate, the Government of the Republic consider it advisable to set forth the principles and methods of French policy as regards the limitation of armaments, the extent to which they have already applied them since signing the League Covenant, and finally those conditions the fulfilment of which they deem necessary if the conference of 1932 is not to disappoint the hopes it has awakened.I.The general principles to be followed in the reduction and limitation of armaments were laid down both by article 8 of the League Covenant and by Part V of the Peace Treaties.By subscribing to article 8 of the pact the members of the League of Nations recognised &quot; that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.&quot;They agreed, moreover, that the Council of the League of Nations, &apos;&apos; taking-account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, &apos; should &apos; formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments.&quot;Article 8 of the Covenant is therefore based upon two fundamental conceptions which it is important to emphasise.The first is the idea of &quot;common action.&quot; In a system,of international solidarity like that of the League of Nations each State must have sufficient armaments to protect itself against aggression until this common action can begin to function : if left to its own unaided resources, a State unlawfully attacked must be sufficiently armed not to be overwhelmed before having had time to mobilise the whole of its national forces. It will therefore be possible for the reduction of armaments to be the more substantial in proportion as the setting in motion of the contemplated &quot; common action &quot; is less uncertain and likely to be more prompt; for this reason, successive Assemblies have urged since 1922 that(!) Knglish translation only printed.[5981] b
such mutual assistance should be &quot; immediate, effective and in accordance with a prearranged plan &quot; (Resolution XIV, 1922), if it be desired that &quot; every State should be sure of not having to provide unaided for its security by means of its own armaments, and should be able to rely also on the organised collective action of the League of Nations &quot; (Resolution V, 1927).Viewed from this angle, the limitation of armaments, in conjunction with the development of the systems for the peaceful settlement of disputes and Avith the mutual assistance, is a means of organising peace. But in order that it may be carried into effect, principle of common action must supersede in the minds of the nations that of individual defence. It implies that the League is considered by them as a living reality, invested with positive responsibilities and possessed of -effective power.Concurrently and this is the second essential idea upon which it is based -article 8 of the Covenant clearly states that the point below which national armaments cannot be reduced depends upon the degree of security enjoyed by the nation concerned.A proper estimate of this safety must take into account not only the manner in which the &apos;&apos; common action &apos;&apos; of the League will operate, but also the geographical situation and circumstances of each nation.Article 8 of the Covenant therefore clearly lays down the principle that as regards the reduction and limitation of armaments there can be no hard and fast rules; the armaments of each State constitute a whole aggregate which must necessarily be adapted to its own particular case; the notion of diversity commands the work to be undertaken. Any levelling or automatic equalisation of forces is, for this very reason, excluded a priori. Indeed, equality of armaments as between two States would only be justifiable in the unlikely event of their geographical situation and circumstances being identical.In the midst of this diversity, there is, however, one fixed element which is supplied by Part V of the Peace Treaties in close conjunction with article 8 of the Covenant.The aim and purpose of Part V of the treaties is indeed to lay down a definite standard for the armaments allotted to four Powers, which have formally pledged themselves to observe its military, naval and air clauses.By thus determining a certain standard of forces for the use of those four Powers, the framers of the treaties make it clear that tlheir purpose was to &quot;render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations.&quot;Clearly, therefore, it is in relation to the armaments allotted by the treaties to certain nations that it will be possible to prepare the limitation and reduction of the armaments of other nations.It follows that the strict observance of the standards of forces thus laid down is one of the essential prerequisites of the limitation of armaments.This fact, indeed, the successive Assemblies of the League of Nations have not failed to recognise. It by no means follows, however, that the member States of the League whose standards of forces have not been expressly defined by the treaties are under the obligation of adopting either the methods or the figures laid down in Part V of the Peace Treaties as regards the general limitation of armaments.When the treaties were framed, at no time and at no place was the argument advanced, either in speech or in writing, that other States should in their turn maintain their armaments on the level prescribed for certain States.The Covenant stipulates, on the contrary, that the reduction of armaments is to be dealt Avith in a plan drawn up by the League Council and submitted to the several Governments for their consideration and free decision. Account will be taken in this plan of the requirements of national security, of the international obligations imposed by common action, and of the geographical situation and H.rcumstances of each State.Were it to be admitted that the standards prescribed in Part V of the treaties for certain States should apply in an equal and uniform manner to other States, article 8 of the League Covenant would clearly be bereft of all value and all significance.On this system of ideas are founded the principles to be followed in the matter of the limitation and reduction of armaments, as laid down in the Covenant of the League of Nations and in the Peace Treaties.
This system has been expounded and consistently approved by the successive Assemblies of the League of Nations.The Government of the Republic have strictly conformed therewith.II.Since the coming into force of the Covenant, France has of her own accord proceeded to reduce her armaments, taking into account on the one hand her geographical situation and the circumstances for which her armaments are intended to provide and, on the other, of the progress achieved in the organisation of security.The particular circumstances of French national defence are well known.Having thrice suffered invasion in the course of a hundred years, and with extensive frontiers lying open to attack, more particularly those frontiers in close proximity to -which are concentrated the resources most essential to her economic life and national defence, France must have at her disposal land forces sufficient to protect her as surely and as promptly as their sea forces protect naval Powers.In addition, France is called upon to maintain order in an oversea Empire peopled by 60 million inhabitants, covering an area equal to twenty-three times that of the home country, some parts of which are not yet entirely pacified. She is therefore obliged to maintain two specially trained forces, one in her depen-tendencies, of the smallest size compatible with assuring their security in normal times, and a similar force in the home country, which would be available in case of emergency.In close conjunction with national defence on land, the protection of the sea frontiers, both at home and overseas, and of the essential communications between these various territories requires the co-operation of a navy sufficiently powerful to dispense the Government of the Republic from the necessity of maintaining in every part of their Empire forces sufficient to cope alone with domestic disturbances which might conceivably coincide with a foreign aggression. The level, therefore, of the naval forces of France directly affects that of her land as well as that of her air forces.Called upon to ensure the air defence of the home country, and to co-operate with the land and naval forces, the air service contributes in addition to the policing and protection of the oversea territories, which otherwise would require still larger land forces.This interdependence of the three great categories of armaments is therefore extremely important for France : she must constantly consider them in combina-tion with each other if she is properly to estimate the consequences which a measure adopted for one might have on the others.?: As for security an essential factor dominating the entire problem of the limitation and reduction of armaments and acting, one may say, as a mainspring for the functioning of article 8 of the Covenant -the French Government have, in the last ten years, unceasingly striven to make clearer, stronger and more tangible the conception of how this primary requisite is to be assured. They had all the more reason to devote their energies to this purpose that one of the foremost guarantees of French security, provided for and relied upon by the framers of the Peace Treaty, was from the very first inexistent. In consequence, they have unreservedly associated themselves with every effort undertaken at Geneva for the purpose of defining more clearly and developing on a general plane the principles of arbitration and mutual help laid down in the Covenant.The value of those efforts it is by no means their intention to belittle to-day.It must, however, be noted that the slow rate of progress hitherto achieved has not tended to speed up the task of reducing armaments. On the other hand, in a particularly sensitive European area, and one of vital interest to France, the signing of the Locarno Agreement, based upon articles 43 and 44 of the Treaty of Versailles, made for France, as well as for the other Powers adjacent to that area, a great additional contribution to the guarantees of security resulting from the strict observance of the treaties.It is by taking into account the progress thus achieved that the Government of the Republic have been able to carry into effect, primarily in their home&apos; armaments, the substantial reductions hereinafter set forth.[5981] B 2
It should be borne in mind that the figures here quoted by the Government of the Republic, as well as any others that may be embodied in a later communi-cation, ai&apos;e of no value except within the framework of the organisation of their national defence as a whole and with due regard to all the factors that may affect the prompt and efficient operation of that organisation in presence of a foreign aggression. They consequently make the most express reservations as regards any comparisons that might be drawn, without taking into account necessary explanations and corrections, between the numerical data relating to the military organisation of the republic and those concerning other countries.These reservations apply particularly to expenditure figures. They call for the utmost caution as regards the comparisons one might be tempted to make between the respective expenditure of the various countries in the matter of national defence. Such comparisons are devoid of meaning save on certain specific points and under certain well-defined conditions.Fully alive to the danger of any hasty conclusion in this matter, the French Government are prepared to supply precise data as to their expenditure on national defence on completion of the technical studies which they are having made with a view to drawing up the standard model of expenditure on the basis of the recommendations of the committee of budgetary experts.Land Forces Stationed in the Home Country.In 1921 France kept under arms only those of her citizens who had not yet discharged their peace-time obligations as laid down by the military statute then in force. At that time every French citizen was obliged by law to undergo three years of military service.In February 1922 the Government of the Republic decided to dismiss the men of each contingent at the expiration of their second year with the colours. On the 1st April, 1923, the length of military service was reduced to eighteen months. Finally, following upon the Locarno Agreement, a further reduction was spontaneously effected by the law of the 31st March, 1928, cutting down the length of service from eighteen to twelve months for all French citizens.These successive reductions have led to several consequences.The first cannot be measured in actual figures; it is important, however, to emphasise the point if the military power of France is to be estimated at its true value; men kept with the colours for one year only cannot possibly acquire a degree of military efficiency comparable to that of troops serving for two or three years. Still less can they be compared with professional troops. Hence the uecessity for the French Government of undertaking at great expense the con-struction of fortification works in order more effectually to cover the frontiers; hence, too, the necessity of increasing the number of so-called &quot; professional soldiers &quot;(2) in order to be able to train and officer two half-contingents of recruits every year, as well as to ensure the smooth working of the administrative services. In France, indeed, these professional soldiers do not constitute a regular army, distinct from the national army. In order to meet the requirements of the national army they are distributed among all its units and all its services.Again, by so completely transforming her military organisation, France has effected substantial reductions in the number of troops available for immediate defence at home. In point of fact, the time required to train recruits being as a rule six months, the reduction of the length of service has caused the decrease in the number of troops to bear solely on the number of trained men; with the one-year service, one-half of each class called, or about one-third of the French army personnel, is permanently inutilisable.In 1921, out of 483,672 soldiers comprising the French army stationed in Europe or France, 400,672 only were trained men. Under the legal statute now in force, the number of effectives liable to be stationed at home has been brought down to 163,000 trained men, out of 270,812, for home defence, to whom may be added 66,000 trained men, out of 69,825 men, constituting the &quot;expeditionary force&quot; stationed at home for the time being, and whose essential duties for the defence and policing of oversea territories are defined.(2) The number of these men will be made known to the conference as soon as the latter has laid down the conditions of seniority, common to all armies, which determine a &quot; professional soldier&quot; within the meaning of the convention.
Imbued with a steadfast and sincere desire for peace, and relying upon the agreements signed, France has thus, of her own accord, effected since 1921 a reduction amounting at times, when the expeditionary force is in the home territory, to 42 per cent, of the forces immediately available for home defence, or to 60 per cent, of those forces, assuming that in the hour of danger the expeditionary force should happen to be abroad.Nor should that contingency be looked upon as in any way exceptional. For not only is the expeditionary force the normal reservoir for the relief of forces stationed overseas, and consequently comprising a considerable proportion of men on furlough or in process of changing station, but it also constitutes a reserve in the event of colonial troubles, and is therefore liable, at any time, to have its constituent elements shipped abroad to distant lands.Thus in 1925-26 events in Morocco and the necessity of meeting in Syria the responsibilities involved in the mandate confided to France, required the use of 133,000 men in Morocco and 36,000 in Syria. These increased requirements had rendered necessary the sending of 72,500 men from home, and it was precisely these circumstances which led to the constitution of the expeditionary force in the present organisation of the French army.The Oversea Army.The reduction is less considerable as regards the oversea forces, comprising on the one hand the expeditionary force as defined above, and on the other the troops permanently stationed overseas.These are forces of a special nature, almost exclusively made up of pro-fessional soldiers and natives. For, indeed, the reduction to one year of the length of service for the French contingent, allows but a very inconsiderable proportion thereof to be detailed for oversea service; and the parallel reduction of the length of service for natives has entailed a substantial increase in the number of professionals to train and command such formations.None the less, the sum total of the forces stationed overseas has been cut down appreciably, inasmuch as those forces, as compared with 312,312 men in 1921, have been reduced, under the present legal statute, to 237,383 men, 13,964 of whom are for service in the mandated territories.This reduction, however, applied only to the troops stationed in certain territories where circumstances have rendered it possible. It should be observed, indeed, that several of these oversea territories are still undergoing a process of evolution the outcome of which cannot yet be foreseen, but which will be attended by fluctuations involving variations in the matter of armaments. Again, even assuming the possibility of collective international action taking place promptly enough to protect such oversea territories against attacks from without, it can hardly be relied upon for police purposes.The Navy.In the matter of naval armaments, the tonnage kept in commission by the French navy in 1921 had been brought down by the elimination of obsolete units to about 500,000 tons, whereas it had exceeded 750,000 tons in 1914.Even so, this total of 500,000 tons represented more than the actual strength of the fleet. As a consequence of the suspension of construction during the war period, the French navy found itself obliged, in order to fulfil the responsibilities incumbent upon it, to maintain in commission a high proportion of old vessels. Throughout that period, in fact, the entire French effort was directed towards supplying the needs of the Allied armies, and the activities of the naval yards were restricted to the building of small craft, in view of the anti-submarine campaign.At the close of the war, even before the Washington Conference, the Govern-ment of the Republic had definitely given up the idea of resuming the execution of their former programmes. Work was stopped on five capita! ships actually laid down, and the construction of four ships voted by Parliament before the opening of hostilities was not undertaken.Now the fleet for defence purposes light surface vessels and submarines  was so weakened as to be unable in the near future to fulfil its normal responsibilities. It was therefore a matter of urgency to build it up again. This was attempted by the programme of 1924, the execution of which was to be completed in 1943. Its principles were based on estimated naval requirements [5981] b 3
from 1922 on, allowance being amply made for expectations aroused by the League Covenant.Notwithstanding the date thus prescribed and having regard to the agree-ments which could be expected in the matter of the limitation of naval armaments, the Government of the Republic later decided to slowdown the rate of construction contemplated for the carrying out of this programme; at the London Conference, the French representatives made unequivocal statements to this effect.It was not without a lively feeling of regret that the Government of the Republic found it impossible to adhere completely to the system of limitation of the Naval Treaty of London. They expect the decisions made at the Conference of 1932 to lead to a complete solution of the problem, and they still hope that, by that time, a suitable arrangement will enable France and Italy, in full agreement with the British Commonwealth, to set forth their intentions in the matter of construction for the next few years in a temporary modus vivendi of a nature to facilitate the work of that conference.On the 1st January of the present year, the global figure of total French tonnage in commission and under construction amounted to 628,603 Washington tons, distributed as follows :- -WashingtonCapital ships  tons.Subject to the Washington regulations       ...      133,134 Not subject to the Washington regulations  ...        52,791 Aircraft carriers      ... ... ... ...        23,146First-class cruisers    ... ... ... ...      124,424(exclusive of the 12,538 Washington tons of the &quot;Edgar Quinet&quot;) Other light surface vessels     ... ... ...      198,233Submarines ... ... ... ... ...        97,875Total ... ... ...      628,603Air Forces.The experience of the French air forces has been the same as that of all the Great Powers. The development of the air service during the war and the extent of the technical progress achieved led to a complete reorganisation of this arm as soon as the Peace Treaties were signed.This reorganisation was to have been carried out in several stages, the number of planes allotted to each tactical formation in the final organisation being determined by the programmes separately drawn up for the military and air services and laid before the Chambers in 1924 and 1925. (3) These programmes provided 2,247 machines for the home forces and 180 machines for the air forces of the fleet.(4) They have already ceased to meet the new requirements of air defence, for they could not allow for the development of non-military aeronautics, which can be subjected to no limitation whatever, and which constitute none the less one of the most important elements of the problem of air security. Furthermore, the new possibilities opened up for aircraft by technical progress achieved are leading most countries to institute an independent &quot;Air Corps,&quot; upon which devolves the duty of ensuring the security of their territories in the air.However much their requirements may have increased, the Government of the Republic was anxious, above all, to render possible general limitation of armaments, and they advanced the execution of their air programmes only to a small extent.As regards the home forces, for instance, a bare beginning has been made in carrying out the programme; in 1925, when it was drafted, the number of machines in service in the tactical units, exclusive of those in immediate reserves, was 1,180 aeroplanes or seaplanes; at the present time it does not exceed 1,210, an increase of only thirty machines. As compared with the seven airships (aggregating a volume of 50,000 cubic metres) the French Air Service possessed in 1923, it now has but three of an aggregate volume of 10,500 cubic metres.(s) The programme of (he military air service was approved by the Chamber of Deputies at the sitting: of March 21,, 11)24. .... :(*) The effectives of air forces stationed in the oversea territories were not specified in the programmes. They were to be fixed at u &apos;later period according to requirements and subject to the available, resource-.
Constituted after the war, the air forces of the fleet comprise but sixty-two machines.Only in the case of the oversea forces has an increase, and this a comparatively small one, been effected in order to meet the special requirements of the more distant territories, requirements, moreover, which are but partly of a military character, and are at least as much in the nature of intercommunication and colonial administration. Such special requirements had been completely neglected down to 1923. At the present time the air forces stationed overseas are provided with 395 aeroplanes or seaplanes (exclusive of forty-six sanitary planes), constituting an increase of but fifty units as compared with the corresponding numbers for 1923. &apos;Such are the steps France has already taken voluntarily, pursuant to article 8 of the Covenant, towards the reduction and limitation of her armaments, which have thus been brought down to a level that appears to her strictly to represent the lowest point consistent with her national security in the present state of Europe and the world. She has taken this initiative without even waiting, as she was entitled to do, for the League to have drawn up the plans of such limitation and reduction. The Government of the Republic has no doubt but that the conference will assure itself that an equivalent effort has been made by all the other Governments, taking into account, for each, the special circumstances it is called upon to meet.The reductions effected in their armaments by the Government of the Republic emphasise the strictly defensive character imparted to them by the adhesion of France to the General Act of Arbitration. By that adhesion she has agreed once for all to make use of her forces for no other purpose than legitimate self-defence or operations of international police.III.The conference faces a triple task: first, to note and record the reductions of armaments already accomplished; second, to require an equivalent effort of every country, with due regard to the special circumstances of each; and, third, to consider under what conditions further reductions are possible.It is plainly to the interest of every Government to prevent a competition in armaments, which would be contrary to the spirit of the pact for the renunciation of war, and to reduce the burden of armaments to the lowest possible point.Yet if many States still feel bound to sacrifice large sums of money for their national defence at the expense of their prosperity, it is certainly not without profound reasons.Reduction of armaments implies confidence. Can that confidence be expected to prevail, so long as the feeling is abroad that in the eyes of many the problem is not so much one of organising peace for the benefit of all, as of modifying the existing order for the benefit of a few and so long as it is possible for some States to feel that the very existence conferred upon them by the treaties is threatened ? The decisions of the conference must be based upon respect of the treaties.Should an attempt be made, for instance, in the name of a theoretical principle of equality, to modify the relative situation created by the provisions of Part V of the Peace Treaties, it would prove impossible to maintain the reductions already accomplished and still less practicable would become the general limitation of armaments.The problem is not one that may be considered solely from a technical standpoint. This, of course, was the procedure followed at the Washington and London Conferences, which dealt exclusively with naval armaments; solutions were sought by the application of arbitrary scales or ratios of reduction, and at the price of empirical adjustments. But, however valuable the results obtained at those two conferences may be, it may surely be observed that they examined only the specific case of five navies, three of Avhich, at least, have bases sufficiently distant from one another to assure to each country, in its own part of the world, complete security. However, the success attained was only partial, because, after all, in the case of two of the participants in the London Conference, it proved impossible to leave out of account conditions growing out of differences in geographical situation, with the resulting consequences in the matter of security.In reality it is now the entire international situation that must be altered. What must be found is a practical solution.
The Geneva Protocol afforded such a solution, in which arbitration, mutual assistance and the limitation of armaments were closely co-ordinated.It was deemed preferable to apply the system of the protocol only within local limits, or to carry out its principles only separately and intermittently.Thus, great expectations were based upon the development of arbitration. But, important as arbitration may be for the enlightenment of public opinion as to the real intentions of opposing parties in case of conflict, it cannot alone suffice to ensure peace.  Some penalty is also necessary for violations of a solemn pledge.The Government of the Republic express the hope that the General Act of Arbitration, based upon the principle of respect for the rules of international laAv, that is to say, on the observance of conventions and treaties, and which constitutes the indispensable complement of the Pact for the Renunciation of War, will, in the near future, receive sufficiently numerous and unreserved1 endorsements. They would fain seethe end of the opposition of those Powers whose leanings are towards a policy of bilateral arbitration and conciliation -ag-reements, to which, by reason of their very diversity, the same value cannot be ascribed in the present circumstances.As to the local applications of the system closely co-ordinating arbitration, mutual assistance and reduction of armaments, they are now limited to the Locarno agreements. The latter represent an important step forward, from which Prance immediately drew conclusions in the matter of her own armaments.These agreements, however, are the only ones of the kind at present in force and their scope is restricted to a single region of Europe.Now insecurity for one State means insecurity for all. The notion of neutrality in presence of an aggressor, hard as it is to justify even in theory since the coming into force of the League Covenant and of the Pact of Paris, is also inconsistent with that real interdependence which, in the modern epoch, binds States more and more closely together.One cannot deny, in the domain of politics, a solidarity daily promoted in the domain of economics. By reason of the dangers threatening the weaker or more exposed States, the general reduction of armaments lays upon the stronger or less threatened Powers fresh responsibilities which they cannot elude.The Government of the Republic are convinced of the necessity of a security guaranteed to every State by assistance which should be mutual, effective and prompt. Nothing short of such assistance will avail to reduce those differences between the geographical situation and circumstances of the several countries which constitute the chief obstacle in the way of a simultaneous reduction of armaments. By such assistance alone can the League of Nations be given sufficient strength, material and moral, to prevent the launching of an aggression.The Government of the Republic call attention to the fact that the Committee on Arbitration and Security, instituted at the request of the 8th Assembly of the League, has not yet dealt with the suggestion made by the Assembly of inviting &apos;&apos; each State to indicate that, in a particular case of a conflict breaking out, either all its forces, or a certain part of its military, naval or air forces, could forthwith intervene in the conflict to support the CounciTs decisions or recommendations.&quot;Of what use indeed will armaments be once they are limited and reduced? War having been outlawed, what will States do if war breaks out and a crime of aggression is committed? These are the essential questions to which the conference of 1932 must give definite answers if it is to succeed.France stands ready to consider all general solutions : universal pledges of mutual assistance, combination of local agreements, constitution of international armed forces, or simultaneous recourse to these several systems. She asks for herself no unilateral guarantee. In contracting defensive agreements over the past ten years, she has assumed, in a spirit of solidarity, and within the scope of article 10 of the Covenant, wide responsibilities for the guarantee of inter-national order. But she cannot face alone such a task. Nothing but the co-operation of each and every State in the organisation of peace can bring about any real progress towards the limitation and general reduction of armaments.Conscious of having already accomplished, for their part, since the coming into force of the League Covenant, those reductions of armaments made possible by the improvement of conditions of security in Europe, the Government of the Republic are prepared to extend their unqualified collaboration to any system for the general organisation of peace which, involving definite pledges of effective
omutual assistance in case of aggression, would enable each State, as soon as the nature and promptness of this assistance has been specified, to determine the further reductions thus rendered possible.For their part, the Government of the Republic will do their utmost at the conference of 1932 to assure the establishment of those conditions without which no further real progress can be effected. They are convinced that the conference will not let slip the great opportunity offered it and that it will ably acquit itself of what constitutes its real task : the organisation of a solid and durable peace.Paris, July 15, 1931.
