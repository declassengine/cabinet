THE question of whether it is practicable to make a distinction between Offensive and Defensive Armaments was fully examined and discussed by the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference which put to Sub-Commission A (composed of the Military Experts of the States represented) the following question : &quot; Are there any armaments (and if so which) which are only capable of being used for the defence of a State&apos;s territory ?&quot;2.   The Sub-Commission submitted unanimously the following reply : &quot; Generally speaking, and subject to the conditions stated below, any component elements of armaments which are incapable of mobility by means of self-contained power or can only be transported after a long delay, can only be used for the defence of that territory in which they are erected.&quot;A list of armaments considered to be defensive under the above definition was added which included all shelters, obstacles and permanent works for the use of armaments such as gun platforms, excluding the armament and transportable equipment. The list included further signalling communications, road beds of narrow gauge railways, permanent anti-aircraft gun emplacements (but not the guns themselves), &amp;c.3. We have individually and collectively considered this problem, and we are of the opinion that the conclusion reached by the Preparatory Commission is correct. We realise that this conclusion is open to the criticism that it does not, in fact, include any actual armaments, but only equipment for use with certain types of weapons : in thus confining their list, however, we think that the Preparatory Commission were right, because, as we hope to illustrate in succeeding paragraphs, all armaments are as much defensive as offensive and whether they come temporarily under one or other of these categories must depend on the circumstances and conditions of their employment.4. During the late War, heavy guns were used defensively by both sides, and especially by the Germans during the three years of trench warfare, but equally they were used offensively when forward movement was attempted on a large scale. In any event the word &apos;&apos; heavy &apos;&apos; as applied to guns is a purely relative term and merely connotes the main offensive artillery weapon. Similarly a tank, though primarily an offensive weapon, can be used defensively to cover an open flank or to take part in a local counter-attack, which is the essence of the successful holding of a defensive position.[6003]Copy No.   2 3
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, September 24, 1931.5. It has been urged that the plan on which the disarmament of Germany was drawn up was based on a conception of denying to her any weapons of a purely offensive character, and that by proscribing heavy guns and tanks the military experts of the allied nations gave evidence that they considered these weapons to be purely offensive. The object of the Treaty was to provide Germany with a sufficient military force for her internal security only, and it was not considered that tanks and heavy guns were necessary for this purpose. In the second place, the Treaty prohibited the use of these weapons in order to deprive Germany of the power of aggression so long as other Powers retain these weapons. In other words, peace was ensured by putting the potential aggressor in a position of inferiority.6. We remarked that the question of whether a-weapon could be classified as offensive or defensive must depend on the circumstances of its employment and that, in consequence, the classification would be a fluid factor. There is, however, a further difficulty, in that national expert opinion shows a marked divergence of views even as regards the question of employment and the characteristics of the weapon. As a classic example may be quoted the Submarine which we regard as essentially an offensive weapon, but which Prance and Japan strongly contend is only suitable for purposes of defence. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive of any naval armaments being classified as purely defensive, except certain elements of coastal and harbour defences such as booms, nets, searchlights, &amp;c, and vessels used for examination purposes.7. The same difficulties arise with air armaments, since practically all types of service aircraft are capable of being employed for offensive purposes. Further, by reason of their great flexibility, aircraft can be readily switched over to a different role, even one for which they are not primarily intended. For example, the heaviest day-bomber in service in the Royal Air Force to-day was designed originally as a troop-carrier and subsequently fitted out as a bomber. In future, this type of aircraft will be classified as a &quot;bomber transport.&quot; Even an ambulance aircraft could be easily adapted for offensive purposes.8. In any event, as is well known, air defence can never be effective if reliance is placed solely on the employment of air forces on the tactical defensive : it is essential to employ, also, aircraft in an offensive role. Even civil aircraft, with the exception perhaps of light aeroplanes, can be readily adapted for aggressive use; they are, in fact, potentially of far more value for offence than defence.9. We have tried to show, by argument and example, that it is virtually impossible to draw any hard and fast distinctions between offensive and defensive weapons, no matter what type of weapon is selected. Whether designed for use on the water, under the water, on land or in the air, given the right circumstances, any weapon has potential offensive properties and can be used for aggressive purposes; and, so long as the definition must depend on the employment and not the nature of the weapon, so it seems to us impossible to draw a definite line that has any real meaning. A Commission of the League has examined this subject and found, unanimously, that only certain component elements of a very limited number of armaments can be truly classed as defensive, because they are, for all practical purposes, immobile and can.only be used for the defence of that area in which they exist. We are convinced that any attempt to extend the scope of this conclusion will only lead to confusion, and that this being so any attempt to regulate disarmament on the assumption that distinctions can be drawn between offensive and defensive weapons must prove, not only abortive, but the precursor of unfruitful argument and international ill-feeling.(Signed) G.
