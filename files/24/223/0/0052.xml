THIS IX)CUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY op HIS BRJiTAHTTIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. ) SECRET.Cj^isjLi^J.. copy no, 6C A B I IT E T, JUDGES,1  SAIARISS. Memorandum by. the Xord Chancellor,,Having regard to the discussion which toot place at the Cabinet on this matter,*   I think it desirable that the observations which follow should be placed on record.I do not in any way desire to contest the decision reached by the Cabinet.The 20$ cut may be criticised on the ground that It inflicts undue hardship upon the individual judge;    and on the ground that it will make it more difficult even than it was before to maintain the high standard of the Bench when vacancies occur.But the principal ground for objection is, in my view, the fact that it is an infringement of a principle, which forms one of the safeguards of the Constitution, that the position of the judge should be secure and unaffected by political movements.      There are grave reasons for the fear that to regard the position or salary of a judge as subject to change without his consent by reason of the political necessities of the moment may lead to an inroad on the impartiality of the Bench.Sankey.ouas of Lords,30th Sectember, 1931. .   ^
