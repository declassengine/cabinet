THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC M/LJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1931.SECRET. Copy No.     8OP. 231 (31).CABINET.THE IRISH FREE STATE AND APPEALS TO THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the attached note of an interview which I had with Senator Brown and Senator Jameson, two of the leaders of the Southern Unionists in the Irish Free State, who had offered to come to see me for the purpose of giving me their views on the question of Appeals to the Judicial Committee from the Irish Free State.It will be remembered that in my memorandum on the Statute of Westminster (CP. 212 (31)) I gave a brief account of the present position of. this question and referred to its importance in relation to the Statute.J. H. T.Dominions Office, September 25, 1931.Note of Interview between Mr. Thomas and Senator Brown and Senator Jameson.Mr. THOMAS saw Senator Brown and Senator Jameson in his room at the Dominions Office on Thursday, the 17th September, the two Senators having offered to come to see him for the purpose of giving their views on the question of Appeals to the Judicial Committee from the Irish Free State. Mr. Malcolm MacDonald and Sir H. Batterbee were also present at the interview.Mr. Thomas outlined the present position. The Free State Government had repeatedly declared their intention of abolishing the right^pf Appeal, but so far they had not done so. It was impossible to deny that the Free State Government were able to make futile the right of Appeal in any particular case, and had, in fact, done so on several occasions (both Senators indicated their entire assent). On the other hand ah &quot;agreement was an agreement, and it was not fair for two persons who had made an agreement in the interests of a third person to alter that agreement, except with the consent of that third person. He would never be a party to doing anything of that kind. When, however, Mr. McGilligan told him that the Southern Unionists as a whole no longer set store by the retention of the right, then it seemed to him that if this were true the whole position was altered, and he was therefore anxious to find out for himself what the facts were.Senator Brown and Senator Jameson said that they thought that on this question the Southern Unionists could be divided into three classes : (1) There was the class of those who regarded the Appeal as futile and an irritant to good relations between the Protestant minority and the rest of the population of the Free State, and who, on that ground, were in favour of its immediate abolition;[6012] -
(2) there was a second class, who, while regretting the disappearance of the I Appeal, recognised that the Free State Government were committed I to securing ,ijts,abolition; while acquiescing in the abolition, they &apos; thought tnat Tfshould come by agreement with the United KingdomGovernment; -........(3) there was a third class who were opposed to abolition in any shape or form.Of the eleven or twelve representatives of the Southern Unionists in the Senate all belonged to the first class : of their eleven representatives in the Dail, three belonged to the first and eight to the second class.As to the state of feeling in the country generally, it was more difficult to say. Among the thinking and educated people the majority belonged to the first class. In this connection Senator Brown mentioned that the members of the governing body of Trinity College, Dublin, were to be numbered among this class. Of the Southern Unionists as a whole the larger proportion probably belonged to the second. In the opinion both of Senator Brown and Senator Jameson the number belonging to the third class in Ireland itself was small, and largely confined to the border counties; in this country it was strongly represented.Wise and thoughtful people in Ireland generally recognised that the real protection of the Protestant minority was not the Appeal, but good will. Senator Brown and Senator Jameson said that it was right that they should state quite clearly that the Protestants had been treated fairly and more than fairly by the present Free State Government; they had nothing to complain of. In fact it was true to say that in the Free State there was now no religious question.While they fully appreciated the political reactions of &quot;the question in this country, they desired to call attention to the political reactions in Ireland. It must be remembered that there was a General Election coming on in the Free State next year. If the pro-treaty party were able to point to the fact that under the treaty they had been able to get rid of the Appeal, that undoubtedly would be a bull point for that party, though on the other hand the present Government could not afford to do anything which would expose them to the charge of subservience to the British Government. There was the further point that, if negotiations were started and agreement were not reached quickly, controversy might be raised by interested parties which would arouse old prejudices and have the effect of driving some of the Southern Unionists from class (2) to class (3). On every ground it was important, if agreement could be reached, to reach that agreement quickly.Mr. Thomas, in his reply, again emphasised that he took his stand on the maintenance of the Articles of Agreement. He fully appreciated the importance of avoiding delay, and undertook that he would take into careful consideration the views which Senator Brown and Senator Jameson had expressed.
