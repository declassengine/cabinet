IviIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).E CRETCOPY NO..P.  246  (31).CABINETTHE CUT IN JUDGESf  SALARIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues in the Cabinet to the very steep cut of 20 per cent,  in the salaries of His Majesty&apos;s Judges.      Let me at once say that I am not writing this memorandum with theirfrom some, and conversations with others, ana, with the unfortunate exception of one Judge of the King1s Bench Division, they are all ready to accept the situation cheerfully and with loyalty.      I feel I must Indicate that there is the exception of this one Judge, because he has written to me an open letter which he says he is thinking of reading publicly&quot;when next he takes his seat.that the Judge in question is one of my oldest friends. There can be no doubt of his loyalty, but he is a stickler for &quot;the sanctity of contracts&quot;.knowledge, or at their request.I have had lettersI purposely refrain from mentioning his name, forI hope wiser counsels will prevail.I must add, however,t-l-
The position is that, of all public servants,  the Judges alone received no bonus during the War period. -    Many Civil Servants did receive such a bonus,  and the out in their wages in many cases only represents the loss of the bonus.      The cut in the Judges&apos;  salary stands on a different footing, because it reduces a salary which was fixed at  5,000 a year nearly a century age, when money was more valuable than it ia now is.      The result of \ this cut has been to  alter the position of the Judges to a very remarkable extent.      Heavy taxation \ and the cut will reduce the  judicial salary to a net amount of about  2,600 a year.      They certainly cannot keep up on that figure the position which hitherto it has been thought desirable that a High Court Judge should maintain.      They have no means of increasing their earnings.I do not urge the plea, that the Judges&apos; salary is fixed by statute,  and that they have a life tenure of their office.      On occasions like the present, everybody must be prepared to make sacrifices, and I can speak for the judges that, with&apos;the one exception above referred to, I do not ionow of anyone who is unwilling to do so.I must, however, point out that their prestige will be lowered.      They will be addressed in Court by Leaders cf the Bar who sometimes make in two or three days as much as a Judge makes in a year.      There are obvious reasons why it should not be in the power of any (Government to decrease the
salary of a judge.His independence must &quot;be secured.There is an express provision in the AmericanConstitution tr this effect.Speaking with many years&apos;  experience both asa Judge,  as a Lord Justice of Appeal, and now as Lord Chancellor, I must give it as my considered opinion that unless some alteration is made, it will not be possible te obtain t he services of the best men at the Bar,  if the salary ef the Judges remains at its present figure.my period of office I have offered Judgeshipc tc learned Counsel, who have refused them on the ground of the smallness of the emoluments, and in my view we shall not obtain the services ef the most eminent barristers, unless we reconsider the present position.not for the fact that, at the height of the crisis and of cur difficulties,,  one could only fall in with the general view, and not ask for any exception.      Indeed I dr not think my colleagues would have desired me to plead their cause t,n such an occasion; but we are now getting our second wind, matters are being carefully reconsidered, the  1 has gene, and the cuts are being readjusted,,      I would?  therefore, press for a reconsideration of the 20 per cent cut in the Judge s1   salary.It is my duty to tell the Cabinet that duringI should not have written this memorandum, were itHouse of Lords,  S.W, 1September 25th,  1931,a
Note on Amsriean judical salaries,Article iii Section I of the American constitution contains the following words&quot;The Judges, both of the Supreme and the Inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall,  at stated, tisi.es, receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished, during their continuance in office&quot;.So strictly has this Article been interpreted that in Evans v, Gore    (253 U.8.  245),  it was held held that a federal income tax cennot be levied upon the net income of a federal judge in which his judicial salary is Included (1920)S
