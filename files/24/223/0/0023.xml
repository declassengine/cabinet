Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN accordance with a request from the late Three-Party Committee on Disarmament, the Chiefs of Staff Committee is, I understand, preparing a note on the French Memorandum on Disarmament. I venture to ask whether any steps are being taken to examine the political aspects of the French paper. They are at least as important and quite as unpromising as the purely military elauses.The French thesis is now, as it has always been, a very simple one: Arbitration, Security, Disarmament, in that order. Without Arbitration and Security, no Disarmament.Applying this thesis to present facts, the French Memorandum admits progress in the spread of Arbitration, though it indicates that that progress is not yet sufficient.In the article of Security it registers the Treaty of Locarno as the sole advance yet made. It describes that Treaty as making &quot; for France, as well as for other Powers adjacent to that area, a great additional contribution to the guarantees of security resulting from a strict observance of the treaties.&quot; Locarno, however, has found no imitators elsewhere; such security as it gives is &quot;-restricted to a single region of Europe.&quot; But &quot; insecurity for one State means insecurity for all,&quot; and so the Memorjindum proceeds to its logical conclusion.France &quot; is convinced of the necessity of a security guaranteed to every State by assistance which should be material, effective and prompt.&quot; To provide this security will be the first task of the Geneva Conference. Without it &quot;no further real progress [in disarmament] can be effected.&quot;What answer is the British Government going to make to this thesis ? Are we prepared to undertake new engagements of a military character ? If so, we must increase instead of diminishing our existing armaments, which, in fact, are not proportionate even to our present liabilities. If we are not prepared to take this course, ought we not to be considering what our reply is to be and where and to what extent we can obtain support for it ?A. C.Admiralty, S.W. 1,September 10, 1931.[5963]
