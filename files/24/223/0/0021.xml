THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVTSifflMENT, SSOBE-Di CP 225(31) .COPY NO . &amp;. . .CABINET -EXPENDITURE OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. NOTE BY MINISTER OF HEALTH.I circulate herewith a copy of a letter which, if I have the approval of the Cabinet, I propose to address to local authorities in England and Wales on the subject of lecal expenditure.(Intld.)     N. C.8th September, 1931./9/31.
September, 1931.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Health, to state that H.M. Government have given consideration to the question of reduction of local expenditure generally, over and abovo the reductions in special branches of that expenditure which will be dealt with in special circular letters,H.M. Government find themselves compelled by the necessities of the financial situation to impose on the community a heavy additional burden of taxation for national services, and at the same time to make large reductions in the national expenditure, some of which are such as to involve heavy sacrifices by the community.    In these circumstances it seems to H.M. Government of the first importance that the utmost care should be exercised in settling the charges to be imposed on the community by way of local rates, since ratepayers and taxpayers are very largely the same people-;H.M, Government would not, however, contemplate that local authorities should embark on a woolesale and ill-considered course of cutting down expenditure whatever be its character or its purpose.    Such a policy seems to them neither necessary nor advisable.What they would desire is that each local authority, through its Finance or other appropriate Committoo or through such special Committees, not necessarily wholly composed of members cf the authority, as have already been appointed in some areas, shall subject . immediately to careful and detailed scrutiny the whole fleli oaf fits expenditure, examining, for example, whether/full/
full value is being obtained, for money spent, what savings oan be made in the administrative machine in all its branches, whether development of any services oannot safely and properly be slowed down till better times.   In making such a survey, Committees should, in the view of H.M. Government, pay special regard, Inter alia, to such questions as whether a service is or is not likely to be remunerative oither at once or in the near future, whether it is required on urgent grounds of public health or other grounds of similar public urgency, whether it is justifiable on the ground of the contribution which it makes to the provision of employment for looal workers, thereby avoiding the throwing of charges on national or looal funds.   The propriety of rationing the spending oommittees of the local authority merits careful consideration.In dealing with this matter the question whether , any reduction should be made in the remuneration of employees of loaal authorities will inevitably arise.   It will be within the knowledge of looal authorities that        j HoM. Government have felt themselves compelled by the exigencies of the situation to impose percentage reductions on all the higher grades of salaries in the service of tho Grown, leaving the lower grades of salaries to the unrestricted operation of the cost of living bonus arrangements.   Reductions are also being m:;do in the emoluments of classes., of local offioers of services which are the subject of percentcge grants from the Exchequer and in the rcmuner^.tion of doctors and chemists under theNational Health Insurance scheme.    Tho conditions of thoilocal government sorvioo and the r -ages of s--JUry vary so/materially
materially that H.M. Government do not think it practicable even if it were desirable for them to impose any hard and fast rule on local authorities in this matter.     But they are confident that officers of the local government servioe not affected by the reductions in emoluments above referred to will be prepared to make their contribution in &quot;the present emergency and they think that each local authority should discuss the situation with its officers with the object of ensuring that all may have an opportunity of sharing equitably in the sacrifices demanded by national need.I am. Sir,your obedient Servant,
