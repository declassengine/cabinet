[This document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1931.Copy n0....J..JCABINET.indian financial position.FURTHER MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.A statement of. the main facts leading up to the present financial difficulties of India has already been given in my previous Memorandum (CP. 226 (31)), which was circulated to my colleagues on the 10th September and of which a copy is appended hereto.   The following further facts are also relevant to the present situation.I need not point out to my colleagues how exceedingly serious is the situation and how very confidential ai-e the figures that I am disclosing.From the beginning of June until the 26th June, the date of the Prime Ministers statement as to the giving of financial support, if the need arose, to the Government of India during the period of constitutional discussions, demands for sterling were met by the Government of India in its capacity as currency authority to the extent of  2,925,000. After that statement was made the demand for sterling practically ceased, but revived about the beginning of August and has continued ever since on a substantial scale, the total amount between 27th June and 11th September being  7,390,000. This, though primarily due to uncertainty as to the future of the rupee, cannot be wholly dissociated from the present general economic instability in which sterling, as well as the rupee, is involved.The total resources available externally (i.e. sterling assets, plus gold both in London and in India) of the Government of India amount at present to about  46,839,000 in the Currency Reserves and  5,700,000 in Treasury balances, a total of  52,539,000. Until it is possible to recommence remittance from India, and so long as it remains impracticable to borrow in London, this sum represents the only resource available to meet the current outgoings of the Secretary of State, and is also liable to be drawn upon to an unknown extent for meeting further demands for sterling in connection with the maintenance of the currency standard. Current outgoings can be met up to the 15th November from the present Treasury balance, but after that date, unless the balance has been reinforced from other sources, they will have to be met from the Currency Reserves. The total extent to which the Currency Reserves would have to be drawn upon for this purpose between the 16th November 1931 and the 31st March 1932 is approximately  30 millions, including about  15 millions for the repayment of India 5-J- per cent. Stock due in January 1932.I append a copy of three private telegrams from the Viceroy, dated 1st, 7th, and 8th September, the last consisting of a note by Sir George Schuster, the Finance Member.The facts of the situation were carefully considered at a Conference on the 10th September at which, in addition to myself, there were present Lord Reading, Sir E. Hilton-Young and Major Elliot, together with advisers of the Treasury and the India Office. I reported the conclusions of this Conference to the Prime Minister and with his concurrence I addressed the following telegram to the Viceroy :- -From Secretary of State to Viceroy, lOtli September 1931.7 U. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegrams of the Jst and 7th September. Financial situation. This morning a Committee consisting of Reading, Elliot, Hilton-Young and myself, with the Financial Advisers of the Treasury and India Office, gave the matter prolonged and anxious consideration. The conclusions reached which I describe below were unanimous and were subsecpiently submitted to and approved by the Prime Minister.2. The possibility of translating the Prime Ministers declaration into immediate promise of specific action can at once be ruled out. The National Government is now engaged in the task of rehabilitating sterling and nothing would be better calculated to defeat that object than an application to Parliament to agree to a large drawing credit. There is no question of repudiating an obligation, but we must face the fact that until sterling is secure it may be impossible for His Majesty&apos;s 317   75   9.31secret.CP. 232 (31).
Government to implement its undertaking. It was agreed that sterling and the rupee are intimately connected and that as a collapse of one might bring down the other, the maintenance of both is in the common interest essential. Further, if it were decided to abandon the Is. C)d. rupee either voluntarily or by force may ewe it would be impossible to maintain it at Is. 4dL Any such attempt would involve a doiible instead of a single failure and the only alternative would be to let the rupee hnd its own level.   The disastrous consequences of this you fully reahse.3. In these circumstances it has been decided to play for time and to use our reserves freely in maintaining the ratio, trusting that the strength of sterling will be rapidly restored and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will, if the need arises, be in a position to come to our assistance. Developments will be under the daily examination of the Treasury and India Office, and the Committee will be available at any time to review the situation.4. It was agreed that on the political side it was essential that the position regarding financial safeguards should be cleared up as quickly as possible, and it will be our object to do this, but you realise that technical considerations are important, as to plunge the Conference into a premature discussion of this kind would be to invite a breakdown. I think you will agree that we could never contemplate putting as an issue before the Conference the question of the relative merits of a Is. 6d. and Is. 4cZ. rupee.5. Finally, it was felt strongly that it would greatly ease the situation if the firm determination of the Government of India to balance the Budget by retrenchments and additional taxation could be announced in the most authoritative way. The Prime Minister and I, with our recent experience here, would urge upon ynu the desirability, if possible, of laying stress on this in your speech to the Legislature on Monday next without, of course, disclosing the taxation to be imposed.I am confident I can rely on you and your Council to acquiesce in and do everything in your power to carry out the policy outlined above. I am not without hope that if we face our difficulties with a bold front we will win throngh.You will realise that parts of this telegram, in particular those relating to position of sterling, are most highly confidential. Their disclosure would have most serious consequences, and they should in no circumstances go beyond Schuster and yourself.The question discussed in these papers has a bearing upon the procedure of the Pound-Table Conference. The intention, as I understand it, is to direct discussion upon questions such as the conditions of Federation and the communal differences, in which the issues are primarily for Indians to agree upon, before coming to &quot; safeguards,&quot; upon which differences may emerge between British and Indian Delegates. This plan has many advantages and I hope it will be possible to pursue it. But we have to face the possibility that the financial situation discussed above may so develop as to make it necessary to take financial safeguards earlier than would otherwise be desirable.From Viceroy, 1st September 1931.739 S. Private and personal. In amplification of my private and personal telegram 732 S. of 31st August about Conference arrangements, the following represent the considered views of the Finance Member and Denning for consideration by your financial advisers.2. In the recent exchange of telegrams we have discussed measures to restore the financial situation ; we have always emphasised the over-riding importance of the present constitutional uncertainty in Indian situation, hut in our telegram of the 26th ultimo, 2178 S., we deliberately refrained from referring again to this lest we might convey the impression of using it as a pretext for evading unpleasant duties in the financial sphere. Of this we have no intention, and we must again assert our considered view that no mere financial measure will restore that confidence which is necessary for preserving the general financial stability and in particular for maintaining the rupee and meeting sterling obligations.3. For this it is necessary that constitutional future should be immediately settled on sound basis. If the Conference is indefinitely prolonged, or if it ends with no more than a general plan, then it will he impossible to maintain financial stability without very substantial assistance from British Government.
4. We shall telegraph separately about Conference procedure, but meanwhile urgency of expediting a decision must be emphasised. If His Majesty&apos;s Government is willing and able to help us substantially, we can of course carry on. Your recent events in England have seriously shaken Indian confidence in value of Prime Ministers contingent undertaking. A steady drain on our sterling reserves has set in. This has a cumulative effect, for as reserves diminish confidence weakens. If present drainage continues, a point may soon be reached at which confidence may break and a violent run set in. It is difficult to forecast exact course of events, but wo feel that once we get to the point of needing to draw in Gold Standard Reserve, we cannot save situation without British assistance.5. There are, therefore, two vital questions : firstly, Avhat period must elapse before final constitutional decisions; secondly, can we expect British financial assistance during interval ? As to the latter, can guarantee proposals be put before Parliament during September session ? If such proposals must wait until after General Election, and if, in the meantime, no decisive result can be expected from Conference, then we fear there is practically no chance of maintaining rupee. We do not wish to be alarmists, but it is essential to face realities. If a break is inevitable it would be much better to let it come before we have exhausted the greater part of our reserves, for then we should at least have some resources left for meeting sterling obligations until the situation has chance to recover.From Viceroy, 7th September 1931.757 S. Private and personal. Financial situation. Referring to my private and personal telegram 739 S. of 1st September, developments during week last have been disquieting and add urgency to the points raised in para. 5 of that telegram.2. The only way of immediately improving the situation is to translate the Prime Ministers statement into immediate promise of specific action. I fully recognise the difficulties at your end and am most reluctant to press you, but if very early action is not possible, then alternative of immediately abandoning the statutory ratio must be facel, as indicated in para. 5 of my telegram of 1st September. I trust you can : send urgent reply.3. I would also emphasise that, in British interests, the sooner that action is taken the better. I can only assume that after the Prime Ministers statement British Government will be bound to give ultimate assistance. If situation is allowed to go too far, then action necessary to restore it may involve very heavy liabilities.4. We of course&quot; recognise that any guarantee from the British Government must be accompanied by our own measures to improve Indian financial position. But here again I would remind you that we are dependent on Parliamentary action, for plans both for Central and Provincial finance cannot be finally settled without decision about reductions of pay. It is important for us to know your views on this matter and specially whether legislation on this could be undertaken in Parliament this session.5. In para. 4 of my telegram of 1st September I indicated that I proposed to telegraph further about the Conference procedure in connection with the financial situation. I have asked Schuster to prepare a note of his views on this and the wider . aspects of currency policy. This follows in succeeding telegram. I fully endorse his views and would ask you to appreciate that currency questions may be the key-point of constitutional discussions and that the way in which this problem is dealt with will vitally affect the task of governing India during the next few years. It is essential that it should not be shirked.From Viceroy, 8th September 1931.758 S. Private and personal. Following is Schuster&apos;s note referred to in my private and personal telegram 757 S. of 7th September ;  &quot;1. The time has come when currency policy must be finally reviewed and the method for handling this question at the Conference decided. Following remarks should be read together with my personal memorandum on financial safeguards, while in my appreciation of the position I have taken the view that no early passing of the present world economic crisis and low prices can be expected.&quot;2. If decision 4s to adhere to the policy of maintaining the present rupee ratio, then its full implications must bo faced. The following are necessary conditions :  First, an early announcement converting Prime Ministers contingent guarantee into a
specific promise of substantial credit ; the sooner it is given and the more generous-the amount of credit the smaller will be the chance of its being drawn upon. Second, simultaneously with, or as soon as possible after, grant of British credit, the Government of India to announce that it is their intention to follow the example-of the British Government and put a programme before the Legislature at an emergency session if necessary. This plan must be based mainly on retrenchment, and must include both cuts in Army expenditure and substantial cut in all pay.&quot; If ratio is to be maintained, the adjustment to meet the fall in prices must be made principally by this means. Nothing else is really sound or fair to the country. We must receive early Parliamentary authority for an adequate cut in pay. Third, adequate measures must be taken to maintain the policy after any consti-tutional changes decided by the Conference. If the constitutional discussions lead to a transfer of any measure of responsibility at the Centre, including financial, responsibility, the British Government must stand behind the Indian Government with unlimited liability to see them through. This liabiiitj&apos; will be very heavy. Can the British Government support it? The task of maintaining the ratio will be so difficult and unpopular that no Indian Government which has to rely on public support can, or will, face it, unless it is made easy for them. No mere safeguards will protect the position.&quot; 3. It is useless to ignore the extreme improbability of being able to fulfil this third condition. The national condemnation of the present currency policy is now practically universal in India. It has ceased to be a mere political cry. At present no representative Indian Government could be formed which would not be pledged to change. There is a rare possibility that, as a result of understanding reached at the Conference, and with the promise of substantial British support, situation might be secured for a few years, but this is very improbable. I do not myself believe that Indian delegates will accept safeguards which permanentlv deny them x^o^e1&apos; to decide currency policy. In that case, only way of establishing that confidence in. stability of exchange, without which it could not be maintained, would be to deny all transfer of responsibility at the Centre and maintain strong official Government until present economic crisis is past. Is British Government prepared to face breakdown of Conference on this and its necessary sequel ? The task of official novernment will be extremely difficult and difficulty will be greatly increased having to carry on in face of geiiei&apos;al public hostility to the measures necessary to maintain currency. Success will be impossible at present price level without unlimited British assistance.&quot;4. If the British Government are not prepared to undertake the fulfilment of these conditions, then the alternatives must be faced. These would be either to abandon the present ratio without attempt at stabilisation until the situation had settled down at the new level or to stabilise at some lower level, for which, having regard to public sentiment, the obvious choice would he Is. id. In either case there-would be definite advantages in staging action as result of agreement with the Indian delegates at the Conference.li 5. Consequences of the former can be easily visualised. Main clanger would be to credit&quot;and to Indian ability to meet external obligations. But, if decision is taken soon, reserves would cover the period, which might suffice until the present crisis is past. Immediate effects internally would be considerable relief, especially for agricultural problems, and improvement in provincial revenues, while greater rupee burden of external obligations could he offset ultimately if not immediately by the rise in receipts from ad valorem customs duties. Nevertheless, dangers and disadvant-ages are obvious, as also problem of reconciling this course with the Prime Ministers statement. As to the latter, I suggest that the Brilish Government should make it clear that decision was to abandon the present standard until the occasion seemed ripe to stabilise at new level, that the British Government would then assist India in stabilising, and&apos; that, in the meantime, they would also assist in meeting sterling obligations in view of the unprecedented economic conditions especially affecting countries like India relying on primarily agricultural products and also of the fact that India alone has stabilised above pre-war level. This method of implementing the Prime Ministers statement in concert with Indian opinion might find some justification.&quot; 6. The second alternative of making agreement at the Conference to stabilise at Is. id. has definite advantages if it could be carried out. The arguments may be stated as follows : The first two conditions explained in para. 2 would still be necessary, but they would be easier to fulfil. Some promise of support from British credit would be required, for otherwise exchange could not be held ; but, as vast majority
of Indian opinion has not pressed for more than drop to Is. id., a great factor both of uncertainty and of opposition would be removed and, if confidence were established, it is possible that British support in the form of a definite and limited credit might suffice. Internal adjustments to meet the fall in price levels, although not eliminated, would be substantially eased, and cuts in pay might be unnecessary. On the other hand, extreme disturbance created by complete instability would he avoided. The task of the fixture administration, whatever the result of the Conference, would be greatly eased by the removal of this factor, which at present sets practically the whole of Indian opinion in opposition to British policy. Change would not, of course, satisfy all, but the unity of the opposition would be destroyed, while constitutional discussions would be made much easier.&quot; 7. In making a choice between alternatives stated in paras. 5 and 6, the real question is whether latter is practicable without involving need for British support almost as great as for maintaining present ratio. The real factor affecting this question will be what is finally decided about new Constitution. If latter gives responsibility to Indians at Centre even with safeguards, export of capital may continue, and in that case limited British support might not suffice. On purely financial considerations the sound and logical plan if present basis is abandoned would undoubtedly be to let market take its course and reserve intervention until opportune level and occasion for stabilisation is again reached. On general grounds, however, there would be great value, whatever the ultimate constitutional decisions, in settling currency policy in a manner accepted by Indians at Conference, while if position could really be made secure, there would be obvious advantages in avoiding period of complete instability. For these reasons ultimate choice may have to depend on Indian attitude at Conference, and on degree to which British Government are-ready to stake their responsibility. I therefore defer final recommendation, merely stating that on financial grounds para. 5 is best.&quot; 8. The practical difficulties of achieving agreement on currency policy at the Conference without going through a period of discussion during which local exchange situation would get out of control, must of course be recognised. On this it will be necessary to exchange further telegrams if this course is considered.&quot; 9. I have not attempted more than the bare statement of alternatives and have not enlarged on the extreme difficulty of India in any case remaining on the present standard if current juices continue, nor on dangers of unrest and agitation especially in rural areas which necessary economic adjustments will involve.&quot; But these must be taken into account, together with the following factors : Firstly, the actual experience particularly of London borrowing during the past nine months. Secondly, the deterioration in our position caused - by prolonged period of uncertainty since the last Conference. Thirdly, the further drop in prices and prolongation of world economic collapse. Fourthly, the present British financial position. To sum up, my views based on these factors are firstly, that if there is any sort of transfer of responsibility at the Centre it will be impossible to maintain present ratio ; secondly, that if British responsibility at the Centre is retained maintenance will be possible, but, apart from increased political difficulties, it will involve financial responsibilities for the British Government, which it seems hardly conceivable that they will accept.&quot; I am therefore forced to the conclusion that whatever the merits of the case, the present position will not in fact be maintained, and that therefore the wisest course is to face realities and take advantage of the Conference to make the change as measure of agreement with Indian representatives.&quot; 10. In any case the urgent practical need is an immediate decision and action to support whatever course is chosen during the Conference ; rumours will be spread and local situation may get beyond control. If decision is to make no change, then for safety we need first an immediate public promise of a definite British credit; secondly, an announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not allow a change in ratio to be made as a result of Conference. If contrary decision is to make change, then tactics must be carefully planned without delay. In this case also I would urgently press for an immediate promise of a definite British credit, for this will stabilise position pending support of public settlement, and will give a much more defensible appearance to British Government action. I suggest that for London discussions it will be valuable to call in Taylor, Controller of Currency, now on leave in England.&quot;
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1931.Copy No.......CA BTNET.indian financial position.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.As my colleagues may imagine, I have been deeply concerned since I went to the India Office with the question of Indian finance. As a basis for my discussions on the subject, I have had prepared the following memorandum. It appears to me so clear and instructive that I am circulating it to the Cabinet. I may add that the Finance Department of the India Office and the Treasury are at present discussing the whole situation, and that I intend to report more fully to the Cabinet upon the subject in the near future.S. II.India Office, 10th September 1931.Note by Financial Department, India Office.&quot;Home Charges&quot; and Remittance.The revenues of India are collected almost entirely in rupees, whereas a considerable amount of expenditure out of these revenues is incurred externally, i.e. in sterling. In a normal year the net amount of sterling required for expenditure, exclusive of the repayment of maturing loans, is in the neighbourhood of  35 millions, these requirements being normally met by remittance through the market in the following manner: Indian exports of merchandise have in the past commonly exceeded imports by some  50 or  60 millions. This favourable &quot; visible balance of trade&quot; creates a surplus of sterling credits beyond those required to finance imports, and a proportion of the sterling so available is purchased by the Government and paid for in rupees. The whole of the sterling credits representing the excess of exports over imports of merchandise is not necessarily available for this purpose, since there are other items including exports and imports of treasure, and the so-called &quot; invisible &quot; items, e.g. investments overseas hy Indians and investments of external capital in India, ocean freights, payment of dividends abroad, remittance of savings abroad, &amp;c. which all enter into the final balance of payments.The world-wide slump and fall in price levels, which has hit with j)eculiar severity the primary producing countries such as India, has brought about a serious decrease in Indian exports, but this has been partially counterbalanced by a falling-off of imports, so that there has still been a substantial, though reduced, &quot; visible &quot; balance of trade. Normally, this should have enabled Government to continue to meet its sterling commitments, wholly or to a gTeat extent, by remittance. In actual fact, however, the net amount of remittance which it has been possible to secure since February 1930 is nil.   The reason for this is indicated in the next paragraph.Exchange.There has arisen in India a lack of confidence in the future financial stability of Government and, in particular, a lack of confidence in the stability of the rupee exchange. There has been for a number of years an agitation, largely fostered by interested parties, aiming at the abandonment of the present exchange ratio of Is. 6d. to the rupee. Until recently this was concentrated on a demand for reversion to the pre-war ratio of Is. 4d., but the present tendency is to jness for the removal of all currency control and for the rupee to be left completely unstable. Many people believe that the new Federal Government will be unwilling or unable to maintain the existing ratio. The natural result of all this is a flight from the rupee, i.e. an attempt on the part of those whose capital or savings exist in the form of rupees to convert them into external currency. Fortunately, owing perhaps largely to the conservatism of the Indian public, this movement has not yet attained unmanageable dimensions. If it were to become unmanageable this would involve for India an economic catastrophe of the first magnitude.secret.cp. 226 (31).307      75 + 75   9.31
From the particular standpoint of the Governments sterling requirements, the effect of the movement to export private capital from India is that the surplus sterling which would normally be available for purchase by Government is acquired instead by private parties and Government is able to make little or no remittance. In case of a failure of remittance there are two methods open to the Secretary of State for obtaining funds to meet his sterling requirements : (a) by drawing on the currency reserves ; and (b) by borrowing in London. The employment of either of these courses is subject to certain limitations, explained below.Currency Reserves.The currency reserves form the baching to the Indian currency (i.e. the note issue and the silver rupee) and constitute the basis for public confidence in the stability of the currency. Thus, if the total amount of gold and sterling held in the reserves were reduced below a certain point, this would undoubtedly create a widespread impression that it would become impossible to maintain the stability of the rupee, thus bringing about a rapid acceleration in the flight from the rupee. It is impossible to say in advance to what point the reserves could be reduced without producing such a result, but it is quite certain that it would occur long before they were finally exhausted. Substantial inroads have already had to be made on these reserves, the gold and sterling holdhigs of which (including gold held in India) stand to-day at about  50 millions as compared with  70 millions in June 1929. A much more serious depletion of the reserves has only been avoided by borrowing in London on an abnormal scale.Sterling Borrowing.As regards borrowing in London, it is undesirable, and it is not the practice of the Secretary of State, to raise loans to meet ordinary current expenditure. It has been usual in the past to incur a great deal of sterling capital expenditure of a reproductive nature, e.g. on railway equipment, which it has been possible to finance in part by funds remitted from India, the balance being legitimately provided by borrowings in London. Recent circumstances, however, have obliged the Secretary of State to raise loans on a scale far beyond current capital expenditure. Between January 1931 and May 1931 public issues aggregating  52,000,000 (including  5,000,000 for conversion purposes) were made on the London market. Even if the market had continued a willing lender, it would not have been in accordance with sound financial principles or common prudence to continue such a course indefinitely. As a matter of fact, the London market and the investing public had, by May 1931, become quite alive to the position. The issue in that month of  10,000,000 Indian 0 per cent. Bonds of only 2-1- to 3  years&apos; currency had in the main to be taken up by the underwriters, and stands to-day at such a discount that the return on it is about 6 - per cent. British Bonds, with a similar date of maturity, would yield about 4-J per cent., and this difference illustrates the depreciation of Indian credit. In this connection it has to be borne in mind that in January 1932 a loan of  15,000,000 is due for repayment, while sterling loans maturing within the next seven years amount in the aggregate (including the above  15,000,000) to no less than  67,000,000.Position in June 1931.The difficulties of the financial position, already great, were intensified and emphasised by the failure of the latest Bond issue and by the depreciation in India&apos;s credit which that failure represented. It was realised that in the event of remittance not being forthcoming, sterling borrowing being impracticable, and the sterling currency reserves having been drawn upon to the practical limit, there would remain, as things then stood, no alternative method of providing funds to meet the obligations for which the Secretary of State for India is liable. In other words, he would be obliged to default. Not only would such a contingency be disastrous for India, but an Indian default would deal a shattering blow to British credit and would produce widespread loss and ruin in this country.It was felt that the root difficulty was lack of confidence in the future financial stability of Government, and particularly in the stability of exchange ; that this lack of coutidence was attributable to the political situation, and that uncertainty was likely to prevail until at least the reassembled Round-Table Conference should have accepted effective financial safeguards. The Government of India represented that the financial situation was essentially the result of political policy, and that His
Majesty&apos;s Government being responsible for that policy could not divest themselves of the responsibility for framing the comprehensive financial policy.Prime Ministers Declaration of 26th June 1931.It, was felt that if stability of exchange was not maintained, there was little hope of proceeding with constitutional reforms until the finances of India had been rehabilitated, and that sooner or later His Majesty&apos;s Government would probably be faced with the choice between giving some measure of financial support to the Government of India to tide over the present period of uncertainty, and abandoning for an indefinite period the project of constitutional reforms. The matter was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and on 26th June the Prime Minister made the following announcement in reply to a question in Parliament : &quot;The financial strain on the resources of the Government of India, already great owing to the world economic depression, has been accentuated by uncertainties which have attended the discussion of constitutional changes and more particularly the consideration of the provisions to be embodied in the new Constitution to ensure financial stability. It will not be possible to introduce the proposed constitutional changes if financial stability is not assured, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined not to allow a state of affairs to arise which might jeopardise the financial stability and good government of India for which the Secretary of State is at present responsible. They have therefore decided that, should the need arise, they will apply to Parliament for the authority necessary to enable them to give financial support under suitable conditions to the Government of India for the purpose of maintaining the credit of the country pending the settlement of the constitutional problem and the formulation of provisions which will ensure the maintenance of India&apos;s credit in the future.&quot;This declaration was made subject to certain understandings, which were accepted by the Secretary of State and communicated by him to the Government of India. These were embodied in a letter from the Treasury, dated 4th July, as follows : &quot; My Lords consider it desirable to put on record that They have agreed to this declaration, which involves a very serious contingent liability upon British funds, on the following understandings, viz. : (1) That the Government of India will use its sterling reserves freely to maintain the exchange and that Parliament cannot be approached unless and until there is serious clanger of these reserves being exhausted. (2) That the Government oE India will take firm and effective action with a view to restoring and maintaining a sound financial aud monetary position in India both as regards making good the Budget deficiencies by  economies  or by  increased  taxation  or  both  and as regards contracting the currency to such extent as may be proved necessary. (3) That the Treasury will be kept in close consultation as regards the practical measures to be adopted for the above purpose as well as in regard to the provisions to be embodied in the future settlement of the constitutional problen so as to ensure the maintenance of India&apos;s credit in the future.My Lords will be glad to know that these understandings are acceptable to your Department and They would be glad if the Government of India could be informed of them as constituting the essential basis of the declaration.&quot;Revenue and Expenditure: Central Government.The following are the recent revenue and expenditure figures of the Government of India : RevisedAccounts, Estimates, Budget,1929-30. 1931-31. 1931-32.Rs. crores. Rs. crores.Revenue       -         -         -   132&apos;69           123-44 134-87Expenditure -         -         -   132-42           136-12 134*86Surplus (-f) or deficit (-)   4-0-27          -12 - 68 4-0&apos; 01
The Budget of 1930-31 had anticipated a small surplus, btrt the Revised Estimates for that year disclosed a very large deficit, as shown above. When it came to the preparation of the 1931-32 Budget, it appeared that--on the basis of existing taxation and expenditure -the still larger deficit of Rs. 17 &quot;24 crores had to be provided for. Exceptional efforts were called for to meet this situation, and eventually measiires were passed which produced a balanced budget, the gap being-bridged by savings and new taxation as follows : Rs. crores.Reduction of military expenditure (including savings from further extension of the &quot; stabilised military budget &quot; period)      2135 Reduction of civil expenditure - - - - 1 * 13Increased customs and excise duties    - - - -      9&apos; 82Increased taxes on income       - - - - -      3*95Total   - - - -     17-25* Note-Rs. 1 crore ^ Us. 1,00,00,000 (100 lakhs) - [at Is. Gd. per rupee]  750,000.In the early summer it had already become apparent that owing to the difficult economic and political conditions of tbe year, even the drastic measures taken would not suffice to produce a balance between revenue and expenditure. Reliable figures are not yet available, but in June the Government of India made a rough estimate that the revenue deficit might be as large as Rs. 10 crores. In addition it was thought likely that the railways would show a deterioration of a further 10 crores which., owing to the exhaustion of the Railway Reserve Fund, would in practice have largely to be borne by general revenues.Provincial Finance.The revenue and expenditure of the Provinces is kept separate from that of the Government of India, and each Province is responsible for balancing its own budget. But the resources of the Provinces are merged with those of the Central Government, so that the latter acts in effect as their banker, and any Province which is in deficit becomes a drain on the Ways and Means j)ositiou of the Central Government. Provincial revenues, like those of the Central Government, have been seriously affected by the difficulties of the year ; and it was estimated in June, by the Government of India, that the out-turn of the year, as regards provincial finance, would show a great deterioration, roughly estimated at Rs. 10 crores.The Present Emergency.The Government of India are thus faced with a probable Central deficit of, say, Es. 20 crores (including railways), and with having to find in addition Rs. 10 crores for the Provinces; they are burdened with a floating debt in India of over Ps. 80 crores, part of which has been due to the need of drawing funds off the market as a measure of currency control, and part to the financing of their own deficits and those of the Provinces ; the sterling reserves for the maintenance of the currency standard have been materially depleted ; exchange is weak ; there has been abnormally heavy sterling borrowing, with little prospect of the renewal of borrowing in this market until conditions change ; and there remains, in spite of the Prime Ministers declaration, considerable lack of confidence owing to political uncertainties.These factors make it necessary to consider special steps to restore the situation, and this need is further emphasised by the undertaking implied in the acceptance of the Treasury letter of 4th July. Measures both of retrenchment and of increased taxation are being considered, and the Treasury are being kept in consultation as to the measures to be adopted.The Government of India were at first inclined to propose a programme which involved reljung this year almost entirely on retrenchment and postponing additional taxation until the introduction of the regular Budget next February. It is quite certain, however, that retrenchment alone can only go a short way towards bridging the deficit, and the Secretary of State accordingly informed them that he could not acquiesce in such a programme and &quot; must ask that taxation proposals be put before the Legislature before the end of the calendar year.&quot; This would involve a choice between prolonging the ordinary Simla session of the Legislature and convening a
special session at Delhi in October or November.   The Government of India have now. intimated that, if action along these lines is to be pursued, they consider the latter alternative the only feasible one, and would hold a special session at Delhi in early-November.A full report on the whole situation is expected shortly from the Government of India when they have had an opportunity of considering it in the light of the four-monthly revenue estimates and of interim reports from the various retrenchment committees. The present position in respect of the principal measures, of retrench-rnent and taxation respectively, which have been under consideration, is briefly sketched in the following two paragraphs.Retrenchment. \Military. It is recognised that the safety of India is the overriding consideration. The Ai-my authorities have acquiesced in proposals saving Rs. 107 lakhs. In addition cuts none of which the military are yet reported to have recognised as possible-have been under investigation, totalling approximately Rs. 168 lakhs; and non-committal reference has been made to the possibility of cutting out all provision for the &quot; extraordinary charges for re-equipment, &amp;c,&quot; totalling Rs. 175 lakhs.Raihoays. Certain changes in rates have already been adopted earlier in the year. Any general raising of goods rates at the present time is thought by the Government of India to be impossible. It seems probable that the most important saving that can be hoped for is by application to the railways of any cuts in pay adopted for Government servants generally.Posts and Telegraphs. Some extra charges of a minor nature have been imposed, and others which do not require legislation are being considered. Small increases in letter and postcard rates, for which legislation is required, would produce about Rs. 78 lakhs per annum, and the Secretary of State has urged that these changes should be included in the comprehensive scheme.Civil Departments. Retrenchment schemes are under consideration by the Government of India which may produce as much as Rs. 250 lakhs per annum. These, it is stated, will involve large dismissals of staff, including some for whom the Secretary of State is responsible.Cuts in Pay. The benefit from: any general reduction in salaries would accrue mainly to the Provincial Governments; hut the Central Government would obtain some pecuniary saving by this means, and it has also been urged that the passage of unpalatable measures of taxation, &amp;c, may be smoothed if they are coupled with a reduction in the pay of the higher officials in particular. The question of reductions in the pay of the Services is fully discussed in a separate note which is being prepared by the Services and General Department. It is sufficient to remar-k here that it would be scarcely practicable to reduce the pay of subordinate staffs while leaving untouched that of the classes of higher-paid officials whose remuneration is-protected by Statute, and that any question of reducing the pay of the protected Services brings in (1) the doubt whether Parliament would take the action required, and (2) the risk that there would be a rush of retirements, resulting in paralysis of the administration. The Government of India have not yet made a definite recom-mendation, beyond asking that a legislative measure should be got ready in case of need ; but the Finance Member has made it clear that in his view any comprehensive scheme for dealing with the present situation must include general reductions in the pay of the Services. The alternative which has been under examination is a general increase in the rates of taxes on income, which would hit the higher-paid officials in common with the rest of the community coupled with actual reductions of pay for the lower-paid Government servants not affected by income-tax. The pay of police and certain other of the lowest-paid grades would probably in any case have to be left untouched.General. As regards Public Works, nothing more was included in the Budget than grants for works in progress, and the position is again under review. The Hoover plan should result in a relief to revenue of Rs. 40 lakhs. It would be possible to cut out the optional portion of the j)revision for reduction and avoidance of debt amounting to Rs. 265 lakhs, but this, which is a measure of the same nature as raiding the Sinking Fund, while it would produce an apparent improvement in the Revenue Budget, would do nothing really to alleviate the position.307 15
Provincial Governments. A Conference with the Finance Members of the Provinces was held in May. Retrenchment campaigns are proceeding in all Provinces, and the Central Government are keeping in touch with developments.Taxation.Income-lax. The possibility of enhancing the rates of tax is referred to above. Apart from the advantages of this as an expedient for dealing with the difficulties involved in reducing the pay of the protected services, the measure should in itself produce a substantial sum. As a separate and additional measure, the question has been considered of reducing the minimum of incomes liable to tax. This would apparently produce only about Rs. 17 lakhs net, but even so may be worth considering.Salt. A potential increase in the salt tax has been generally regarded as a &quot; tax reserve &quot; for emergencies, and as such it would seem reasonable to call upon it at the present crisis. It is, however, of course, highly controversial. The Secretary of State has informed the Government of India : &quot; I see no alternative to a substantial enhancement of the salt duty. I realise that this proposal will excite intense opposition, which is an element we should have to consider, but when heavy sacrifices are being called for from the upper and middle classes it might have to be accepted.&quot;Apart from the question of raising the rate of tax, steps are being taken to abolish the salt credit system. This should result in additional revenue of Rs. 1 crore this year and Rs. 1 crore in 1932-3. If, in addition, the tax were doubled, a further Rs. 112 lakhs might be anticipated this year and as much as Rs. 5 or 6 crores next year.Customs and Excise. The general level of Customs duties is already high, and the Government of India feel that in most directions the economic limit has been reached. They are, however, considering the possibility of new or additional duties on dyes, raw cotton, cotton yarn, artificial silk yarn and piece-goods. The Customs and Excise duties on kerosene and motor spirit were increased in the last Budget, but the Secretary of State has suggested that a further increase should be considered.The Government of India have expressed apprehensions as to the attitude of the Legislature to measures involving increased taxation. In this connection the Secretary of State, in a telegram dated 31st July, observed : &quot; In dealing with the question of taxation and other measures for increasing revenue, while it is of the highest importance to do everything possible to carry the Legislature with us, the mere opposition of the Legislature would not necessarily preclude us from adopting measures which in this emergency we consider essential.&quot;India Office, 2nd September 1931.
