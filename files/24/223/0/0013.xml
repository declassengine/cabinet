ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)p E C R E T. lo,P.  217 (51).COPY NOCABINET. PROPOSED ECONOMIES IN THE CIVIL LIST.The attached letter from the Keeper of the Privy Purse to the Prime Minister in regard to economies in the Civil List is circulated by direction of the Prime Minister, for consideration at the Meeting of the Cabinet to be held today at 3oO p.m.(Signed) M.P.A.HANKEY. Secretary, Cabinet,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.TJ. 1. 3rd September, 1931,
Balmoral Gastle.28th August, 1931.My dear Prime Minister,The King told me to go and see the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Tuesday and to discuss with him in what way His Majesty should participate in the movement for the reduction of national expenditure.      I told the Chancellor that the King was willing to consider any proposal, no matter how drastic, hut I was to explain that, after the war, when, owing to the increased cost of living and the depreciation in the purchasing power of the pound, the Civil List was found to he totally inadequate, His Majesty refused to have recourse to Parliament and ask for an increase in the Civil List.    The King decided to carry out drastic economies and as a temporary measure to borrow  100,000 from the Duchy of Lancaster.   &apos; It is therefore clear that any further reduction on a large scale will entail a fundamental change in the State functions which have hitherto been associated with the Monarchy.     It would involve the selling of the horses and scrapping of the carriages used in the procession for the Opening of Parliament;    it might entail the abolition of the G-entlemen-at-Arms and the Beefeaters.     All these economies would really fall on the public more than on the King, and His Majesty therefore hesitated to suggest a 20$ reduction in the Civil List.    The King, however, had come to the conclusion that 10% would be quite possible, although it would no doubt entail the diminution of Court entertainments.
I told the Chancellor that His Majesty thought that,  instead of expressing it in terms of percentage, it would tie wiser to say that he had decided to surrender  50,000 a year from the Civil List.     The Chancellor said that he quite agreed with His Majesty in thinking that it would be a mistake to attempt to surrender so much as 20% under the special circumstances which I had referred to, and he was of opinion that if the King said he was willing to give up  50,000 during this financial crisis that would have a very good effect in the country and would undoubtedly help as an example to others.I asked the Chancellor when this announcement should be made, and he thought that probably you would prefer to wait until Parliament met before making any such statement.     His Majesty, however,  is of opinion that while it would never do to be premature, it would be a mistake to give the impression that he had been forced unwillingly to give up this sum after hearing of the voluntary sacrifices which have been made by Cabinet Ministers and others. The King therefore would like to leave it entirely in your hands as to when the announcement should be made.    Of course if you could not find a suitable opportunity for announcing this in any speech which you would make in the next fortnight or so,  the statement could be made in the form of a letter written by me to yourself which could be published.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) P. P0NSONBY. Hon. James Ramsay MacDonald, M.P.2.P.S. The Members o:.&quot; the Royal Family are also anxious to surrender a proportionate amount of the grants which they receive from Parliament.    The members and servants of the Royal Household also wish to participate in the movement anc are prepared to accept a scheme by which a certain percent-age of their salaries and wages will be reduced.      These two items will be in addition to the  50,000 which the King has surrendered.
