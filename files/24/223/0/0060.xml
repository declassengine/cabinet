THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1931.SECRET.CP. 265 (31).CABINET.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.Adoption of a Standard Horse-Power Measurement for Aircraft Engines.Note by the Secretary of State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith for the information of the Cabinet a memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staff upon the proposals for the standard horse-power measurement for aircraft engines.A.Air Ministry, October 7, 1931.Observations of the Chief of the Air Staff upon the Report of theCommittee of Experts.(C. 259, M. 115, 1931, viii.)1. IN discharging their allotted task of suggesting a standard method of calculating the horse-power of aircraft engines, the Expert Committee have evolved a formula calculated to give an index of horse-power assessed on a purely arbitrary basis. The formula is based upon the &quot; total volume&quot; of the cylinders of the engine, and the weight of the engine itself together with certain accessories.2. The Committee observe that &apos;&apos; any formula for horse-power rating which could not be verified without the assistance of a dynamometer could reasonably be objected to on technical grounds,&quot; and further that &quot;no standard test on a dynamometer would give equitably comparable results for engines in the air and on the ground.&quot; In short, the Committee recognised at the outset that definite assessments could only be obtained by means of test-bench measurements to which there are insuperable practical and technical objections; and that even if test-bench tests were practicable, the results of horse-power measurements so obtained at ground level would not be comparable with the output of the engine when at an altitude in the air.After reviewing the defects of systems of assessment based upon the cylinder &quot;volume,&quot; and upon engine weight, the Committee finally suggest the adoption of the formula referred to above as a compromise &apos;&apos; involving the fewest disadvantages.&quot;3. An examination of the result of attempting to apply the suggested formula reveals the following circumstances :  (i) The formula takes no account of the vitally important factor of engine speed, i.e., revolutions per minute of the crankshaft. In consequence, the margin of error amounts to as much as 22 per cent, in the (ground level) assessment of the power of existing standard engines and would probably reach a still higher figure in the future.[5693]   [6062]Copy No.     8
(ii) The formula does not make adequate allowance for the effects of&quot;supercharging,&quot; that is, of supplying the cylinders with fuel-mixture under pressure. (&quot; Supercharging&quot; is resorted to principally in order to increase the horse-power of engines at an altitude.) The result is that at a height of 12,000 feet there could be a difference in actual horse-power of some 70 per cent, as between two engines (one &quot;supercharged&quot; and one not &quot;supercharged&quot;), whose rating under the Committee&apos;s proposed formula was practically identical.(iii) Owing to the introduction of the weight factor and the inclusion ofcertain accessories such as radiators, it is not possible to apply the formula until the engine has been actually installed in an aircraft. Because of this circumstance, identical engines, when installed in different types of aircraft, would, under the Committee&apos;s formula, be rated at different &apos;&apos; horse-powers.&quot; Moreover, it will; in many cases, be impossible to arrive at the weight of the accessories since these are often incorporated in, and inseparable from, the structure of the aircraft itself. For example, the wings and body surface of our Schneider Trophy racing machines are used as radiators, and it would be practically impossible to decide what proportion of the weight of the aircraft represented &quot;radiator weight.&quot;4. In these circumstances and while conceding that the Expert Committee could not have been expected to produce a more satisfactory rating formula the Air Staff are of opinion that their proposals are not practicable.5. Even if it were practicable as a measure of international comparison accurately to determine the horse-power of each type of engine, the basis of whatever form of test was proposed would inevitably have to include arbitrary assumptions as to certain factors, such as the quality of the fuel, the engine speed, the &quot;compression ratio,&quot; and relative reliability all of which affect the horse-power obtainable from a given engine. So that results of any such test would not necessarily form a criterion of the potential war value of aviation engines.6. Furthermore, the horse-power of an engine as such, is not a direct index of the anticipated performance of military aircraft. Apart from the aero-dynamical efficiency of the airframe itself, the performance of the aircraft will in addition depend upon the &quot;head-resistance&quot; of the motor, the efficiency of the airscrew, the combined weight of the engine and its fuel which does not vary directly with the horse-power maximum and minimum speeds, rate of climb, and various other factors.7. In conclusion, it is evident that to be oi practical use a system of horse-power assessment must comply with the following minimum requirements :  (i) It must furnish a basis for purposes of comparison, irrespective of theconditions under which the engine is to be employed, (ii) It must be sufficiently accurate for purposes of limitation.   .(iii) It must take into account all the technical considerations.(iv) It must be capable of practical application.The formula proposed by the Expert Committee does not comply Avith any of these conditions, and in the opinion of the Air Staff it is not at present possible to suggest any practicable formula or system which will do so. 1 &apos;*The application of a horse-power limitation is not in the interests of this country (Cabinet decision CP. 371 (30)), and in view of the impracticability of establishing any satisfactory system of horse-power rating, it is recommended that on these grounds His Majesty&apos;s Government should decline to accept a limitation of the horse-power of aircraft.Air Ministry, July 17, 1931.
