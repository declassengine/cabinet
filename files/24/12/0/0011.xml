T   SEBRET 7% WAR dABIIETpi I  bU Tsd^HAVAX situation mm m&amp;m^cE to thm submarihel&quot; 797/ &apos; DANGLE.MMOHAHPUM   PR Oil THfl ADMIRALTY.I.First Soil lord to First LordI fool it my duty to place before yon my considered      , opinion that tho time has arrived when it is necessary to bring home more fully to tho Government the very serious nature oi the naval position with which wo are now confronted. &apos;I fear that the War Cabinet is not as yet fully impressedwith the gravity of the situation.     This may bo duo, in partat any rate, to want of sufficient emphasis in;what. I have saidand written to its members, and on thin aes&amp;mption I must now invoke your aid, and that of the Board itself if necessary, toadd force to my arguments and representations.As you may be aware, the only result of my efforts so far has been the appointment of Committees to investigate various features of tho problem, such as the rate at which we can build-, ships to replace losses, the extent to wh$ch our shipping can be reduced without starving the country, etc.; and I must point out with all the force at my command&apos; that this kind of adnini-str&amp;tive action does nothing to grapple with the vital difficulties of th$ situation.To begin with,- all such estimates depend upon a forecast of our probable losses   in mercantile shipping and such fore-casts are utterly useless *   . It is out of my own or anyone elsers power to furnish figures with any approach to accuracy.The losses which we shall suffer depend upon such factors as the number of enemy submarines which are working, the skill with which they are disposed on our various trade routes, the numbor of torpedoes which they can curry and the facilities possessed by the enemy for replacing those expended, the skill of tho personnel, tho sagacity of the officers of our own merchant ships, our luck in hitting off routes clear of submarines, our ability to intercept vessels which are on dangerous routes and to divert them when the danger becomes apparent, weather conditions, the number of vessels which we are able to maintain on patrol, tho rate at which wo can arm our merchant ships with guns and howitzers, the rate at which we can fit them with mine protection,, the rate at which we can replace our minesweepers, the perfection of our minefields and the&apos; rapidity with which the new pattern mine can be manufactured.Hearly the whole of these factors are problematical and no sort of accurate estimate can be given:   some depend. largely on the industry of the workmen of this country and on how far we may enjoy freedom from strikes..   All estimates of deliveries of any of the new devices under manufacture have been falsified owing to labour difficulties, and, generally speaking,  ,   -it is guite impossible to foresee the date at which wo may hope to increase the rate of destruction of the enemy submarines.AH these enquiries and all this Committee work - though valuable for certain purposes - falls very far short of the
courageous end drastic action that should &quot;be applied &quot;by H iM.Gov ernme nt.For instance, I have urged time after time the absolute necessity that exists for reducing the number of lines of communication which the Navy is called upon to safeguard and for increasing the protection of those lines of communication which remain.     So far the only result of my efforts has- been increased calls upon the Ifavy without any sort of reduction of liabilities and with no appreciable increase of our resources^    During tho last three months, for example, we have been asked to import largo numbers of native labourers from all parts of the world and, &quot;by   the recent actions of the enemy, we are a^so called upon to escort all our hospital ships except those in far distant waters.Tho real fact of tho matter is this.    We are carrying on the war at tho present time as if wo had the absolute command of the sea, whereas we have not such cQ.mmarid or anything ap-oroaching itu     It is quite true that we are masters of the situation so far as surface ships are concerned, but it must be realised - and realised at once - that this will be quite useless if the enemy1s submarines.paralyse, as they do now, our lines of communication.History has shown from time to time the fatal results of basing naval and military strategy on an insecure line of communicationso     Disaster is certain to follow and our present policy is heading straight for disasterc     It is useless and &quot;dangerous in the highest degree to ignore that fact .I must, therefore, advise that the G&amp;vernment should so shape, its policy as to recognise that we have neither the indisputed command of the. sea nor even a reasonable measure of that command.     If we do not recognise this it is my firm conviction that we shall lose the war by the starvation of our people and the paralysing of our allies by failing to supply them with coal and other essentials.The policy of the war must, of course, be decided by the Government.     It is merely my duty to advise &quot;whether the Navy is in a position to give effect to that policy, and I have no desire to trespass beyond my proper functions,     I fool, however, that, as I am addressing this serious memorandum to you in the hope that through you its contents may have some influence on the War Cabinet, I ought to indicate several very important matters which, in my Judgment, demand immediate attention..I feel certain that the Navy will indubitably fail in the noar future to satisfy the demands made upon It by the present policy of H.M.Government unless -(a) wo at once withdraw the whole of our force from Salonica, as this is the quarter which taxes our resources most heavily and, from the military point of view, gives no promise of a successful offensive.     Apart from all questions&apos; of securing shipping and releasing H.M.Ships from escort work in the Salonica area, for use elsewhere, it is a fact on which I am bound to insist with great emphasis that the Navy will be unable to moot the demands recently put forward for the removal of sick and wounded from this area.(b) We realise that we cannot continue to bring reinforcements of troops into this country unless they are convoyed in ships carrying other essentials from the Colonies, such as food, etc, as we cannot afford to provide the necessary escorting ships..

Without some such relief as I have indicated - and that given immediately-- the Navy will    -fail in Its responsibilities to tho country and the country itself will suffer starvation.

In connection with the paper which I have asked you to place before the Prime Minister, on the subject of the general naval strategy of the war, I would urge very strongly that urgent necessity that exists for immediate measures being taken to facilitate in every possible way the speedy provisioning of the United Kingdom in order that a sufficient reserve of foodstuff may be quickly built up so that the Country may be in a position to stand a siege.

One of the most important points in this connection is the equipment of our Western ports for the rapid discharge of cargoes of foodstuffs and their distribution; and at the present moment most of these ports are utterly unequipped to deal with the situation. The result is that cargoes of valuable foodstuffs, and, indeed, valuable cargoes of all sorts arrive safely in our Western ports, and the ships, instead of being able to discharge at the port of arrival, are sent to sea again, have to run the gauntlet of submarines in the Channel and Irish Sea, with the result that the ships are often sunk and the valuable cargoes lost.

There have been many instances of this. Ships have arrived at Liverpool and are ordered to London; ships arrive at Plymouth where they discharge passengers and are ordered to London; and a recent instance has been the safe arrival at Portland of the large Atlantic Transport "MINNESOTA&apos;, carrying and enormous cargo, and great efforts have been made to induce the Admiralty to allow this ship to go to London to discharge. The ship herself was partially disabled and could only steam 11 knots speed. She offers an immense target to a submarine, and I therefore ordered her to be discharged at Portland. The greatest pressure has been put upon the Admiralty to send her to London, and owing to the inadequacy of the arrangements at Portland, and the long detention to which the ship would have been subjected, I have escorted her to Southampton for discharge. Even this action has been mot with many protests.

Today a case has occurred of a Belgian steamer having to go to Calais from America to discharge, and from Calais return to Cardiff to unload steel billets for munitions.

I suggest that this matter is one which requires handling immediately and with great determination. The Admiralty has been pressing this question throughout the war.

It is understood that there is available for shipment in Canada at the present time, when it can be collected, two million tons of wheat, approximately three months supply for the United Kingdom. It is obvious that every available vessel should be turned on to bring this wheat across as fast as it can be transported to the ports for shipment; and that, in order to minimise the risks on arrival, the discharge should take place as far as possible at Western ports. The shipping necessary for bringing across this wheat should be that released by the proposal made in my paper above referred to.

I attach a paper which has been presented to me by the Pirst Sea Lord.   When I first read it I thought it my duty to summon the Board of Admiralty together before presenting it to you, in order that I might hear the views of my colleagues; and after considerable discussion, the Board unanimously con--curred with the views expressed in the; memorandum - and also were of opinion that I should urge those views upon you.In the crisis with which we find ourselves through being unable to deal successfully with the submarine menace, and in the absence of any specific remedy against the menace of the submarine, it is quite clear to me that we can only look for palliatives - and one of the most obvious is the cutting down a3 far as possible of the traffic of our vessels upon the high seas, and reducing it to a minimum of what is necessary for the successful prosecution of the war.    The commitments of the Government in Salonika have imposed, and are imposing, upon the Admiralty a strain ?diich they are unable to bear with any chance of success, and it is obvious that if the ships which are engaged in supplying&apos; our expedition there could be turned to use for &quot;Bringing food into this country,  something at all events would be gained in meeting the submarine difficulties. But in addition,  it would free a number of destroyers and other vessels which are badly needed for protecting and p?*trolling the trade routes in those quarters through which our food supplies have necessarily to pass.It is the duty of the Board of Admiralty to state frankly the naval view - and that you will find in the papers presented to me by the Pirst Sea Lord and adopted by the Board.But I should like to add that, while we put forward the naval view, it must not be.supposed that. I am not aware, of the grave political difficulties which are involved in the with-, drawal of the forces from Salonika, and of the complications that arise by reason of our having to adapt our policy as far as possible to that of our Allies.   I would most strongly urge, however, that under existing conditions, and with no prospect so far as I can see, of solving the submarine question in the immediate future,  our first, thought must be to make the position of. our people here as secure as possible.1 do not think it is necessary to add anything more as I am well aware, from the many conversations we have had upon the subject, how fully your own mind is possessed of the urgency of this question. &apos; , ,(Inilld)   E.C.lot MaV( 1917First.
