MAliiY STATES .    RUBBER   INDUSTRY.   \miORANllJM Representations have been made to me as tothe importance of maintaining British control of the rubber growing industry in the Federated Malay States, and the darker of allowing foreign capitalists to take unfair advantage of the restrictions as to the issue of new capital imposed on British companies to alter the present status of that industry.   The export of rubber from the Malay States in 1916 was 62,765 tons. It is estimated that the land already alienated in British ivlalaya is capable of producing 420,000 tons annually.     It is also estimated that some 4,390,000 acres of rubber land exists in the Federated Malay States though much of this is not easily accessible at present.    Exclusive of small holdingsj the area already alienated for rubber cultivation is more than 900,000 acres.; . In view of the increasing importance ofrubber as a raw material, and the tendency of British manufacturers (e.g. the Dunlop Company) to acquire land for rubber growing in order to be independent of the middleman, I think that tnis question will require serious consideration at the end of the war.     It is understood that the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy will make recommendations on the general question of restrictions on aliens holding land in British territory.     The Coranittee have asked me to abstain from any action wnich might create a precedent in regard to rubber until the whole policy has been considered, as they are impressed with thedanger..........I HI I Mil.......llllllBillllllllllllMllllWllliwrilPiH...........................iiniiiiwiu-iiipiiiii...... ------ -     i -----------r i  ; ------------
danger of retaliation.     It is understood that they have in mind especially the iron ore mines in Spain.It has for many years past been the settled policy of Hi? Majesty&apos;s Government to insist upon British con-trol of companies exploiting oil fields in British Colonies.    At the request of the Admiralty the Colonial Office has adopted the same policy in regard to the bauxite deposits which have attracted attention since the war began.   British Control has also been in-sisted upon in the case of companies exploiting other raw materials in the Colonies in isolated instances. Since the war instructions have been given in India triat no prospecting licence or mining lease of any mineral whatever is to be granted to an alien.    The Government of India have also forbidden the transfer of existing concessions without their leave.In these circumstances trie question of setting a precedent would seem not to arise in regard to the Malay States rubber industry.   The Empire is full of precedents,     I have, however, no desire to prejudge the general issue, and even so far as the Malayan rub-ber industry is concerned I do not propose to take any decision as to permanent policy until the industrial Policy Committee&apos;s recommendations have been received and considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   I only propose a temporary war measure designed to preserve the status quo and to prevent the final decision being taken out of the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government by the march of events before there has been time to examine the whole question properly and arrive at a considered decision.I am
I am much impressed with the argument that British companies cannot extend their operations while the capital restrictions are in force, but that American and Japane-se companies are free to invest their war profits in rubber plantations and so to secure a firm footing in the rubber growing industry.   It is obvious that if, at the end of the war, a large area of rubber land in the Federated Malay States had passed under foreign control His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be free to adopt whichever policy commended itself to them, but would ^ave ^0 ^e content with reserving the less accessible lands for British interests, if they decided upon enforcing British control of rubber growing.In these circumstances, I have instructed the Colonial authorities not to dispose of any area of rubber land exceeding 50 acres to persons who are not British subjects (the limit has been fixed at 50 acres in order to allow foreign Malays and other Asiatics to acquire small holdings).   It appears to me that this measure is necessary in order to preserve the status quo pend-ing a final decision as to the policy to be adopted permanently, and, as at present advised, I am disposed to adhere to my instructions for the period of the war, and, as a necessary consequence, to prohibit temporarily the transfer of estates now in British hands to foreign corporations or individuals.It is not to be expected that a measure of this kind will not cs.use protest from interestedquarters.
quarters.   The American General Rubber Company has withdrawn its application, which originally drew attention to this question, and on which the London Rubber Growers Association made representations to the Colonial Office.   The Japanese Ambassador has lodged a protest against any restriction upon Japanese subjects.   And the Colonial Government have represented that the Chinese community which is interested in rubber as well as in mining resents the restrictions imposed.It should be observed that the Colonial authorities, looking at the matter from the local point of view, are apprehensive that sufficient British capital may not be forthcoming to develope the Malay States after the war, and are anxious to attract&apos; foreign capital for that purpose.   They are also apprehensive that any measure of restriction may be looked upon as directed against Asiatics.   They propose to set apart large areas of rubber land which will not be alienated with-out sanction, and, having done so, they wish to apply the restrictions to British as well as to foreign sub-jects.   If no other measure or restriction were con-sidered possible, I should prefer to adopt this policy rather than to allow foreign capitalists to alter the existing status of the unduetry during the war. But the policy of preserving British control over the rubber-growing industry has the support of the Board of Trade and of the Chairman of the Rubber and Tin Exports Committee, and I recommend that my instructions beadhered
\t* w tjadhered to for the period of the war, with such concessions to local non-British Asiatics as the local authorities can devise, and that the transfer of British estates to aliens be suspended also for the period of the war.Apart from the other considerations mentioned above it appears to me that to withdraw my instructions to the Colonial Government in consequence of pressure by interested parties would prejudice the ultimate decision as regards rubber and make it more difficult to maintain the British control policy in regard to other raw materials in respect of which it is a matter of settled policy.   Further I fear that a reversal of policy in the Malay States might gravely compromise the position of the Government of India: and if the Cabinet on the information now before them hesitate to approve the measures I have taken I would suggest that the India Office should be consulted before a final decision is taken.   The preservation of the status quo, and the protection of British interests during the period of restriction due to the war are in them-selves such reasonable measures that I confidently anticipate the approval of the Cabinet.W.H.L.
Ireland: Policy of the Government.1. Pursuant to the reference made to us by the War Cabinet on April 16th, we have prepared the annexed Draft Bill on the lines of the policy laid down in the minutes of that meeting. We have also agreed to recommend to the War Cabinet certain modifications in points of detail.&apos;: 2. The Draft Bill provides, as was directed, for the exclusion oi individual counties from the operation of the Home Rule Act unless 55 per cent, of the voters agree upon inclusion. After careful consideration of this proposal we are, however, opposed to the introduction of so obviously artificial a departure from the common principle of the decision of public questions by the vote of a majority, and we have embodied in the Draft Bill an alternative proposal for decision by a bare majority of the voters polled.   The reasons for this view we shall state presently.8. The following is a concise statement of the principal proposals in the Bill: - .(a) The introduction of Home Rule with as little delayas possible throughout Nationalist Ireland.(b) A poll  by  counties of  the six Ulster counties ofAntrim, Armagh, Down, Londonderry, Tyrone, Fermanagh, (including the boroughs of Berry, Belfast, and Newry) described as the &quot; excluded counties &quot; in the Draft- Bill-to be taken within a specified period after the war with a view to the incorporation in the Home Rule area of any county where a majority of the voters shall support inclusion, and to be repeated after a period of not less than seven or more than ten years if there shall still be at that time an excluded area. .   . - .-\c) The establishment of a &quot;Council of Ireland&quot; in which the excluded area will be represented by its Members of Parliament and the rest -of Ireland by an equal number of members nominated by the Irish Parliament, with a President agreed upon by the members or nominated by the Crown, which3 ***?f A/
Council, voting, in panel, will have power, speaking&apos; broadly (i) to pass private Bill legislation affecting both the included and the excluded area ;(ii) to recommend to the Crown the extension to the excluded area by Order in Council of any Bill or Act of the Irish Parliament ;(iii) to agree to the inclusion under the Home Rule Act of the whole of Ireland, subject to the assent of a majority of the voters in the excluded area, power to be vested in the Crown in that case to extend the Act to all Ireland by Order in Council, unless either House of Parliament has declared its dissent;(iv) to consult and make recommendations upon Irish questions, including the amendment of the Home Rule Act (as ultimately passed into law).(d) The reservation to the Crown of power to appoint a judgeor judges of the High Court for the service of tho ^excluded area, to sit continuously in Belfast as well as to hear appeals from subordinate jurisdictions, and the maintenance of a right of appeal from the High Court to a Court of Appeal in which the Crown will appoint the judges, and in the last resort to the House of Lords (sections 15, 16, and 17).(e) The grant to every person now resident or carrying onbusiness in the excluded area of the personal privilege of electing to be subject to British courts and not to Irish courts, and of a title to indemnity out of public funds for any damage which may result directly to him from legislative, administrative or popular interference with his existing rights (section 4).(/) A parliamentary guarantee to the Home Rule area of an annual grant from the Consolidated Fund for purposes of development such as are dealt with by Part I. of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909 (section 13).4. The proposal to make the exclusion of counties from the Home Rule area dependent on the vote of a 55 per cent, majority   seemed  to  us   to  invite  the   criticism   that  an
apparently trifling departure from ordinary constitutional pro-cedure was proposed for the transparent purpose of enabling a minority in Tyrone and Fermanagh to decide the issue in those counties. Further, we. had reason to believe that the suggestion of a 55 per cent, majority was equally unpopular with all parties in Ireland. In these circumstances it seemed to be undesirable to suggest a procedure which, besides being contrary to the usual practice of elections in the United Kingdom, would appear to have been devised to produce, if not to stereotype, a particular political result.5. We have described the Council of Ireland as a body which will &quot;vote in panel.&quot; This phrase is used to designate shortly a method of voting which is explained at greater length in clauses 15 and 17 of the First Schedule to the Bill. It is there provided that each of the representative groups in the Council shall have one collective vote, to be exercised according to the wishes of the majority in the group. The reason for the proposal is manifest.6. As an alternative to the group of privileges for minorities or individuals in the areas included after the passing of the Act, Avhich are to be found in clause &quot;4 of the Draft Bill, we discussed the suggestion of a privilege of a more comprehensive kind, namely, that a dissentient upon registering himself as such should be left iii all respects, except those relating to municipal adminis-tration, subject to British law, British tribunals, and British taxation in the same way as though he had remained a resident in the exclitded area. Such a far-reaching provision would no doubt be regarded by these classes of persons as more advantageous than that in the Draft Bill. It would probably provoke Objection on the part of Nationalists, and it would necessitate an elaborate adjustment of accounts in order to safe-guard the Irish Exchequer against loss of revenue. It may, however, be worthy of consideration in the last resort if further inducement be required.7. We have found it difficult to devise proposals which would commend this Bill to those who have severely criticised the Home Rule Act on the grounds of finance. Clause 13 wrould no doubt be more acceptable if it were to embody a statutory minimum grant than if it merely guaranteed a rateable sum proportionate to any grant which might be expended in Great Britain.   The field of education appeared124, A 2/
at first to be one in which, existing conditions wottld have made a grant in aid very welcome to the Irish Nationalists to help them to deal promptly with a grave Irish problem. We have reason to believe, however, that a fund ear-marked as a means of educational reform in Ireland would be an embarrassment to the Nationalist members by reason of the controversial questions that it would raise. We have therefore not embodied any such proposal in the Draft Bill.8. We have felt that the Council for Irish affairs which is proposed in the Draft Bill would perhaps receive a warmer welcome if it were designated by a name more suggestive of authority and of a national identity than the &quot;Irish Council&quot; (the title which was suggested to us by a number of repre-sentative gentlemen in Ulster). &quot; The Council of Ireland &quot; and &quot;The Irish Representative Council&quot; are names which have occurred to us.   We have adopted the former of these.9. We have drawn up this Draft Bill in the belief that, should it be fortunate enough to receive a Second Reading in the House of Commons, it will then be referred, along with the Home Rule Act of 1914, to a Commission or Conference, with instructions to draw up a new Bill, as already promised, in amendment of that Act for submission to Parliament. The fortunes of the Draft Bill will in. our opinion depend very much upon the terms in which any such reference is - made. If the Draft Bill were referred alone without the concession of a power to propose amendments in the Home Rule Act, much disappointment would probably be caused, and it is doubtful if any practical result would ensue. If, on the other hand, the Act be referred, together with the Draft Bill, there would seem to be a fair chance.of evolving a reasonable and acceptable scheme.C. of K. H. E. D^May 8, 1917. C. A.
