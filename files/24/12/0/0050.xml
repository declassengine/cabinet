M M fl H !tf B&quot;^p.T.6bOIIJCRiiAS22) PRODUCTION OF CEREiJS, ETC. IKtkb mil hud  ibgdqhpursuant to the request of the prime Minister, a Conference of tho Agricultural Departments of England and wales, Scotland and Ireland-, assembled to consider, with a view to harmonious action, the programmes which had been r,ut forward by tho Departments respectively for the year 1917-1918 (G.T. 536, 570 and 619).Tho Conference came to the conclusion .that, at present, the dfcta which will be necessary for determining the relation to be maintained between tho provision for crops and the pro-vision for live stock are not sufficiently complete to warrant definite estimates on the subject of reduction of live stock and increase of tillage.     Inquiries arc being Urgently pro-secuted which will result in the supply of the requisite information as to live stock, in the course of two or three weeks, and as to estimated now tillage for next season in the course of six or eight weeks.aThe Conference will keep in touch with the Committees who are to provide this information and immediately the moans are available will submit a further report.The estimates of 1918 tillage at present relied upon, provide for an increase in England and Wales of three million&apos; acres... in Scotland of 350,000, in Ireland of 1-J-million acres.     These figures are the figures Of increase beyond the tillage of 1916.     The Conference is satisfied that it is necessary and practicable now to forecast thenecessary provision of implements, fertilisers and labour which will, be required to cope with this vast increase in our national means of food supply.As to implements, not less than 6,000 tractors, 6,000 tractor-ploughs and 60 complete steam ploughs ought to be provided for at once.     Requisitions for smaller implements-will be presented as soon as requirements are definitely ascertained.     The necessary census is now proceeding.The key ,of the situation as to implements for plough-ing is found in the generous conduct of Ilr .Henry IPord in placing, at the disposal of the Government his designs and business machinery for the manufacture of the Pord Tractor. A practical trial of the -Ford- tracts has been carried out by the Royal Agricultural Society of England with exceedingly good results and the Society1s judges conclude their report v*ith a rocommendation that &quot;stops bo taken to construct immediately as many of these tractors as possible.&quot;The Conference became aware of risks which threaten this undertaking arising out of not unnatural Orade anxieties of a certain section of British motor manufacturers. Any miscarriage   in the provision of these,implements would have, disastrous consequences..     It ought to be possible, and At full advantage is taken of Mr.Ford&apos;s generous proposals it will be possible, that the delivery of   those tractors at the rate of 1,000 a month should be in process by the end
*f the summer.     This g an only be done, ho?;ever, if the Govern-   -meut takes direct charge of the manufacture as though the objects to be ore vided- were vitally necessary munitions, e.g. tanks or high explosive shells.     Mr.pord has placed his representative, Mr.Perry, at the disposal of the Government and has despatched from the TJ.S.A-, a body of experts who are now on their way. The Conference urgently   recommends that the manufacture of the Ford Tractor and Tractor Ploughs   should be carried out under the direct control of the Ministry of Munitions on the termsof Mr.Ford1s offer and with tho assistance of his representative, Mr.Perry, as business manager.     In this, way, the 12:,.000 large implements-which are stipulated for can probably be secured.     it is&quot;tft0 late for consideration of possible alternatives, none of which is at present in view.For the necessary sup-sly of fertilisers, 800,000 tons of rock phosphate, 480,000 tons of pyrites, 500.000 tons of basic slag and about 250,000 tonjs of sulphate of ammonia appear to be necessary.     The provision of theso raw materials for arti-ficial manure will no doubt impose a very heavy strain upon the available tonnage at the disposal of the Controller of Shipping. If tho increased tillage which has been resolved upfln is to proceed, these supplies of fertilisers are indispensable.     It may well be that a oargo of phosphates will be   of more importance for food supply during the next ton weeks than a much higher ton-nage of cereal food.     Besides fertilisers, sulphate of copper for spraying potatoes, to the amount of 14,000 tons and of soda crystals to the $mount of 12,500 tons will have to be provided.Tho labour involved in the great English programme of additional tillage raises questions of most serious difficulty. The Board of Agriculture (England and Wales), estimate that 80,000 men-must bo provided on the land in addition to 40,000 already employed.   The Scottish Board estimate their additional requirements at 10,000*     There will bo work in England and Wales for 25,000 women upon the land beyond the number now engaged. The Conference is not able, with the means presently at its disposal to suggest methods of procuring this largo amount of additional labour.The English Board called the attention of the Conference to difficulties which will arise if certain skilled ploughmenwhfl have been lent for the immediate emergency by the Army are withdrawn before ihe urgent work for which they were provided is reasonably complete.     The Conference was satisfied *$hat the -premature withdrawal -of these men would cause serious difficulty to tho English farmer and requested  ,Mr. Prothoro to communicate this view to tho Secretary of State for r/ar.The supply of horses for farm work in England and Wales and to a smaller extent in Scotland end perhaps Ireland, will need t$ bo supplemented.     The English Board estimate their requirements in this respect at 60,000 additional horses, the Scottish Board estimate theirs at 6,000;  -while 2,000 may be needed in Ireland. Whether Army horses can inappreciable extent supply these needs appears very doubtful.     The use of the horses in question will, the Conference art; satisfied,bo required for the greater part *f&apos;tho year.The Conference present this Interim Report in order that the Prime Minister may bo aware of the present necessities of the tillage schemes^ taken as a whole.   They have secured the continuous joint action tf a Committee of exoorts from the three -Agricultural Depart-ments, who will ascertain and recommend, from time to time, tho necessary steps for the provision and distribution, according tc the several requirements of the throe countries, of the supplies upon which the progress of the agricultural development now in hand will dop end and the Conference will re-assemble,. from time to time, and ihfrom the Prime Minister wf the progress .%f the general undertaking sue1 of any action thought necessary for its promotion.^Whitehall Gardens, 1917 (Sgd)H.E.DUKE7th May, 1917
