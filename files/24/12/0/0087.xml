Third Heport by the Board of Trade on the working&quot; , of the Imports Restriction Scheme and the relationof Imports to Shipping. 368\y&apos; In table I information relating to losses and gains is brought up to the end of April, but some slight readjustment of the April figures may have to be made later.The average daily war loss of British vessels over 1,600 G.T. (excluding oilers and prizes) was as much as 24,500 tons a day during the period April 23rd to 26th, and this rose to 32,500 for the period April 27th   to 29th. For the last day of April the loss is just under 20,000 and the average daily loss for the first six days of May is less than 11,000 tons.iititrances as a whole, in comparison with 1916, shew a marked improvement in April over March.In April they are no more than 17$ down on last year. Entrances of British ships in the third period of April (reckoned as a daily rate) fell beneath those for the first and second periods by 4$ and 10$ respectively.   Entrances of foreign ships (similarly reckoned) in the last period of April were 2% above those for the first period and 23f0 lower than those for the second period.   For April as a whole, British entrances were about the same as last year: for the first three months of 1917 they were somewhat less than last year.   As regards foreign entrances, the decrease on 1916 was 51% for April, 65 for March, 56 for February and 16 for . January.   Details are shewn in table II.Clearances for British vessels (reckoned as a daily rate) have rison from about 30,000 in the first period of April, to 42;000 in the second period and 45,000 in the third. For the last period they are about the level of 1916. Clearances in the last period for foreign vessels, on the other hand, show a decline on the middle period of about 20$, though a rise on the first of about 30.   Table III will shew that the relativea,       *W
position as compared with 1916 (expressed as a percentage) is much worse for April as a whole than for March in the case of British vessels; hut in the case of foreign vessels the relative position as compared with 1916 is about the same in April as in both larch and February.

The accompanying table IV shows the gross Mercantile tonnage of the world (excluding enemy countries) in the summers of 1914 and of 1916.   The British and Colonial tonnage fell during the two years only slightly - from 21,045,000 to 20,902,000 tons - whilst the total for Allied and Neutral countries showed a rise due in the main to the marked growth of American shipping.Table V summarises information obtained from the Admiralty as to tonnage sunk by enemy action during the war, up to the end of March 1917.   Out of a total world loss of about 5,360,000 tons, about 3,120,000 or 6($ is British.. Norway comes next with a loss of over 600,000 tons, followed by France and Italy.   The Allied loss (apart from the British) is substantially exceeded by the neutral, though the neutral Mercantile fleet is less than the Allied (other than British) Mercantile fleet.Table VI shews the extent to which Lloydfs last figures of Neutral and Allied, ships have been reduced since by enemy action.    War losses are deducted from the beginning of June 1916, because Lloydfs list of the tonnage on the Register, as it is corn-piled over a period and not for a precise date, may be taken as representing the position at an earlier date than that on which compilation is completed.   It will be seen that the British per-ceniage loss of 7.5 is considerably exceeded among the Allies by that of Italy and Irance, and among neutrals by Norway, Denmark and Greece.   Norway is the chief sufferer, in proportion to the size of her mercantile fleet, of which she has lost a sixth in -&apos;. nine months.   The percentage loss of neutrals is above the Britisi, which in turn is higher than that of the Allies if America is included.   The British percentage loss (7.5) is just about the average for all the countries considered.The column showing tonnage remaining at the end of March takes no account of marine and other losses on the one ihand or of new construction on the other.

TIMER.The increase in the supply of timber for the Army from the French forests is one of the chief means of reducing the needs for imports.   The production as estimated hy the Director of Forestry (Brig. General Lord Lovat) was 59,000 tons for April and should he 65,000 tons in May.   The estimate for June is 77,000 tons. It may he noted that the total War Office demand was estimated in the reduction of imports report at from 150,000 to 200,000 tons a month.   The most interesting items are sawn timber, sleepers and slabs.   For April these three items taken together were estimated at 17,000 tons.   The June estimate is just over twice this figure (34,500 tons). But the June estimate and all future increases under this head depend on (I) the immediate supply of more skilled personnel for supervising the forestry companies, (ii) the prompt supply of more mechanical and horse transport, (iii) the despatch of fully equipped Canadian forestry companies from England at the rate of two per week.As the despatch of Canadian, companies automatically reduces the labour for the supply of home grown timber these consdjieratioins ^ put forward inrecent reports in favour of the present maintenance and future rapid increase of the forestry &quot;labour in this (vountry-^8th May, 1917.
