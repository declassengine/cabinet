S B 0 R E T. WAR CABINET.679 A, RAILWAYS Iff PERSIA. 355Is PTE 3Y LORD CURZON. (Circulated with reference to Paper G.T.679)The idea of a junction with the Russian Railway system in Central Asia was mentioned, not so much as suggesting a definite scheme,,as of indicating a method &quot;by which, if it is not now too late (as it is) and if the obstacles were not insurmountable (as they probably are), a fresh avenue of entry for munitions &amp;e. into Russia might have been devised at an earlier stage in the War.&apos;To run the railway from Dalbandin to Rob at and. thence on the Persian side of the Frontier to Meshed, and from there to the Transcaspian Railway a.t Dushakh or elsewhere would probably be quite impracticable.The real point of contact with the Russian Railways would have been not at Dushakh but at Xushk and upon this idea the rough figures were based.Such a junction, however, would require the assent and co-operation of Afghanistan, which in all probability are not procurable.The reference to the India Office was only intended to provide them with the opportunity (for which a further reference to India would not be required) of saying whether they would advocate a further extension from Dalbandin to oeistan, and in such a case whether the old and familiar objections to a junction with the Russian system, either via Meshed, or at Eushk, still hold good - as doubtless they do - or whether the altered condit-ions under a change of policy, either now or in the future, are worthy of consideration.     The answer, it may be expected, will be in the negative.(Initialled) C of  .27th.February, .1917.
