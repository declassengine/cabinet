Good Many desertions of men have occurred, strong impression of disorganisation in which army now finds itself. Kalamata (1) and Tripolis district. Report of riles as at Patras. People and military, friendly and obliging. Some difficulty in checking men. No want of food at Tripolis (2), but at Kalamata, supply is very scarce, and Megaloppolis (3) almost starvation conditions, Gargaliana (4) and Philiatra (5) ditto, Argos (6) almost famine, Behaviour of certain French officers at Kyparissia (7), caused considerable friction. Large majority of people pro-allies, but at the same time, anti-Venizelos. In general, economic situation in Peloponnese is grave, and the people are suffering most acutely in many cases, but look with confidence for decision of British Government. Velo.
