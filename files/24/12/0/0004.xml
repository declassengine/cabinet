S B OJJJ.mn cabinet.THE PRIM]IfHOTE BY THE PRIME MIIXSTJR^CI&apos; Ps CONP1RMCS &apos;W^MldM.iMMl^APRIL ^ona, 19:l?0I ciroulate for the benefit of ray colleagues in tho War Cabinet tho following impressions of my visit to tho Admiralty undertaken by a decision of the War Cabinet on April 25th, (War Cabinet 126, Minute 6a) with a view to an investigation of all tho means at present in use in regard tc anti-submarine warfare.I spent tho greater part of Monday, April 30tfy in the Admiralty,where, in the presence of the First Lor&amp; and Pirst Sea Lord, I saw thefollowing officers: -Rear Admiral A.,Lo Duff, CaB.Head of the Ant i-Submarine Department:Captain Richard Webb, CB,, Head of tho Trade Division:Captain Grant, R.H,,W. H. Gard, Esq., C.B., H.V.O.,Assistant Director of Haval Construction, (in the absence of 3ir Tennyson Dr-Uyncourt).I was afforded evory possible facility and information, and among the subjects investigated were the following:-(A) The organisation&apos;of the Admiralty and more particularlyof the War Staff, in connection with Anti-Submarine warfare;(B) The scientific statistical basis of the Admiralty1s arrange-ments:(0) The relations between the Admiralty and the Shipping Control!(D) The arrangements for tho control over the movements of mor-chant ships in those areas whore the submarines operate:(B) The arrangements for controlling the ports of destinations of merchant ships:(P) The question-of convoys which the Admiralty are nor/ working out:(G-) The distribution of destroyers and the possibility of ob-taining more assistance in this respect from the United States of America and Japan:
tA)       organisation of the Admiralty and more particularly of the War -Staff,&apos; in&quot;&quot;oonnoot&quot;i.on with Ant i-Submarine par fare,I do not consider that the present organisation of the Admiraltyis satisfactory, and this was admitted both by the First Lord and bythe First Sea Lord.   The criticisms are directed mainly, but notsolely, against the War Staff organisation,I was particularly glad to learn that the First Sea Lord, as the result of his experience at the Admiralty, is now convinced that he himself sh-ould become the Chief of the Staff in place of the old system whereby the Chief of the War Staff was an officer under his immediate orders, interposed, as it were, between the First Sea Lord and the Directors of Intelligence and Operations.I consider it of the utmost importance that the First Sea Lord should be relieves of as much detail as possible, &apos;and Admiral Sir John Jellicoe qiu.ce agreed in this view, and stated that he had been endeavouring to obtain this relief ever since he took over his present post.   One obstacle to this which Sir John Jellicoo mentioned, was that unless he exorcised his personal initiative and drive  * he could not obtain the material he required sufficiently quickly. This is obviously wrong, and it is of the utmost importance that the Admiralty should be so organised that the First Sea Lord is entirely free from the necessity of devoting his attention to the supply of materiel.   This, as I informed the First Lord and the First Sea Lord, can in my opinion only be done by the appointment of a thor-oughly capable business man, of the type which was so successful at  he Ministry of Munitions, to supervise the whole supply of material.(H) Che effect on Anti-Submarine warfare of reducing our mill-tary commitments in the Balkans:(I) lline sweeping, including paravanes:(J) She supply of submarine mines and minelayers: (Z) She various weapons used to combat the submarine: (L) Mammoth ships.
It is not necessary nor, in ny opinion, even desirable, that he should himself be a shipping export, as a really good business organiser will make uso of tho brains of the experts at his disposal to obtain what is required.Tho first proposition, therefore, to which I Invite tho assent of my colleagues and tho Admiralty is to:-The appointment- to the Boards ofJltoirarjffjsf^a groat xRrg&amp;oi.cor at^FHeaS. cjTaj\1 J^ne[]sUjllles^o^materio 1 rejnirid&quot;fur nayal &quot;purposes In place of the- present syst ouT of&quot;a Third&quot;  aval Lord.Having thus released tho first Sea Lord from part of the over-whelming questions of cLotail which must considerably $yeoccupy him, tho nest question to which attention is required is the organisation of the Staff itself.The weakest point of the present system appears to me to be the lack of a department whoso special duty it is to think out and work out tho Ibarge questions of policy under the l^irst Sea Lord. I asked the question:   Who was responsible for this duty, and I was told the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the War Staff.     I then asked a ques-tion: Who was responsible for the uay to day dispositions, drafting of tolegrams, &amp;c, which with so large a Fleet under direct Admir-alty control, must involve very heavy work.    I received the roply that tho Chief of tho 7/ar Staff, under tho First Sea Lord, was res-ponsible for this also0   This appears to no too great a burden to place on one man, even when ho is gifted with such enormous powers of work as Admiral Sir Henry Oliver.   In fact, I see here every sign of over centraliss/tion.    It is true that Admiral Oliver has under him two Directors of Operations, namely, Admiral Jackson and Admiral Hope.     I did not gather, however, that either of these officers has the specific functions of looking ahead and working out policy and tho necessary arrangements to meet the contingencies, that threaten. I cannot help thinking that a very large number of the admitted do-ficiencios of the Admiralty at the present time arc duo to the lack of some such thinking organisation during the last two years; for example, the First Sea Lord points out that submarine mines were pain-fully
deficient both in quantity and quality when he assumed his present ffioe, and that some months must elapse before the arrangements which he had inaugurated can take proper effect.   Surely, if there had been a thinking department which was working on a careful appreciation of the tendencies of submarine warfare, this matter would have been put ri0ht long ago and the departments responsible for the supply of materiel would have been put on the right track by the War Staff,    I would be in-clined to assign the same cause to the present deficiency of mine- veepers and the slowness with which such articles as paravanes and howitzers are bein6 provided.Of the Directors on the present War Staff the only one who has -   -actual sea experience in the present War&quot; is Rear-A&amp;miral Hope, and this appears to me a defective arrangement.The second proposition which I would lay before my colleagues and the Admiralty, therefore, is that :-The War Staff shou3d be reorganised on lines somewhat similar mutatis mutandis &quot;tc&quot;th&quot;o*so&quot; in force at; the&quot; gar Office., namely, -that the First Sea 16rcL, as Okiei of the ;VaStaff, should nave immediately un^r^hfm a number of Direcxors - who mip-ht, fur example, beA Deputy Chief of the Stsff, whose functions vould be to carry on the da:/ to day mcvements of &quot;ships, squadrons, &amp;.c\ , and the relations between the War Staff and the administrative side of the Admiralty,A Director of Operations, whose special task would be to work out., under the Jj&apos;irst Sea&quot; Lord, the measures of policy required to meet every development,A Director of Intelligence, whose functions should be to supply the data, or a part of the data   on v&apos;bich the Director of Opera-tions and the other Directors would work.&apos;The Head of the Trade Division, who is already responsible to &quot;the ffirst Sea Lord for the control of the&apos; movements of merchant ships,AJDirector of Anti-Submarine Craft, whose functions would besimilar to those how exercised by Aumiral Duff. % .---These Directors should include several officers with actual sea experience during the present War.It would also appear to be a matter for the consideration of theAdmiralty whether they should not have an officer corresponding to theDirector of Staff Duties at the Admiralty who&apos; would be responsible fornominating all the officers employed on Staff work, not only in theAdmiralty
Admiralty itself, but in all the outside posts connected with the Staff  Vrk, such as, the officers employed at the ports at home and abroad, i connection with the movements of merchant ships. This suggestion is based on a remark of the first Lord that he was not entirely satisfied as to the suitability of some of these officers for their duties.It is scarcely necessary to add that it is essential that allthese officers should work in -the closest possible co-operation, asis^understand they do already, but this/secured by the fact that the First Sea Lord, with the assistance of the officers of his personal staff, controls the whole machine.The third proposition which I wish to place before my colleagues and the Admiralty, is the-following z-That the Branch of the Director of Operations should, for the -foirst Sea Lord, &quot;prepare a Weekly Appreciation of the Naval Situation generally, and in the present phase of the War, of the developments of the submarine campaign in particular. This Appreciation should be circulated for the information of the War Cabinet, and should deal hot only with the events which have taken place during the previous week, and the intelli-gence received during the week, but also should include comments and deductions as to the policy required to meet expected developments.(B)   The scientific statistical basis of the Admiralty&apos;s arrangements.I made a special enquiry into the statistical work done by the admiralty., more particularly in connection with mercantile losses from submarines.    I found that a good deal of information is obtained as, to [the circumstances under which the losses occur, for example, the areas in which ships are sunk and engagements reported; the times at which -they occur; whether in daylight or in darkness; whether the ships are escorted or unescorted; whether-armed or unarmed; the state of the leather and of the atmosphere; &amp;o.f cc.   A good deal of this informa-tiro is very carefully plotted on charts, both for the day and for the month. &apos;.I was also satisfied that this information is used tc a con-side rattle extent in arranging and altering the courses to be taken y inco ing and outgoing ships, and the times within which they should
 pass through the danger zones as well as in the allotment of escorts and patrols to different areas.

Nevertheless, I think it would be a real advantage to the Admiralty, to the Shipping Controller, and to the War Cabinet, if these statistics were calculated and coordinated more completely than appears to be the case at present.

The fourth proposition which I wish to place before my colleagues and the Admiralty, is the following:-

That a regular Statistical Department should be set up at the Admiralty for the complication and analysis of the statistics of submarine losses in all the different areas. The results of the new Department&apos;s work should be communicated to the War Cabinet. First Lord, First Sea Lord, to all the Directors under the First Sea Lord, and to the Shipping Controller, and to other persons as necessary.

Whether this Branch should come under the Director of Intelligence, the Director of Movements of Anti-Submarine Craft, or under the Director of Movements of Anti-Submarine Craft, or under the Director of the Trade Division, is a matter for the Admiralty themselves to deci? I do not think it is indispensable that a naval officer should be at the head of this Department, and it might be proferable to obtain the services of some really good statistician, such as Sir Norman Hill or Mr. Layton of the Ministry of Munitions, who should be given an adequate Staff for the purpose.

(c) The relations between the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller;

Sir Joseph Maclay was present during a short discussion in regard to the relations of the Admiralty and the shipping Controller. The First Sea Lord, Captain Webb, and Sir Joseph Maclay, all appeared to agree that the relations were not so close as they ought to be, and ? concerned appeared willing and anxious to improve matters if a means could be found of doing this. Sir Joseph Maclay urged that a selected representative of the Shipping Controller&apos;s department should attend once or even twice a day at the Trade Division to ascertain the latest details of the movements of ships, and to confer in regard to the alteration, and whom necessary, deviation of routes

 
This proposal no doubt will take some time before it gives satisfactory results, but in view of the possible prolongation of tho War I think it well worth while to give offset to it.    flo doubt it will involve a good doal of detail.    The initiative should rest with the Admiralty,$ho fifth proposition which I wish to submit to my colleagues and the Admiralty is the following:-ghat the Shipping Contro11er should nominate one or more represontaHvgs^to^ajg^Tjonoe or twicday as con1 venie&quot;nTli,t the Trade Division for TEe purpose mentioned above.In this connection I would mention that it transpired that both the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller were very dissatisfied with their present information as to the departure of homewurd-boun. ships from ports in foreign countries, and in the Dominions and Coi-oriios.     It appears that in the interests of secre y Iloyd3 organise tion, on which they mainly relied, has gradually been suppressed anr nothing has taken its place.   I therefore arranged for an immediate Conference on tho same evening between Captain Webb, a representa-tive of tho Shipping Controller, and the Secretary to lloyds, witha view to concerting measures for procuring full information on this subject.Another weakness which transpired during this part of the dis-oussion was that there are still a very large number of merchant ships not fitted with wireless telegraphy.   The Marconi Company ap-parently are working very satisfactorily in remedying this defic-ienoy, but difficulty is found in training operators.   Moreover, many of the operators are by no means efficient, and the majority of ships only oarsy one operator.   Consequently., It is not possible in many sasos to divert homeward-bound ships from zones which the latest information has shown to be highly dangerous.vThe sixth proposition which. I wish to put before my colleagues, and the Admiralty is the followingThat stops should be taken by the Admi&amp;alyy, in concert with the General gost ^QlTice arid the far Office, immed-iately to train a larger numFer&apos;of wireless -telegraph operators &quot;with! a view to&quot; the &apos; provision of Vt loablTwo &quot;efficient wireless operators in every sHpT
It appears that the control of the Admiralty over merchant ships is still very unsatisfactory.   I learned that the Admiralty -cannot rely upon the Masters of ships either to carry out their instructions in regard to zigzagging, nor to darken their ships. The Admiralty have evidently, devoted a great deal of care and attention to this- subject.   In connection with the former they -have designed a special striking clock which warns the officer on the &quot;bridge when he has to alter course, and large numbers of these are being supplied.   They also have an order that Captains of ships are to rehearse in port the arrangements for darkening ships, but, either through the carelessness of the crews, or passengers, and the lack of discipline on board merchant ships, the Admiralty cannot rely on their instructions being carried out.     This is a matter which I think must be left for the Admiralty to work out as best they can, but they should, in my opinion, invite the coopera-tion of the Shipping Controller in putting pressure on the owners of ships, and it would appear worth while to make this a punishable offence, if necessary, by legislation, and to make some&apos; examples,(D)   The,arrangements for the control over the movements ofmerchant: ships in-those areaswhere the submarines operate.I do not think it is necessary for me to describe in detail the arrangements made for controlling the routes of.merchant ships. These appear to me to be very complete and to be based on a very careful appreciation of the experience gained in the past.   Broadly speaking, the policy of concentrating the traffic is only adopted on routes which can be properly swept&apos; for mines and patrolled,and wher-ever possible these concentrated routes are in the close vicinity of the coast where submarines do not like operating, since the direc-tion in which they can escape Is limited by.the lie of the land. Away from these concentrated and protected areas the policy is to scatter the traffic over a certain given area which diverges as the ships reach the more  pen and safer waters.   The cones formed by the lines of dispersion from the concentrated route to completely open and relatively safe water, are protected so far as protection can be
given as the point of convergence is reaohed and arrangements are made for the more dangerous areas to he passed through at night.rfjhe routes are constantly changed, hut obviously the whole system will be much more efficient when all the ships are provided with wire-less telegraphy and efficient operators,  since it will then be possible to divert incoming traffic from danger zones, and to obtain earlier intelligence of losses.It is interesting to note that the losses among homeward-bound ships, all of which nowadays carry important cargoes, are muchf arger then among outward-bound ships-.   Although it is possible that the enemy concentrates his attack on homeward-bound ship3,-the general view in the Admiralty appeared to be that this was due mainly to the difficulty of diverting homeward-bound 3hips from dangerous areas.   Near the approaches to one area the Admiralty hope to estab-lish a ship for supplying destroyers with oil at sea, which will also serve as an intelligence centre where merchant ships can obtain information.   The First Sea Lord would like to establish similar intelligence bases on other routes, which i3 prevented by lack of shipping,^-t is noteworthy that darkness has lately become less a protec-tion than formerly,  and something like one-third of the ships in certain areas are understood latterly to have been sunk by nighti   I am not clear however whether these losses took place in darkness or semi- dark-ness, and this is a point on which statistical evidence would be of valueThe arrangements in the Mediterranean are much the same as in the AtlanticI have no proposition to present to my colleagues under this head.(s)   The., arrangement s for controlling the port a of deat i nat i on of merchant shipsT&quot;&quot;1t appears that little control i3 exercised by anyone except theowners of the ships,  or the Government Departments whose needs the shipsare suPPlying, over the destinations of the ships.-   There was some difference of opinion between the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller as towhether it would be an advantage or not to divert ships to the Western ort3.   The contention of the Admiralty was that if the bulk- of ourdipping could be loaded and unloaded in the   /
io. 30Western ports, thus saving the voyage up Channel to London and the East Coast, the risk would be considerably diminished.   The Shipping-Controller, however, did not admit this, and endeavoured to show from the Admiralty charts of losses thatj in fact the Channel and the East Coas^ were now relatively much safer than the approaches to the Western ports.   This is a matter which it Is difficult to dispose   of without a full statistical analysis and the Statistical Department which I have urged should be formed will be very useful cn such a point. The Shipping Controller also stated that the corifestion on the rail-^ways was so great that London, at any rate, could not be supplied from the Western ports, though he thought some alleviation might be obtained from the ports on the North-east Coast, where the railway distances from the West coast ports are shorter.The seventh proposition; which I wish to put forward to my colleagues and the Admiralty is that:-The Admiralty and the Shipping Contraller shouldcarefully Tfivestigate the^gueation. ofJthe irelative sal*el/f &quot;oT The&quot; Wei tarn and ^lastern^jjortfe J-^J^p&apos;^: j&amp;l t a tTo .&quot;&quot;wltfiTtEe* Boaro&quot; oi^Waae J^f necessary ; ^&apos;d2pBou.tS.-1akj &quot;such measures for&quot;the&quot; diversion of   ^ traffif as&quot;may fie&quot;&quot;desir-able as jtheJresult of&quot;their Inquiries? and snouTd&quot;&apos;re&quot;pbrt accor-difxgly&quot;&quot;to the far Cabinet.,(p)    ^he question of convoys which the g&amp;miralty are now working; out:-I was gratified to learn from Admiral Duff that he had completely altered his view in regard to the adoption of a system of convoy, and I gather that the First Sea Lor$ shared his views, at any rate, to the extent of an experiment.    Admiral Duff is not enamoured with the system, but a number of circumstances have combined to bring him to the view which I believe most of my colleagues share, that, at any rate, an experiment in this direction should be made.     One of these reasons is that now that the United States of America have entered the War, he thinks it should be possible to find escorts which were formerly Impracticable.     Another is that experience has shown, that he cannot rely/ on merhhanfc ships to find salvation from the submarines by zigzagging and dousing their lights,- and he therefore estimates these factors as a means of protection to a single ship, lower
-3.1*than ho formerly did.     Moreover, as the result of investigation in concert with a representative of tho Shipping Controller, he finds that the number of ships for which convoy will have to be supplied is more manageable than he had thought.     Further, the losses whon he last reported to mo on tho subject were not, in his opinion, sufficient to justify the adoption of this experiment, which he warned mo might involve a greet disaster.     How, however, he calculates that he could afford to lose three ships out of every convoy without being worse off than at present, and he therefore thinks the experiment justifiable-.     Finally, a very experienced merchant Captain, the- Commodore of the White Star line, whom he has consulted on this question, and who had hitherto been pronounced opponent of the system of convoy has, after seeing the Admire!ty scheme, come round to tho view that it is very desirable to adopt it*I much regret that some time must elapse before convoy can be in full working order and I consider that the Admiralty ought to press on with the matter as rapidly as possible.As the views of the Admiralty &apos;are now in complete accord with the views of the War Cabinet on this question, and as convoys have just come into operation on some routes and are being organised on others, further comment is unnecessary.     I understand that the itai ions are also adopting a system of convoy along their own coast.(G*) The distribution of destroyers and the possibility of obtaining more &quot;ass&quot;i &quot;aiicc in this respect from the United States of America and Japan;The First S:ea Lord informed me that six American destroyers would shortly bo available off the south-west coast of Ireland, which has lately been the most dangerous area.     He feels fairly confident that the United States will now give him a total of 18 destroyers, and ho has hopes for as many as 24.As a result of our discussions on this heading, I authorisedIthe First Sea Lord to draft a telegram for the Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs to send to Japan with the authority cf the War Cabinet, impressing on the J. :/anese Government the seriousness ;of the shipping question, and urging them to send a large number of additional destroyers to the Mediterranean, whore there arealready eight Japanc-se destroyers. \
*?&apos; I50 ships of 400,000 tons are at present employed on this route.I also authorised the First Sea Lord to arrange for the Secretary of State for the Colonies to send a similar telegram asking that 2 Australian destroyers might he sent to European waters.(H) The effect on Anti-Submarine warfare 0f xed.XLQi.ng our military commitments in the Balkans:The First Sea Lord laid great stress on the importance ofreducing our military commitments at Salonica from the point- of view -x-of releasing shipping, reducing casualties, and releasing patrol vessels for protection elsewhere.     If the troops were transferred to Egypt no shipping would he released, hut it would he required mainly &quot;between India and Egypt and consequently the losses would he greatly reduced.     Possibly, also, so^e of the patrols might be released.     we shall, however, have to expect a great outcry from the French if their forces ere retained at Salonica and our patrols are withdrawn as the protection of that route will be even more inadequate than at present.The eighth proposition which I present to my colleagues is that: -The War Cabinet should authorise me to take the opportunity at the nextl?onference with the Frenon Government to_Insisjfc on a withdrawal,&quot; or at least&apos;, &quot;a diminution &quot;of our army in the Balkans/&apos;The Admiralty estimate that complete withdrawal of the force would take no less than seven months, but I hope it may be possible to reduce this by using Taranto and the Trans-Continental route for the transport of at least a part of tho force,(!) Minesweeping, including paravanes. The adoption of a system of convoy, if it can be brought into complete use, will provide a great relief to the Admiralty in mine-sweeping, since the escorts will be in wireless touch with the Admir-alty, and the convoys will be able to avoid mined areas which need not thou be swept as regularly as at present.     At present only 3
merchant sh&amp;ps are fitted with paravanes, hut if it is found feasible to train the mercantile marine in their use this will provide a further security against the danger from submarine mines. The First Sea Lord wishes to &quot;build further minesweepers, and I have no doubt that this ought to be sanctioned.-The ninth proposition which I present to my colleagues and the Admiralty is as follows :-That the Admiralt&quot;/ should be authorised to provide the full number of additional minesweepers they:__require.(     The supply of submarine mines and minelayers: The facts in regard to this question are well known tc the War Cabinet, and I will not repeat them.-(K) The various weapons used to combat the submarine: The arming of merchant ships which has proceeded, and is proceeding steadily, more than a thousand additional guns having been mounted since the beginning of January, has had the effect of driving tho submarine below water, and a study of the statistics of recent casualties will show that the number sunk by gun-fire is now comparatively small. .   The Admiralty have some hope that the enemy may find difficulty in supplying an indefinite number of torpedoes, and that this will be the limiting factor in our losses. The not result is that the Admiralty now have to rely mainly on the various means available for attacking the submarine under water, the principal of which are, the depth charge, explosive paravane, and a new type of depth charge which is to be thrown from a mortar.    The mortars, however, orders for ?i/hich have been, placed with Messrs.Yickers are very, much behindhand, and I gather that the First Sea Lord has had to devote a good deal of attention to attempts to stimulate their production.     This emphasises the necessity of appointing some first-rate organiser to the Admiralty to take charge of this side.The directional hydrophone has not yet proved a success except at shore stations.There are not many new instruments being estperimented with at the present time, the few that there are be ins in the nartmre of
instruments to locate rather than to destroy submarines.fee Admiralty are themselves developing seaplanes for use against submarines, and establishing new seaplane stations,  one important statibn having lately been established at the extreme west point of Coprroall.t consider that the use of seaplanes for the purpose of anti-submarine warfare ought to be developed as rapidly as possible, par-ticularly in the Mediterranean, and that there is no more important field for tho provision of aircraftt , (L) Mammoth ships.the general conclusion which I have formed during my investi-gation at the Admiralty is that while it may be possible by means if convoy, improved mines, by new instruments, and by the extension of efficient wireless telegraphic arrangements in merchant ships somewhat to reduce the present rate pi\los3es, nevertheless * we must base bur assumptions on the supposition that these will continue to be heavy,  and considerably to exceed any possibilities of construction in the near future.   I admit that this is a gloomy outlook, and that it is of the very first importance that the losses should be reduced as low as possible,    when all has been done, however,  the position a year hence is likely to be very grave.in these circumstances, and after reading Lord Curzon&apos;s Report on the subject , and having special regard to the ease with which largo ships can be convoyed, I have come to the conclusion that we ought to take up the construction of mampth ships as proposed by the Admiralty. I discussed this question again at some length both with the representa tives of the Admiralty and with the Shipping Controller, and the result was to strengthen the view expressed above.As the Shipping Controller and his Department are strongly opposed to the proposal, I am of opinion that the construction of these ships should be undertaken by the Admiralty, particularly as the design has been made by the Chief Constructor of the Admiralty.f, hov/ever,  these ships are to be really useful,  it is neeessary that considerable numbers should be provided, and I personally am in favour of building the largest number for which slips can be /
found, both in this country and in the United States of America.I authorised the First Sea Lord to telegraph to the Naval representative on Mr.Balfour*s Mission in order to ascertain whether ships of such large size could be built in the United States, ond if so, how many,I understand that in this oountry it might be possible to build as many as 10 mammoth torpedo-proof ships, and that some of these at any rate might be ready within 12 months of their being laid down.The tenth proposition which I make to my colleagues and the Admiralis that:-The Admiralty should be authorised at once to put in hand the largest numoer ;of mammoth torpedo-proof ships up to 10 which can be constructed in private shipyards or in the Royal dockyards of the United Kingdom&quot;, as well as the largest number^ of similar &quot;ships which can be built in the United States of America.The First Sea Lord has undertaken to give me particulars as to the number of slips available in this country for the construction of these ships.  *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
