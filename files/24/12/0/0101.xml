SECRET.Sir Henry Wilson to Sir William Robertson.11/5/17.H.W.8.   12 noon.   May 11th.     Personal and Secret. At Nivelle^ request I came to Paris at 11 p,m. last night* On my arrival I found that Nivelle had been asked to resign by the Minister of War and had refused.    War Committee is sitting this morning to determine what is to be done.   I will wire you later.   As a result of all these changes both Paris and Compiegne are unsettled.&quot;&apos;&quot;        - i &quot;7 &quot;V ----- -r------ -.--r-7--:----^--^
Ge Qo Gr98 * 5 3 17 eDear Robertson,There is very little change since you left.   The present situation appears to me to be this.     PETAIN means to have a voice and a control in the proposals f^r operations, and even, I think, to a certain extent;, in the execution of operations.        He will do this, not at all because he is trying to curry favour with the Cabinet, but because he quite honestly believes in,his own superiority, as a soldier, over NIVELLE,        PAINLEVE on the other hand, who thought that the -appointment of PETAIN would in reality give him (Painleve) a grip over NIVELLE and the general direction of affairs, is finding that PETAIN is not so &quot;commode&quot; as he had hoped. NXVELLE, on his part, is reasserting himself as C-in-C. I can show you perhaps beet by something that happened yesterday.,I gave NIVELLE a letter from HAIG- containing his proposals for future operations, and after going through it carefully with NIVELLE, I asked him point blank whether he would show It to PETAIN, and he replied &quot;Certainly not, until our plans are agreed to as between HAIG and myself, and then I shall send PETAIN the completed arrangements&quot;.There is therefore certain to be a clash between NIVELLE and PETAIN, with what result I do not know, and the reason of my doubt is that NIVELLE has now got the active support of BRIAND.BAll this is, of course, bad for the Army, and for the War *        The Prench Headquarters here are simply upside downj every Chef de Bureau is being changed, and all this nestlessnea is -reflected lower down, and if it is continuous for long, it will result in the soldiers taking sides politically, which will be fatal0The present position cannot last very long, which is a comfort, as it is thoroughly unsatisfactory0    I am not going to take the slightest notice of the differences between&quot; NIVELLE and PETAIN, and I shall talk to both of them like a father- whenever I think fit.     It may do good.Yours,H..W.(Lieut.-General Sir HeHt WilsonK.C.B., D.S.0
