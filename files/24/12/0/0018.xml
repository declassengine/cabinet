71PBIO^jgXJiL^ Q-&apos; -TEENERS,&quot;fli) ICCBoSJTY if&apos;OR PROVISION Oi KOr^VgS^SjLMemorandum &quot;by Jirst S.ea Lord.15The Secretary,War Cabinet.Our losses in minesweepers have become so heavy that it is necessary to ask: the V/ar Cabinet for sanction to add to our shipbuilding programme in this class of vessel, and, further, to obtain sanction to give the minesweepers already on order first priority0The situation in regard to construction of thesevessels is as follows6 are due for delivery in May, .5 in June, 3 in July, 1 in August, 0 in September,and 2 in each of the months October, November and December,In 1918 the deliveries are much better, and what is necessary now is to push forward the construction of those due for delivery in 1918, in order that some of them may be delivered as early as possible in the current year, In addition it is necessary, in my opinion, to order an ad-ditionai 50 at oncecFor both of these measures I request the sanction of the War Cabinet,,It is right to state that the figures I have 6iven do not include trawlers., some of which as they are completed will be used for minesweeping; but the delivery of this class of vessel only averages about  0 a month and they are needed for patrol as well as. minesweepin0 duties..The serious nature of :the position is shown by the fact that.19 minesweeping vessels were blown up by mines during April.and that the total number of mines swept up in April is 487 as against 2l;3&apos; An January. The number of . mines laid by the German submarines is steadily incheas-ing and. our losses of-minesweepers increase in proportion^ 1st May 1.917-   , tegfy- JZ1LIC.0Z.i.;s i if ti 4     ii
