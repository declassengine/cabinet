It was stated last week that so far it had not been found necessary to cancel any of the exemptions which had been accorded by the War Office toscientific workers, teachers, and organisers, on the recommendation&apos; of this Department.     While this holds true for the time being, the War Office have informed us that they consider that the practice to oe followed by this Department in dealing with exemptions should
follow the lines of the revised  card of Education Circular.     In effect this would mean the withdrawal of all exemptions in the case of men who are placed in category A. and those under 31 in category 33.1. To&apos;apply this policy in certain cases would he a very serious matter for Colleges and Local Authorities affected.

Kiscellaneous enquiries received during the week included the usual demand for information with regard to medicinal herbs, and as to the process for using sugar beet for jam-making:    it appears that the large number of enquiries which have been received on the latter subject have been due to the issue by a firm of seedsmen of a pamphlet - calculated to deceive the public - stating that sugar beet may be used for jam-making and offering to supply the necessary seeds.Publications Branch.The work of distributing the April, issue of the Journal waB completed-     The number of applications for ordinary issues of the leaflets was 1,160 , and the number of copies sent was 23,600.

The &quot;weeding-out&quot; of papers has been continued.2.   Under arrangements sanctioned by the Treasury in 1910, certain classes of map-work required by the Board in Tithe transactions are executed by the Ordnance Survey at Southampton, instead of by the Board!s own Survey staff at 3, St. Janes5s Square; but it has recently been feasible for the staff at St. James&apos;s Square themselves to do much of the kind of work which they did before 1910 and thus to reduce the requisitions on Southampton.     In addition, that staff, despite its recent further depletion, has cleared off a large accumulation of cases of recording on Ordnance Survey sheets the boundaries of land redeemed of Tithe Rentcharge.Establishmen t^Bjranch.A considerable amount of general correspondence, including Ordnance Survey business, has been dealt&apos;with during the past week; and many offers   of services and enquiries in connection with the Live Stock Census have been answered.
