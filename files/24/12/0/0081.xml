S C RET--&quot; - WAR   CABINETG.T.-680Translation o f a telegram from the French Consul Genenal at Moscow dated 5th May, 1917, handed in by the French Military Attache to the D.M.I,Demonstrations took place ,on the 4th May in Moscow. Placards inscribed &quot;Down with the Provisional Government&quot; and &quot;Down with the War&quot; were hawked round the town by parties of agitators and torn to pieces by counter-agitators. Shouts of &quot;long live Germany&quot; were heard.     Deputies and workmen urged the crowd to maintain order.     The agitators dispersed, but the situation is not yet clear.French Socialist deputies gained the impression during their visit here that propagandists were assiduously and successfully spreading the idea of a separate peace.It is probable that an anti-foreign movement, directed against the Allies, could be started by the agitators without much difficulty.
