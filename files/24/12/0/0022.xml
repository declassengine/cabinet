Sir C. Spring-Bice to Lord Hardinge.My Lord, Washington, April 13, 1917.The announcement of Mr. Balfour&apos;s visit has given the greatest satisfaction here, especially in Government circles. There are, however, certain considerations which it would he wise to bear in mind.1. There is no intention to establish a coalition Government or to accept the advice and assistance of the Republican party, although in political, naval, and military affairs the Republican party, owing to its long continuance in office, undoubtedly possesses the most distinguished personalities. In finance, the great leaders belong to the Republican party, and are on the very worst terms with the Democratic Administration. On the whole, what is generally known as Society is on the side of the Republicans and opposed to the Democrats. The speakers and writers who have from the first taken the side of the Allies have violently attacked the President, and are almost all to be ranked among his political enemies. It will therefore be essential that our mission should bear these facts in mind. The persons with whom they would naturally come in contact, and with whom they would be naturally inclined to associate, are precisely those with whom the President is on bad terms. Any intimacy with these persons would be regarded witli suspicion. On the other hand, it would of course be dangerous to show any ingratitude to those who have borne the labour and heat of the day on our behalf. It is thought very fortunate that the British Government has selected a man who is known to be most competent to deal with this very delicate situation.2. The President in entering into the war has probably taken the action which he has done at the earliest possible moment. If it had been taken before it is extremely doubtful whether the country would have followed him. His political method is to ascertain from various sources of information what is the predominant sense of the country. He has never taken any action in which he was not n^oderately sure of at least the acquiescence of the majority. His tendency has been to follow very exactly the dictates of popular&quot; opinion. There is no doubt that this country desires peace, and enters on the war with the greatest reluctance. Their reason for coming into it is not the desire to help the Allies, but the conviction that neutrality is no longer possible; that they must fight Germany, and it is better to fight her in Europe with Allies than in America without. Congress is already showing very plainly the effect of the manifest reluctance of the people of the United States to take an active and physical part in the struggle.3. One of the favourite lines of attack on the President by the pacifists and pro-Gormans is that Great Britain for her own purposes has inveigled the United States into the war and is going to make use of tais country for her selfish objects. It will be said, especially in the Hearst papers, that the British mission is sent here in order to carry out this object to induce the United States to take action best fitted to promote British purposes, and is sending specialists to teach the United States how to raise an army and conduct the war. The best answer to this accusation is to point out that the conditions in the United States are very similar to those which prevailed in Great Britain and that the United States has every reasoa to take advantage of the mistakes made by Great Britain and profit by our experience. We are sending a mission not to offer advice unasked for but to answer any questions which the United States Government may be inclined to ask us in order to promote the common cause and to enable this Government to avoid the errors into which we have fallen4 The reason which no doubt is at the bottom of antagonism of Americans to Great Britain is the fear of being thought to be relapsing into the pre-revolution conditions. There would be the very greatest reluctance to taking part in the war under British control or as a part of a British campaign. The United States army and navy and the United States Government would be very sensitive to the accusation [542]
which will undoubtedly be made that they are submitting to the control or dictation of any British officer. This is the danger which will have always to be borne in mind. The fact that Great Britain has taken the part she has done in the war and that the United States has come in at a later date will tend to promote the impression that the United States is following Great Britain&apos;s lead. Eor - this purpose it is most important that every possible care should be taken to impress on the minds of Americans that Great Britain has no secret designs of this nature. Of course it is also highly important that true recognition should be given of the very great services which this country has rendered and is now rendering to the Allied cause.5. There can be no doubt that the President will speak of the Irish question, The Irish party are of very great political importance at the present moment. The question is one which is at the root of most of our troubles with the United States. The fact that the Irish question is still unsettled is continually quoted against us as a proof that it is not wholly true that the fight is one for the sanctity of engagements or the independence of small nations. The President is by descent an Orangeman and by education a Presbyterian. But he is the leader of the Democratic party in which the, Irish play a prominent part and he is bound in every way to give consideration to their demands.I have, &amp;c.CECIL SPRING-RICE.
