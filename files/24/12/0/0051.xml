SECRET. 65117 A B    CABIIII, SHIPBUILDING.Icte &quot;by the Shipping Controller on paragraph (14) of &quot;Jar- -    &quot;r&apos;&apos;  - ws^tw^q^iw: &quot;     *     ^There is everything to ho said for oloso co-ordination of tho various Departments concerned with shiphuilding, hut the suggestion that the now Admiralty Civil Lord, who is to he responsible for Ilayal shipbuilding, should also exercise a measure of -control, over merchant shipbuilding is one In which the Shipping Controller could not possibly acquiesce..  The Shipping Ministry has already in existence a shipbuilding Committee consisting of men of the highest eminence in tho profession, together with technical experts, and they have done splendid work.   lo reasons have been given for suggesting that they need surveillance from outsido and it could not be expected that they would be willing to accept such.      Thoir achievements have been limited only by failure to make available the necessary supplies of material and labour for an extended programme.,  for this failure they are in no way responsible.4th May, 1917.
