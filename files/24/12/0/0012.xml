CONFIDENTIAL . WAR   CABINEfl .G.T. 612. For the information of the CabinetProm the First Sea Lord.USE OF HIGH SPEED VESSELS FOR IMPORT OF WHEAT.I suggest to the War Cabinet that the question of using high speed vessels for the import of wheat should be at once considered.The use of high speed, in combination with Admiralty directions as to courses to be steered, is probably one of the most practical and readiest means of defence for providing a factor of safety against the present submarine menace when vessels are passing through dangerous areas.In order to obtain details as to how the question now stands, and of vessels of high speed, and the probability of allocating them to this service, it is proposed that a Conference should be held at once to report on this matter, arrangements being made for the following representatives to at t end: -Representative of Admiralty&quot;   Controller of Shipping (For information as regards present employmentof high speed vessels.) Representative of the department responsible for theimport of wheat, and with knowledge where wheatis available for export to this country:and, as occasion arises, Representatives of any other department necessary toensure a complete statement of facts beingobtained.Lloyd&apos;s Registry has a list of high speed vessels, and this list would serve as a basis for preparing one for high speed vessels which could be diverted from their present service for the import of grain.The following information extracted from the Requisition-ing Branch, Ministry of Shipping, dated 31st March, 1917, is of interest:-&quot;The number of wheat vessels employed by the Government is 182, with gross tonnage of 777,405, giving an average of 4,265 tons gross.   Of these, three are passenger vessels and 179 tramps and cargo liners.Vessels on that date free from Admiralty requisition were 293 Passenger Liners, 529 Cargo Liners, the majority of which would exceed the speed of the ordinary tramp.&quot;It would therefore appear possible, with suitable organi-sation, for some 293 Passenger Liners with some of the high speed cargo liners to be at once diverted to this service.It may be taken that Passenger vessels would supply the high speed required, and probably some of the Cargo Liners.COPY
The question of clearing the ships by naval and military labour should be considered.The Guns Crews detailed for these vessels should be specially selected for marksmanship and efficiency.The same remarks would apply to high speed vessels that could be obtained from foreign countries, especially the United States, and it is proposed that the main points of these suggestions should be telegraphed for consideration at the conference now taking place in the United States.1st May, 1917,
