G.T.-660.PROPOSAL TO SECURE ABSOLUTELY THE NATIONAL SAFETY BY CONCENTRATING SHIPPING IN THE ATLANTIC.(Memorandum by Sir Leo Ghiozza Money, M.P.)1. WE have it in our power to secure absolutely the national safety in spite of the increasing submarine menace.2. It is necessary to realise that it is possible for the United Kingdom and her Allies to live and to wage war by virtue of: (a.) Their own resources;(&amp;.) The resources of the North American Continent;with the addition of a comparatively trifling amount of cargo brought from othersources.3. We are now allied to the United States of America, and therefore allied to the country which is : (a.) The greatest wheat country. (6.) The greatest steel country, (c.) The greatest mineral oil country. (d.) The greatest lead country, (e ) The greatest copper country. (/). The greatest cotton country.\n fact, there are few things of importance which the United States lacks, the chief being rubber and tin. As for engineering power, she has the greatest engineering plant as well as the greatest iron and steel plant in the world. As to steel, the United States production is over 40,000,000 tons against 9,500,000 tons here and 13,000,000 tons in Germany.4. In these circumstances it is submitted here that it is the height of folly to sacrifice our ships as we are doing by sending them to all parts of the world when it is tjuite unnecessary to do so. All that is needed to ensure absolute safety and power to continue in the war for an indefinite period is to stop trading with the world and to conserve our ships in keeping open communications with North America, which can supply us not only with food and materials, but with men.5. Before going further, let the desperate character of the situation be realised, unless this proposal is adopted.(3. As I have shown in my latest memorandum on tonnage and cargo estimates (dated the 27th April, 1917), tonnage will break down before Christmas if the present use of tonnage is continued. The Admiralty is asked to perform the impossible task of using its veiy limited number of patrol boats and destroyers to safeguard many routes. Hie thing cannot be done, and the pitiable spectacle is witnessed of Parliament and the press baiting the Admiralty for what the Admiralty has not the material to remedy. It is in our power to enable the Admiralty to do good and useful work, well within its power, oil the Atlantic route.7. It is still true, as I pointed out as long ago as May 1915, when I vainly urged taat every merchant-ship should be armed forthwith, that German engineering- power is underrated. I then said &quot; there, is no practical reason why Germany should not mild another hundred submarines by next Christmas,&quot; and that, &quot;if I were making plans to meet the Germans, I should think it safer and wiser to count upon 150 rather than 100 by Christmas &quot; (i.e., Christmas 1915). Now, after two years, I feel strongly that we are not yet allowing enough for German increased submarine building. In six [621]     * ^        &quot; B
months&apos; time Germany will possess many more submarines than now, after allowing far all we can do to destroy them.8. We are tempted to imagine that some heaven-sent genius will show the Admiralty how to destroy submarines. The fact is that it is, from a scientific point of view, an inherently difficult problem, unlikely to be solved in this war. The Admiralty must no longer be given an impossible task. It is merely foolish to scatter targets about the high seas and to call upon the Admiralty to protect these targets. The essence of my proposal is to deprive the enemy of a large part of his field of action and so to use our ships as to give the Admiralty a fair chance to save them. As things are we are offering our ships to the enemy as gratuitous victims.9. The proposal would also rob the raider of his chance. At any moment, in existing circumstances, another &quot; Moewe&quot; may break through to operate on our scattered ships.   Given Atlantic concentration and a raider could do little.10. We have still left some 3,500 ocean-going ships, of which about one-half is allocated to war purposes or is serving abroad. The remaining 1,750 ships, or thereabouts, are being daily sacrificed by unnecessary employment. We have the power to bring this to an end for each individual ship as it touches the United Kingdom. My suggestion, in short, is that as ships arrive from other routes they should then be diverted into the Atlantic if necessary, or, if not necessary, laid up in port-to make good whatever losses occur on the Atlautic route. New ships should be put into reserve as completed.11. It is perfectly true that the Admiralty probably cannot guarantee absolute safety, even when in a position to concentrate all its protection upon the Atlantic trade, but who can doubt, in the nature of the case, that the margin of loss will be comparatively small? Observe, then, the position that would obtain. We should have in our ports, deliberately laid up and in safety, a stock of ships to replace the Atlantic losses if and when they occurred. If they did not occur, so much the better. If they did occur, we should place ships into the trade to the extent needed to make good the losses.12. And thus we should continue in absolute security and with all the supplies really needed, until the increase of shipbuilding here and in America enabled us to resume commerce on ordinary lines. That is to say, we should be tided through the danger period which may be taken as extending to the spring of 19IS. We must uot be tempted to imagine that shipbuilding alone can see us through this period. At present our British shipbuilding output is at the rate of about 1,000,000 tons a year, whereas in the month of April nearly 650,000 tons of British shipping were either lost entirely or put out of action for many months. It is quite possible that June may see a loss of 1,000,000 tons, and while there is some reason to hope that that figure will fall again at the close of the year with shorter working days for the submarines, we have to put against the shorter days the fact that every week the number of submarines possessed by the enemy is increasing. We ought to aim at increasing the rate of our shipbuilding to 3,000,000 tons per annum, but that rate cannot be reached for a long time yet, whatever we do. So it is with the United States. The possibilities of her shipbuilding are enormous, but it takes months to establish new shipyards and months after that to get the beginning of output. In nine months&apos; or a years time, the combined increase in shipbuilding of England and America should -save the situation, but what is to serve us in the interim, if not the proposal made here ?13. The proposal demands sacrifices on the part of our traders, for it would be necessary to relinquish a considerable part of our export trade. It would also mean sacrifices for some of our Dominions which have hitherto supplied us with their surplus exports. But it is also true of both our traders and our Dominions that such sacrifices are as nothing compared with what they would have to endure if we headed for disaster towards the close of this year.14. The adoption of this plan of concentrating shipping and the defence of shipping on the Atlantic would deprive the enemy of his last hope. Our shipping losses would quickly fall from 20,000 tons or 30,000 tons per day to a negligible figure, for there would be fewer targets to aim at and those targets would be mainly in a route which the submarine could only use by making itself also a target.] 5. Of course it is recognised that there are a few things which must be fetched from, places outside the United States, but they are comparatively few and really do not complicate the problem to any great extent. Anybody who is tempted to doubt the feasibility of this plan should reflect upon the fact that the German Empire has been living on its own resources, with very little aid from outside, for nearly three
vears. The resources of the German Empire when compared with those of the United States are almost negligible. ^16. Germany is, in point of natural resources, a poor country, her outstand-ino- factors of industrial wealth being the same as those of the United Kingdom, viz. coal and iron. How is it, then, that she has been able to maintain herself practically without imports during this long war ? The explanation is largely to be found in her scientific methods, but that is not all. Germany has done without imports simply because we have compelled her to do without them. Her imports in 1913 were worth 520,000,000L, or 8L per head of the population. Being deprived of them she set her wits to work to do without them and succeeded. So, in lesser degree, it has been with ourselves. Last year we were importing over 3^ million tons of cargo per mouth, and the Board of Trade was convinced that we could not do without these imports.   It declared that &quot; We have exhausted every civil economy suggested to us or thought of by our experts or by members of the Government and the Departments.&quot;Now, a year later, we are living with imports of about 2^ million tons per month, and yet, as every thoroughfare bears witness, our people were never so well dressed or so happy and prosperous looking. We can still live, and live comfortably, with fewer imports. It would indeed be strange if, when the Germans have shown that they can live for years with scarcely any imports at all, we were unable to sustain ourselves upon our own resources plus what we can secuie by maintaining the North Atlantic communication, plus small and exceptional supplies from other sources.17. What has been just said may be neatly illustrated by the case of iron ore. Because we had ships to bring ore we did not trouble to develop our home resources. It was enough to live from hand to mouth as though the ships would always remain. As soon as our wits were sharpened by necessity we discovered what we might have known and acted upon all along, that it was really not difficult within a reasonable time to make ourselves largely independent of ships in this respect. Thus again it was with timber, although we knew, or might have known, that the great bulk of the timber required in the war could be got within our own borders. In spite of these object-lessons, we continue to act as though every ship we possess must be put into what is, in a very real sense, the firing line, because we possess the ships. Possessing ships able to bring in x tons of cargo, we say that x tons of cargo must be fetched. It would be just the same if at this moment we possessed ships sufficient to fetch 2x tons of cargo. We should still fetch them and still be tempted to declare that we could not do without them. It is a much simpler thing for us to exist with American aid than for Germany to live upon herself. That is the essence of the matter, and properly regarded it is our salvation in the present crisis.18. Finally, let me point out that losses have become so grave that, with shipping used as it is, the chance of a vessel (which is about to proceed overseas to a destination not nearer than Gibraltar) returning safely is not better than a 3 to 1 chance.(Signed)        LEO CHIOZZA MONEY.May 4, 1917.Supplementary Notes.1. As to the exporting power of the United States, it should be noted that in 1916 American exports reached the prodigious total of 1,096,000,0001.The distribution of this total was as follows :  To United Kingdom..         .. .. ..      378,000,000France ..          ..          ..   &apos;                 .. .. ..       172,000,000Italy                ..         ,.          ..          .. .. 61,000,000Russia ..      ...          ,.          ..          .. .. ..        94,000,000,,thealove .. .. .. ..      705,000,000,, rest of the world.. .. .. .. .. ..       391,000,0001,090,000,000
Thus, in spite of the extraordinary call made upon America by the Allies, she was able last year to export nearly 400,000,000/!. of food, material, and manufactures to other destinations. Of this 57,000,00OZ. was sent to Holland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, part of it really being supplied to the enemy (i.e., fodder turned into produce and sold by these neutrals to Germany).2. As&apos;to Canadian exporting power, in the year 1915 Canadian exports reached 101,000,0001 Of this, only 47,000,0001 was sent to the United Kingdom and her Allies, the remaining 54.000,0001 going to other countries.3. Thus between them the United States and Canada exported enormously more than either the United Kingdom or her Allies absorbed. If Canada and the United States threw themselves deliberately and without regard to commercial considerations into the supplying of the United Kingdom and her Allies, much more than the surplus export referred to could certainly be counted upon as available for our European supplies.4. Turning to wheat, the following figures show, roundly, what has happened in the last three years in respect of the American and Canadian export surpluses: Imports of wheat into United Kingdom in 1914-1916 were (In millions of cwt.)				1914.	1915.	1916.From U.S.A. and Canada From other places	78 40	75 28	100 14Exports of wheat from U.S.A. in 1914-1916 to places other than the United Kingdom, France, and Italy were  (In millions of cwt.)				1014.	1915.	1916.To other places	55	63	47Exports of wheat from Canada in 1914-1916 to places other than the United Kingdom, France, and Italy were  (In millions of cwt.)				1914.	1915.	1916.To other places         ..         ..	8	9	125. It will be seen that in each of the three years 1 914, 1915, and 1916 the surplus export of wheat from the United States to places other than the United Kingdom, France, and Italy amounted to much more than that part of our wheat supply which we drew from places other than the North American Continent. There was also a Canadian export surplus over and above her sales to the Allies. It can only be regarded as highly improbable that under the proposal made here we should not be able to draw the whole of our wheat supply from North America. Moreover, our position would in no respect be damnified m this respect if my proposal were adopted, since, in the event of the North American supplies failing, we should possess the ships to fetch wheat from other markets.6. Turning to maize, the following statement is of interest: Imports of maize into the United Kingdom in 1914-16 were (In millions of cwt.)	1914.	1915.	1916.From TJ.S.A. and Canada	0-2	1-9	9-1From other places	39-0	48-6	34-2
Exports of maize from IIS. A. in 1914-16 were (In millions of cwt.)-	1914.	1915.	1916.To United Kingdom	3-0	4-4	6-1To other places	5-4	21-7	22-5This statement is not quite so favourable as that relating to wheat. It shows that we should probably have to make a limited number of voyages to other markets than North America to secure our maize supply.7. As to barley, the American trade returns do not give quite so much detail as for wheat and maize, but the following statement is sufficiently conclusive : Imports of barley into the United Kingdom in 1914-16 were (In millions of cwt.)	1914.	1915.	1916.From U.S.A. and Canada From other places Total	7-1 8-9	6*5 5-8	11-8 4-0	16-0	12-3	15-8Exports of barley from United States of America in 1914-16 were  (In millions of cwt.)				1914.	1915.	1916.To all destinations    ..         .,	18-2	26-5	22-5This shows that the American export of barley is very much greater than our present total imports from North America, and also much greater than our total imports from all places.8. As to meat, our home position is very much better than in regard to bread; normally we produce in the United Kingdom one-half of the meat we consume, and our imports are now 82,000 tons per month. These imports, or the greater part of them, could be dispensed with given some small assistance from the American Continent. The following statistics of our live stock will show how great is our home reserve : -	1914.	1915.	1916.Cattle   (exclusive   of   cows   and heifers in milk or in calf) Sheep Pigs ..	7,700,000 , 28,000,000 3,900,000	7,700,000 28,300,000 3,800,000	8,000,000 28,800,000 3,600,0009. Let us suppose that 15 per cent, of these animals were slaughtered during the danger period.This would yield in meat: -		Number of Animals.

That gives over 73,000 tons per month, for nine months, or over 55,000 tons per month for twelve months, against our present import of 82,000 tons per month. Yet we have just sent ships round the world to New Zealand to fetch meat with no guarantee of their safe return.10. The next most important factor in the food problem is fat. Fortunately, we have in the country a very big stock of oils and fats, sufficient to keep us going for about six months. We could afford, therefore, very considerably to reduce our oi! and fat importations, as under my proposal we should retain a stock of shipping sufficient to make good in any direction in case of emergency. It is true that North America cannot supply us with the valuable oleaginous produce of the tropics, but she, can supply enormous quantities of cotton-seed oil, which can be utilised by margarine makers. The annual exportation of cotton-seed oil from the United States of America ranges betweeu 200,000,000 lb. and 350,000,000 lb. a year.11. I pass to materials. As to cotton, there is, of course, no difficulty. America is the cotton country, and it is&apos; unnecessary to discuss the import question. Of exports of cotton goods I will speak later.12. As to wool, America cannot be helpful, and it will be necessary to make a certain importation from other markets. The import has been already cut down to very small dimensions by the War Office, but it would be further reduced. We are still exporting large quantities of British wool. It is true that these are not as suitable for army purposes as some of the imported wools, but the time has come when we must weave our cloth according to our materials. As to jute, there has been a drastic reduction in import, and there will be no difficulty in providing for the shipment of the reduced amount.13. It is of more importance to turn to metals, as to which, fortunately, the Allies can almost entirely depend upon America. Of iron and steel the United States produces nearly twice as much as Germany and Britain put together. We need not import another ton of iron ore from Spain. We need only import from America either crude steel or, better, the standardised products of her rolling mills. It should be thoroughly understood that America needs only to divert a small proportion, say, one-fifth of her to&quot;al steel production, to war purposes to more than solve every problem in tiiis connection for the Allies. One-fifth of her production is over 8,u00,000 tons, whereas our total production is 9,500,000 tons.14. Other important metals, of which we can obtain more than sufficient from North America, are copper, lead, and zinc.   As to nickel, Canada is a chief producer.For the rest, the obtaining of such minor metals as tin and manganese from other markets would present no difficulty. For the purposes of this discussion, we may say that we can depend upon North America for almost all the metals we require. It is a most fortunate situation, which could hardly be better if we invented it to suit ourselves.Of miscellaneous materials which we ne^d and which cannot be brought from North America there are very few of any consequence.   They are :-Bubber, Pyrites,  Nitrates.The provision of these from other markets, is but a fractional factor in the case.15. The production and exports of America are wonderful enough, and practically sufficient for our purposes, without regard to the all-important fact that America has now joined us. That is to say, if we allow nothing for Governmental co-operation, the case is good enough. How much better it becomes if we allow, as we can surely do, for the deliberate devotion of the resources of the United States to the purposes of the war.10. I now pass to some observations en the internal effects of my proposal upon the economic life of the United Kingdom. Concentration of shipping&quot;7 upon maintaining the Atlantic route could give us practically all the materials we want, but it necessarily robs us of a large part of our export trade. Our exporters could doubtless make increases in the North American markets, and they would still be able to maintain a small connection with other parts of the world, since a limited connection could be maintained with all places, but export loss must be faced.17. The cotton trade presents the chief problem in this connection. Manv of the other exporting trades, such as iron and steel and engineering, have not &quot;suffered through the war because the war demand has recouped them for the loss of export trade.a.
Tins, would, continue to be true under my proposal. Indeed, it is very easy to exaggerate the export difficulty, especially now that the entry of America into the war solves our external financial difficulties.18. Even as to the cotton trade, there is no difficult)&apos; that could not be surmounted bv wise and appropriate action. Normally, four-fifths of the products of the cotton trade are exported. How, then, is Lancashire to be tided over a period in which she will be deprived of a very large part of that four-fifths of her. output which is normally sold abroad. There is, of course, no difficulty as to material, since America, is the great supplier. For the rest, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that we could maintain, about 60 per cent, of the output of Lancashire during the danger period with which this memorandum deals.(1.) The public could be encouraged and urged to purchase cotton goods. That is to sa3r, it should be a national advice and instruction to the people to have regard to the condition of this great staple and to help it by buying its products. The national income was never so great. Unfortunately, it is not possible to present a precise statement of the case as it stands, but I should not be surprised to find that if a census were taken at this moment the cotton trade has already largely increased its output for home account. Out of high wages and war profits the people of the United Kingdom could, by a little extra buying per head of our 45,000,000 people, aid Lancashire considerably.(2.) Foreign oversea markets-would not be entirely closed. America and Canada would be freely open and there would be small shipments to some other markets.(3.) Neutral ships would doubtless carry a certain fraction of the normal export.(4.) The War Office would encourage the production of cotton garments for the army.(5.) The Government could promote a certain amount of manufacture for stock, which could be very easily dumped into oversea markets at the conclusion of the war.(6.) In regard to the last item, and indeed as to the whole problem, the Government could give generous financial assistance. If necessary, assuming (as indeed this memorandum assumes all through) that a proper system of rationing obtains, the standard loaf could be sold in cotton towns at a price below the&apos; standard price of 9d. suggested in my memorandum entitled &quot; Food liationing, and the Discouragement of the Enemy.&quot;19. In this connection it is too often forgotten that Germany has bad to do without export trade for nearly three years. Nevertheless, wages have risen considerably in Germany * and there has been no lack of employment save in very exceptional cases indeed. The fact is, of course, that in Germany the majority of export trades have, been compensated for loss of exports by war business We have been so spoiled here by enjoying an amazing prosperity at home while the war is fought on foreign soil that I fear we have got these things a little out of perspective, and difficulties which are not really great in relation to the issues at stake come to be unduly magnified.20. It should also be remembered that my proposal would take two or three months to carry into full effect. Indeed, it is for that reason that I urge that there should not be a day&apos;s delay in making a beginning. The process of readjusting our shipping has to be done ship by ship.21. As to the British Dominions, the practical difficulties are few. They wrould be depiived of a large part of their export market in tho United Kingdom, but that is a financial and not a shipping difficulty. It would doubtless be necessary to give financial assistance, but the gigantic resources of our new Ally make this a small thing for us when compared with the financial part we have played in respect of France, Italy, and Russia. Fortunately, all our Dominions are exporters of foods and materials, and all of them are easily able to maintain themselves. As for manufactures, Australian manufacturers are not likely to regard very distressfully the stoppage of British imports of manufactured goods.22. It would, of course, be essential for the State buying departments to have regard to the new situation and to confine their buying, as far as possible, to the North American markets.   In any case they should be instructed to do this at once.L. C. M.May 4th, 1917.- 1 : o &apos;    - -
