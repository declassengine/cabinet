, S E C RHG.Tv&apos;- 687 &apos; WAR CABINET/.SUGGESTIONS FOR COP INS WITH SUBMARINE MENACE. \- - TEIiEgRAM - from the Governor General of, the Commonwealthof Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies- (Received Colonial ,Off ice -11.12 p.m. &quot;BtFMay, 1917*Prime Minister, asks you to he good (?) enough to bring before Admiralty authorities and Sir Joseph Maclay the following suggestion for their earnest consideration in connexion with submarine menace and means of. coping with-it;     He claims that although there is nothing now in them they have the merit of being practicable so far as cargoes of flour aro concerned (an ample supply of.which is absolutely vital to: Britain) and seem to offer - an effective protection against the danger of vessels being sunk by torpedoes. The facts are briefly, as fellows:- (1) Vessels built of pine have been proved experimentally not to founder, even if full&apos;to the hatches with water. - (2)    In Prime Minister1s presence mid by himself it has been proved by experiment that flour enclosed in bags after 48 hours submergence, in salt water/ anchored by weights exceeding the weight of the flour itself, will, when the weights are removed,, not only rise to the surface at once and float but retain sufficient buoyancy to keep afloat a certain amount of deadweight of Iron or other heavy material attached to it. Further upon being taken from the water after this 4c hours submergence and opened the bag shows that the bulk of the. flour, remains perfectly dry only about one inch of tho contents being affected by the water...    In opinion of. Prime Minister it follows from this II)&apos; that if wooden ships were built and loaded with say 40$ of.flour they would not founder;after being struck by torpedoes, could.use their, guns, against submarines and drive them off if their engine room was   flooded and could, by signalling for assistance,, bo towed in and the bulk of the cargo saved. (2) The Prime Minister does not know to what extent the buoyancy, of &quot;a^cargo of flour could prevent fin iron vessel sinking and he suggests that experiment could easily determine..     These suggestions are earnestly recommended by Prime Minister to those in charge of shipping and he hopes that they will at least demonstrate experimentally that they are not worth trying before repeating them.     He asks that it may be remembered that Australia can load with flour every ship Britain can sent here for the next year and more.     I should be glad of a telegraphic-reply.mimo pbrguson.
