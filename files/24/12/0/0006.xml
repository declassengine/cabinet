SECRET. COPY.G.T. 606.WAR CABINET.0.1/97/282.Withdrawal of the British from Salonika.1..   The Admiralty have recently, and the General Staff have on many &quot;occasions,  represented the necessity of withdrawing, partly or wholly,  the British troops from Salonika,  and therefore the arguments for this course need not he repeated.   The object of the, present Note is to explain how a reduction might be carried out and what it would mean.2.    The Allied front extends from the mouth of theStruma to Lake Ochrida, west of Monastir    a total lengthof 180 miles, while in addition the French have a number ofwidely distributed detachments,  amounting in all to aboutone division and one brigade,  in the country to the southof Lake Ochrida.   Last Winter when it .appeared possible thatthe enemy might strengthen his forcesin Macedonia with theobject of making.an attack in force,  the question of a with-f rontdrawal from the Monastir/to lines in rear was consideredboth by General Milne and by the General Staff.    The first linesuggested maintains the present front,  from the mouth of theStruma as far as the Vardar,  and then turns southwards byVodena and Verria - the total length would be 160 miles.    Theother alternative is the withdrawal to the original SalonikaDefence Line, which has a total length of 65 miles, or of45 miles if the lake fronts are excluded.    General Milneestimated that to hold the outer line by Vodena   and Verriamightagainst any attack which the enemy/make,  at least 22 divisions at full strength would be required and 12 to hold the inner
line of the Salonika Defences.    From this it will be seen that little or no saving of troops would result from a withdrawal to the outer line, and that it is only by falling back to the Salonika defences that any material economy of force can be realised.3.    If a withdrawal is carried out we must expect that the enemy will be tempted to take the offensive,  and he may possibly reinforce his troops with the object of attempting to drive the Allies into the sea.    There are no grounds at present for making any reduction in the estimat formed last December of the numbers which the enemy can bring against the Macedonian front.   On the contrary the collapse of Russia makes it easier for him to transfer the necessary troops if he so desires.    The increase in the length of the enemy lines of communication and the destruction of the roads as the allied1 forces retire v;ould increase his difficulties,  but these for the most part might be overcome.4.    The strength of the Allied forces at present under General Sarrail&apos;s command is shown in the appendix.    It amounts nominally to 23-^- infantry divisions,  one inde-pendent infantry brigade,   one cavalry division,  one cavalry brigade and two mounted brigades, but as the strength of the Servian infantry is only 40,000 at most, the Servian Contingent can only be reckoned at the equiva-lent of three divisions and the total allied force at the equivalent of 21 divisions and two cavalry divisions.The strength of the British portion of this force is 6 divisions,  one brigade and 2 mounted brigades.It will be observed in the appendix that the Allied infantry strength is very small in proportion to the ration strength.    The chief reasons for this are the
very large number of-men employed on- the construction and maintenance of the communications,  and the fact that the transport is necessarily pack to an abnormal ex-tent and thus absorbs an increased number of men for the increased number of animals.5. To find the 12 divisions estimated as necessary to hold the Salonika Defence Line there are, exclusive of the British troops;-8 French divisions, l-g- Italian divisions.1   Venezelist division    (which may be increasedto three)1 Russian division (equivalent of) 3 Servian divisions -(equivalent of).of these it would be unwise to rely on the Servians who,having fought well at Monastir,  would certainly be bitter-ly disappointed to find that their efforts had been ofho avail from a national point of view and might refuseto fight any more, but even if the Servians are eliminatedthere would still be. 12 divisions left,  exclusive of theBritish Contingent.    The effect of a withdrav/al upon theVenezeli3ts,  one division of which is included in thetotal of 12 remaining,  is uncertain but as the completewithdrawal of the latter must take many months,  it willbe time enough to decide when this is nearing completionwhether or not it will be necessary to leave any Britishtroops.6.    Since one of the main objects of a reduction of the force is to save shipping,&apos; this must be an important consideration in deciding on the destination of the force released.    The transference of the force to France would about halve the shipping required to and from the Mediterranean,  and of course it would set free considerable
Naval forces which the Admiralty are so anxious to obtain.   The saving in sending the whole forc-e to Egypt would not he great in shipping,  as the force would have to he kept up to strength and fed,   and the distance from the United Kingdom,  or from America,   to Egypt and to Salonika is practically the same.    In effect the move would release the 17 ships now engaged in carrying from Egypt to Salonika certain commodities coming from the East.7.   Withdrawal will, however,  take so long a time that it is&apos;impossible to say now where the troops should he sent,  hut we might begin by sending one division, two mounted brigades and a proportion of heavy artillery to Egypt.    If only the shipping now available in the Mediterranean is used,  it will take about two months to get those troops to Egypt,  and when the transport of them is completed a saving of six ships exclusive of supply which I refer to later,  will result.   As the evacuation proceeds it will he possible to review the situation from time to time and to decide whether it is necessary and wise to send more troops to Palestine,   or whether to send the whole of the remainder to Prance8.    As soon as the evacuation to France begins a considerable and increasing saving in shipping will take place.    Further,   in view of the considerable reserve of supplies now at Salonika, which will gradually be con-sumed as evacuation proceeds,  ant   additional saving of supply ships may be expected,  amounting to three or four ships per month throughout the whole period.    This programme would therefore mean that at the end of the, first two months when the/
division and two mounted brigades had reached Egypt there would be a saving of about 14 ships, and that from then on if the movement to France proceeded the saving would increase rapidly up to an eventual total of about 80 ships.   This is, of course, quite apart from the relief afforded to the lavy by reducing the demands now made upon them in the Mediterranean. (The figures regarding saving in shipping are merely an appro-ximate calculation by the War Office, and are subject to review by the Shipping Controller.)9.      It may be expected that the French before consentiig to a withdrawal to the Salonika defences will press for decisive action against King&apos;-Constantino, and that they will .. base their arguments upon the necessity for immediately removing all danger to the flank of the Allied Forces at Salonika, and of establishing a Government friendly tothe Entente at Athens before beginning the withdrawal. As to the alleged danger to the Allied flank, I have already expressed the opinion that there is little, if any, provided the Greeks are not provoked, and this opinion has been confirmed by the reports of General Phillips which are concurred in by General Milne, while further confirmation of it.is given in a report from General Sarrail&apos;s Head-Quarters of which the following is a summary:-&quot;The following numbers of Greek troops remain in districts shown below -In Thessaly   Regulars     1920)   including men onGendarmes   1500)   leave and deserters.In Epirus      Regulars     1920In Altica      Regulars     2400In Central Greece   Gendarmes   1500. All machine guns and artillery have been transferred to the Peloponnesus and Vnejlanger of reinforcements of troops
in Thessaly lies in the 1914 class.     The fev; men leftin Thessaly are weak from shortage of food, poorly equippedand clothed and have only a limited supply of ammunition&quot;.From the above it is quite clear that any danger to the Allied flank can be met by a small detachment, the provision of which^ould not materially affect other operations.10.     As regards establishing a friendly Government atAthens before the withdrawal begins,. the French proposal islikely to take the form of a plan to depose King Constantineby means of a military force invading Greek territory.Our diplomatic and military advisers on the spot are unanimousin their opinions that such a step would lead to war withGreece, as I feel sure it would, and  that the Army and agreat part of the people would rally round the King.Such action would involve us in commitments the extent ofwhich we cannot fully foresee, but it would certainlynecessitate the detachment of a Naval and Military forceto the Isthmus of Corinth in order to prevent the escapeof the Greek Army now in the Morea, the presence of anothernaval force at Athens and the opening of an additional baseat Volo, which would require further naval protection.Even if we succeeded in locking np the Greek Army it isestimated that a force of not less than 25,000 men wouldbe required for the invasion of Thessaly and this wouldhave to be proportionately increased if any or all of theGreek Army succeeded in escaping.     Apart altogether from theimpossibility of withdrawing a force of this size from the/present
present Allied front, the condition of our shipping resources is such that we cannot assent to the large additional demands which this programme would involve,11.     It has been suggested that if the deposition of King Constantine proves to be politically advisable we should&apos;adopt the course of presenting an ultimatum at Athens backed by an increased naval force at the Piraeus and by the threat of making the existing blockade complete.   The danger of this is that it might lead to disturbances in Athens and danger to the lives of Allied subjects and Venezelists, and thus after all bring about military action and consequently the retention of our forces in the Salonika theatre.     Whatever may be the&apos; necessity for deposing the King of Greece I have no hesitation in repeating what I have frequently said in the past that we cannot deal with still another enemy. This is more true now than ever because of the collapse of Russia,  and. it is my deliberate opinion that to become involved in hostilities with Greece might be seriously prejudicial to our prospects of vanning the war, and at the best and in any case could not help us to win it.12.     To sum up, it is lamentable to think that at thepresent time ^hen the Prench Government hesitate to continuefighting in Prance because of tka deficient man-power, theyand ourselves have over 400,000-men at Salonika who areunlikely ever to achieve any useful results, while anabsolutely intolerable strain is being put upon our navaland shipping resourees.     We have been waiting nearly amonth for the so called offensive on the part of Sarrail /and
we ought not to wait any longer.     My advice is:-At the forthcoming Conference at Paris the French Government should he informed that it is impossible for us to retain our present forces at Salonika; that we cannot agree to any action against Greece which might conceivably lead to hostilities with that country; and that we propose to withdraw forthwith our two Mounted Brigades and one Division, these to berollowed by the whole oigreater part of our force as soon as shipping can be provided.(Signed)   W.R.
