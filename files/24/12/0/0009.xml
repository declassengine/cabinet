SECRET ^ -                            WAR- CABINET.                                    *G.T. 609The National PgpoVPollqy-(Observations, by the Ministry of Pood on the Memorandum: by the Fcod (Vifar) Committee of the Royal Society, dated 24th April 1917 )(G.T. 550)The main point of the attack made by the Pood (War) Committee of the Royal Society on the Ministry of Pood, appears to be that they have not been regarded as the dictators of the National Pood Policy.     In concentrating their attack upon the Pood Controller the Committee overlook, or are unaware of, the fact that in its main lines, and to a considerable extent in its details, the policy adopted is that of the War Cabinet.Some, of the allegations are based on unfounded assumptions. To Bay that attempts to reduce consumption have been &quot;imperfectly&quot; co-ordinated with measures for extending the bread supply is only trUB in the sense that no co-ordination can be perfect.     It has, of course, been the constant pre-occupation of the Ministry to effect this co-ordination.     It is not true to say that attempts to reduce consumption have been confined to the well-to-do; though it is obviously true to say that it takes longer to influ-ence the &quot;millions of workers&quot; than those classes who are more readily reached by propagandist methods.It is stated that &quot;excessive emphasis&quot; has been placed on decrease of consumption.     But it is not explained how the millions of workers5 who are said to have been overlooked, can be influenced without emphasise     The statement that &quot; a certain level of consumption is necessary for efficiency&quot; is obviously true, but net very pertinent.     The truism was abundantly recog-nised by Lord Levonport in his first Appeal to the Nation, and nothing has been said on his authority which would justify the insinuation that it has been overlooked.     The statement that the Pood Controller has applied his policy &quot;indiscriminately&quot; to meat and bread is contrary to the facts.     The proposed voluntary ration reduced very substantially   the consumption of bread, but left the consumption of meat at slightly above the pre-war level.More than one allusion is made to the regulation of meat consumption, and the point is one in regard to which there has &quot;been, much criticism of the policy adopted, and as to which, no doubt, difference of opinion may fairly exist.     The contention apparently is that, instead of suggesting that the average con-sumption of meat might be maintained, the Pood Controller should have advocated an increased consumption.     It would hardly be gathered from this report that Lord Levonport has from the first, not only suggested the maintenance of pre-war meat consumption, but has steadfastly declined to institute a general meatless day. The adoption of one meatless day per week in Hotels and Res-taurants is not inconsistent with this.policy, as the total allowance of meat during the week in these establishments is still much above the average.     The extent to which there has been an actual reduction of meat consumption is at present uncertain, but, so far as evidence is available, it may be said that it may be accounted for by the reduction of wasteful and excessive consumption by the well-to-do, and not by any reduced consumption by the millions of workers.     Consumption per capita inttie case of meat, is greatly above the average among&quot;&quot;the well-to-do, and generally below the average.among the working classes.
It is a fallacy to suppose that no check upon meat consumption Is necessary.   It has, from the beginning of the War, been recognised that our native flocks and herds constituted a reserve which could be drawn upon in case of emergency.     But any substantial draft upon this reserveshould be deferred as long as possible. We still depend to a large extent on oversea meat supplies, especially for the feeding of the Army, and depletion of our reserve would proceed very rapidly if these supplies were cut off.     Not only is the yield of meat per head of stock killed much less, but it is pot possible- to go very far in killing a larger pro-portion of the total herd, without jeopardising the maintenance of the milk supply.     The policy of drawing upon our meat reserve has been accepted, Kid will be gradually adopted, but anything like excessive meat consumption - and.especially waste of meat     ought to be repressed.The observations .. in-the-report on the subject of fixing prices, might be discussed at length, but it is only necessary to say that the obvious theoretical objections, as well as the experience of Germany, are familiar to Lord Devonport and his advisers.   Whether In any particular case such as milk, potatoes or grain, the policy adopted was sound, may be debate-able, but it need only be said that the whole of the circumstances which lead to the adoption of the policy in each case, should be fully known before the action taken is condemned.It seems hardly worthy of the Royal Society to drag one or two statements from the &quot;Food Economy Campaign Handbook&quot;, out of their context and criticise them. The Handbook is intended as a popular appeal couched in forcible and fas is suggested) somewhat rhetorical language, and no one is likely to take it for a scientific treatise.Generally this report can only be described as cavilling without being helpful.     It mainly deals, not with those matters on which the Members of the Committee are eminent authorities, but with questions of policy which the Government must decide in the light of their full knowledge of the facts as to present and prospective supplies of various kinds of foodstuffs, both for this country and the Allies, and of the bearinr. of food regulations on other aspects of their general policy. The advice which the Committee have offered from time to time has been considered with due r espect by the Ministry of Food, and if it has not always been implicitly or immediately followed, for reasons which may not be always apparent, it has nevertheless been of great assistance in dealing with the complex questions which are Involved in any attempt at Food Control.(Intd).
