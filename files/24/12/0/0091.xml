0 1 0 1Memorandum, for the War Cabinet. Stoppage of Horse Racing.With reference to the memorandum submitted to the War Cabinet by Mr H.E. Puke I would ask permission to say-that I entirely agree with every argument that he puts forward with regard to the continuance of racing but I would point out that these arguments apply just as much to England as to Ireland.     Horse Breeding may not be so general in the former country but England certainly has larger and mere important Studs of thoroughbred stock than Ireland has and the amount of money received from abroad and our Colonies for the purchase of bloodstock is undoubtedly greater in England than in Ireland.  -I may point out that Lord Kitchener in the early part of the War expressly stated the importance of maintain-ing our horse breeding supremacy and many breeders who might otherwise have gone out of the business have continued believing that thereby they were performing a National service.I may point out too that the War Office,  in con-junction with the Board of Agriculture, has just set up a Committee with a view of putting to the best advantage the well bred mares which at the time of demobilisation wi]1 be superfluous to the establishment,  the procedure contemplated being the distribution of these rnares throughout the whole Kingdom and the provision of thoroughbred stallions in various neighbourhoods.     Their whole work will to a certain extent be nullified by the recent decision of the Cabinet ahs the almost inevitable result will be the elimination of at least 5 years of stallions.It would have required very little racing to keep the Industry going and the programme arrived at by Lord Devonport in consultation with the Stewards of the Jockey Club would have proved successful in this direction, whilst the amount of oats that would have been required to keep the best horses in training would have been infinitesimal.I made my protest when the matter last came before the Cabinet and I loyally accepted the decision they then arrived at but Mr Duke&apos;s memorandum gives me the opportunity of again registering my protest against the decision which if maintained will in my opinion to a large extent ruin the horse breeding industry of this country.     Neither our Allies, our Colonies, nor our enemies have been so unwise as to adopt the course which this Country has had forced on it.DERBY.War Office,IO.5.17.
