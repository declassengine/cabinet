tG.2..- 652W A S   .. .0 A 3 I H S S.THE CONSTRUCTION QJ? wOODEU,  SUPS III THB EiST. &apos; (Letter from Capt. T.G^ Tullooh to Secretary, War Cabinet).Bank Buildings,Sta James!s Street,S aWiApril 28th, 1917,Sir,As regards building ships to replace, as a war measure, steamers that are being submarined, I venture to call to your notice the possiDili-ties of building wooden ships in Burma and the Straits Settlements, where, not only material in the form of teak is plentiful (which material is to a large extent the&quot;&apos;property of the Government), but where there also exists a plentiful supply of cheap labour and suitable spots for this class of shipbuilding.The class of ship I have in mind would be In the nature of seagoing barges, propelled by a cheap form of heavy oil internal combustion engine, such as are at present used to a Very large extent in fishing vessels, particularly in Denmark and the Scandinavian countries generally,     T??o or throe of these engines coupled up together should suffice for propelling the barges at a satisfactory speed..*   These bargos being made of wood would be extremely diffi-cult to sink by gunfire from submarines, especially if the engines wore placed below the water lino and arrangements made whereby, when undor fire, the ship could bo stoorod by a periscope, the Captain and crew being also, below the water line during such time. -She small draught of such a vessel would also make it difficult to sink by means of torpedoes.There would be no call, I suggest, for the provision of masts, sails or rigging and the absence of those three factors alone would also enhance the possibility of the vessel escaping observation from submarines.If a standard type is adopted, the rapidity of erection would be considerably increased by the preparation of the necessary ribs, planking  sc. in many centres In Burma and the Straits Settlements and the parts could then be assembled at convenient launching plac es *Another suggestion I would like to make is that for immediate use&quot;it might be possible to&quot;purchase a number of Chinese Junks, - fit thorn with the same class of heavy oil engine Iliave described above and get them to sea in a very few weeks&apos; ;time from the date when the engines are alongside     Thero must be a very large number of places in China whore junks can be bought and the installation of engines carried out.
There probably exist in America a considerable number of the class of engines I have described and there would be no fear of loss by submarine during        transport from the Western seaboard of America to Burma, the Straits Settlements and China.i am, Sir,Your obedient Servant\(Signed)    T.G. TULLOCH.
