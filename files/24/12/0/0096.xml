S .1 0 B EJ2WAR CABINETBRQPOSSD TBAXiSF ERliNO3JS TO THE MINISTRY OF PENSIONS Q.F THS;.PQgI&apos;BS ASP DUTIES 01&apos; THE STATUTORY COMMITTEE (llote by the Minister of Pensions)This note has been prepared to assist the Cabinet in coming to a decision on the proposal cf the Statutory Committee under the Naval and Military War Pensions etc. Act of 1915 that these functions should, subject to the necessary modifications be transferred to my department.     This pro-posal is embodied in a letter from the Secretary of the Committee to the Prime Minister dated the 19th April, 1917, which is attached as   Appendix I to this note.2c       The Statutory Committee was constituted in 1916 for the double purpose of filling up the gaps which the stress of War had made in the arrangements for the administration &apos; of pensions and separation allowances as had been recommended in the report of   the 4th April, 1915, cf a Select Committee of the House of Commons on Naval and Military Services (tensions and Grants) and of providing for the treatment, training and employment of disabled men by the measures that had been proposed in the report, dated the 4th May of thatyear, of the Committee presided over by Sir George Murray. Central and local machinery were set up, the latter largely absorbing that of the Charitable organisations that had previously looked after the interests of sailors and soldiers and their families and bringing in local authorities and representatives of labour *     The constitution of some 310 local committees in all the Counties and larger Boroughs of the United Kingdom, many with sub-committees and district committees, was a matter of some difficulty snd it. was not till the latter half of 1916 that they began to operate. This they did most quickly in the matter of making advances on   account of separation allowances and pensions and of supplementing separation allowances.     The supplementation of pensions necessarily proceeded more slowly..A complete scheme for the treatment of disabled men was considered and a provisional agreement arrived at. with the National Health Insurance Commissioners as far as outpatients treatment was concerned but the ratification of the agreement was delayed until the question of inpatieht treatment was decided by the War Officer     It was the unanimous view of the Committee that men should be retained in the Army until active treatment was completed.     The War Office, however,- finally   decided that they were unable to agree to the suggestion and delay in the full solution of the problem, resulted from this.The schemes for training first put forward by local Committees were put back by the detailed examination necessary to ensure their not resulting in the overstocking of particular trades with semi-skilled labour and schemes for employment were largely dependent on training schemes.
3. In tile meantime the unsatisfactory nature of theold Royal Warrants with regard to penoiono and complaints of theVay in which they were administered resulted in the appointment of a Pensions Minister and the introduction of a.hill on the 14th November, 1916, into the House of Commons to create a Pensions Department.     The relations between tho Pensions Minister and the Statutory Committee were much discussed in the debates on that bill.     It originally provided that the Minister should take over the work of the Committee connected with the supplementa-tion of pensions\ leaving to&quot;them their full powers in all other respects, e-go, the supplementation of separation allowances, the making of grants or allowances where no separation allowances&apos; were payable or where by accident they had not been paid, the determination of various matters of factr the making provision for   the health, training and employment of disabled officers and men,,etc.     In the course of the discussion much was said by some members for leaving to the Statutory Committee their full powers and something by others for taking away all these powers.     The general feeling in the Commons appeared to be that the Committee should continue their functions under the control of the Minister and though there was some slight opposition by the f tends of the Committee both in the Commons and lordsto the   exercise of this control it is provided for by Section 3 of the Act as it passed on the 22nd December, 1916.     The section also provides for the Committee giving to the Minister advice and assistance.4. .       The manner In which the advice and assistance Were to be rendered to .the Minister and in which he was to control the Committee in the exorcise of their powers and duties was settled at a Conference on the 16th January, 1917.     The terms of this settlement are given in Appendix II to this note.5. ;       Those terms have been loyally carried out by the Statutory Committee but they, have failed to cover the full control that circumstances have forced on the Ministry. The Royal Warrant and Order in Council of the 29th and *&apos;&quot;-30th March respectively, in addition to absorbing and superseding the regulations of the Statutory Committee with regard to supplementary pensions and to obviating the need for most of those under which special allowances have been granted where no - state pensions are awarded, have also given effect to the wishes of Parliament that the Minister should have power to make, generous financial provision for the treatment and training of disabled men. It has been mainly in arranging for the exercise of this power that I have undoubtedly trenched on the functions of the Statutory Committee and I have convinced myself that in the interests of the early decision of the many-insistent problems with regard to them it is essential&quot;that I should do so in the future.   The Committee having cstab-lished local machinery and prescribed the conditions for its
working the problems which arise from clay to day all over the country can he more easily and quickly dealt ^i-th hy a permanent staff than by sub-committoos and sections of sub-committeos and for&apos;my control over the Committee directing these bodies it is necessary that there should be substituted control over executive officers&quot;actually in communication with tho local Committees.   In the visits to different parts of the country Chichi have made with a viet? to informing&quot;myself of the different aspects of the treatment and training questions I have been in.personal communication \7itli very ma:iy representatives of these local committees and I aid satisfied that, as stated in the Statutory Committee*s letter to tho ;?rimo Minister there&apos; should be only one centred, authority to &quot;which they should look for guidance and control.&apos;This is a main consideration moving..me -fo press the -acceptance of the Statutory Commit tee * s&quot; proposal but^: truTCTTfc rigHr&quot;W&quot;&amp;dd that action taken ana contemplated by me to hasten and extend the Statutory CommitteeTs plans for adding to the facilities for institutional treatment and for making the training facilities which exist at certain places available over wider areas than those of local committees, have contributed both to.the desire of the Statutory Committee to transfer their powers and of myself to accept that transfer and so regularize the&apos; position,6. The transfer if agreed upon should cover all the powersand duties of tho Statutory Committee oxcept the administration of those grants which are referred to in the Committee1s letter of the 19th April as differing in char act or. from those&apos; ordinarily administered by a department, of Mie Government and in no way covered by tho Royal V/arrant or Order in Council, such as those now made where no assistance can &quot;be &quot;given out of public funds and also those for the education of the children of disabled or deceased soldiers or sailors.   I agree with the Statutory Committee.1 s views that the - administration of these grants should after the;transfer be entrusted to the Hoyal Patriotic lim&amp; Cor-poration (subject to such reconstitution of their personnol as may bo considered&apos; necessary)&apos;- ,if they are r;idling to undertake it, but it mil probably bo thought desirable that the funds should be provided by an annual statutory grant for a fixed number of years which would be a. charge on the vote of the Pensions Ministry rather than from a capital sum taken from the  1,000,000 placed at the disposal of tho Statutory Committoe under Section 1 of the Baval and Military &quot;.?ar &quot;tensions otc, Act 1916.- -    50,000 a year for five years suggests itself as a suitable amount, for the annual grant but further investigation rail be necessary before-, any decision can be como to in this matter.5Jho&apos;further proposal of tho Statutory Committoe that the funds in their possession which were voluntarily subscribed for specific purposes might also be transferred tc the Hoyal Patriotic .-?und Corporation to bo administered by that body, seeis suitable.7. The CommitteeT s lot tor of the 19th April refers -to theexperience gained by&apos;Members of the statutory Committee or of tho  ub-Committoos being placed at my disposal after the transfer. This offer -which is made also in generous&quot; terms in various letters from members that have been shown to mo is very valuable and I should giro pose to have      advisory Committeos constituted from theso members.;.&quot; Yjhile.it&apos; is not essential that &quot;the Bill..dealing with tho transfer should refer to the Committee, it mav.be advisable that it should lay doxm that if any Committee is constituted to advise in connection with tho duties transferred, it should have on it v;omen and representatives of labour and of the Departments .of-Government ooncerned which should bo specified.
(-Initialled)     (J-1T.B.Ministry of tensions. 10th May, 1917.t8. I have boon given to understand that tha StatutoryCommittoG will give eyory assistance they can in passing the legislation embodied by their proposal to transfer their functions and in these-circumstances I do not anticipate there will be difficulty in this.       The&apos; Committee somewhat over-estimate the rate at which the re-assessment of the pensions of sailors and soldiers and their dependents under the new Warrant and Order in Council are proceeding and for some time to come my Department will be&apos; very much occupied by work in connection with those warrants and with others still under preparation to deal with officers and tho families of officers and nurses, with sailors and soldiers who suffered in consequence of previous wars, and with soldiers of other -than-,British units.   She proposed legislation which should provide for the date of tho transfer of powers and duties being fired by Order in Council should not however bo delayed pn account of this work, and as soon as the transfer of power bill is passed, arrangements will be made for an increase to the Committee1 s staff7 v/hich seems to me very necessary but - -in. existing circumstances will be difficult, and its amalga-jnation with the staff of the,-Ministry.   The o:icaot date for th transfer may be left for future consideration.9. l&apos;,rith the lojral eo-o-poration which I know wo shallreceive from Mr. Cyril Jackson, the Yice-Chairman of the Coromitteo, I foroseo no special administrative difficulty in.tho transfer beyond thikt involved In all matters of administration at the present time by the want of trained staff..    The existing staff of the Statutory Committee, will of course be taken over and their secretary placed in a .  position of not. less valuo than that which he nov; occupies.The finding of a suitable position in the Civil korviccor otherwise for Mr. Cyril Jackson whose appointment&apos; as Vice-Chairman at the commencement of 1915 was for 3 yoars, and who has done-very valuable service for His Majesty^ government will require their careful consideration.
Letter from the Secretory to theSTATUTORY G OMIT TEE to the PRIME MINISTER.WAR PENSIONS &amp;-c , STATUTORY COl^ITTEE.22, Ahingdon Street,8.W. 1.19th April,  1917.Sir,I am directed by the War Pensions &amp;c. Statutory Committee to state that they have carefully considered their present position and the way in which the functions entrusted to them by the Naval and Military War Pensions &amp;c. Act,  1915,  can best be performed, regard being had to the establishment of the Ministry of Pensions.    They have come to tho conclusion that in the public interest and also in that of those for whose benefit the Statutory Committee were constituted it is desirable that their functions should,  subject to the necessary modifications, be transferred to the Minister of Pensi ons.Accordingly at their meeting to-day they passed a Reso-lution to this effect,  and directed that copies of it should be sent to you and to the Pensions Minister.The Resolution is as follows:-&quot;That in the opinion of the Statutory Committee the time has arrived when their functions under the 1,1 aval and Mili-tary War Pensions &amp;c . Act 1915,   should,  subject to the necessary modifications, be transferred to the Minister of Pensions,&quot;As you are aware* the Act of 1915 was passed &quot;to make better provision as to the pensions, grants and allowances made in respect of the present war to the officers and men in the Naval and Military Service of His Majesty and their de-pendants,  adn the care of officers and men. disabled in conse-quence of the present war, and for purposes connected there-with&quot;,  and it provided for the constitution of tho Statutory Committee with a view to giving effect to the objects of the Act.The members of the Committee willingly accepted appoint-ment, and they have done their best to carry out their functions and to further the interests of those for whose benefit the Act was passed.   Under Schemes sanctioned by them, more than 300 Local Committees have been established for the purposes of the Act; they have, with the approval of the Treasury,  framed Regulations under which supplementary separation allowances are paid by the Local Committees; further Regulations have been made by them which have formed the basis of the new Royal Warrant and Order in Council relating to Pensions and Grants, and they have done, much work with regard to arrangements for&apos; the treatment,  training and employment of disabled men.
2.40 JThe passing of the Ministry of Pensions Act 1916, which provides that the powers and duties of the Committee shall he exercised under the control and in accordance with the instructions of the Minister of Pensions, and subsequently deveiopoments have entirely altered their position.There is a very cordial fooling between the Committee and the Minister, and thoy hove done everything in their power to assist-him at the outset of his work.     They fool, however, that the present position is anomalous, and that the functions now shared between the Minister and themselves would in the future be best carried out by him alone. They think that it is impracticable, without grave incon^ venience, that they and also the Minister should deal with tho same matters;    they consider that there should be undivid-ed responsibility, and that there should be only one Central Authority to whom the Local Committees should look for guidance and control.Legislation will of. course be necessary to give effect to these proposals, and the Statutory Committee would urge that such legislation should be obtained as soon as possible as some timo must be taken up in the requisite transitional arrangements,The Committee understand that the reassessments of the pensions of sailors and soldiers and thoir dependants under tho Order in Council and tho Royal Warrant will have been finished by the ond of Juno, and that tho corresponding documents relating to officers are nearly ready,    Thoy do not aosire to relinquish their functions until the arrange-monts of the Pensions Minister arc completed and they can fool assured that no hardship could result from thoir retirc-mont to any of those who receive grants under thoir Regulations.It would be essential to secure that-the persons who have now, or may hereafter have, interests under the Regulations of the Statutory Committee should be safeguarded so that such persons may in no way be prejudiced by the alteration in the arrangements *     This specially applies with respect to grants made where no allowances or pensions are payable out of public funds, and also to those for the education of the children o^&apos; deceased or disabled officers and men.These grants differ in character from those ordinarily administered by a Pepartment of the Government, and are in no way covered by the Royal Warrant or   the Order in Council, and the fact that they may be given has been somewhat widely made known&apos;.It nay be found desirable that the administration of these grants should be entrusted to the Royal Patriotic Fund Corporation, who already carry out kindred work, if they are willing to undertake it, and that a capital sum of suitable amount should be transferred to them from the sum of  1.000,000 placed at the disposal of the Statutory Committee under Section 1 of the Naval and Military War Pensions &amp;c..(Expenses) Act, 191&amp;, .The Statutory Committee are in possession of some funds voluntarily aubscril-ed for specific purposes, and they suggest these too might be transferred to the Royal Patriotic Pund Corporotion, and be administered by that
Body, particularly as in some instances the funds were derived from them..The Committee presume that provision would &quot;be made for the transfer to the Pensions Ministry of their staff/ whose interests they would wish to have safeguarded.     Ih particular they would desire that their Secretary should he placed in a position of not less value than that which he now occupies.I am directed to add that if the Minister of Pensions at any time feels that the experience gained &quot;by Members of the&quot;Statutory Committee or of their Sub-Committee3 would he of service to him it would be freely placed at his disposal.The Statutory Committee-have sent a copy of this letter to.the Minister of Pensions, and they hope it may be found practicable to give effect to their wishes.   -I am, &amp;c.,( signed)...........Secretary.
., APPENDIX II, -0- &apos; . . -DECISIONS OF CO&amp;gTlRBITCE HELD ON JANUARY 15TH.1917.   . ^^JgJLJ^e,rJg^lfflffM1.13.1 s.^ry and. tho Statutory Oommfrttee.^(1.) The assistance to be rendered to the Ministry ofPensions under Section 3 of the Ministry of Pensions JSct of 1916, will include the administration of those parts of the proposed Royal Warrants and Orders in Council which deal with matters other than the award of flat rate pensions and allcw-ances,     This administration will be in accordance with Regulations end instructions to bo drawn up by the Statutory Committee in consultation with the Minister of Pensions and to be approved by the Minister.     The Statutory Committee will also furnish the Minister with such periodical returns as he may require to acquaint himself with the manner in which the Royal Warrants etc., are working.(z) Communication with the Local Committees for thepurpose of the administration referred to in the preceding paragraph will (not withstanding the powers given to the Ministry under Sectio2i 4 of the Ministry of Pensions Act of 1916) be conducted through the Statutory Committee who will arrange for the re-examination of any individual case&apos;or the reconsideration of any general matter which the Minister may request and will, if necessary, place before him all the information that may be available to them with regard to any such case or matter.(3) The control by the Minister of Pensions of theStatutory Committee in the exercise and performance of their powers and duties will as regards Section 2 of the Act of 1915 consist in giving directions after consultation with the Statutory Committee, in any case in which there may be a difference of moment between a Local Authority and the Statutory Committee.     The Statutory Committee will, moreover, keep the Minister informed of the Local Committees that have been or are being established from time to time and of thoso that are carrying out their functions.(4) The control of the Minister of Pensions under Section 3of the Act of 1915 will be exercised as regardsSub-Section 1(b) Through the submission to the Minister for his observations of all regulations prior to their issue.Sub-Section (c) (d) (e).   Through the submission to the Minister for his information of periodical returns showing the number of different classes assisted and the nature and extent of this assistance.As regards Sub-Section 1 ( 3) it is proposed that the Ministry shall be represented on the Statutory Committee and on its Disablement Sub-Committee.(.5) The functions of the Statutory Committee with regardto the other matters included in Section 3 (1) will be carried out. as at present, but generally the Statutory Committee will keep the Minister of Pensions informed of all proposals of importance coming before them and of all matters connected with their work of which, in view of his responsibility under the Ministry of Pensions Act of 1916, he ought to have cognisance.(.6) As regards fpids, all disbursements in accordance withRoyal Warrants etc. and Regulations thereunder will be made by the Minister of Pensions from his Vote and will be accounted for by his Department.     The Statutory Committee will be responsible for all ether payments made by them or in accordance with their instructions whether they are made from funds at their disposal in accordance with the present system or from an annual vote or
(in the ease of supplementation cf Separation Allowances) from the Vote of Credit..    An annual payment should he made from the Vote of the Minister of Pensions on account of the work carried out for his Department &quot;by the Staff of the Statu-tory Committee.     The staff will he entirely under the management of the Committee with direct access to the Treasury S3 to numbers and salaries.     Prom the date on which the new Warrants etc. come into force any payments made by the Statutory Committee which will be covered by them will be repaid to that Committee.     The foregoing financial arrangements to be submitted to the Treasury for thoir consideration.(7) llothing in any of the foregoing arrangements canof course diminish the powers of the Minister of Pensions under the Act of 1916.     It is, however, his intention to consult with the Statutory Committee from time to time as may be necess-ary with regard to the exercise of those powers.
