TILLAGE PROPOSALS IN SCOTLAND SEASON 1918. MEM)RANDUE BY BOARD Of AGRICULTURE FORs60TLAHDiThe possibilities of increased food production are much less in Scotland than in England and Ireland,    Up to 1891 the cultivated area of Scotland continued to increase and though it declined from that date yet in 1916 there were only 86,000 acres less in cultivation than in 1887 and only 141,000 acres less than in 1901 when the maximum was reached.    But although the land continued to be cultivated the-fall in the price of cereals was met by lengthening the rotation with the result that the area actually producing crop apart from temporary pasture had declined in 1914 by 280,000 acres as compared with the maximum year,    liuchj but not all of this land can be brought into crop.     Apart from the mountain grazings, which form the greater part of the total area, the amount of permanent- pasture is one tenth of that in England and is chiefly confined to (a) the edges of the arable cultiva--tion where it runs up to the foot hills of the Grampians: (b)   the mixed arable and sheep breeding counties where the original moorland lias become poor /?rass land at a high elevation: - (c)   the dairying districts of the South West -also originally moorland.&apos;*^w^ the quality and elevation of much of this grass--land it would be unprofitablo to turn it into arable.Nevertheless,, small areas of suitable character can be restored to cultivation in all these districts and these combined with the shortening of the present rotation in many arable, counties should provide an increased cropping area of 250,000 uo 300,000 acres.This
This need not. represent the ultimate limits of increase as still more intensive cultivation of the arable land now in six or seven year rotation and the provision of many more allotments in the neighbourhood of country towns and villages can be aimed at.kost of the 250,000 or 300,000 acres would be sown in oats in 1918 but a small proportion would be planted with potatoes and the allotments would be chiefly devoted to the latter crop.In addition to this programme it would be passible by draining and liming,to bring a further considerable acreage into crop, but draining on the large scale necessary is impracticable during the War.To carry out the extension of cultivation the following are the requirements:-LABOUR:    The retention of all regular workers now in occupation other than those who may be released for the Army under the arrangements recently adjusted between the Scottish Command and the Board.Special supplies of military labour for seasonal work in the spring and autumn.TRACTORSi   The provision of 250 tractors of the present types, or 300 of the light Ford type if available.HORSES:   Owing to the hilly and stony nature of much of the available crass land, horses are more important than tractors, and at least 2,000 additional draft horses will be required.FERTILISERS:   Adequate supplies of phosphate, rock and sulphuric acid are necessary and to insure that the limited supplies of all fertilisers are apportioned in such manneras
as to secure the /greatest increase of food a central body representative of each of the national agricultural departments should be set up as an executive distributing authority.MEAL MILLS:   Provision must be made for the repair or renovation of oat meal mills in certain outlying rural districts in order to secure locally the benefits from the increased acreage of oats.IMPLEMENTS:   Larger numbers of ploughs, harrows, cultivators and sheaf binders will be required and can only be obtained if manufacturers are provided with the necessary labour and materials.ORGANISATION: The Committees which have undertaken the extension of cultivation during the past winter have worked efficiently and with good will, but a more extensive organis--ation is absolutely necessary for the new programme.    It is proposed to sub-divide the Committees and their functions, appoint many more executive officers, and secure by means Of local coBoaittees such a close survey as will leave no farm untouched.    The local and smaller committees will be chiofly concerned with the economical and co-operative use of horses, implements and machinery and other materials of production.FINANCE:   A money grant for payment of executive officers and general administration and inspection will be necessary.    An advance for the purpose of loans to committees for tho purchase of tractors, horses and implements will be required.    It may also bo necessary to purchase fertilisers and seeds for small holders and allotment holders in advance by way of loan.
