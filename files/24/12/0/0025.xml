SECRET. G.T. 625.OPERATIONS.General Hanbury Williams to C.I.G.S. 1/5/17,1007. May 1st,  3-40 p.m.Eete day is being celebrated here today. Precession of red flags etc.    Civilians,   soldiers, German and.Austrian prisoners marching all together in the procession.   Officers are all wearing red ribbons.   I consider it would be well to convey hint to the Government that it is time they got to work to help our armies now fighting in Erance and elsewhere and losing their lives in the cause of Russia as well a3 of other allies.   Heanwhile work here does not progress as can well be imagined.
