ftSECRET,IDGCT,- 620WAR GABI NET.,CIRCULATED TO THE. KIgO &amp; WAR CABINST.FOREIGN OFFICE.bord Bertie, i       Paris,May1917.My Lord:-The moment has now arrived when it is essential that the Allied Governments, and more particularly His Majesty1s Government and the French Government, should enter into a frank and comprehensive discussion as to the attitude henceforward to he adopted towards Greece* with the object of terminating the present period of uncertainty, and ofelaborating, on definite and constructive lines, a future policy.His Majesty^ Government have viewed with increasing apprehension the failure which has in the past attended the endeavours of the Allies to adopt a concerted and conseeu-tive line of policy in Greece, and they feel that the incoherence which has so often mani-fested itself in the past has not only rendered ineffective the efforts of the Allied Powers to secure a final solution of the Greek question, but has caused this question.to attain a prominence out of all proportion to its practical importance and to constitute an outstanding menace to the present ana futureinterests/
interests of the Allies in the Eastern Mediterranean0I feel, therefore, that any ultimate solution by which the Greek problem can be relegated to its proper sphere in the diplomatic scheme of the Alliance, must in the first instance take full account of the mistakes which have been made in the past, and it is with this purpose that, before making any suggestions as to the means by which this solution may be attained, I propose to provide Your Lordship with a short summary of the events of the last ten months in order to show how essential it Is that no occasion should in future be admitted for the repeti-tion of those errors or of the circumstances by which they were producedeIt is not intended that the commentary which follows should be interpreted by the French Government as an indictment of French policy as opposed to the policy pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government:    I am well aware that the criticisms which I am about to make are based purely on our own aspect of the events under review, and that the French Government might contend perhaps with justice that their own action in Greece has been hampered and obstructed by the objections and hesitations of His Majesty1s Government,
I am not concerned to apportion blame between the two Governments but to show that the past policy of the Allies in Greece has been in fact lamentably ineffective, has produced chaos in Greece itself, has more than once threatened to shake the stability of the Alliance and has largely injured or destroyed the position and influence of the Entente Powers amongst the Greek people. These deplorable results have I believe been due to the absence of a fixed policy consis-tently carried out and if I state frankly the evils that have arisen it is not for the purpose of recrimination but to&apos;lay the foundation of a more satisfactory state of things in the future.In order clearly to consider the policy pursued during the past ten months by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Prench Government in regard to Greece, and to understand the underlying divergences which have from the first existed between them, it will be convenient to divide the period under review into three distinct phases.   The first of these phases would date from the acceptance by the Greek Government of the Allied Mote of the 21st June, and would terminate with the fall of the Sairais Cabinet on the 11th September.     The second phase wouldbegin/
begin with the Greek offer of alliance of the 4th September and would end with the disembarkation of the 1st December, while the last phase would cover the question from the Conference of Home to the date of my present despatch.During the whole of this period His Majesty&apos;s Government have been guided by the ultimate ideal of a united Greece, directed by a representative Government and a Constitutional King, and attaining by its own efforts and of its own free will to a full realisation of national Greek traditions and national Greek interests *During the first phase of the period His Majesty&apos;s Government had endeavoured to approximate to this ideal by giving a free scope to Mm Government of Mc 2aimis, and by fostering an atmosphere in which the elections which were then impending could be carried out without prejudice, and without either internal or external interference.   During the second phase His Majesty1s Government welcomed, the Greek offer of co-operation, and hoped to find therein a definite solution of the problem of Greek unity-which at that stage had become insoluble by any but radical means.   During the third and last phase His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment have been compelled by force of cireum-stances/
stances to abandon for the moment all hope of a united Greece and have concentrated their efforts upon securing unity In the policy of the Allies towards Greece, coupled with the security of the Armee d*Orient and a strict fulfilment of the demands of the Ultimatum of January 8th,It Is not quite certain whether the French Government have completely assented to this policy, or, if they have, have attached the same meaning to it as that given to it by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   It is still more doubtful whether it has commanded the sympathy of their supporters in France or the whole-hearted co-operation of their Agents abroad, with the result that its execution has been fatally marred by hesitation&apos;and uncertainty.It appears indeed that during the first of the three periods under review while His Majesty1s Government were making efforts to afford ALZaimis an opportunity of establishing his influence in the country and of gradually restoring normal relations with the -Entente Powers, French Agents in Greece were pursuing a different policy. It is not my desire to draw particular attention to the circumstances attending the Military Rising which took place at Salonica on September 1st, or to the hostile demonstration which was organised outside the French Legation at Athens,-but I must allude to the fact that it has beenfreely/
freely stated that both these events occurred with the knowledge, if not at the inspiration, of local French Officers.It is more in conformity with my present purpose to instance the action taken by the French Government at the end of August 1916, when acting on the advice of their agents they permitted the ifrench Admiral Commanding-in-Chief to despatch the Allied fleets to Salamis and to address a series of demands to the Greek Government which were of so drastic a nature that tho Saimis Cabinet were unable to survive the humiliation of acceptance.     She reason adduced for this action was the receipt ofreports from ffreneh Agents in Greece which Indicated an impending- descent of the GermanArmies upon SJhessaly in collusion with the Greek General Staff.     His Majesty8s Government do not deny that there may have been considerable sub-stance in these rumours, and that some definite action may have been essential, but I would observe that it had been decided at the Conference of Calais on August 24th to await confirmation of these reports before any forcible action was taken.     In spite, however, of this decision, the Jfrench Government appear within two days of the Calais Conference to have ordered the Allied fleets to Salamis, where the French Admiral took it upon himself to enter into direct negotiations with the GreekGovernment *. *
Government, with the result already stated,The second phase of the period now under review opened with the Greek offer of Alliance of September 4th and culminated in the landing of December 1st, and it was during this phase that tho underlying divergence which existed between the policies of the two Governments, and the confusion resulting from this diver-* gence, reacted to the greatest disadvantage of the Allied causeoSome few days before his resignation M0 Salmis had made, whether with the consent of his Cabinet is not quite clear, a tentativeoffer of an alliance between Greece and the Entente Power.-,     His Majesty&apos;9 Government, while realising that this might be a mere manoeuvre to gain time, considered that the offer pre-sented a favourable opportunity for securing a definite and creditable solution of the Greek problem, and they at once suggested to the $Tench Government that a reply should be returned asking King Constantine to declare war upon Bulgaria by a specified date, and to appoint a national Ministry to give effect to this declaration,     The French Government at first gave a somewhat hesitating assent to this proposal.    On the 80th September, however, they informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that
the creation of a Yeniaelist Government at Salonica had introduced an entirely new element into the situation, and that it was now preferable   that the King should declare war -upon Bulgaria of his own accord and without external pressure,     They suggested, therefore, that the proposed intimation should not be  -delivered^The evident disinclination of the , French Government to encourage these overtures of the Hellenic Government, coupled with such action on the partjof the French Admiral as the confiscation of the Greek Fleet and the increased demands which he proposed to make to the Greek Cabinet, let His Majesty1s Government to fear that the French Government, were eontemplating an Allied occupation of Athena, and Your Lordship was instructed on October 9th to warn them that it was essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed and have time to discusa any measures which the French Admiral proposed to take before the British forces under his command were committed to any drastic action.It appeared indeed that the Conference Of Boulogne which was held on October 20th would secure a certain unanimity of action and intention.     Unfortunately, however, thishope *,*,,
nope was not fulfilled*     She main decision come to at Boulogne was, that in reply to theGreek offer of alliance which had mean-while been confirmed &quot;by Dr, Lambros the Greek Government should be informed that the only way in which they could convince the Allied Governments of their good intentions would be by an immediate declaration of war on Bulgaria.     A Hots in this sense was handed to the Greek Minister in London on the BSrd October, but similar action was not taken in Paris;   and it was only, some days later that we learnt that M*Benazet&apos;s conversations with the  ing had induced the French Government to reverse the decisions come to at Boulognea From this moment the clear issue as to whether the Greek Government would or would not carry out their offer of alliance became oBscured by the negotiations initiated by M* Benaaet without the knowledge or consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and tending rather to reduce the Greek army to a position of impotence than to secure its co-operation as an AllyaHDhese negotiations of M. Benazet were, continued by General Roques on his passage through Athens.   They came to nothing, however and finally Admiral de Fournet on the 16th of November addressed to the Hellenic Governmentthe Note which led to the disembarkation ofDecember *,
December IstoIt is not my desire to lay particular stress upon the disastrous circumstances attending this disembarkation since the French Government have themselves seen fit to punish the Officer chiefly responsible for that most ill advised procedure..     I would observe, however, that it is a good example of the vice underlying the Allied dealings with this question.     &quot;here was practically no consultation between the Allies before the French Admiral took action and he throughout disregarded the views of the Allied Ministers in Athens relying entirely on the reports of Captain de Roquefeuil and other unofficial Agents with the very unfortunate consequences which are now^iotorious.She events of the 1st December placed the whole Greek situation on a fresh basis, and it then became necessary to abandon all hope of Greek unity, and to think only of presenting a united front and of obtaining adequate reparation and guarantees aFrom the first, however, this co-ordination of action was exceptionally difficultoIn addit: on to the difficulties caused by the divergencies of view between the\two Governments a special element of confusion was introduced by the position and actions ofGeneral
General Sarrail.   That distinguished officer has been accorded An addition to his military authority a political position which it has not beenjeasy to harmonise with that of the Allied representatives in Athens.      On several occasions he appears to 8a ve carried out or tried to carry out a policy entirely distinct from that of the Allies or even perhaps from that of the French Government.For instance8 as a result of the events of the 1st and 2nd December we learnt that General Sarrail was threatening   to bombard Athens and to take immediate military action.    His Majesty1 s Secretary of State therefore telegraphed to four lordship on the 10th December, uging that immediate instructions should be sent to General Sarrail not to take any such action, and was informed that he had been instructed accordingly.    On the 23rd December, however, Mr. Balfour again learnt thatGeneral S or rail was endeavouring to provoke a rupture, and, in reply to his protest, the French Government informed that of His Majesty that ths moment had come to give General Sarrail a &quot;free hand&quot;, as they had evidance of an impending military coup on the part of the Athens Government.As a result of this conflict of opinion a Conference was held in London, and it was decided/
to send Allied Military Commissions to Greece, who would report on the manner in which the Greek Government were conducting the promised evacuation.    If this report were unfavourable General Sarrail might then propose to the Allied Governments the coirse of action he considered necessary.On JJecjemher   the 30th, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government received information that General Sarraii was marching on Eoaani, having &quot;received a telegramfrom the French Minister which he construed as containing an ultimatum from the Greek Government&quot;.In reply to a request for an explanation of this departure from the decisions of the London Conference, the French Government, while making no mention of the Greek &quot;ultimatum&quot; alleged by General Sarrail, again stated that they hao&quot; - evidence of an impending Greek coup against the flank of the Arraee d&apos;Orient.Meanwhile the French Ambassador at Petrograd had read to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs a telegram from his Government to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been con-suited as regards this action on the part of General Sarrail0     It appeared that the Russian Government had also been furnished with a version of the London Decisions which /
appeared to be unintentionally misleading.In view of this extreme divergence of opinion it was decided to summon an Allied Conference at Borne, at which General Sarrail should be present in person, and it- is the decisions of this Conference Including the ultimatum of January 8th which now govern the situation.It cannot be said however, that the decisions of the Home Conference have produced the effect which was anticipated.      A continual difference of opinion has manifested itself as to the interpretation to be given to the decisions of that Conference and as to the manner in which the terms of our ultimatum of January 8th were being fulfilled.        A condition of affairs has thus arisen under which His Majesty&quot; s Government are presented by their Military Commissioners in Greece with reports regarding the evacuation of the Greek Army which are not in accordance with those received by the French Government.   These latter are even sometimes at variance with reports issued by the French General.Headquarters of wh&amp;eh a striking example was given in the communication made by the French Ambassador on the 27th April,      Again, no unity of interpretationhas been maintained as regards the scope of /
the ultimatum of January 8th and the question whetherthe requirements of that ultimatum embrace the demandsof the previous Betes of December- 14th and 31st orwhether they should be regarded as Supplanting theformer requests. This divergence has beenparticularly unfortunate in treating such questionsas the raising of the Blockade, the institution ofthe Commission of Enquiry into the events of remember1st and End, ana       the attitude to be adopted by theAllied Governments towards spontaneous Tenizelistrisings in the Islands.     Incidents such as thosecannotwhich have occured at 2ante/but create the impression in the minds of the Greek Government that the Allied Powers are without a clear conception of policy andthat the vacillation which governs their actions is due, not only to there being no identity of pur-pose as between themselves, but to the existence of conflicting aims and interests among the several officials to whom the local execution of Allied policy is entrusted.His   Majesty1s Government have moreover recently been informed that French Officials in some of the Greek Islands have of late been expressing anti-Veniaelist opinions and it is to be feared that circumstances may arise in the near future which willdisplay a cleavage of /
opinion as to the policy to bejpursued not only towards the Government of Athens but oven towards the Venizelist movement itself.It will have been seen from the above commentary that the treatment of the Greek problem has been rendered inconsequent and ineffective owing to an essentials if unexpressed, divergence of policy and to the effect which this divergence hs-s produced upon the French executive officers in Greece.    Your Lordship will have observed that the Conference^of Calais, Boulogne, London and even Rome have failed to unify the actions of tho two Governments,       that the French Government has taken a view ofthe effect of the decisions arrived at different from ihat which approved itself to His Majesty&quot;s Government: that on several occasions the independent action of the French Commanders have exposed the Allied Governments to the risk, and in one instance to the humiliation, of a serious disaster; and that the Interaction of these several elements has produced an atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty which has proved fatal to the pursuance of any coherent policy.I am firmly convinced, therefore, that no improvement In the situation can be hoped for /
for unless a clearly defined policy is elaborated between the two Powers who are mainly interested in a solution of the Greek question.     I feel, moreover, that this solution must now be of a comprehensive nature and that the question must be approached without reserve if a repetition of the former ineffective methods of Allied policy is to be avoided.His Majesty&apos;s Government are therefore prepared to enter with an open mind into a frank discussion of this nature withthe French Govern-aient, and they trust that the latter will be willing to meet them with an equally frank exposition of their views and with an explicit statement of the ultimate aims which they desire to attain in Greece.I am of opinion that it should in the first in stance be clearly established that the governing consideration 13 the prosecution of the present war to a successful conclusion and that no question of the national aspirations in Greece of any one Power should be allowed to affect that consideration.I feel also that it is essential for military reasons, and in view of the vital proportions which have been assumed by the tonnage question, that the Allied commitments in Greece should not be increased and that on the contrary an ideal solution of the question/
would be one which carried with it the possibility of the reduction of these commitments which, I may add it is not unlikely may be imposed upon the Allies by the imperative necessities of the ship-ping situation.The removal of King Constantine whether by abdication or deposition, has been suggested as the only course likely to secure a final settlement of the problem8   It is desirable, however, before accepting such an idea, to discuss whether his abditffcion is likely to be obtained by peaceful persuasion, or in the event of his refusal what measures would be necessary to secure his deposition.As far as one is able to judge of the mentality of King Constantine, from the reports received from His Majesty&apos;3 Legation at Athena, it is not likely that His Majesty would willing ly resign the throne of Greece *   Owing to the successful campaign conducted by him against Turkey in 1912, his former failures and short-comings during the reign of King George have been forgotten, and he has been, and still is, regarded as a popular hero by the Greek Army. His reputation amongst them has undoubtedly been increased by the events of December 1st which, by the comparative impunity that he has since enjoyed,/
demonstrated to his Army and people his successful opposition to the Allies.    It is -clear that King Constantine&apos;s conduct in the past has been affected by a conviction of the eventual success of the Central Powers in the war, and now that it is being gradually brought home to His Majesty that this success is by no means assured, he has become more accessible to the demands of the Allied Powers.   Still his attitude towards the Allies is one that can inspire neither confidence nor sympathy and backed,  as he is by the Queen of Greece and by German influences in his entourage, it may be safely assumed that voluntary abdica-tion at the present time is an $dea which would meet in him with no response and would be resisted.The forcible deposition of King Constantine is a step which opens up a vista of difficulties and military commitments which, at this stage of the war, should make the Allies pause.   It is known that such a step would meet with resistance and it is difficult to foresee what the measure of it would be.   The statement has also been made that it would probably entail the massacre of foreigners and Venezelists in Athens and elsewhere.It is possible that the removal of King Constantine might be effected by a military &quot;coup de main&quot; directed against Athens   and
carried out by the Allied Military and Naval forces.   I am advised by the British Naval and Military Authorities that such action would entail the employment of o... divisions, and would monopolise tonnage, and its success would of course depend upon the maintenance of absolute secrecy in order to prevent the escape of King Constantine and a failure ofathe entire movement *Supposing, however, that it were possible to remove King Constantine in a comparatively short period and by the employment of relatively small forces which could then be released,  the problem would arise as to what arrangements should be made for the future governance of Greece.   It would be essential that whatever form of Government were established should command the willing support of the great majority of the Greek people.   In this connection the decision of the Conference re-cent ly held at St. Jean de Maurienne must be borne in mind.   It was there decided that the Allies would not foster any antidynastic or republican movement in Greece, and the (bbvious result of this decision is that King Constantino would, in the natural sequence of events be succeeded by his eldest son,  the Crown Prinee   In that eventuality every effort should be made to ensure the /
reunion of Greece by the formation of a con-stitutional Greek Government under the leader-ship of M. VenizeloseHis Majesty*s Government feel that the difficulty of securing this solution renders it questionable whether it would justify the employment of considerable forces that might be better employed elsewhere and the assumption of the large responsibilities v/hioh would be entailed BThe second alternative course which appears to His Majesty1s Government as more likely to be successful would be to afford to King Constantine a, further opportunity of showing himself prepared to co-operate with the Allies in restoring order and harmony in his countrye   The present moment is not inopportune for, arriving at a clear and concise agreement with King Gonstantine as to the policy which fehe Allied Governments desire him to adopt.   It would doubtless be possible to secure the fall of the present Cabinet find, the substitution of a Cabinet friendly to the Allies under the leadership of Monsieur Zaimis. If this solution were adopted it would be necessary to raise the existing Blockade as a pledge of confidence and as an earnest of our good intentions, and it would be essential
to afford the new Cabinet our loyal support and co-operation so long as it committed no aot such ad to diminish our confidence. At the same time it would be necessary to obtain the removal from Greece of M2&amp;. Goun&amp;ris and -Domaauis and possibly of M* Streit,   as well as of the leaders of the Reservist Leagues and any enemy Agents still remaining,   also that any arrangement made with King Constantino should be such as to provide His Majesty with a very precise idea of the policy which the Allied Powers expected him to maintain. It would at the same time be explained to King Constantine that no further opportunity would be accorded to him for justifying himself in the eyes of the Powers and that any unfriendly action on his part in the future would entail upon the Allied Powers the necessity of demanding his abdication in favour of his son and of enforcing that abdication by every means in their power.     It would also be necessary to define8 as far as possible, the nature of any action on the part of the Greek King or Government which would constitute a &quot;cause of complaint&quot;, and it would be clearly established that no action should be taken on such a &quot;cause of complaint&quot; arising, until the guaranteeing Powers had had opportunity to examine into thematter
matter and had agreed that action had in fact been rendered necessary.But it. is clear to His Majesty1 a Government that neither of these alternatives, nor any other, will avail to secure the object the Powers have in view without a complete change in the control and direction of the policy of the Allies in Greece. Hitherto the control of the military and naval operations in Greek territories and waters has been confided within certain limits by the Allies to the French General in command of the international forces at Salonica, and a PrenGh Admiral as Commander-in-chief in Greek waters.     It can hardly be said that the operations of General Sarrail,   which have assumed a political rather than a military aspect, have inspired the Allies with confidence while the action of the French Admiral then in command of the Haval forces was the cause of the catastrophe of December 1st, by which the Allies have lost both position and prestige, The truth is that these officers have in their strictly naval and military duties more than sufficient to occupy them and it is unfair to lay upon them the burden of political action as well.     It is therefore essential that the control of political affairs shouldbe
be entrusted to other hands and if we are to avoid the mistakes of the past some arrangement must be arrived at which will secure unity and vigour in their direction. The only way to secure these objects is for  -the Allied Governments to appoint a single individual as their political agent in Greece. Perhaps it would be sufficient to give to the representative at Athens of one of the Powers - a man of distinction specially chosen for the purpose - the same kind of predominance in the political sphere as has been accorded to General Sarrail in military matters.     The difficulty of the suggestion lies no doubt in the selection of the individual and especially in agreement as to his nationality. It will probably be agreed that owing to the remoteness of Russia from Athens and other circumstances a Russian representative would not be suitable.     Italy is not a guaranteeing Power and could therefore scarcely be asked to assume the leadership of those Powers who are in that position.     There remain France and England.     To appoint a Frenchman would be to put the whole control of Greece military and political into the hands of one power. That does not seem in itself very desirable. Moreover, it is useless to shut one&apos;s eyes to the fact that such a proposal would be bitterlyresented
necessaryresented In Italy *     Italian aspirations in the Eastern Mediterranean are well-known and the recent Asia Minor negotiations have shewn how tenaciously she struggles for equality of position in that region.    Further it is right to say that the actions and language of several of the French agents in Greece during recent months have raised a suspicion not confined to Italy that influential section of French opinion is anxious to utilise the present opportunities to secure for France something like the permanent protectorate of Greece.     For these reasons it seems to His Majesty1s Government impossible to ask a French representative to as sura e the chief political direction of Allied policy in Greece and if that be so there appears to be no other alternative to the appointment of a British official.    His Majestys Government recognise that objections may be felt to this course but they would point out that Great Britain has no exclusive national or political interest in Greece and that the maintenance of the chief military command in French hands -it would probably be necessary to appoint a British naval commander-in-chief - would effeotually prevent the pursuit of any British political aims if they existed other than that of securing the settlement of Greek affairs
R.C.necessary for the successful prosecutionOf the war.    That indeed is the sole purposeof the present proposal.I have to request Your Lordship to lay these ohserrations and suggestions before the Prench Government and to impress upon them that His Majesty5s Government are firmly convinced that the situation in Greece must no longer be allowed to act as an obstruction to the prosecution of the war or as a possible cause of friction between the Allies.    You should lay before the French Government our conviction that no solution is possible which has not the full support of the four Powers concerned, and that a qualified assent to any line of action could only lead to the reappearance of that divergence and inconais-tency which have rendered our policy so ineffective in the past *Finally His Majesty&apos;b Government are fully prepared to discuss and to consider with sympathy any solution which the French Government may wish to advance, and they desire only to be assured that if, and when, such a solution is accepted by the Allied Powers, it will command the entire and consistent support of the French Government, of the French Military and Naval Authorities and of their subordinates wheresoever situated,
