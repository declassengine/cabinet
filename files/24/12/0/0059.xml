REPORT FOR PERIOD FROM 27TH APRIL to 4TH MAY 1917.1. The work of revising pensions under the NewWarrant is steadily proceeding but from the manner in which it is necessarily being undertaken it will be the end of September before the great bulk of the re-assessments are completed.     For non-attributable and non-aggravated cases 470 pensions were granted during the week including&apos;50 to men whose claims to pension were previously rejected.   The total number of gratuities given under the New Warrant in these non-attributable cases now amount to 1240. 2. Progress in the re-assessment of Dependants&apos;pensions (Appendix I) has been accelerated during the week, 1,667 cases having been disposed of as against 1,130 last week.   500 Dependants have benefitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/lld a week; the remainder receive no benefit, their pensions being already equal to pre-war dependence.     3549 Dependants1 pensions have been re-assessed to date leaving 71,451 still to be done. In the matter of re-examination as to Entitlement (Appendix II) -(a) 151 widows cases have been disposed of during theweek.    98 widows who had been refused pensions have now been admitted under either Article 11 or Article 15;   49 aggravation (gratuit?/-) cases have been granted pensions under Article 11 and 4 claims have been finally rejected.(b) 70 Dependants&apos; have been admitted to pension or gratuity; none have been rejected during the week.(c) A total of 1,059 widows cases have now been re-examined. Of these 734 have been admitted to pension underArticle 11; 295 to temporary pension under Article 15; and 30 have been finally rejected.   Authority for payment is given in each caso as soon as the v/idow has completed thenecessary
necessary forms.   Only 645 widows causes now &quot;remain for re-examination.( d) A total of 474 Dependants rejected for defectiveentitlement have been admitted for pension or gratuity ano 10 have been finally rejected.    1,400 claims have, been set aside, the claimants having been found not to have been dependent on the deceased man.   300 mothers previously rejected because they were drawing separation allowance in respect of serving husbands have been admitted to pension and 200 parents rejected because of possession of Old Age Pension have also been admitted.    Only 435 Dependants&apos; claims now remain for re-examination.512 Grants of  3 have been authorised during the week, as against 340 last week.3. The draft Warrant for the retired pay of Officersdisabled, and for pensions to the families of Officers deceased, and for the pensions to nurses disabled, in consequence of the present war, was further revised on the 1st instant and formally submitted to the Treasury on the 3rd.   A copy of the draft forms Appendix III to this Report.     It is generally on the lines of the Warrant for Soldiers.   Eight degrees of didability are provided for, the pensions for the highest degree to Officers being somewhat and those to nurses being very much higher than the pensions for total loss of earning capacity under existing Warrants.   The present highest rates of Widows&apos; pensions are retained but these rates are to be given in death from disease and other cases in which an &quot;intermediate&quot; rate has hitherto been granted.   Alternative pensions are to be given to Officers and to &quot;idows of Officers with the same idea of maintaining the former standard of living as Is embodied in the menfs Warrant.Allowances
Allov/ances are to be paid on account of the children ofin cases of pecuniary- diseftsw, these children being treatred--in future on the same lines as the chii^ren of Officers1 Widows which remain much as before.   The provisions for Treatment and Training of disabled Officers and Nurses are similar Jo those for disabled soldiers except that it is proposed to grant actual medical expenses to a limited extent.   Slight impairment and     impairment not attributable to or aggravated by military service, are as in the case of men to be met by gratuities.   The restrictions in existing Warrants to the grant of pensions to the parents, brothers and sisters of deceased Officers are to be somewhat retained. V-4,      The Naval and Military War Pensions,  Administrative Expenses) Bill received its third reading in the House of Lords on the 1st instant- and the amendments made in that House were considered and agreed to by the House of Commons on the 2nd instant.     Pending the Royal assent which it is hoped will be given shortly, the Ministry in conjunction with the Local Government Board are circular!-sing Local   Authorities and Local Committees instructing them to prepare estimates of the administrative expenditure of Local Committees with a view to their submission tc the Local Government Board at the earliest possible date. In the meantime the regulations required %q be made under Clause 1 (4) of the Bill, for the payment of travelling expenses and compnsation for loss of remunerative time, have been drafted by the Ministry after consultation with the Local Government Boards of England, Scotland, and Ireland and the Statutory Committee   and have been   sub-mitted to the Treasury for approval.Officers in addition to the Education aJLlowanc-es given
5.     The National Insurance Amendment.. Bill received its third reading in the House of Commons on the 27th ultimo. In reply to Mr Hogge who raised the point Sir Edwin Cornwall gave an assurance on behalf of the Minister of Pensions that where a gratuity was paid under Clauce 2 of the Bill in place of a Pension to a discharged disabled man who was judged likely to be totally incapable of work for any period following his discharge the amount of the sickness lienefit which he would otherwise have received for that period would- be paid to him by way of a lump sum in addition to his gratuity.     The Bill passed its first and second readings and the Committee Stage in the House of   Lords, on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd instant with-out amendment and will receive its third reading on the 8th instant.6.        A statement of the work of the Statutory Committee forthethe week enaing/Snd .iay is annexed as Appendix IV,Satisfactory reports   were received as to the working of the Bristol Committee and Roclidale sub-Committee.     The Kerry Committee not having formed sub-committees have not yet got a proper grasp of their work.     Prom Birmingham as from other places have come pretests with regard to the unsatisfactory manner in which Class W men   are being dealt with by the T-ar Office.Training Schemes for Kent, Leicester and Fimbledon were discussed with the Committees of those localities and approved for the two. first named.     Schemes for Berks&apos;, Angle sea, and Bath have been received and are being considered.       The Northampton   Institute has been approved as a training centre for Electricity sub-Station attendants some little difficulty with the trade union interested having been surmounted.The Employment Department of the Board of Trade report that in the period iiarch 12th to April 30th. 638 openings for employment were submitted to 222 disabled officers but only a small proportion were acceptedThe
&quot; St^ivutoiy^ommit officers who applied to themare not easy t* place   the s alaries for which they ask being often in excess of what their qualifications justify.      The question of training facilities for officers beean&amp;Jt&apos;; therefore of considerable importance and will be taken into con-sideration by the Ministry.7.       On the 29t; jaltimo   the Minister visited Brighton for the purpose of fulfilling a number of engagement concerned with the training and treatment of discharged disabled Soldiers and Sailors. i.ir. Barnes was accompanied by the iParliamentary Secretary, Sir A. Griffith Boscawen, .i.Pt, and Sir Charles Nicholson, M,P., Chairman of the London Disablements Committee.       In the evening the ivilnisters addressed a well attended Conference of representatives of Local Y/ar Pensions Committees, and Trade and Labour Organisations, held in the Aquarium Hall.     The -layor of Brighton presided and those present included, lar. C. Thomas-Stanford, a,P.. llajor Chappele K.P.-. and the liayor of Hove.      The Royal Warrant and Order in Council y;ere explained; and a number of questions  answeroo On the 28th ultimo . the Minister visited the Brighton School of Art and Technical College, where several disabled Soldiers were undergoing training in sign-writing and mechanical drawing in the former and as fitters and turners in the latter institution which offers great facilities.Subsequently Ur Barnes visited a munition works employ-ing about 2,000 hands.      The Principals expressed their willing ness to receive and train disabled men and to provide them with regular employment afterwards.Later on the same day llr. Barnes inspected the Queen liar-^s Workshops situated within the grounds of the Brighton Pavilion kilitary Hospital.; where 550 limbless soldiers were under treatment and voluntary training.      About 100 men are being instructed in boot making, carpentry, electrical   trork, motor mechanics engineering and commercial subjects.     The men assembled on the lawn and were addressed on the provisions of the new rarrant.        The Minister answered a number ofquestions
Questions and. received from the men unmistakable evidence of their opinion that the loss of the right arm   should constitute   a higher degree of disability than the loss of a leg.     At the conclusion of the proceedings- the men warmly approved the new pensions scales,On the s ame day the Minister visited the French gardens   at patcham and discussed the question of extensive culture as a means of livelihood for discharged soldiers and sailors..On Sunday the 29th ultimo Ur Barnes visited the Brighton Borough Sonit6rium., Bear Hill,     This Institution has accommodation for nearly 100 tuberculous cases and the present inmates includes several discharged soldiers,     The Minister found these premises capable of considerable extension,3.     Appendix V shows the Classification of the disabilities for whioh r:arrant Officers, Hon-Commissioned Officers and men who had been discharged from the Army since the beginning of the Tar up to the 30th April, 1917.     It shows that in 7876 cases (including frost-bite eases) there had been amptutations of legs,   arms, feet or hands up to the same date 0805 artificial limbs had been supplied or were on order making an increase of 618 during the month a number of these having been furnished to men not yet discharged.     5971 undischarged ;.ien had had limbs amputated but had not yet been fitted with artificia limbs, 1046 were re ady to be so fitted at Koehampton,     409 men were admitted to hoehampton House during the month and 425 men discharged from it fitted with limbs,3,     Luring April 5.0 men were admitted to the Blinded Soldiers and Sailors. Hostel, St. Duns tans, Legents Park,    and 14- were discharged. :&quot;Tom the beginning of the T&apos;ar to the end of the month the number ad-;dtted was 597&apos; of whom 228 had passed through.     Of this number 192 ;1ad been fully trained and set up for themselves and the remaining 06 owing to mental or physical disability had left without being Set up.       On the 1st Hay   369 men were in St. Dunstanfs
St. Duns tan1 s or its various annexes *     100 blind cases werestill in Hospitals ready to &quot;be s ent, to St, Duns tans *As a result of a conference between the authoritiescf St. Dunstan1a Hostel, London, and Newington House, Edinburghan agreement- confirmed by the Minister has been come to by whichthe latter establishment is recognised as the National In-stitution for the training of the blind soldiers and sailors forScotland,     A copy of this agreement is annexed as Appendix VIto this Report.The Minister is prepared to sanction the starting of asimilar institution for Ireland but is generally of opinionthat the care of the blind is fortunately; not such a big matterifthat it cannot be centrally undertaken and that/so undertaken in two or three National Institutions: working in close cooperation with each other the work of treatment, training and   aftercare can be more effectively carried out than in a number of insti-tutions distributed over the Kingdom.     It is therefore not his   intention to support- suggestions that similar arrangements-to those with Nev/ington House should be made with other insti-tutions.10.     Table 1 shows that 10*97-3 new pensions, including chil-dren&apos;s allowances were granted during the week, against.   10.992 in the previous week the Awards to soldiers having slowed down and that to dependants of soldiers having been accelerated. The average total in April, omitting the Easter days was about 10,850.     Since the beginning of the !;ar up to the 2nd instant 617,379 pensioner   - including childrenls allowances have been granted.Table II shows that last week *JF&amp;. grants of supplementary pensions and childrenfs allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 17&apos;6- in the previous week and that the total number to date is 3684.11.     The monthly report on forfeitures etc.,    of   widows pensions gives the following figures:-During April

In all these the widowo was awarded and periodical reports will he obtained where necessary.12.

In the case of such persons whose claims to retired pay, pensions or gratuities have been dealt with or arose under previous Warrants the terms of this Our Warrant may, if more beneficial to them, be applied with retrospective effect from the Ebove date, on such dates as Our Minister of Pensions may find it practicable and convenient to re-assess their claimsin

WAR PENSIONS, &amp;c., STATUTORY COMMITSREPORT TO THE PENSIONS MINISTER.3?or week ended 2nd May, 1917.ORGANISATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors of Accounts etc.Our Inspector reporting on the 3ristol Local Committee states that the various Divisions of Bristol are very important. After obtaining details of the general working from the Local Committee^ Secretary, he visited three of the most important centres on the days of distribution.     The workers are mostly those people who formerly carried&apos;on the work of the Soldiers1 and Sailors1 Families Association, whilst the applicants generally get the full benefit of the Regulations.     A suggestion was made by the Divisional President that an Enquiry Officer should be appointed to investigate cases of Supplementary Pensions, as it is thought&quot;that the enquiries made by the ordinary visitors are inadequate, and it seems to be the general opinion that a large saving would be effected.Our Inspector reporting on Rochdale Local Committee says the work is carried on at - a&apos;Central Office and Sub-Committees meet frequently and all payments are duly authorised.   Disabled men receive careful attention but very few payments are made as the pension is supplemented generally by the ITational Health Insurance,     Ee examined a fair number of case papers and found the payments to be in order.. Our Inspector reporting on ICerry Local Committee states that the Local Committee consists of 30 members but no Sub-Committees have been formed and it would be well if this were done, for though at present the work is light, when It increases Sub-Committees would be of great assistance to the Local CommittseThere are 36 cases of disabled and discharged soldiers. Some of these have obtained employment but there is a consider-able number more who if trained could do work of one sort or another.The following has been received from the Birmingham Local Committee:-&quot;While my Committee are willing to assist Army Reserve men who fall ill from their local fund   they do not feel that they should be called upon to support them during the time that elapses between their transfer, and the date on which they receive wages and they feel that the refusal to assist these cases, which they are satisfied are quite genuine, brings discredit upon the Local Committee11.The following Resolution was passed on the 24th April:-&quot;This Committee protests against the action of the War Office in transferring men from the Colours to Class W and W (T) Army Reserve without making provision for their maintenance
and that of their families until there is a reasonable prospect of their receiving wages from civil employment,     This Oomitte^ urges that the Army Council should make suitable monetary allowances to prevent the soldier (and if married, his family) from suffering&quot;the hardship whioh at present exists in cases 6f this class&quot;.DISABIEMBIITS BRAITCH. RepQrt Qf the Training and Employment Section.1*    The Section have approached the War Office ashing whether in view of the work which is being dene, they will allow the training^at Cork and the Tipperary Command Depots to continue until the accommodation at the Command Depot is actually required and to ascertain whether the Tipperary Local War Pensions, &amp;e,, Committee can make other arrangements to carry on the training.2,   Meetings have been held between the Representatives of the Statutory, Committee and the Local Committees for Kent, Leicestershire and Wimbledon,     The training proposals of Leicestorshire and Wimbledon have been approved with certain modifications and the Section&apos;await further detailed informatisn from the Kent Local Committee,3,    .Ihe Section have considered the proposal of the Swindon Local Committee to train men in the metal plate industry basket-making and light wood-work,    Y/ith regard to the first named no more men tther than the two er three already in train-ing are to be trained until the matter has been arranged with the Local Trades Union,     The training in the other two trades has been apprtved,4,   It has beon reported to the Section that certain over-lapping has occurred in the payment of grants for maintenance by the Ministry of Munitions (Training Section) and the Statutory Committee in the cases of men undergoing training for munitions work, the errangements laid down in the Statutory Committee1g Circular No, 23 having been departed from by the Ministry of Munitions,     The matter has been taken up with the Ministry of Munitions and the arrangement is under re-consideration.5,   The Section have approved the Northampton Institute as a Training Centre for Electricity Sub-Station Attendants,6,   The Section have laid ctewn general principles govern-ing the selection of disabled men for clerical work, viz, that they shall have been educated until at least the age&quot;of sixteen in a secondary school or a school of a simiS&amp;r class, and that they shall be trained for good clerical positions and not merely as typists and shorthand writers,7,   The Section have received and are considering Train-ing Schemegfrom the Local Committees for Anglesey, Berkshire and Bath,8.
