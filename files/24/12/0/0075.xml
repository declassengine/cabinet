16MOTOR    SPIRIT.The situation with regard to Motor Spirit lias become very serious recently.    Certain tank steamers have &quot;been lost through the action of enemy submarines, and in consequence of this and of the increasing military requirements for motor spirit in Prance, the supplies held for Army use abroad dimin-ished, and the deficiency has been made up by the Army drawing largely on the stocks in this country.   The consequence is that the stock available for military, naval and civilian needs here, including the carriage of munitions and food, has fallen to less than a month1s supply, apart from the possibility of the Army making a further call on the stocks in this country.If no further boats were lost, this position would be serious enough, but in the event of further loss the position would be extremely critical, and the gravest incouYBnience would be caused if drastic restrictions have to be put in force, of which the effects cannot be fully foreseen.As new licences for motor spirit are issued, supplies for such purposes as taxi-cabs, omnibuses and commercial cars will be restricted, whilst private motor cars, unless used for some essential purpose, will get no supply at all.Further steps will be necessary, which present great difficult ties and I suggest that somounsmber    of the War Cabinet should be appointed to take the matter in hand in conference with representatives of the IJepartments concerned and to decide en the action to be-adojrted.A. H. S^8/5/17.
