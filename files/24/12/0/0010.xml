CLEAR THE LINE.OPERATIONS..SECRET,From G..O.Cin-CSalonika to C.I.G.S.30.4.1917.4,20 p.mG,C. 7.   Your 33491 April 30th,    4 p.m.Having regard to the express wish conveyed hy the War-Cabinet to the French Government that an early offensive should take place on this front, (vide War Office cipher 32,805 Cipher, dated April 16th).to the fact that great stress was laid by Sarrail on the importance of this attack.. smd in particular to the fact that my instructions are to give the French all support possible, I did not consider I had any justification for taking further action than to impress upon Sarrai-1 my view ^ that the attacks of the Allied forces here should as far as possible be synchronised,,    This he stated to be contrary to his views.    Although on this point we differed, I had, I thought, no good grounds for reference to the War Cabinet, especially as my troops had been waiting since the first week in April in readiness to attack, rumours of the Impending attack were reaching the enemy, and I had grounds for believing that reinforcement;:, of men and artillery were on the way to oppose my attacks I saw, moreover, that any objection on my part would provide material for further delay, which was contrary to the wish of the War Cabinet,    In addition- 1 Sarraii had stated in writing that operations would commence on April 26th and it was not until after my attack on April 24th. that I learned they had been postponed until April 28th.    My French and Servian liaison officers report   that, owing to recent very bad weather and deep snow, the commencement of operations has been impossible.   This fact was communicated, to me on April 28th. by Sarrail, when I was informed that operations on the Monastic- front had been put off until further orders.\
The leaders of both the Frenoh and Servian armies in the field seem determined to de their best, and are -confident of a limited success, being hopeful that the Bulgarian Army will be broken up by a hard blow.I have just returned from an interview with Sarrail., to whom I conveyed the views expressed in your telegram.-   He states that, apart from the ?/eather, his operations would already have been begun.     Should the weather continue good, artillery preparation will begin on May 2nd, or 3rd, infantry attack following in the course of throe or four days,.     On my request for further information, as to future plans and possibilities, he expressed a hope that the Bulgarians would crack, and that he would be able to clear Ivlonastir and push the Servians north into the Vardar valley, thus assisting me to advance.     As he appeared to show uncertainty, I pressed him ,for further information.     He thereupon said that the hurrying an of the offensive was due to instructions from the French Government to prevent withdrawal from this area, that he could not furnish me with any definite idea as to the future scope of his operations, but that their primary objeot was to cloar the Bulgarians from the neighbourhood of Monastir.   Of necessity he had no intention of pushing on as far as Prilep, but having cleared L-Ionastir by the action of the troops in the CERNA loop and the Serbians to the eastward, he may be forced to take up a strong defensive position Y/hich could be held by smaller number of troops.This measure may bo imposed on him by (a) difficulty in filling up losses (b) attitude he may have to adopt towards Greece.   Ho has received instructions that the Poy/ers have decided to dethrone Constantine, and measures will consequently, have to be taken against Thassaly.     He would first employ territorial troops and cavalry, and subsequently active troops taken from the defensive line already mentioned.He
He further considero that four or five days after- the commencement of hie attack he will he in a better position to foresee the future &quot;but has no intention of carrying on operations in the hot weather after May,I learn frcm other sources that some battalions are being held back for operations in Thessaly,, ostensibly to prevent royalists capturing the grain crop, which is, it is stated, sufficient to supply the allied armies.I should be glad to know if you have any fresh instructions for mie,     Sarrail desires continuation of my offensive, which he hopes will draw men from the Monastir front, which ifc undoubtedly should do; to do so, however, will&apos;involve severe fighting and losses.,
