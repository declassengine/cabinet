ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH.9th May 1917 .Sir,INCREASED   FOOD   PRODUCTION1 am directed &quot;by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to express their thanks to your Committee and yourself for the efficient national service they and you have rendered during the past few months In connection with the movement for the increase of home-grown feed.The efforts of District Agricultural Committees throughout Scotland have met with a gratifying measure of success, although that success has been materially limited owing to the lateness of the season when the Committees1 operations began, and the adverse weather conditions which prevailed during many weeks in 8pring.The development of the German submarine campaign combined with a general diminution ef production in countries . from which normal supplies of cereals are obtained make it necess-:ary to bring into crop in 1916 an area five or six times greater than it has been possible to break up during the short and unfavourable season just ended.Each county must bring every available acre of grass land into cultivation. In order to do so, it is necessary to get into touch with every farm, and for this purpose the Board consider /The Secretary, District Agricultural Committee,
consider that it is essential to remodelj^ttie^syfrtOTLJ^^ and provide for&quot;mere exterided^and.minute organisation.The Board are satisfied that the District Agricultural Cemnittee is the most efficient unit for co-ordinating the work of a large area such as a county,hut they consider that an Executive Committee with an Executive Officer should he formed for each Local Government er other suitable district, or, if thought preferable, that a single Executive Committee should be formed for the larger area, with an Executive Officer in each district.They suggest that the first duty of the Exeoutive Committee should he to organise small local committees comprising one or more parishes, or an estate, or any other convenient area, which will ensure that every farm is fully surveyed and Its possi-bllities for the increased production of food thoroughly investigated. The duties of the parish or local committee would be:-(a) to report on the food producing possibilities of each farm:(b) to enumerate and report en the numbers and movements of live stock:(c) to arrange hy agreement for the loan and co-operative use of horses, implements and machinery:(d) to foresee and tabulate the demands for labour for harvest and potato lifting: *(e) to organise oc-operative effort hy every means, so that the fullest use may be made of all the agricultural resources of the district.With this extended organisation in view the Board desire that your Committee should meet without delay and proceed to the selection of the Bxeoutive Committees described, in lieu ef the existing arrangements.    These Committees may be chosen from the members of the District Agricultural Committee or from outside. The names of membere of the Sxecutlve Committee should be submitted to  /
Secretary.to the Board for approval.It is nec^sjaary^or the-saf^^ in theimmediate future that the harvest of 1918 should be sufficient to maintain all or nearly all of the population, and the problem in face of the farmers is to secure this object notwithstanding the scarcity of labour, the difficulty of obtaining additional horses, and the restricted output of agricultural maohinery.   To overcome these difficulties oo-oporation among farmers will he required, and it is hoped that by organisation it may bo possible to keep every available horse and every available implement work-ing practioally continuously on one or other of the farms in the district.Tho Board will take steps to provide Tractor Ploughs and other machinery for the use of Committees.   Thoy also expect to supply a limited number of horse teams, but they must continue to depend to a large extent on the energy of farmers themselves, not only to do additional work upon their own holdings, but, so far as possible, to make their horses and implements available for the use of their neighbours.It is necessary that preliminary steps should be taken at an early date so that all arrangements may be well advanced before another ploughing season commences.     The Board, therefore, trust that your Committee may be able to overtake the work in your distriot during the months of June and July.    Before fixing your first meeting if you will be good enough to communicate with this Office, one of the Staff of the Department will ondeavour to attend and give what assistance he can.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.M.C0NACHER,
