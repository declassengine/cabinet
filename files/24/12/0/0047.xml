EAR CABINET.SUMMARY M BLOCKADE I  FORMAT I Oil.(Circulated at the request of Lord R.Cecil with reference to Paper Ho. G.T-647.)7th May 1917My dear Eankey,Lord Robert Cecil has just returned from Paris and I have referred to him the last &quot;Summary of Blockade In-foriaation&quot; April 27th to May Srd, which is issued for the &quot;Jar Cabinet&apos;s information by the War Trade Intelligence Depart-raent,Ha desires me to say, that he regrets that he did not see the paper, before it was issued to the Cabinet, as he feels that he cannot concur in the views, which are expressed therein nor can he agree with the conclusions arrived at.He would be grateful therefore, if you would inform the Cabinet accordingly^Yours very truly,(Sgd)   F. LSVERTOIT HARRIS.Col,Sir Uaurioe P.A.Hankey, K.C.B.
Last month was more remarkable for full and free discussion of our Blockade Policy than for any events which denoted a change in the essential facts of the situation.   We venture therefore to summarise the con-elusions whieh appear to emerge when the views of those most competent to judge the situation are collected and compared.It is remarkable that of the five neutrsi Powers which adjoin the enemy the most complacent to the Allies should just now be Sweden, who until the beginning of the year waa unfriendly or positively hostile.   Sweden has now undertaken to release 90,000 tons of British end Allied shipping against whioh she had for a long time closed the iCogrund Passage; and she agrees that theee vessels may carry full cargoes of Swedish timber which are badly needed by the Allies,   These concessions have been made by a Ministry which represents the Germano-philes more than it represents any other party in the State.     I&apos;he moral seems to be that our policy towards some other neutrals might with advantage be sharpened end stiffened.     Sweden has yielded because for the p&amp;st four months she has been virtually blockaded.   We were often told in the past that if Sweden were blockaded she would join our enemies;   and undoubtedly it is on the side of our enemies thst the Swedes would prefer to range themselves.   But the Swedes have learnt that they, the
most self-sufficing of the northern neutrals9 cannot afford to break with us at this stage of the war.   We may have been right to hold our hands in the past;   it must be remembered that the entry of America into the war has immensely strengthened our position as regards the neutrals.   But full advantage should be taken of the improvement in our position which the support of America has caused.   In the light of our recent experience with Sweden it is worth our while at least to reconsider our policy towards Denmark and towards Holland.The food supplies which &amp;e many receives from and through these countries are tiding her over the critical three months before the harvest, and will be no lees useful to her when next winter sets in.    he importance of these supplies may be judged from a few specimen figures.   In one period of 48 hours during March there passed through one Dutoh ifrontier Station into Germany 868 tons of Butter and Cheese and 56 tons of Meat end JPlshi     In the week ending April 11 there were despatched from Denniark to Germany5,5U0 head of cattle850 tons of Meat,  ork, id eh &amp; Canned Foods 588 tons of Butter and Milk 136 tons of Kggs.These exports are unfortunately not abnormal when judged by the war standard,   jfigures more startling have reached us in the past both from Denmark and from Holland; and we quote these particular figures simply because they come to hand in the present week,   tfut they signify a scale of exportation to Germany which
judged fey peace standards is altogether abnormal, end which most seriously detracts from the efficiency of our Blockade.     fhere is obviously a case for strong action against Denmark and Holland if it has a reasonable chance of success.   We learn that such action is already proposed with regard to Danish imports of Margarine materials and we notice indications that further steps of the same kind are being carefully considered.What are the chances of success?   In the first place Holland and Denmark no longer believe that Germany is winning this war, and they are aware that they stand to lose both politically and commercially by ranging themselves on her side,     Xn the second place  ermsay, so far as we can learn, has not the military resources at her sowand with which to attack Denmark and Holland as she attacked Koumania in 1916.   She might parade sufficient forces to intimidate Holland singly or Denmark singly; but she would be at a lose if both countries were simultaneously obliged to close their frontier against further exports of food.   Both countries could be driven to this course in a very few weeks by the judicious use of sea power.   Like Sweden they are in urgent need of bread stuffs;   Holland also requires many raw materials for native industries; Denmark requires Margarine material, Mineral Oils and Coal.     She future of farming in both countries depends on the punctual replenishment of their stocks of fertilisers, which will not last for many months. IWe have been holding our hand in the expectation that the United States would be willing to take upon themselves the odium of threatening these countries with starvation and industrial ruin,   She United States,however,
seem unwilling to adopt that blockade policy against which they made such vigorous protests in 1914 and 1915. In time no doubt they will come round to a sore realistic view of the situation,   but we can hardly afford to wait,for their gradual conversion,   father we should act in the anticipation that they will condone our action when they see, and benefit by, its success.     We are not committed to wait for their approval before we make a newdeparture in our treatment of the neutrals; for the United States are not yet committed to active co-operation in the blockade of Germany.She justification for a general embargo upon shipments to Denmark and Holland is ready in our hands. Mr. Andersen has given a particularly plain hint that we should be foolish to permit the accumulation of food-stocks in Denmark.       We know that there are still large stocks of imported food in Holland;   and quite recently we discovered that owing to the abundance of these stocks the Dutch population were buying and consuming twice as much as fats as we had Intended that they should receive.     for the present we should force these countries to live on their native produce and their accumulated stocks, ae Sweden has done for the past four months.   It cannot be absolutely guaranteed that the failure of Dutch and Danish supplies will starve out Germany before the harvest.     But the moral effect of the deprivation will be very great;   and the prospect of living through another Winter without the help of these supplies will be terrible to the German civil population.      By taking these strong actions we
too shall lose important mppliee;   we shall deprive ourselves of Butch Margarine, Fish and Agricultural Produce and of Danish Bacon, Eggs and Buttor.   But they are supplies with which, it would seem, we can dispense in the summer months;   and It would he a mistake to suppose that these supplies will he permanently cut off from us.   Holland and Denmark will respect us more end will serve us better when they have learned to be afraid of us.   It is vorth our while to run the ride of being pinched in our food supplies if these countries are made to realise that we can do without their help end are not afraid of their hostility,   This is very emphatically the view of the Prench Government,Bo doubt severe restrictions on the imports of these two countries would entail considerable interference *vith the experts of the United Spates.   But there is no question of confiscating American cargoes.   They can be detained on one pretext or another; or bettor still they can be pre-empted for the Allies,   The re is hardly one commodity required at the present moment by Holland or by Denmark of which we and our Allies are not more urgently in need than they.    We might well adopt to-day with American Cereals the policy of purchase which we adopted in 1914 and 1915 with American Copper; only it &amp;ould be possible, now that America and we are allies, to come to some previous arrangement on the subject with the American Government,   America has alreadybset up an Oil Board to regulate oil exports.   Sheeahould also create a Grain Board, a Board for Meat Products, a Cotton Board, a Coal Board.   The first duty of these Boards ^iould be to supply the wants of the Allies,   We need not ask the Boards
-    - 178- 6 -to starve neutrals, but it will come to the saraemthing if we ask them to give priority to the requirements of the Allies.   While these Boards are being formed Aaerioa should take steps or we should take steps to see that no important cargoes from America reach European neutrals exceot in return for reciprocal concessions (particularly in respect of tonnage) to the Allies, We understand that this policy of compensation is being pressed at Yvashington by Marshal Joffre in the name of the French Government;   it is therefore a policy tiilck commends itself to good judges of the situation,This policy of embargoes might with advantage be used lightly against Spain, Horway and Sweden to accelerate the conclusion of the bargains which Great Britain is in course of negotiating with these countries; four undoubtedly the progress of these negotiations has been slow whatever the good vdll of the neutral negotia-tors.   But much stronger pressure of the same kind itiould be used against Denmark and Holland until both ere compel-led to feed their population from their native produce an^ their accumulated stocks.The Blockade situation is extremely complex; it is difficult to present in a short compass all the problems which are involved;&apos; and no doubt there are solutions alternative to that which we have indicated.   All alteraa-tives must be weighed and compared before action is possible.   But the present conjuncture would appear.to offer the best and possibly the last chance of making unbearable the already acute pressure of the blockade upon the Central -Empires.
