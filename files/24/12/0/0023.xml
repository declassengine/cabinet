CONFIDENTIAL.Sir C. Spring-Rice to Lord Hardinge.My Lord, Washington, April 13, 1917.ADMIRAL BROWNING&apos;S visit has been a great success. It was feared that there might be a good deal of reluctance to make a clear expose of the situation or to enter into a definite arrangement. There is a section in the American navy which is not very favourably disposed towards us. There was certainly the fear in some quarters of being made a catspaw to Great Britain or submitting to British dictation. There was also a good deal oi&apos; reluctance to enter into the war at all. The Secretary of the Navy is by inclination of a very pacific disposition. But it turned out that there was the most excellent spirit on all sides, and an evident desire on the part of the Americans to co-operate to the fullest extent. Admiral Browning showed the greatest tact, and I think that nothing could exceed the skill with which he conducted the negotiations. The French Admiral did not understand English very well, and was rather anxious to have a record of the proceedings embodied in a protocol, which of course might lead to an accusation that the Navy Department without the authority of Congress had entered into an alliance with the European Powers. You will already have received all the details.2. A difficulty arose with regard to the recruiting question. The Department of Justice thought that existing law forbade any formal and official recruiting operations on the part of a foreign Government. We are advised that the objections could be removed by the expression on the part of the State Department that the United States did not consider recruiting by a foreign nation under present circumstances to be au impairment of sovereignty. The State Department, which was very friendly, shared this view, but thought that the best way of meeting the difficulty would be to introduce a Bill into Congress. This has now been done. Meanwhile the War Department has expressed the desire to afford every possible assistance, and all arrangements have been made, which will be put into effect the moment that the legal difficulties are removed. Representatives of Great Britain and Canada have been present here and have been in close touch with the Adjutant-General, who has done all in his power to facilitate.3. Congress is getting what is technically known as &quot; cold feet.&quot; Tbe Presidents great desire for some time past lias been to educate the people to the idea of compulsory military service. This is evidently unpalatable to the mass of the people who have made their representatives express opinions hostile to compulsory service. A compromise will probably.be adopted. An army of half a million men on the voluntary system wili be asked for. This scheme is foredoomed to failure. When it fails the people of the United States, like the people of Great Britain, wili see that there is no alternative, and some form of conscription will probably be the result. In the meanwhile all the necessary preparations will be made.4. The Chairman of the Shipping Board who showed at first a very hostile feeling has now been brought round and is inclined to co-operate. His idea is to construct a large number of wooden vessels on the Pacific coast. He thinks that a similar course may be followed with Quebec. The difficulties are that it is doubtful whether such vessels would have the necessary speed, and also whether the engines can be obtained. A scheme of standardisation of marine engine construction is being pressed forward. He is a very energetic man, and we shall probably meet with considerable difficulties on minor points, but on the whole he seems to be quite convinced of the gravity of the question of tonnage, and very desirous of finding a&apos; remedy. There may be a conflict of opinion as to who shall obtain control of the new ships. He is anxious to build up an American mercantile marine, and is opposed to the construction of any ships in America which are not destined to fly the American flag. The orders placed by the Cunard Company excited suspicion. We may have to yield a point on the ground that the main question for us is to.obtain tonnage whatever be the flag, to be flown by the new ships. We will no doubt have to bear in nrjnd the point of view of this Government, and it is important that we should do so. We have again and again called the attention of this Government to the gravity [543]
of the question and to the necessity of hearing in mind the pressing needs of the Prench and Italian Governments. The Iialiau Government seems to he a little anxious lest their needs should he ignored.5. The President has impressed on Congress the necessity of considering first of all the needs of the Allies who are already in the field. Committees are sitting with the object of co-ordinating the resources of the country. So far no practical conclusion has been arrived at but every effort is being made. &quot;We have given full information as to our needs. Lever has been here and has seen the principal members of the committees. Plavelle has come here from Canada. Lever will come here again and will he in constant, touch.6: With regard to finance the Secretary of the Treasury has adopted a very friendly attitude and it is not anticipated that there will be difficulties in Congress. The bankers consider that there mav be some difficulty in floating the loan asked for on the terms proferred. There is a difference of opinion between the bankers and the Administration partly owing to the fact that there has for long been a personal antagonism between them. But on the whole they seem to be working pretty well together.7. The President has taken action at the earliest moment possible. Had he attempted to take action earlier it is very doubtful whether the country would have followed him. Germany has managed to persuade this country that her intentions are fundamentally hostile. The President at the instigation of Germany made a desperate effort to promote peace. He followed the German lead and he took measures to cut off the money supplies of the Allies in the hope that Germany would suspend her hostile measures and consent to negotiate on fair terms. Having done all in his power to show his peaceful intentions he was met by a declaration from Germany that she proposed to continue her acts of hostility. Under these circumstances it became plain to everybody that the President desired peace but that Germany desired war. It was necessary to accept the situation and to declare the state of war which Germany by her unprovoked actions had herself brought about. Any other action would have meaut an abject surrender on the part of the United States. But in accepting the situation and in declaring a state of war the country still maintains its pacific attitude and its reluctance to engage in hostilities, and to share in the horrors of the present struggle. Above all there is a strong dislike to take p;irt in the v\ar as allies and especially as allies of England. The attitude towards Prance and now towards Russia is different.8. The United States Government is verv anxious about the Russian situation. Gompers, the head of the labour unions, who is strongly for the Allies, has been asked to make a very strong representation to the Russian working classes. The Jews are also being appealed to, and I have personally represented to my Jewish friends the great danger which would be incurred by the Jewish communities if a revolution, to a considerable extent promoted by Jews, were to be utilised for German purposes. I am not in communication with Mr. Gomper?, as he desires to avoid direct relations with Embassies, but I have no doubt of his friendly sentiments. It would be an excellent thing if representatives of the British and Canadian labour unions were sent here to co-operate with the American labour unions in order to promote the common cause of democracy.9. An idea which seems to be dominant here is that an appeal from the United States to the democracies of the world will be successful in ending the war on a basis of mutual concessions and a common understanding in the cause of freedom. The United/States Government is going into the war, not as an ally of governments or monarchies, but as the standard bearer of democratic ideas and as the eldest child of freedom. No other argument could have induced the American Congress to consent to enter into the war. The Presidents speech should be very carefully studied, because it represents, in a clear and unmistakable form, the real motives and objects of the President and the people of the United States.10. One result of this will be that the President will doubtless make some repre-sentations on the Irish question. He seems to think that the guarantees provided by the United States Constitution for the protection of minorities should be sufficient to prevent the oppression of Protestants by Catholics. These guarantees have success-fully protected religious minorities in this country. There is a great fear of the growing power of the Catholics here. At the same time the wisest spirits among the Catholics are convinced that as long as they keep religion out of politics they have nothing to fear. Wherever religion has been imported into politics this has been fatal to the party which makes the attempt.   This is an axiom in American politics,/
and a large number of the American people are quite unable to understand why-similar guarantees should not be accepted in Ireland. The independence of Ireland, if this implies any impairment of the naval situation of England, would, of course, be absolutely contrary to United States interests. The policy advocated by Germany and German-Irish agents here, of a German naval base on the Irish coast as a price of the independence of Ireland, would constitute a most serious danger to this country and would excite grave apprehensions. The Irish themselves are loyal to the United States and are anxious to avoid any imputation of disloyalty or of pro-German feeling. But they have compromised themselves by their alliance with the Germans and are now anxious to find a way out. They cannot stultify themselves by professing friendship to England merely because the United States and England are fighting the same enemy. Tney will be perfectly willing to co-operate with France, but they will insist that President Wilson, while advocating the cause of the independence of small nations, should not neglect the cause of Ireland. Apart from this, there is a very widespread feeling here that the Irish question is a public nuisance and should be got rid of ; that it is the great obstacle to a good understanding between the United States and Great Britain, and that, in fact, it is the most urgent question between us at the present moment. It is partly with a view to assisting in the settlement of the Irish question that the United States is willing to show its flag in Irish waters.11. The United States Government are aware that, next to ships, we want men. We have impressed on them that the men must be sent forward at once. Roosevelt is urging on the President to consent to his raising a considerable-f-rce, and taking them to France to be trained there. I think it is out of the question, or at least very unlikely, that the President will consent. I told Roosevelt that it was no business of ours how the United States should send her troops, if she was going to send them, and that I could offer no opinion whatever. All I knew was that the moral effect of the appearance of the American flag in France would be enormous, and also that men were imperatively needed. These facts, however, would not justify us in making any suggestions unless we were officially asked as to what course should be followed by the United States as to sending troops to France. The danger of the voluntary system is evidently that the best men go at once, and are sacrificed. These men are imperatively needed at home to help in the work of organisation and to assist in recruiting. The United States Government wishes to organise its military forces on a very large scale, and not to agree to any half measures. There is also a natural inclination to object to prominent members of a hostile party gaining political capital by military achieve-ments, but this is only a secondary consideration.12. The situation as regards the resources of the country, especially as to wheat, is not satisfactory, and grjat eff jrfcs are being made to make the country realise the necessity for economy, and for straining every resource in order to increase supplies. But the great mass of the country remain still comparatively indifferent.15. The feeling towards Canada is excellent. At the same time the President is rather afraid of any demonstration which might excite the antigonismof the Irish party, and of that section of the American people who&apos;seem to believe that George III is^ still alive and that the English are still plotting against the independence of the United States.I have, &amp;c.CECIL SPRING-RICE.
