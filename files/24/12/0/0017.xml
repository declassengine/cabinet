SECRET--- WAR   CABINET..*x.617THE   TIMBER   SITUATION.In pursuance of the duty laid on the Board of Trade by the War Cabinet on February 22nd, 1917, of watching the progress of the Imports Restriction Scheme and reporting to the War Cabinet from time to time on the relation of imports to shipping, I feel bound to warn the ?.rar Cabinet that the Scheme for Timber control and production, which formed a vital part of the whole scheme of Imports restriction devised by the Import Restrictions Committee is not making the progress which thdt situation would seem to demand.As pointed out in my Memorandum dated April 23rd, nmch the most fruitful way of restricting imports is to increase the supplies of home timber.   This is the outstanding lesson of the experience so far gained of the working of the imports restrictions already introduced.At present, over 100 articles are on the restricted list, yet in March out of a total re ruction of 427,000 tons in the imports of all restricted articles no less than 251,000 tons, or nearly 60 per cent, of the total, was saved on /timber alone. Judging by the returns so far received for April, the saving on timber in that month will be considerably greater, both in quantity and (probably) in proportion.But the possibility of shutting down timber imports without serious detriment to military and essential economic needs, depends absolutely on the possibility, of providing for essential require-rnents by timber-cutting at home.     Economies in civil consumption will at the best, operate slowly, and already the inroad on stocks is giving rise to serious apprehension, and may lead to a timber famine in a few months.    It is not easy to give precise figures as to total stocks including those in the hands of consumers as -well as of merchants, but the bestrough estimate that can be made seems to point to a reduction from 3 million tons at the end of November to lj million at the end of March or less than three months&apos; supply at present rate of consumption.   Even if the drain on stocks is largely restricted by drastic economies and by the development of timber-cutting in France it seems very unlikely that it will (in the absence of imports) be reduced below 300,000 tons a month for several months to come. - At this rate present stocks might possibly be made to last for four or five months, but long before the end of that period the position will become extremely dangerous.The Army is by far the largest consumer of sawn timber, both for direct use at the Front and for the manufacture of packing of munitions.   A timber famine would therefore presumably be very serious from a military point of view.    The only way to avoid this contingency is to effect a large increase in home supplies of sawn timber.     It is, however, sawn timber, which presents at once the most important and. the most difficult problem.For every 20,000 men employed in increasing home supplies of sawn timber, at least 1,000,000 tons per annum of imports can be dispensed with.   The same amount of labour applied to any agricultural operation would not yield anything approaching the same tonnage.   This statement (and the xtxksmnxk estimate- is a yery conservative one) is sufficient to show how much more important timber is than any other article - or all other articles
put together - in relation to imports restriction.The principal &apos;bottle neck&apos; as regards sawn timber production is the want of labour.       As stated in my last Memorandum,  the Director of Timber Supplies expects to have 9,000 men at work by the end of May, and desires to take on from 3,000 to 4,000 men per month from that time onward. This demand seems a modest one compared with the great results to be achieved, but, unf6rtuha&quot;te!j.y, there is at present no sign that any large proportion of it will be met.      I cannot say how far the deficiency is due to circumstances entirely beyond control, or how far it may be due to conditions which admit of remedy.     But it is clear to me that the matter requires immediate attention.A.H.S.1st May,  1917.
