V 383WAR CABIIS5.T.IIOTE I IT REGARD TO SIR jjglC GEIPE S&apos; RELATIONS TO THE SHIPPIKG COnTRCTLER \ S &quot;lEPARTJOTT.Circulated tb Kembers of the War Cabinet only.The War Cabinet will remember that at their meeting on May 2 (77ar Cabinet 13C Kinute 13), it was decided that a bus-iness man should be appointed as a Hember of the Board cf the Admiralty to superintend the whole of the shipbuilding and the supply of material for naval purposes, and this appoint-ment was offered there and then by the T?ar Cabinet to Major-General Sir Eric Geddes, who undertook to consider the matter, and reply as soon as possible.Sir Eric Geddes accompanied the Prime Minister to Paris., and after seeing Sir Douglas Haig and discussing the -ehole question -*ith the Prime Minister, decided to accept the appointment.     Sir Eric laid grea-t stress on the importance of obtaining ccntroloover shipbuilding for the Mercantile Marino and the Tar Office Inland Waterways; as well as for tho Admiralty.   -It will be remembered that the War Cabinet had themselves on May 2, felt that; having regard to the intimate connection between&apos;shipbuilding; for the purposes of the Havy, the Mercantile Marine, and the Tar Office Inland Waterways, very-close association was necessary between the holder of the new office and the shipbuilding side of the Shipping Controllers Committee, but they left over the final decision on the eub*-ject until the reply of Sir Eric Geddes was received.     In view of the great stress laid by Sir Eric Geddes on the exercise of control over all the three ship construction departments, and having regard to the general trend of the discussion at the War Cabinet, the Prime Minister, on his return, wrote to Sir Joseph Maelay informing him that it was essential to plaee the whole of the shipbuilding of this country under practically one direction, and that the War Office had concurred so far as they were concerned.     The Prime Minister * a letter, together with subsequent corree-pondence, is appendedIt now appears desirable that the War Cabinet should pass a Minute definitely defining the relations of Sir Eric Geddes to the Shipping Controller.      I saw Sir Eric Geddes this afternoon, and asked him what he had in his mind.   He replied that what he desired was that the whole of tho tech-nical ani advisory staff of the Shipping Controller dealing with shipbuilding should be transferred to his Department. This, of course, *ould include the design as well&quot;as tho placing of orders for merchant ships at home and abroad. -Sir Eric Geddes also considers that.the purchase of second^ hand ships or material abroad or elsewhere should be in his hands.
TMa would leave to. the Shipping Controller tho manage-ment, control and requisitioning of British ships, and the obartering of tonnage,Under this arrangement Sir Eric Geddes will have the control over the allocation of all the eteel available for shipbuilding.   He Informed se that the Prime Minister under-took to make satisfactory arrangements for the provision of the necessary steel&quot;and raw material.     The elaboration of these arrangements is a matter vhioh awaits the decision of the War Cabinet.   Sir Eric Geddes informed me that he would be glad if this decision could be postponed for a few days, as he would like to have time to go into the question first.(Sgd)     M.P.A.HA1IKEY.8 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.  (1) 10th May 1917.
Note by the Shipping Controller on paragraph (14) of War Cabinet Minute 130.There is everything to bo said for close cc-ordination of the various Departments concerned with shipbuilding, but the suggestion that the new Admiralty Civil Lord, who is to be responsible for Naval shipbuilding,  should also exercise a. measure of control over merchant shipbuilding is one in which the Shipping Controller could not possibly acquiesce,The Shipping Ministry has already in existence a shipbuilding Committee consisting cf men of the highest eminence in the profession, together with technical experts, and they have done splendid work.     Ho reasons have been given for suggesting that they need surveillance from outside and it could not be expected that they would be willing tc accept such.     Their achievements have been limited only by failure tc make available the necessary supplies of material and labour for an extended ^programme*     For this failure they are in no way responsible.&apos;4th May, 1917*IILetter from the Prime Minister to Shipping Controllerdated&quot;&quot;Fth May,  1917*My dear Shipping Controller,I have only just seen your Minute of the 4th o.f May;    I wan in Prance when it arrived.     The Cabinet have come definitely to the conclusion that in order to utilise our shipbuilding resources to the best advantage it is essential that there should be complete co-ordination between the building for naval, for mercantile, and for War Office purposes.     This decision affects not merely your Department, but also the *ar Office as well as the Admiralty.     You have now competition for the same material, for the same yards, for the same&quot;labour between the three Departments, and the results are not as satisfactory as the Cabinet would wish.     That is inevitable unless you put the whole of the shipbuilding of this country under practically one direction.      The War Office have readily assented to this course, and their barge and ferry department will
9 Q  dot)be entirely under the control of Sir Eric Ge&amp;dos, who has &quot;been chosen for this position.     GeneralCollard, whom yoii know, will act under him.The policy as to priority must be decided by the Cabinet where there is any dispute, and Sir Eric Geddes will just as much represent you in the matter of building mercantile ships as he will represent tho Admiralty and the War Office in their programmes.I know Sir Eric well.      I hare had a good deal of experience of him both in the Ministry of Munitions and in tho War Office, and there is no bettor driver in the United Kingdom. You will find him of the greatest possible assistance to you in pressing forward your shipping programme.As you know, apart from other material, the question cf steel is one which has caused you as well as the Admiralty endless anxiety, and by placing the building of ships- under one management the regular delivery and allocation of this essential material mil be greatly facilitated.     I am sure that you will find that this is an arrangement which will suit your policy admirably, and I earnestly hope you will see your way to accept it with the same readiness as has been displayed by Lord Derby &amp;nd Sir Edward Carson.As I have to speak on the question of Shipbuilding on Thursday at the Secret Session, I should be glad if :/ou would give instructions to someone in your Department to prepare a paper giving me full particulars as to the number and tonnage of the shipping which you have ordered and of the numbers and tonnage of those which have absolutely been laid down.I think I ought to add thai: Sir Eric Geddes is one ox the easiest men to work with, end that is the experience of &amp;11 the men who have had any business dealing with him during the last three trying years.Yours sincerely,(signed)     D.L1.G.III.Letter from Shipping Controller to the Prime Minister dated 9th.May. 1917.% dear Prime Minister,I have received your letter of yesterday.I need hardly assure ycu that I and the members of the Shipping Control Committee (which is comprised of three of the iaost capable shipping men in the country) have the one idea - to serve you to the utmost of our capabilities, and you would not appreciate us if we did otherwise than state frankly the position and the truth.Since this Ministry was formed it has been a constant effort to held cur own with the admiralty and without definite independence we could have made little progress, but as it is we have gone through and made progress which I do not believe could nave been exceeded with the limited possibilities permitted to us.We are all for co-ordination, and there need be no trouble about this, but I do not think there could be a greater mistake than to ask us to be subordinate in /
any way to the Admiralty, which is what such an appointment as you indicate would mean.     Sir Eric Geddes would he first and foremost an Admiralty man, and would undoubtedly, wittingly or unwittingly, stand for the Admiralty.     It is one thing for Sir Edward Carson to concur when Geddes is to he a member of the Board of Admiralty;    it is quite another matter to propose that a moat important Department of this Ministry should be placed under the authority of a member of another Ministry.   The interest of the War Office in the natter is relatively trifling.I think you must, on consideration, see that the pro-position is not a reasonable one.Of course, if you decided to form a totally separate Department to control shipbuilding, the matter would be quite different.We are not here for one moment to make difficulties but It would, we believe, be fatal to have Geddes, an Admir- ... alty man, with control orar as.   ; The Admiralty we know too well neither   realise nor understand the requirements and the importance of merchant ship-building.Yours &amp;c.(Sgd) J.P.MACLAY.IV.Letter from Secretary of the War Cabinet to the Shipping Controller dated 10th May 1917.Dear Sir Joseph Maclay,I saw the Prime Minister for a few minutes this morning in regard to the relations of Sir Eric Geddes to the Shipping&apos; Controls r, and the Prime Minister handed me your private letter of the 9th of May and asked me to reply to it.The Prime Minister asks me to say that he regards the question of principle that the whole of the shipbuilding of this country ie to be placed under one direction,nasaly, that of Sir Eric Geddea, as settled by his letter to you of May 8th.The Prime Minister thinks that you need have no appre-henaiona that Sir Eric Geddes will give Admiralty requirements undue priority over those of the Mercantile Marine.    It has been made perfectly clear to Sir Eric Geddee that one of the main objects of his appointment is to stimulate the building of mercantile tonnage as well as of the craft which the Admiralty require for the maintenance of our sea power and the vessels needed by the War Office for inland transport &amp;c. The policy as to priority will be decided by the Cabinet in case of any dispute and Sir Eric Geddes will be just as much responsible for the production of merchant ships as he will be for that of Admiralty and ?ar Office vessels.     In fact, his position towards the Shipping Controllers Department, the Admiralty, and the War Office, will be very similar to that occupied by the Minister&apos; of Munitions vis-a-vis the War Office.Yours sincerely(Sgd) M.P.A.
