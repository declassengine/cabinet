OPERATIONS.SECRET.From, - Colonol Thomson,To,     General Hanbury Williams repeated C.I.G.S.3*5*IV sHanded in at 9 amiC,B, 504.A0     On Hay lot two manifestations by Russian troops took place in Jacsy,   The 1st occurred at 1 p,.jn,, was arranged by working committee of United. Council of Soldiers and Officers. This body represents 30,000 men and their chairman is the special envoy of Russian Government.      The manifestation was orderly in character, speechos were patriotic and during at least a portion of the proceedings General Scherbatchoff was present wearing a red badge.B8     2nd manifestation, at 4 p.m. took placo against wishes and without knowledge of committee referred to in paragraph A,? and was the work of certain violent revolutionaries who began by liberating a Roumanian socialist, who Was under police supervision in a suburb of the town.     This man whose name i3 Rakovsky, is Bulgarian by origin, and is suspectod of being a German agent.      In 1907 he was expelled from Roumania for his action in connection with the peasants rising, but he was subsequently reinstated as a Roumanian citizen.&apos;&apos; His liberation was effected by Russian soldiers who arrived in 3 motor cars at the house where he was detained.   The two Roumanian policemen on duty were Unable to offer any resistance.   Rakovsky subsequently addressed a large meeting in the principal square of the-town, and rccommondod Republican Government all round in the Balkans. A Russian sergeant called Gellor (originally spelt Heller) was the next speaker, and he, while apparently in favour of continuing the war, declared that if Roumania could not run a revolution by herself, Russia would have to do it for her; he also advised Xing Ferdinand to follow Tsar&apos;s example.
C. Roumanian Government have received reports that active revolutionary propaganda - is being carried on in Roumania.     Shis had not much effect as, whatever their sympathies, Roumanian peasants disliko Russians too much to learn anything from them.     The danger of situation is that Russian revolutionary leaders in Jassy, when they find themselves unable to influence either Roumanian or Russian soldiers on this front, may lay hands on King Ferdinand and his Ministers, so as to become masters of the situation.     It is reported that this line of action has been discussed at secret meot-inga hold in Jassy.D. As a precautionary measure, Roumanian Government, has brought 4,000 Roumanian troops into Jassy, where there are already at least 7,000 Russian troops.     This latter number seems excessive, and if Russian Government oould arrange to reduce it to at most 2,000 situation hero would become much easier-     It does not seem right (? 1 group) the audiences of the Revolutionary Dema-go&amp;ues would be reduced in proportion.S.     Nearly all Russian soldiers here go unarmed in the streets, and for this reason danger of collision with Roumanian troops is not great.     The real danger of situation is that Russian officers do not seom to have .any control over their men.
