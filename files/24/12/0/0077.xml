3 B. 0 El T cy m oWAR CABIHESCOM3CII5HTIOUS OBJECTORS. (Memorandum by X.ord Milnor.)I era not at all easy in my mind as to our attitude towards Conscientious Objectors.     It is quite clear that the late Govern-&apos; noiii foresaw the difficulties which would arise in this connection, and it is equally clear, that they decided that prevision should be made for the exemption from military sorvice of those whose convictions prevented thorn from taking a direct part in the war. Moreover, it was obvious, from the first that amongst the group of conscientious objectors tl&amp;re wculd be some extremists who would go to the length of refusing any substituted service in lieu of service in the ranks.     The provisions of the Military Service Act 1916 were therefore so framed that tribunals wore given the option of granting^either absolute or conditional exemption as the circumstancea of each case might demand.     Indeed the importance whioli the Cfovornmont attached to the power of granting absolute exemption in certain cases is shewn by the fact that a special&quot;&quot; explanatory clause was introduced Into tho second Military Service Act of 1916 in order to clear up a misapprehension which appeared to exist on this point in tho minds of many of those who had to administer the Act*Whether this policy was wise or unwise it is not my purpose to inquire.     I *im merely concerned with the question as to whether tho administration of the Acts&quot;has in fact achieved the objects which the Government had in view,     Those objects wore presumably two-fold;-(3,) To give relief to those who had genuine convictions, and thereby incidentally to prevent tho possibility of an outcry against religious persecutions(S) To prevent tho shirker from obtaining a refuge under a &quot;conscience&quot; acquired since the outbreak of war.I must confess that I have serious misgivings as to whathor either of these objects has in ftict been achieved. As regards the first we are allowing   it to be scid, with Some show of justice, that we are meting out unduly hersh treatment to those whose religious feelings are so strong that they cennot even accept substituted sorvice.     As regards thG second there Is a growing outcry against the leniency with which vre ere treating those whose consciences are sufficiently olastic to allow   o^bhe acceptance of such service.     And yet if shirkers ere suspected it is surely in the ranks of the latter that they are most likely to bo found.     It is the .who have chosen to avail themselves of the amenities of &quot;Ztertmoor in ^reference to tho trenches:
whereas in the case of those who have refused&quot; substituted service the choice has in many cases been in favour of hard labour, not as against the trenches but as against a life of comparative- ease on Dartmoor or elsewhere,   in a word, we appear to nave succeeded in making the worst of both worlds. We have neither obtained credit for our endeavour to meet the case of genuine religious conviction, nor have v/e escaped the -charge that :-?e are treating too aindly those whose genuineness is more open, to doubt.I &quot;ill frankly admit that my attention via 8 first drawn to this, question by a necessity ahich lay upon me to inquire into the case of an individual who has been wel 1 knoan to me for many years.     The man in question bee erne quite early in life a disciple of Tolstoi, end as the result of his views oa the ouesti of private property he refused to inherit his f:-.ther-&apos;rs estate. Several years before the war he became a Quaker and lived in a worhing class tenement in order to carry on his work amongst the poor.   But for the fact that the Quakers do not recognise any Ministry he would quite obviously have come within the category of Ministers of Religion recognised as such under the Military Service &apos;ots.     Ee is also, incidentally, quite unfit for active service.The history of this man-&apos;1 s case is as foilows:-He appeared before the Eoxton Tribunal and was refuse-&quot;&apos;, absolute exemption.-   He stated that hits religious beliefs prevented him from accepting any form of substituted service.   He was arrested an-&quot; taken under military escort to his unit.    Ee was then court-martialled for   refusing to put on uniform and sentenced to six months1 hard lab our.   Here he contracted rheu-matism and the Home Office endeavoured to induce the Uar Office to discharge him on the prison doctor Js certificate.-The War Office, however, insisted on their own medical examination, which the prisoner refused.   On leaving prison after the completion of his sentence he was immediately re-arrested and again sent to his unit.     On again refusing to waar uniform he was. again court-raartialled and was sentenced to two years1 hard labour..     On completion of this second term he will, if the Military Service  ,cts are still in f.&apos;-rce, he re-arrested an^ the process will continue ad infinitum.-Thatever else may be said about this man1s convictions it is clear that they are patently genuine.      It is also clear that the provision allowing absolute exemption was intendel to meet gust such a case as this.      I am informed on reliable authority that there are a large number of cases of tin s ;ae kind. I submit that -.re are merely sowing tho seeds of future trouble-by allowing the Acts to be administered in * way which directly defeats the object cf those who framed them.     All that appears to be required is a greater elasticity of administration. Many or  these cases could be suitably disposed of &apos;arer the King&apos;s pardon, whereas in others&apos; discharge could probably be granted, on medical grounds..(Initialled)     M.9 May 1917..
