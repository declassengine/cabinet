-.T.664. &apos;TH5 SHIPBUIDDIIIS SITUATION &amp; TH3 CPITOOL 0? STEEL.(Copy of letter from Minister of Munitions to Secretary, Tar Cabinet, Dated 9th May 1917)Dear Hankey,. - ^ .I have Just been reading your Minute on the Shipbuilding: situation and in it you raise the question of the control of steel.You may perhaps remember that, at a previous Cabinet meeting, it &quot;-as decided that all questions of steel allocation and orders must go through the Director of Steel Production, Mr. Hunter, here.There Is an Inter-departmental Committee working regularly to deal with any conflicting demands,, as hitherto orders have been given without^cognizance cf the Steel Department and it was in order to correct this that I brought the question up and obtained the decision referred to.I think that, in cases of difference, with, the Inter-departmental Committee, it v/ould not be satisfactory for the issue to be settled by any of the officers or chiefs of the conflicting Departments, - ourselves included. It might perhaps - and I think -dth advantage - stand referred to Lord Curzon to be the arbitrator in such cases. . As far as the Ministry is concerned, *e vrould be quite willing to accept such an arrangement, but, of course, we could not accept the ruling on such questions cf departmental executive officers.       I do not ,-howsvorin fact expect that it would be necessary to refer to Lord Curzon very often.Yours sincerely,CSd.)     C. ADIISOE.
