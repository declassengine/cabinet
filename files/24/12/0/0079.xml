O rr qETJSSQ- PER SI AIT RAHAVAYS w J 0(Eote by Lord Curzon)There is a further telegram, lJe.72 from Sir C.Marling, (appended) about c Russian railway in the Hi of Persia, which is not included in the file..    It rclctoe to the Astara-Teheran railway which is probably an amplification of tho Enzcli-Tehersn project, mentioned in the printed telegram.Tho Astara-Tchoran or Enscli-Teheran extensions - and the Askabad-Meshed extension - are probably in the long run inevitable, and will,, of course, rivet the hold of Russia on Porth Persia, Which will sink into the position of a Russian province.They eannct be permanently resisted.     But it seems undesirable that wo should encourage or accelerate their execution until the whole position of the British Zone in S.Persia is settled - which I imagine will not be until after tho war - all the more that tho Askabad-Meshed line will seriously alarm tho Amir.What Sir CBMarling moans by the &quot;section of consortium rail-way in our sphere&quot; I do not know.     It seems to point to a revival of the Trans-Persian Railway scheme, with which the late government flirted through the agency of the Sqciote dritudes*In my view the whole cf these questions ought to be postponed until aftor the Wcr:   and to invite the co-operation of Gt.Britain and France at this stage in the furtherance of purely Russian schemes is to prejudge the find issue and to make a quite unnecos-sary sacrifice of British interests.An attempt is being made to rush us into approval of a Trans-Pore ian Railway - conceived on Russian lines - much in the same way as recent British Governments without knowing what they were about, end in spite of frequent warnings - committed themselves to tho acceptance of the Gormen Baghdad Railway.(Intld.)

QULTTA IUSHKI RAILWAY SXTEHSIOKWith&apos; reference to Y/ar Cabinet Minutes 69, Minute 3, I have considered   Lord Curzon^s Memorandum of the  7th February in consultation with my advisers.   We are clearly of opinion that it would certainly be inadvisable (to say the least of it) to approach the Amir as to a railway line through his country just now.     An extension of the railway from lalbandin to Seistan would no doubt be advantageous to us now and after the war - as a means of strengthening our influence in lias tern Persia - but, as its construction would take probibly over a year and would use up rails, materiel and labour that might be more profitably employed on work which is likely to have a direct bearing on the war., it is not advocated at present-.As regards an eventual junction with the Russian railway;   our relations with Afghanistan would have to be altogether revolutionized before a line to Zushk could be contemplated.The present does not seem a, suitable time to consider the very big problem of an extension through Khorassan via Meshed to Dushakh or Askabad.(Initialled) A.C.7th March, 1917
