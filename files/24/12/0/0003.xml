The Director attended several conferences at the offices of the Euilding Trades t Federation, in order to advise in connection with the work-ing out of the Scheme for that trad--i, which is now well advanced.     The Printing Trade have held a meeting at Leicester to arrange matters connected with the Printing Trade Scheme and the first mooting of the Central Joint Committee has been arranged.     The Trade Unions in tho Furnishing Trade have been approached and have indicated their willingness to co-operate in applying the Scheme to tho Furnishing Trade.

Acrtivc steps have been taken in North Wales to induce *men from the Slate Quarries to transfer to iron-stone, limestone, and dolomite quarries..     Mr. Small, from the Trade3 Section, went down specially to assist the Commissioner..     As a result of their action, considerable numbers of men have signified their willingness to undertake the work offered, and some have already been transferred for dolomite v/ork.     More men could have been despatched., had it not been that when confirmation of the vacancies notified by the Ministry of Munitions was asked for, it was found in a number of cases either that the firms named had over-stated their immediate requirements., or that quarrymen had been asked for whenthe work was in underground mines, or that the wages offered wore too low or too indefinite.     Before undertaking the campaign the Commissioners had been assured by the Ministry of Munitions that the requirements named on the list with which they had been furnished were quite definite, and the
subsequent discovery that this was not correct has resulted in serious dissatisfaction.     In response to their urgent appeal, a number of men had already arranged to give up their present work, and it is exceedingly unfortunate that the Department should have to inform those men now that their transfer must be postponed.(e) Labour for Timber Felling0     The Department have been in communication with the Timber Supply Department with a view to giving any possible assistance in finding labour for this work, and it has been arranged that if the Employment Exchanges Department) who have had the question of allocating National Service Volunteers or other labour to this work undnr their consideration^ are unable to moot the immediate demand, a special effort shall be made by the Substitution Officers of the National Service Depart-mento     Further information is at present awaited from the Timber Supply Department as to tho extent of tho deficiency of labour for their needs. 7.
