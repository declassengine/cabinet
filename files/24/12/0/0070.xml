Internal condition. There has been no general excitement amongst Mahometans over the fall of Baghdad ; a few are gloomy and depressed, some Sliiahs very glad. Few Indians have yet volunteered for defence force; the Press is inclined lo criticise the conditions of service, but exhorts young men to join. The revolution in Russia attracted much attention, and in some quarters there is a tendency to point the moral in regard to India. The war loan is doing well in spite of rumours that Government do not intend to repay it. Internal condition of India quiet. In the matter of recruiting for the Indian Army, temporary disturbances occurred in the Kolapur State owing to want of sufficient co-operation on the part of the State authorities/ Government of Bombay have now, however, issued adequate instructions and the excitement has been allayed.
