Mesopotamia Administration Committee.For convenience of reference abstracts of (1) the proposals of the War Cabinet Committee; (2) the comments of Sir Percy Cox; and (3) those of the Government of India are printed below in parallel columns.(1) War Cabinet Committee.(2) -Sir Percy Cox.(3) Government of India.1. Occupied territories to be 1 administered not by Government \ of India., but by His Majesty&apos;s j Government.2. Basra to remain perma-nently under British administra-tion : western and northern limits to be Nasiriyeh, Shatt-el-Hai, Kuty Bedrai.3. Bagdad to be an Arab state with local ruler or Government under &quot;British Protectorate in everything, but name. No rela-tions with Foreign Powers; Con-&apos; suls to be accredited to His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. Behind Arab facade Bagdad to be administered as -an Arab Province by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions as far as possible.   In particular : (a) Irak Code not to be used but local judicial system maintained as regards both law and personnel, only sub-stituting Arab for Turk;1.. No comment.2. Agrees.3. Ruler not feasible as no outstanding personality to fill part.. Proposes an Administrative Council presided over by High Commissioner, eitlier one for each vilayat or a combined one for both vilayats. Combined Council would bring into true perspective diver-gent interests of each vilayat, and would have unquestionable right to regulate, in accordance with needs of whole country, such questions as Indian immigration and cognate matters.4. .  &apos;   -(a) Agrees that territory should be administered in accordance with existing laws and institutions, and con-vinced of great advantage of having uniform codes for Basra and Bagdad and other Arab provinces under foreign rule or protection. No essen-tial reason why systems established in ; both vilayats should not be assimilated. Turkish judicial. system in-cluded   final   reference   to, Constantinople, for which substitute must be found by creation of High Court of Mesopotamia with final appeal1. Readily accept decision ; but India&apos;s share in the conquest of these territories, in which her interests, commercial, political, and religious, are already large, must be recognised. m Any restric-tion of free Indian immigration into Irak would cause bitter and legitimate resentment. Provision of a definite field for expansion elsewhere, preferably in East Africa, would tend to satisfy India and check undue flow into Irak; but in any case, in view of Indian pilgrimage and trade interests, desirable to post an officer of Go-vernment of India to Basra and perhaps Bagdad to advise local administration on such questions.2. No remarks.3. Entirely agree with. Sir P. Cox that precise constitution of Arab 1 State at Bagdad under British Protectorate cannot be decided at once. Experience of puppet rulers in India and Afghanistan not encouraging. Endorse Sir P. Cox&apos;.s suggestion (under head 13) as to appointment of a Commission to examine whole problem on the spot.(a) No remarks.S 356  40  5/17
(1) War Cabinet Committee.(2) Sir Percy Cox.(3) Government of India.(b) Similarly   with   executive and administrative machinery, i tribal system of Government, provincial and local councils, &amp;c.\ to be resuscitated  and 1 maintained ;(c) Present land revenue system ! not to be disturbed ;(d) Employment of Indians in any branch of administration to be strictly discountenanced as  inconsistent   with   above j principles,  and  no  Asiatics j from outside to be employed ! unless  of  Persian  or Arab j descent  or  domicile.     The i same to apply as far as pos-sible to Basra vilayat.;to Privy Council. Civil and criminal codes and land laws require considerable amend-ment and adjustment of wording to make them inter-pretable. As regards personnel, sufficient indigenous material not available at present, but can gradually be created. (b) Tribal system of govern-inent already adopted where suitable ; no objection to pro-vincial and local councils.(c) Agrees in principle.(*/) Agrees ; but for duration of war must Lave some latitude, i especially in regard to clerical I establishments.   Urgent   re-quirements of Expeditionary j Force   and military ad.inini- ! stration must be met by most expeditious means possible.5. If Basra is not annexed, head of whole Mesopotamian ad-ministration to be High Commis-sioner residing at Bagdad, Basra being placed under a Governor subordinate to him. If Basra is annexed, head of administration to be styled Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Meso-potamia with titular headquarters at Basra, but residing generally at Bagdad. Deputy Governor and Deputy High Commissioner at Basra and&apos; Bagdad respectively to act for him in his absence.6. British Civil Service to be amalgamated with that of Soudan and possibly also of Levant, re-cruitment being by same method and personnel interchangeable. British officers of Indian services, if required at first, to be lent temporarily under foreign service rules; those now serving there to be permitted to volunteer for per-manent transfer.7. Shiah holy places to &quot;form a separate enclave not under direct British control, but not to include any important irrigated or irrig-able areas.5. Itecognises that both vilayats cannot be annexed, and that importance of annexing Basra makes it necessary to put up with certain disadvantages at Bagdad. Is convinced, however, that two administrations should be so similar as to be indistinguishable in the working. Difference would be one of technical political status and nomenclature not felt on the spot. Two vilayats from every point of view inseparable, and could not be run on conflicting lines and inconsistent principles without great prejudice to all interests concerned.6. No comment or objection.(b) No remarks.(c) No remarks.(t/) In practice impossible pro-bably for some time to dis-pense entirely with Indian Moslems in the administration. No wish to encourage introduc-tionof Indian subordinates, but think it would be a grave mistake to debar them abso-lutelv. Such a course would excite legitimate ill-feeling in India.5. No remarks.6. No remarks.7. Nejef and Kerbela should not be treated as an enclave cut off from advantages   of  enlightened I Government,   which   inhabitants expect and will demand.    They should be organised as independent j townships   as  regards municipal administration.  Unable at present i to form an opinion as to irrigation, river    conservancy,    navigation, ! posts,  telegraphs  and  railways, which should come under united administration controlled by High I Commissioner.    Limits of town-ships would be existing limits of sacred territory round shrines.7. Agree   with   Sir   P.   Cox&apos;sview.

General   remarks. as will be seen from foregoing, generally &apos;. accepts and agrees with proposed \ lines   of   policy.    is,   however, 1 strongly  of   opinion   (in  which ! army &quot;commander concurs) that j formal introduction of above prin-&apos; ciples in  existing circumstances I (i.e., with  martial law in force and   the   military position  still insecure)   takes  too   much   for granted, and makes demands upon local authorities  which may be incompatible with military inter-ests  and freedom  of  action  of army commander.   nevertheless, accepts policy in principle, and8. agree entirely tion department will doubtless have to indent heavily on india and services of indian official sub-ordinates will probably also be required this would militate against rigorous enforcement of 4 (d). quite prepared to meet indents if given full warning. if large irrigation works started at once in mesopotamia., almost in-evitable that labour should come from india. control of large colonies of indian labourers will present difficulties. further, when large &quot;schemes have been carried out, good cultivators will be re-quired; do not see how they can be found without indenting upon india. for these reasons large schemes to be deprecated until the country settles down and local labour is available.9. necessary corollary of (1) ; but (a) unsettling effect on gulf chiefs who are accustomed to and trust government of india will require tactful handling; (6) ja-panese commercial penetration will require uniform treatment in gulf.10. gladly agree.11. proposal not fully under-stood and more precise informa-tion requested, control would india exercise ?what practical government   of12. General remarks. subject to above remarks, readily accept general policy proposed; but fully endorse views of sir p. cox under heads 12 and 13. pre-sume (and strongly urge) that present practice of keeping com-mander-in-chief in india informed of all developments in the-military situation in mesopotamia will be maintained. if kept in ignorance of policy, and merely treated as supplier of materials and per-sonnel, no assurance that india&apos;s resources will be utilised and developed to best advantage. same applies to aden and other

For   tbe   present   recom-mends that Chief Political Officer be permitted to carry on according i to his lights in consultation with [ Army Commander as heretofore, I and that, as soon  as conditions i permit, a Commission of first-class ! men examine whole problem on the spot, and make detailed re-conimendations as a basis of future policy.potential theatres of war in area to be transferred.As regards conditions after the -war, India Avill apparently be responsible for some time to come for supplying troops for defence i and garrisoning -of Mesopotamia j oi- at any rate for providing re-I serves for all military operations.Strongly urge, in view of these con-! siderations, that India be kept fully i informed of all political develop-j ments which  may necessitate a call for troops.   Otherwise, con-templated policy would, in fact, be giving prospective Government of Mesopotamia a blank cheque on India&apos;s military resources.
