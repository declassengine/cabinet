Hote by the Secretary of State for War.en era! Number/7637 .The Array Canteen Committee, who are responsible for the supplies of beer (through canteens) to His Majesty&apos;s Forces, Haval and Military,  estimate the minimum requirements at 1,000,000 standard barrels per annum.     The amount consumed last year by the Army alone was estimated to be 1,500,000 barrels (which was obtained partly by beer due under the &quot;Restriction of Beer Act, 1916&quot;, partly by purchase in the open market and the balance by &quot;certificates&quot; authorized by the Board of Trade).The estimated minimum quantity required shews a reduction of -g- a million barrels on last yearrs figures, in spite of the increased demands by Colonial troops, Naval Barracks, Hospitals, etc.     The original amount asked for was reduced to 1,000,000 barrels at the request of the Food Controller.     This allows considerably less than -g- a pint per man per day which is an absolute minimum.The total output for the current year has been fixed    f by the War Cabinet at 10,000,000 standard barrels per annum.     jThe amount of statutory beer due to the Forces is 249,000 barrels per annum (forming part of the 10,000,000 barrels) leaving a deficiency of 751,000 barrels, .f;&apos;&quot;The Food Controller gave authority to the Army Canteen Committee for the issue of the necessary certificates during April lut the continuation of tnis authority was cancelled by his letter to t.he Army Canteen Committee received   i on April 30th.Many units in the Army are in consequence absolutely without supplies of beer today and arrangements for the supply of a large number of the others will have to be cancelled forthwith unless immediate action is taken, the A.C.C. being already inundafea^n^TK^appli cat ions from brewers for certificates to enable them to continue brewing, one of which is for the Hospitals for the Overseas Forces from Canada.It is estimated that the potential beer drinkers in the country (outside His Majesty&apos;s Forces) are 15,000,000 and the potential beer drinkers who look for supplies through the Army Canteen Committee approximate 1,750,000.Unless something.,.is done immediately the Army will be placed in a very much inferior positfanHToHThe Civil populatic i.e., the beer for the Army will be reduced by 84^ while the beer for the Civil population by only 60/i which would be most inequitable and invidious.Further the amount asked for on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s forces is less than their due proportion of the restricted output, though the troops in this country are surely entitled to greater facilities for the supply of beer and such &quot;extras&quot; tnan, say, Munition Workers, and other civilians, who have money which they can spend on such things, whereas the soldier has nosuch
such source of income and a less varied source of supply.In order to secure the 1,000.000 barrels requir the following alternatives are suggested(1)   The Pood Controller be&quot;authorised by the WarCabinet to exercise his power to issue licences the required amount, vis., 751,000 barrels, in addition to the 10,000,000 barrels authorized,(2)    The figure of 10,000,000 barrels fixed by the I Cabinet be reduced to 9,000,000 barrels and tha certificates for the balance of 1,000,000.barre be issued by the Pood Controller to the Army C Committee for the use of His Majesty&apos;s Forces.DERBY.3rd May, 1917
