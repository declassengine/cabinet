Treasury Chambers.  6th April,1917.Dear Mr.Lloyd George,Wo&apos; have pleasure in   i^jNiriling you herewith the Interim Hoport of the Committee of Snquiry into the Warv Expansion of Public Departments.     We received a formal appointment from the Lords of the Treasury subsequent to the private cobmunicctions which were toads to us individually and jf wo have drafted our report in the ordinary, form.     It has, however, been sent to you to be dealt with as you think fit.Yours faithfully,(3gd) Joseph Compton-Riokett.(3gd)   Midleton.(Sgd) Chas. S. Henry.Committee of Enquiry into the War Expansion of Public Departments.Interim Report.TO TH3 LORDS COMMISSIONERS OP HIS MAJESTY^ TREASURY.MAY IT PLEASU YOUR LORDSHIP3,1. Ws were appointed in February 1917, under the Chair-manship of ths Right Honourable ^ir Joseph Oompton-Rickett, M.P* with the following referencevt$o enquire into the growth and development of public departments froa the outbreak of war to the&apos;present time, to report upon:the incre?tse in personnel and the expansion of premises, and to consider and report how fat such increase and expansion havo been Correspondent with and justified by tho changed conditions induced by ths war;   tc report whether there is avoidable over-, lapping in tho work of such departments;   and generally to consider and report upon matters which in the opinion of the Committee are relevant end important in relation to the above matter.&quot; .     We have met up to the present on 19 occasions and have examined representatives of the following Departments :-H.M.Office of..Works.,The Treasury,The Ministry of Labour,The Department of the Director-Geiioralof national Service, The War Office, The Admiralty, The Ministry of Munitions, The Ministry of Pensions, The Home Office, and The Ministry of j?ood.WAR QABiOT.
3.     The Committee propose to defer an/recommendations which they may be able to make on the staffing, remuneration, and housing of Public Departments until the completion cf their enquiry.     Certain points have,, however,    come to light on which they feel it desirable to make immediate recommendation4.   - Although some cases cf temporary overlapping may be incidental to the development, cf new departments under the stress of war conditions, there are many which are avoidable and which require to be dealt with promptly.    In.this present. Report we are selecting only some typical cases and it must not be considered as covering the whole field of investigation.5.    (a)    The functions of the National Service Department to a considerable degree overlap those&apos; of the.Ministry of Labour and there is, in consequence, a multiplication cr officials and loss of power.&apos;(b)     There is also an amount of overlapping between the Labour Ministry and several other departments which has occasioned- a considerable amount of waste and disability.6.     The National Service Department rapidly gathered together a staff of some 700 persons costing about  65,000 per annum, as well as incurring other expenditure.    It mpist be admitted that the voluntary system of enrolment was experi -mental,  aid we-understand from public   statements, but not fromysvidence given tto^js that;.considerable, changes have recently taken place in the organisation.., The expenditure has undoubted ly been largely inflated by the issuo of appeals for volunteers before the requirements of the country in the matter of labour had been definitely-ascertained..7*     If the Department is to be continued, we recommend that it should operate through a revised registration of the man and woman power of the country, and that appeals should be made from time to time to particular classes for recruits to definite trades and occupations, as the requirements and importance of those trades demand.8. .   We are informed that the &quot;Employment, Exchanges of the &quot;Ministry of Labour are placing in employment an average v of 5,000 persons a. day3 irrespective of the National.appeal. We-&apos; are- of opinion; that.during the progress of. the war the machinery of the.&apos; Employment Exchanges is sufficient, and should have the. entire responsibility, for dealing with the applications, interviewing, and placing in employment, of Volunteers, except that the offices of the County and Municipal authorities should.be retained for the allotment of higher c3iass work, including clerical:,, professional, administrative, and similar employment, and that any machinery adopted by the National Service Department for dealing with agricultural labour should be utilised, so far as may be found necessary, for this purpose by the Ministry of Labour.
9. If the Rational Service Department could have ful-fillcd the function of a clearing house &quot;between the claims of the Army, Munitions and other forms of service and occupation, the Committee would have &quot;been prepared to uphold Its office in an advisory position.&apos;    They regret however, to have to come to the conclusion that such a position is not now practicable, and whilst acknowledging the services of those who have attempted tc develop it, they feel bound to recommend that its work should he amalgamated With that of tho Ministry of Labour, in whose hands they consider the disposition of labour throughout the country should be concentrated.10. .        The Ministry of Labour is a new   Department which took over&apos;.a,considerable amount of the labour duties of the Board of Trade, and which has necessarily contact with nearly every Government Department. &apos; We are of opinion that there is consider-able overlapping between the Chief Industrial Commissioner^ Department of this Ministry and other public Departments, and there is an increasing tendency for public departments having relations with Labour to deal themselves with Trade Disputes arising in their province, by means of special branches and of officers on the spot.     We do not suggest that the discipline of any Department should be interfered with by the reference of a labour- dispute.until such Department has found that it cannot be settled, in the ordinary course.     But should it be necessary to invoke any outsido help, whether of the nature of conciliation or of arbitration., v/e are strongly of opinion that the Ministry of Labour should be called in before the dispute has become seriously involved. - The Chief Industrial Commissioner1^ Depart-ment has a long record of difficulties successfully settled, and precedents to which to appeal.     It is very undesirable for outdoor officers attached to a department such as the Ministry of Munitions or the Admiralty to. be dealing with disputes, whether in their own departments or in firms controlled by thorn, which could be better treated by the Ministry of Labour.     Moreover, confusion is caused &quot;by the uncertainty as to which authority is the right one to appeal to in any particular case.We are therefore emphatically of opinion that there should be one authority, and one only, to deal officially with Trade Disputes, and that that authority should be the Ministry of Labour, which has already been entrusted with the pov/ers created by Parliament: to this end.11.       &apos;We. are of opinion that the carrying out of these Recommendations, as regards the Ministry of Labour and the other departments mentioned in relation to them, would result in an increase of efficiency and economy, and would assist the Ministry of Labour to prevent disputes by anticipation, or to enter upon the work of mediation before feeling had been excited.     It would, m addition, not only relieve other Government departments of the anxieties of labour troubles, but also diminish the number of representatives specially detailed to deal with them&apos;.
12.     The evidence before Us shows that during the war the control of the Treasury over Public Departments has been greatly relaxed, and in consequence the supervision of Par-liament has been restricted.     this relaxation has been deliberate and considered in some oases, because the exigencieo of war conditions prevented the disclosure of details and hindered a fuller examination.     Beyond this, however, the control of the Treasury has been set aside in certain oases through the -aotion of Parliament,15.     The Acts of Parliament creating new Departments (the Mihistry:of Munitions Act, 1915, the Itew Ministries and Secretaries Act, .1916, and the Ministry of National Servioe Act, 1917) differ from older models of euoh Acts (e,g, the Board of Agriculture Aot, 1889) in that they give absolute discretion to the Department as to the numbers of the staff employed, without the necessity for reference to the Treasury;   while the Treasury retains its control only over the salaries and remuneration of the staff,.. The appointments made under this power have already reaohed a figure consider-able over 10,000 in the new Departments we have eo far examined. We deprecate any step which would have the effect of permanently weakening the hand, of the Treoe-ury^ and consider that the oon-timiance of such, a provision after the Departments have got into eiape Is open to strong objection.   We particularly re-commend that the new Departments shall be as scon as practicable brought under ae close a supervision in matters of appointment and expenditure as formerly  retailed..14,     Further,we recommend that a Parliamentary Standing Oommittoe should be established upon&apos;whioh the Treasury should he represented, whose duty it would he to report to the Cabinet upon the relationship of these Departments, to control their development, and to assist in their demobilization after the war,(Sgd)   JOSEPH COMPTOH-RICKETT, .(Chairman)(Sgd)   HXD1ET0H(Sgd)   CHAS..
