WAR CASI1U1T .Purchase of Dominion Wool Clips . Note by the Secretary of State for War.With reference to the attached memorandum,  it seems cleany necessary in view of the increasing shortage of Y/ool supplies and the increasing requirements that the Government should secure at the very least the sane proportion of the Wool Clips throughout the Dominions as last year.     The &apos; shipping difficulty must be faced separately and should not interfere with securing control of the raw material ?\rhile it is yet time.     I think that an immediate decision should be taken to buy the Australian and New Zealand Clips. There is considerable force in the arguments for extending the purchase this year to South African Wool.     Every bale could be used to advantage in this Country, and even with all possible supplies obtained, Civilian trade will have to go short.     If it is considered politic to let the United States or Japan have a share of the South African Clip, this can be arranged later on; meanwhile the prudent policy would be to purchase it and thus secure complete control.DERBY.April, 1917.
The arguments advanced in September, 1916 for the acquisition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Dominion Wool Clips still hold good,, though since that date many of them have been strengthened and new factors have been introduced making State control of Wool supplies even more essential. The main factors a;o-ear to be as follows :-1.     The 20/.; shortage in the world&apos;s Wool supplies still continues .2. The reduction of shipping facilities makes it necessary to ensure that priority of such tonnage as is available is given to wool -required for Government purposes,3.     There is clearly insufficient Crossbred Wool to supply all military requirements.     It has therefore become necessary to increase the proportion of Merino used for military purposes.     In that case there seems no reason in equity for excluding the South. African Clip from the Imperial Purchase Scheme.     (The exclusion of the South African Clip this year from the Purchase Scheme has had several unfortunate results:  (l) Shortage of tonnage,-which could not be provided for private trade, and has caused a considerable accummulation of wool in South Africa;  (2)    Japan has purchased largely in South Africa thus creating fresh and direct connections which, will tend to cut out London and the Australasian markets after the.war and enable Japan to carry further her aggressive economic policy).1.     British and Allied demands are steadily increasing and the clothing for a large army next winter must be provided.2. , The entry of the U.S.A. into the war involves another heavy drain on Wool supplies .3. The present position of supplies of Wool for Military purposes is regarded as so important that the Army Council has instructed that a reserve of not less than nine months&apos; supply shall be built up in this country as soon as possible. The total available supplies at present under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government are insufficient to put such a proposal into effect.4. .   The longer the war lasts the greater becomes the stringency of the Wool position in all countries - enemy, neutral and Allied - and there will be undoubtedly a very urgent demand for Wool from all quarters when peace is declared The great textile area of Prance, round Roubaix and Tourcoing -which are only a few miles east of Lille - may be&apos; in the hands the Allies before the next wool season.     Although it- is impos-sible to say to what extent the machinery will be available for use, the Prench will wish, to resume their Wool industry at the earliest possible moment and they should not be held up for lack of raw material.  -  The Prench Government has already applied for 100,000 bales of Merino wool for their civil trade .
5.     It is &quot;becoming.more and more evident that economic questions after the/ v^rar will centre not so much   round the discovery of frosh markets for manufactured goods as in the safeguarding of supplies of raw materials to re-equip all the industrial countries, and to enable them to resume their manufacture and trade.&quot;. Advantages &apos; The measure of control already effected has safe-&apos;    of        guarded the needs of the British and Allied Governments for i,atc Control, the remainder of the present war.     It would have beendifficult,  if not impossible, adequately to clothe the Allied During war. armies without it.The advantages of this course have been as follows:-1.     It has enabled the British. Government to obtain supplies necessary for clothing the British and Allied armies at a reasonable cost, partly by limiting speculation in the raw material and partly by rendering it possible to fix prices through the several stages of production up to the finished article.2.     Government control has rendered it possible to ensure that the raw material is used for the export trade and for essential national purposes instead of being distributed to the highest bidder to be used for less essential purposes,  or for speculation.     The whole production of army material has now been organised on this basis,  and any alteration in the system of purchase and distribution of raw material during the war would seriously interfere with the maintenance of a steady output of cloth and clothing for the British and Allied Armies and would certainly involve increased cost to the Exchequer.3,      It has given to Eis Majesty&apos;s Government the power to allocate definite quantities of wool to neutral countries and thus to eliminate the economic and political difficulties which have occurred in the past as a result of intermittent embargoes on export.4,     The Central Organisation which has been set up both in the Colonies and the United Kingdom has considerably simplified the collection and distribution of raw &quot;Wool. . The saving of man-power alone in this country by concentrating the handling of documents in the hands of a small central staff and by arranging direct distribution to consumers without the intervention of numerous middlemen, is in itself of considerable importance at.the present stage.After Yifar . Even if the war should end during the present yearit would still be desirable in the national interest to control supplies of raw Wool.     The probable demands of Continental countries will counterbalance the decrease in the demands for Allied Military requirements, and unrestricted competition for raw wool by enemy countries and neutrals in the period immediately-following the cenclusisn of peace would accentuate the immense difficulties of re-establishing the Allied industries, particularly in the devastated areas,  during.the transitional period.     There will in any case be a world shortage Of raw Wool and the requirements of Belgium and NorthernErance
France alone will absorb very large quantities of the available supplies\     It is dangerous to prophecy as to what may happen but it is improbable that there will be any &apos;serious break in prices at the end of the war.South Africa.!, 1917-1918 Australian Clip.JI. PriceAn attempt was made in November last to include The South African Clip in the &apos; Imperial Purchase Scheme but as a considerable part of the Clip had already been sold to U.8.A. this proposal could not be carried through at that t.i*ie.     The result has been that South Africa has occupied a &quot;-privileged position compared with Australia and Hew Zealand and British manufacturers have found difficulties in obtaining their&apos;normal requirements of South African Wool competition with U.S.A. buyers..     In pre-war years London was a very considerable market for Seuth Africanwool.      Practically the whole ofthe Clipof 500,000 baleswas distributed through. London to the Continent, U.S.A. taking only 1,000 to 2,000 bales.     This season it is estimated that the United States will take up to 500,000 bales although she is now having considerable shipping difficulties. A large trade has been lost to the London market, and American manufacturers whose trade has extended considerably are replacing Australian by South African wool.     The permanent effect of this upon Australia may be serious. British control of the South African Clip would make it possible to place Australasian and South African wool on the same footing.As next season&apos;s Australian Wool Clip will be shorn from May next onwardsthe question of continuing Government control is an urgent one both from the point of view of British and Allied requirements, and from the point of view of the Australian producer.&apos;55^The price paid to the Colonial grower for this season&apos;s Clip was on the basis of 1913-1914 prices plus This was more generous than the price paid to the British -farmer whose figures were based on 1913-1914 prices plus 55^ and in order to bring the prices approximately to the same level it his been necessary to increase the price to the British farmer to the level of 1913-1914 prices plus 50/j.In considering what should be a fair price for the Colonial producer this year it should be borne in mind that the difficulties of the shipping situation may render it necessary to leave a considerable portion of the Clip in the Colonies.     If the Government does not purchase the Clip this would probably involve a considerable proportion of the growers in financial ruin.     It is, however, an important factor to be taken into consideration in deciding what is a fair price.It is submitted therefore that allowing for the rnuoh. larger risk of the British Government having to pay for Wool which will be idle in Australia or South Africa the basis of prioes should be the same as last year,  subject to the same arrangement by which, any profit made from Wool sold for other than Military purposes is divided between the Home Government and the Colonial Governments.
