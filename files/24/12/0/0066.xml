3 1 0 L^-lmB. CABINET THE SIIIPBIIILSIM SITUATION No to by the So or g t c,ryIt .ic desired to ce.ll the attention of the War Gebinot to the fact that certain decisions are urgently required i:i order that the &quot;building of merchant ships rr.y &quot;bo pressed on with-, perhaps the most important question is that cf the provision of steel-.&apos;    Tho question of the priority of steel &quot;between ship-building and other &quot;claims was referred &quot;by the Wer C\- bioot to Lord .CurMcn on April : 5,&quot;(Wor Cabinet 126, Minute 6 (c (i))..     It-is understood- however, that since the decision of the War Ct binot to appoint,Sir Eric God&amp;es to the poet of Civil Lord cf tho Admiralty Lord Oerzon considers that his functions in the allocation of steel have ceased.It is not clear, however, that the question of the ellocr.tion of steel-, will, in fact., rest with Sir Brie Gcddes.     It - is true that a proposal was made that Sir Eric Cedaes should be very closely associated with the shipbuilding side of the Shipping Controllers Commit bee, but no decision on this point was taken. (War Cabinet 130, Minute 14). ,It will be noted that the Shipping Controller has the -strongest objections to this proposal,     Even if the proposal to put Sir Eric Ged&amp;es in&apos;charge of all shipbuilding should be accepted by the War Cabinet, it is still not clear that he would have any Control over the supplies of steel.     The principal claimants for &quot;the supplies of steel areThe Admiralty The Ministry of Shipping of MunitionsThe Ministie Tho oar Office, The Air   Board.andSir Eric Geddes, as Civil Lord of the Admiralty, would only be aclaimant and not an arbiter in the tho consideration of the War Gabine take a decision as to who is supplies of steel betweenmaiooei&apos;It is submitted forA-t-hey snoula immediately , in iact, to be the arbiter of tho the various claimants.Yet another question which is hanging fire is that of the completion of merchant ships on the stocks.   It will be remembered that this question &quot;was also referred te Lord Cur3on under the same reference, but for the same reason as in tho case of steel, further action on the matter hes been suspended.- At the present moment the responsibility for settling this presumably rests with the Shinnies Controller, but nreaumeblv if Sir.EricGec.cesrs functions ere extended as&apos;contemplated, hemight have some part of this responsibility.It will be seen that the decision of both the above questions depends to a considerable extent upon a clear definition of Sir Eric Ge&amp;aes^ functions, end this would appear to be the first task, in the shipping connection to be undertaken by the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.(Initialled) M.P-.A8th May,1917vr-r-T-       ------..... ,^^...r........ .......        r^.,-.......
