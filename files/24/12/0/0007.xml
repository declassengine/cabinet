Should any of these fears materialise I apprehend grave dangers to English and the other Allies in Greece as also for the remaining Venezelists.   The Military terms of the ultimatum have been practically fulfilled and I am strongly of the opinion that no danger whatever would exist for the Army Salonika if the Greeks could be left alone under a conciliatory control.
