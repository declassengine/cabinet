any further communication should be addressed not to any individual by name,but to-the director, board of agriculture and fisheries, food production department, 72, victoria street,london, s.w. 1.and should quote the reference number and date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address: &quot;growmore, sowest, london.&quot; telephone:-victoria 8240.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1. 2nd May, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to submit the following Report on the work of the Food Production Department for the week ending1st May:-The WeatherAfter the justifiable complaints against tho weather which have formed the inevitable preamble of the Report for at least two months past, justice demands that an appreciation of its behaviour during the last 10 days should be recorded in these annals.    As a result of the improved conditions agricultural activity all over the country has been very marked and good progress has been made.PROGRAMME FOR 1918. The Programme for the 1918 Harvest which was submitted to the Cabinet on the 24th instant is being worked out in greater detail in the different Divisions of the Department in anticipation of sanction being received.    Several of the Agricultural Executive Committees report that they are taking preliminary steps to arrange for cultivating an increased area in their counties, and that they have called meetings of their District Committees and of farmers to impress upon them the need for early action.    The need for an early decision by the Cabinet is extremely pressing.    The Executive Committees have learned from the Prime Minister&apos;s speech at the Guildhall that the Government have decided to increase very largely the production of cereals in 1918, but they are anxious to know at the,earliest possible date the acreage in each county
which has to he broken up for wheat, and whether they can rely upon obtaining the additional labour, horses, and machinery, without v/hich their task is impossible of accomplishment.1 *       LOCAL ORGANISATION. Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. The following matters of interest appear in the latest reports received:-Bedfordshire - The Committee have taken temporary possession of 34 acres at Tempsfprd for the purpose of mole draining, and of 60 acres at Bolnhurst and Tibworth for summer fallowing. Cheshire - Possession has been taken of a grass farm of 146 acres at Calveley, and the Committee are letting the land and imposing specific conditions on the tenant for cleaning out watercourses, and for applying fertilisers.Hunts.- The Committee aro taking possession of a further 83acres of glebe land, now under poor grass, but on which it is hopedto produce a crop in 1917.Norfolk - The Committee are taking measures with regard to thecleansing of the channels and maintenance of the banks of the Bure,Wensum^ and other rivers, the congestion of which has resulted inthe waterlogging of considerable areas of otherwise useful land.They are also taking measures to regulate the flow of water throughmills under the Drainage of Lands Order, 1917.Suffolk. West - The Committee are taking possession of farms atStradishall, Barnardiston, Great Thurlow and Whatfield.Surrey - The Committee are taking possession of a farm of 226 acresat Windlesham, and are arranging to let it to a new tenant who isalready cultivating on their behalf.Sussex, West.- Possession is being taken of a derelict farm of175 acres at West Chiltington, and the Committee are arranging withthe owner to cultivate the land for 1918.
Wiltshire - Under pressure from the Committee, a firm of speculators who own down-land at Bratton, have agreed to plough up 100 acres;   the Committee are closely watching the progress made on this land.Radnorshire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm in the Parish of Llanyre and are about to let it for the purpose of the 1918 cultivation.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2) The extent to which the allotments have been provided under the above Order is very satisfactory.   The Department have now received particulars from 884 Borough or Urban District Councils regarding the provision of plots under the Order.    149,466 applications have been made for plots in these districts, and 128,416 plots, comprising a total area of 9,321 acres, have been provided.As regards London, where there has been a great demand for allotments, the County Council have now decided to permit the cultivation of all the suitable portions of their Parks and Open Spaces. This decision will enable provision to be made for many residents in districts such as Stoke Newington, St. Pancras, and Islington, where there is little land that is not built over.Horticultural Section. The preceding paragraphs give, in a summary form, an indication of the satisfactory response which has been made to the various appeals for increased cultivation of vegetables.    It must be remembered, however, that in addition to the 9,321 acres there mentioned as having been turned into &quot;War&quot; allotments, permanent allotments provided by local authorities are being cultivated to a gfeater extent than ever before.   Moreover, private enterprise is supplementing the work of the local authorities in providing land for cultivation.    Empty house gardens, discarded
flower beds, turned up lawns, paddocks in private estates have been brought under vegetable cultivation.Although the total amount of land recently brought under Horticultural Cultivation cannot be stated accurately, it undoubtedly amounts to many thousands of acres and it is not too much to say that the number of allotments in England and.Wales have been at least quadrupled since the outbreak of War.   As evidence that this is not an exaggerated estimate, the results may be given of an enquiry made from one of the leading seed houses with respect to the amount of vegetable seed sold this year as compared with that sold in 1914.   The average increase of sales of the chief garden seeds is 350%, an increase ranging from 75% in the case of Dwarf beans to 900% in the case of Parsnips.    It may be added parentheti-cally that the increase in the amount of seeds sold is so great as to be a source of embarrassment to the wholesale firms who have to consider the seed supply required for the coming year.   This aspect of the question is now engaging the attention of the DepartmentThe following instances will indicate the extent to which allotment holders, gardeners and the public generally have increased the ground under &quot;small&quot; cultivation.In Middlesex the increase amounts to 1,000 acres.    In a rural parish in Buckinghamshire comprising two villages, 66 acres of allotments and cottage gardens are being cultivated.    In the Borough of Southall the number of allotments previous to the issue of the Cultivation of Lands Order was 600, it is now 1,500. These are not isolated cases. Results no less noteworthy have been achieved in many boroughs and urban and rural districts.During the week 6,000 pamphlets have been distributed from the Horticultural Section. 24 Horticultural Representatives have been appointed during the week, making a total of 156.
Potato Spraying - Arrangements have been made with the manufacturers for the preparation of one thousand tons of copper sulphate and soda for spraying potatoes.    Honorary supervisors have been appointed in various,parts of the country to assist in the organisation of spraying.    A statement shov/ing the arrangements made for the supply of spraying machines and material has been issued to the Press and as a result 1,600 letters, containing orders or enquiries, have been received.Preservation of Fruit and Vegetables - Application is being made to the Treasury for sanction to incur expenditure in the training of instructors in fruit bottling and other methods of food preservation. Provisional arrangements have been made for the appointment of a chief instructor and premises suitable for holding classes (in London) have been found.Notification has been received from the Optical Munitions and Glass Ware Department of the Ministry of Munitions that arrange -ments are being made for ensuring an.adequate supply of bottles for fruit bottling.   ThO&apos;^necessary priority for the manufacture in England of small canning plants of the Home Canner Type hao been gasMftfri i:1; but it has not yet been found possible to arrange for the supply of can3 for use with these machines.II.     TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY,Preliminary steps are being taken to set up an organisation to collect information on the various methods adopted in breaking up grass land in different parts of the country.    The home requirements in regard to grass and clover seeds have been considered and recommend-ations made as to the extent to which restrictions could reasonably be placed on the imports of different species. Information on the growing and harvesting of grass and clover seeds in New Zealand is being collected with a view to deciding whether the methods adopted are applicable to this country.    A Bulletin dealing with the various kinds of hay making machinery has been prepared directing attrition to the most efficient labour saving types.
Notes have been communicated to the press on mole draining, and the production of food by school children. , A Bulletin dealing with the organisation of Agricultural Executive Committees has also been prepared and sent to the Printer.III.      LABOUR.Retention of Labour - As a result of further representations an assurance has been received from the Timber Supplies Department of the War Office that neither labour nor transport used in agriculture will be diverted for the purposes of forestry.     That Department is also considering the possibility of obtaining the use of horses not at present fully employed on work of National importance in order ***** to set free horses hired from farmers.Soldier Labour - Over 42,000 soldiers are now being employed on the land, and reports indicate that their work has given great satisfac-tion.   As indicated in the Departments Programme for 1918, it is of the utmost importance that the services of all skilled hands amongst these men should be retained on the farms and unless this can be arranged it will be impossible to proceed on any extensive scale with the breaking up of grass land this summer.    A decision upon this point is urgently needed, in view of the fact that the period for which the men have been lent by the War Office expires this month. Prisoners of War - Two schemes have been received for the employmentof batches of Civilian Prisoners of War.     The Home Office report that 722 Civilian   Prisoners of War have been released individually up to date for work on farms.Women &apos; s^ Branch ,The number of women who had enrolled under the National Ser-vice scheme for work on the land up to the 30th April was 20,254.    In some counties large numbers of the volunteers belong to the industrial and casual class of workers, from whom the proportion of suitable recruits for farm work will be low.   On the other hand, reports received from a number of agricultural counties state that a good type of recruit is forthcoming.The question of wages for National Service women Is a very difficult one.    In Oxfordshire, for example, it has been suggested that women with experience should receive the 18/- minimum wage for the first fortnight, and that the farmers employing them should be left to decide whether or not this amount should be
increased later. There is evidence in this county that the minimum wage will militate against the employment of women. On the other hand a village worker in the county, who only earned 14/- a week until last month, had her wages raised at once to 18/- when she proposed to register for national service, her employer  earing that she would leave him.Interesting reports are being received from all over the ,country as to the keenness of women to come forward and assist in food production. In most of the counties the women&apos;s Committees have under-taken propaganda work for increased food production as well as devot-ing their attention to questions relating to women&apos;s labour. In one village in North Carnarvon 15 women have been awarded armlets who are working on their own farms and small holdings, in some cases doing the entire work themselves, their husbands being away in the Army,Considerable progress has been made during the week with the appointment of Group Leaders for part time workers. In nine counties 13 Group Leaders have already been appointed, and 5 other counties have agreed to make such appointments, while Hampshire and Surrey propose to employ Group Leaders in the first instance as instructors to the national service recruits.Thirteen new training centres have been approved during the week. An interesting account of the work of women students while under training has been given by the principal of the Harper Adams Agricultural College, Shropshire, where a large number of girls have been received. He stated that out of the 40 pupils who attended the course during the Easter vacation only 3 proved unsatisfactory, and that the girls had shown great anxiety to learn, and several of them, at their own expense, had stayed on for a further month&apos;s training.Reference was made in last week&apos;s Report to the difficulty that is being experienced in obtaining outfits for women land workers. Although every effort is being made to speed up delivery it has only been possible, so far, to complete the requisitions received from 14 counties. Other counties have been supplied with certain items of the outfit, but have not as yet received complete sets.     This is seriously hampering the progress of the movement.
MACHINERY SECTION.Lt.Colonel E. YT. Allen of the A.S.C, was appointed on the 30th April to he Director of the Machinery Section of this Depart-ment in succession to liar. Perry who, with your approval, has placed his services at the disposal of the Minister of Munitions In order to direct the manufacture of tractors required to carry out the pro-gramme of food production for 1918.     Mr. Perry&apos;s work in procuring and organising motor tractors under the control of the Department during this Spring has been of inestimable value, and his transfer to the Ministry of Munitions is a serious loss.Motor Tractors.   A further 117 Tractors ordered through the Ministry of Munitions have been received, bringing the total of Government owned tractors up to   388.Of the 600 originally ordered through the Ministry of Munitions, 297 have now been received.     166 of the privately owned tractors which were loaned to the Department for Spring cultivation have been returned during the week.Steam Tackle.   In connection with the Food Production Programme for 1918 and subsequent years, it is essential to increase to the utmost extent possible the present limited supply of Steam Tackle.     Appli-cation has, therefore, been irade to the Ministry of Munitions to give special facilities to the makers of this machinery, and it is hoped that not less than 60 additional sets may be available for this Autumn1s cultivation.IV.    SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and PQe^in^^Sj^fs^ejiM^. Sulphate of Ammonia.   A notice has been issued recommending the use of Sulphate of Ammonia as a top dressing.     Owing to the fine weather there has been a renewed demand during the past week.     In order to enable a limited export to France to take place without Interfering with the home supply, a pooling arrangement has been made with export merchants, whereby Sulphate stored at the docks has been used partly for France and partly for Ireland.
Superphosphate.   A cargo of superphosphate purchased by this Depart-ment from Portugal has now arrived in this country and is being un-loaded.     Arrangements have been made for its sale through the princi-pal merchants In the locality.     A supply of superphosphate is also available in Liverpool, and Agricultural Executive Committees have been asked to draw the attention of farmers to this source of supply. Replies received from superphosphate and compound manure makers indicate that the Railway facilities are sufficient and that they are getting as many trucks as they are able to load.Maize.     Imports of maize are being well maintained, but by direction of the Wheat Commission it is now being sold mainly for human con-sumption.     In the country districts there are still stocks available for stock feeding, but a serious shortage is likely to arise in the course of a few   weeks.     In view of the small quantity of maize which will in future be available it seems desirable to take steps to restrict the use of maize to cows, so as to maintain milk production. The steps taken by the Department in regard to the price of maize have had a good effect.     A large number of towns have been visited, and corn dealers and merchants have agreed to sell at the price fixed by the Wheat Commission plus a moderate profit.Oil Cakes.   The importation of oil seeds for the manufacture of oil cake has so&apos; far been maintained, but owing to the shipping position the prospect of future supplies is very uncertain.     Every effort is being made in consultation with the Controller of Oils and Pats to secure as large a supply as possible.     The Controller proposes issuing an Order prohibiting dealing in oil seeds except by licence and fixing the price of certain seeds.     It is hoped by this means to keep the price of oil cake within moderate limits.
Molasses - An arrangement has been made by the Ministry of Munitions whereby the quantities of molasses required for the manufacture of compound cake will be provided, on the under-standing that this Department will take steps to ensure that the demands are not excessive.Seeds Section.Seed Potatoes - The Department&apos;s commitments in respect of the provision of seed potatoes for distribution by Agricultural Executive Committees have now been practically fulfilled. During the week the last shipment from Ireland has reached this country, -and a sufficient quantity of potatoes is available to supply the requirements of nearly all those who have applied to the Department for seed.    Supplementary orders received from Executive Committees have also been executed.The total quantity of potatoes purchased by the Department is as follows - from Scotland 6,150 tons; from Ireland 8,500 tons; from England 500 tons; total 15,150 tons.    Of this total, approximately 12,000 tons have been supplied to Agricultural Executive Committees, 600 tons to the Army Canteen Committee, 500 tons to Cornwall (in addition to the quantity supplied through the Cornwall Agricultural Executive Committee), and 1,000 tons to various allotment societies, local authorities, hospitals etc. making a total so far distributed of about 14,100 tons.    Arrangements for the distribution of the balance of 1,000 tons are being made.The condition of the consignments has on the whole been satisfactory, although considerable damage was at one time done by frost. The most serious losses have, however, been due to pilfering in transit.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt.Men.Rowland E.i*rothero, k.P. &apos; President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.
