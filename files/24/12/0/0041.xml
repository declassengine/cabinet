The clover not only provides Autumn keep for stock and tends to reduce the number of weeds, but enriches the soil by accumulating nitrogen, and also prevents some loss of nitrogen before the next ploughing.   Experiments whioh were carried out in the West of Scotland over a period of three years showed that red clover sown with lea oats produced an increase in a succeeding crop of barley of more than one quarter of grain and 6 owts. of straw per acre, as compared with barley following oats whioh were not sown out with clover.quality, made up to sufficient bulk with dry sand or sawdust, should be used.   The seed should be sown after the grain crop is above the ground and lightly harrowed in and rolled according to the condition of the soil.From 4 to 6 lbs. per acre of redclover seed of goodI am, Sir,Tour obedient Servant,H.M.

With reference to their letter of 23rd ultimo, relative to the calling up of agricultural workers as they attain 18 years of age, I am directed by the Board of Agri-culture for Scotland to inform you that, on further con-sideration of the question, they have come to the conclusion that it would be more satisfactory for these men, where the circumstances of the farm as regards staffing justify it, to obtain certificates of exemption in the ordinary way through Tribunals.The position of men attaining the age of 18 cn farms marked &quot;Excessive&quot; will, however, fall to be con-sidered just as if they were men holding cortificates of exemption on such farms, in accordance with the general arrangement outlined in the circular letter of even date dealing with this subject.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, H.M.
