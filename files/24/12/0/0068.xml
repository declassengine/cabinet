S B C 3 3 T. CM.- 668W A S     C A 3 I !J S 5?.JCH5 gHOEIBITIOII OF HACIITO:. (Memorandum by tho Chief -Secretary for Ireland. )Since the annotincement last wo ok of tho intended prohibition of 2aae Meetings in the United ringdon numerous public bodies and representatives of the horse breeders and owners of training stables in Ireland have iid3 urgent rearer sentations to me by deputation and by letter \with regard to the operation of the Order ae it affects the businesses of horse breeding and Training,     The ^towards of the Irish Turf Club have also waited upon me several times and I have had .eonvorsations with various official persons.Horso Breeding, as is well-known, is among the most important of the rural industries in Ireland.     The character of the soil and the climate both soom to help in the production of the class of horses which has been heretofore in great request not only in Surope but in the United States of America, and the subject is one which affeots farmers throughout the country&quot; as well as those wealthy people who maintain studs of thoroiighbrods and horse breeding forms,I am told that a revenue of something like  2,500,000 a year is ordinarily derived from the sale of Irish horses for export and that between the comencement of the V/ar and the end of 1916 upwards of seven millions pounds1 worth of Irish horses were exported,Lord Decies, who is Press Censor in Ireland and one of the ;jteuards of the Turf Club; the Commandor-In-Chief in Ireland, Sir Bryan Ilahon, who has an intimate acquaintance with Irish conditions; Sir william Helson,. who is a very capable business man and a large owner of thoroughbred horses, and numerous people ez-igaged in the business have assured me, and I m satisfied, that a certain amount of racing is essential to the carrying on of tho breeding industry to the best advantage.&apos;  It has also been pointed out to me that verj great hardship without any corresponding gain is Inflicted upon numorous owners of stables by the total prohibition of racing without notice.At the commencement of last year there were I aza told about 1,600 racehorses kept In Ireland.    In view of the restrictions upon racing ivhich have been introduced from time to time these have been reduced to about 920.     I am told that if the prohibition of racing could be brought gradually into effect and reasonable facilities given for disposing of the horses now in the stables, the blood stock in Ireland could be reduced with very little delay to
something like four or five hundred head and by management of supplies during the period which must elapse before the horses can be turned to grass the heavy loss involved in the total prohibition could be avoided.     This would involve the castrating of probably 300 thoroughbred stallions and the turning out of a considerable number of mares and colts as soon as grass is available.The stud owners and trainers press very urgently for postponement of prohibition for a month, which (as they say) would give them time to make some arrangements for the future. The Stewards of the Turf Club tell me, and Sir Bryan Mahon is of the same opinion, that, unless permission is given for a certain limited amount of racing for young horses, horse breeders will be, at a great disadvantage in the selection of stock for the maintenance; of their business until the close of the War.There ore in my opinion strong economic as well as social and political reasonsfor mitigating as far as possible the inevitable hardship of the stoppage of a. very important rural, industry,     I think that if I were authorised to make arrangements through the Stewards of the Irish Turf Club, who have the control of racing, for the sanction and regulation of a certain number of meetings during May and a very limited-&apos;-and indeed almost negligible number in June and July it is probable that the breeding industry could be put into a posi-tion where arrangements might be made for carrying on under altered circumstances during the war.I have inquired with regard to the consumption of Oats involved in this proposal,     I am satisfied that, unless large numbers of thoroughbred horses are to be destroyed, they will have to be fed to some extent with Oats or other purchased food during the next few weeks, and on the whole I have come to the conclusion that the course I have Suggested would be in the interests of the   industry and of Ireland generally and would not involve any appreciable demand upon our supplies of Cereals,- -(Intd.)   H.S.D.7th May, 1917.
