AIR BOARD. Report to the Cabinet.153/14.5th lay, 1917.,-eneral Policy-:1.        Lieut. Colonel 0*Gorman, Consulting Engineer to the Director General of tilitary Aeronautics, has recently been sent to Italy to report on the development of aero-nautics in that country.     The Italians have adopted a line of development somewhat different from that which has been followed in this country and In Prance and have made a special study of high-powered engines and large machines driven by more than one engine.Colonel 0&apos;Gorman, who was accompanied by an officer of the Naval Air Service, Commander Babington, has reported favourably on the CapronI aeroplane. .   This Is a very large machine, lifting a gross weight of 14,500 lbs., and driven by 3 engines of a nominal 200 h.p., and was designed to be a bomber. It lb suggested by Colonel 0lGorman that by the substitution of reserve petrel tanks for bombs-, it could be given an unusually long duration of flight and might prove useful for anti-submarine patrol work.     It has been decided to offer to accept six, if delivered by air at the British Anti-Submarine Station at 0tranto, where they can be tried on the barrage, and if successful more can be ordered for use in this country. As the aeroplanes are said to be available, it should be possible, If the above proposal Is accepted, to know the result of the experlmehti in two or three months.,2.        Further consideration has been given te the pro-gramme of orders for machines and engines to be supplied up to the end of the current year.     It Is Interesting to note that the Board have been Informed that of the machines now at the Front, the S.E.5., the Spad and the Sopwlth triplane are better than anything which the Germans now have;   the NIeuport and Sopwlth Scouts are as good as any-thing the Germans have;   and the De Kavilland 4 and Bristol fighter are better than anything except the Albatross Scout, which, however, their better armament enable them to deal with.     It must be noted, however, that the supply of the above machines at the Front is not large, but It will be increased as rapidly as output permits.3.        The Board have had under consideration a request that orders for aircraft and aero-engines should be placed , In Australia with a view both to facilitating the training j Australian squadrons, and to enabling Australia In course of time to become self-sufficing in the matter of aircraft production.     It has been fcund, however, that this course is Impracticable during the &apos;v*ar.     Staff and machinery would have to be sent from this country for the erection of the necessary workshops and subsequently the bulk of the material required in the actual manufacture would also have to be transported from here.     In these circumstances a suggestion has been made to the High Commissioner for Australia that a certain number of Australian artisans,
voluntarily enlisted for industrial work in this country, should be allocated to aero-engine factories.     This would provide in the course of time a nucleus of skilled workmen to start the Industry in Australia after the War.4.     The Controller of Aeronautical Supplies has com-municated to the Board an interesting statement based on past experience of the average periods which are required for the development and production of aeroplanes and aero-engines.     Prom this it appears that from the date that the design and conception of an aero-engine is formulated until the date when the delivery of the engine in series begins, 64 weeks must elapse.     The corresponding period In the case of an aeroplane is 34 weeks.V  These periods have rarely been attained and it is unlikely that as the standard of performance required rises, and as the manufacturing difficulties increase, they will be reduced in the future.Supply. 5.     The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes havebeen as &quot;follows: -Total for week ending 28th April,(i )   Total for April to&apos; date (adjusted),Total for March 1917,(ii)   Total for March 1916,Engines.   Aeroplanes,212 675 771 245252 772 716 219Note,    (i)   -The month of April included the Easter Holidays, and cannot be considered a normal working period.   -(ii)   Deliveries for March 1916, did not include any Admiralty figures. .  .In addition to the above, 11 seaplanes were delivered in the week ending 28th April.(Signed) H.P.HARVEY,Secretary to the Air Board,
