MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.Keport for Week ending Wednesday, May 2, 1917.PART I-ACTION TAKEN. &apos;--      Orders.The following Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations have been made by the Food Controller during the week:   .(1) Seed Potatoes (Prices) No. 3 Order, 1917, dated April 30, 1917.-This Order extends until the 1st June the prices and regulations governing the sale of seed potatoes. Without this Order such prices and regulations would have ceased to be in force on the 1st May.(2) By an Order dated the 1st May 1917, the Food Controller takes over from the original consignees all Burmah peas and beans to arrive in this country at the price of 377- per ton for hand-picked white beans and at corresponding prices for other varieties. All contracts for sale made by consignees and persons claiming under them are cancelled, and sellers and brokers are released from all liability as to brokerage.&apos; The transaction extends to between 50,000 and&apos;60,000 tons, the market price of which before the intervention of the Food Controller was about SOL.per ton. The beans so commandeered will be retailed at a price not exceeding 6d. per lb., as against the current price of Is. per lb.The original consignees are required to furnish the Food Controller on or before May 7 with full particulars of tonnage engaged or allocated for Burmah peas or beans, and such other particulars as may from time to time be required. The expression &quot;original consignees &quot; means the shipper or the person to whom the peas or beans have been or may be originally consigned.(3) Maize, Barley, and Oats (Restriction) Order, 1917, dated May 2, 1917. By virtue of this Order maize, barley, and oats and their products may be used only for seed or human and animal food, while tapioca, sago, manioc and arrowroot are restricted for use in human food. The Order comes into force on May 9, and the restrictive clause with regard to maize, barley and oats does not apply to such products and articles as are on that date unfit to be used in human or animal food.Supplies.Wheat.-A. formal contract with the Australian Government recording terms of purchase of 3,000,000 tons of wheat was signed on the 27th April.The Argentine Government having released 200,000 tons of wheat and flour for export to the United Kingdom and Allies on condition that wheat to the same amount is given back to them later in the year, the Royal Commission are making arrange-ments to despatch sailing vessels with wheat from Australia to the Argentine.The Royal Commission are not at present making further purchases of wheat options in TJ.S.A. at present prices, but continue both to buy actual wheat as it comes on the market and to switch their option holding into actual wheat as it is possible to do so. They have made considerable progress in this latter operation during the past week. &apos; &apos; &apos;; .Though the Wheat Commission have made large purchases of oatmeal and rolled&apos; oats they have not hitherto been charged with the importation of oats. Arrangements are in progress for combining the operations of the Oats Purchasing Committee, which is now charged with the supply of oats for the Allies, with that of the Wheat Commission, so as to include the whole of the purchases of cereals for the Allies in one organisation.a   (.33)2955-1   pk 1   40   5/17   e &amp; s a
. :Sugar. The past week has &quot;been marked by the loss of three cargoes, totalling 18,700 tons, and bringing up the losses since 1st February to 41,730 tons. In consequence, it is probable that work in the Greenock Refineries will have to be suspended towards the end of this week for a few days. - But, apart from this, the supplies for immediate consumption will not be affected; and the effect of the losses will be felt mainly in a continuance, for some weeks longer than was hoped, of the inadequate stocks of sugar in reserve. . It will now not be before the end of June that the Commission can hope to have built up its stocks to a figure that it can Tegard as affording a sufficient margin of safety.The subject of the maintenance of the sugar supply for the United Kingdom from September onwards for six months is one of serious preoccupation to the Ministry of Food and the Commission. The amount of sugar to be obtained from Cuba will be exhausted by September, if the market there follows its usual course; and the Commission will have to have recourse to Eastern sources of suppfy (Java and Mauritius) for&apos;its purchases on account of this and allied:countries. But the Shipping-Controller foresees great difficulty in providing the necessary tonnage for the longer voyages which this entails, and doubts are entertained as .to what Quantities can be brought from the East. The question is being closely examined with the Controller of Shipping. ..;Meanwhile, it has been thought advisable to consider what alternatives might be possible, so as to avoid a serious dearth -if not actual famine in sugar, in the latter months..of the year. The only one that presents itself is that, by some special arrangement, a larger part of the Cuban crop should be reserved for the Allies than would naturally be ravailable for them; and, in pursuance of this idea, the Foreign Office has been asked to consider whether it would be possible to ask the Govern-ments of the U.S.A. and of Cuba to prohibit the export of sugar from Cuba to any but allied countries, so as to compel neutral countries to obtain their supplies from the more distant East. .;:   Food Economy.The King has been pleased to dssue a Proclamation exhorting his subjects to practise economy and frugality especially in thense of every species-of grain. The text of this Proclamation is almost identical in.character with that of the Proclamation issued in. 1800 by King George III.The Food Economy Campaign progresses with-indications of success. On four -consecutive Sundays the Royal Proclamation on Food: Economy will be read in churches and ohapels of every denomination; it will also be read publicly by the Sheriffs throughout the country. Meetings in connection with the campaign are being held in every, part of the country. The Board of Education has issued a letter to Local Education Authorities requesting arrangements to. be made for instructing school, children in the-necessity for the saving of breadstuffs.Five million leaflets are being distributed. Alread)- a million and a half of these have, with the approval of the Ministry of Munitions, been put into the pay-envelopes of workers in controlled establishments. Every channel of publicity is being used to bring to ..the notice of the women of the country the urgency of reducing the consumption of wheat and corn. Communal kitchens are being organised and established by many of the municipalities.Compulsory Rationing.A department of the Ministry of Food has been formed to be called the Rationing Department.   It will deal with : (1) The construction of the central and local organisations for compulsory rationing on the general lines laid down in the Report of Lord Somer-. .   .&apos; : leyton&apos;s Committee.       -   - .....(2) The general administration of the sj^stem of compulsory rationing, if and -\   ; .       when it is put into/operation.        : . i.&apos;The new department-will proceed forthwith to form: the organisation, and prepare and print forms, tickets^ &amp;c, necessary for the rationing in the first instance of bread. ^-     - -   &apos;&apos;.   -
There have also, been formed (1). a Quantitative Committee to consider the quantities of bread&apos; allowances to various classes of the population, on the, basis of average rations of given amounts, and.(2) a Consultative Committee to consider all questions of policy/ in connexion with compulsory rationing. and any matters of importance referred to it by the Rationing Department: .&apos; , &apos;The new department, as responsible for the systematic organisation of the regulated demand for,, and distribution of, bread will necessarily be in close touch with the Mills Control Committee which will control the distribution of flour from the&apos;mills to the bakers&apos; shops, in accordance with the regulated demand;.   Enforcement of Orders.Bread. By arrangement with the Public Control Department of the London County Council, bakers&apos; shops in the Administrative County of London have been thoroughly inspected during the week, and proceedings have been authorised against 57 sellers and bakers in respect of 65 offences, chiefly for selling loaves which did not conform to the provisions respecting weight. This provision is causing some difficulty, as a London Police Magistrate declined to convict on the ground that it was unreasonable to require a loaf to weigh exactly 1 lb. or an even number of pounds, and the Tower Justices have stated a case on a similar point for the decision of the High Court.Public Meals.-As the-result of inspections in London and Dublin it appears that genuine efforts are being made to keep within the allowances prescribed by the Order. The same may be said of the principal towns, but in the country districts the Order seems to be less rigidly observed.Conditions of Sale and Hoarding. The Conditions of Sale Order appears to be widely disregarded especially in the poorer districts where the purchase of other vegetables is made a condition of sale for potatoes. Conversely the complaints as to alleged hoarding are singularly few and in no case has a prosecution been found necessary up to the present time. ; -:Miscellaneous.On May 1, an Inter-Departmental Meeting was summoned by the Food Controller at the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the question of dogs. Captain Bathurst presided, and the following recommendations were made:- &apos;-(L) That the number of licences issued to any one person should be limited to four, subject to special exemptions in case of pedigree kennels ;(2VThat the tax for licences should be: 7s. 6dLfor first (log, 11. for second, - 21. for third, and 31. for fourth;(3) That dogs in general should be taxable when one month old ;(4) That existing licences should expire not later than July 1 ;(5) That new licences should be charged at a double rate except in case of owners of dogs licensed before 1 January 1917, or in case of devolution by death of former owner ;(6) That an opportunity be given for surrender of dogs on or prior to the date fixed for the expiration of existing licences, and that in such cases half the licence paid should be refunded ; -(7) That the present exemptions for farm dogs should remain in force ; (8) That hounds should be exempt from taxation until 12 months old; (9) That the blind man&apos;s dog should not be taxed ; (10) That in Ireland dogs should become taxable at one month, and that the charges for permits be raised to 5s., 10s., 11., and 11. 10s. for first, second, third, and fourth dog respectively ; (11) That all dog shows be abolished ;(12) That more stringent measures be taken for the destruction of dogs found wandering without collars, and that all sales of dogs be prohibited.In view of the fact that, owing to the excessive number of exemptions from taxation in the North of Scotland, sheep dogs are causing serious losses among sheep and lambs by worrying, it was suggested. that the regulations governing the exemption of sheep dogs should be revised, and that, if necessary, a Defence of the Realm Order be issued to deal with the worst districts, both in England and Scotland, after consultation with the Agricultural Department concerned.a 2
part ii-summary of food position:- . ^ ; Imports.&quot;The imports of food during the week ended 28th April were better than usual, the total; quantity of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs imported (as shown in Table A.) being 218,544 tons as compared with 204,675 tons in the preceding week, 196,313 tons on an average of the 17 weeks of the present year, and 220,088 tons in the corresponding week of 1916. The improvement as compared with last week is mainly due to considerable increases in the imports of maize and sugar.; / .There was a heavy fall, however, in the imports of wheat-which amounted to less than 75,000 tons, compared with over 90,000 tons in the previous week, a weekly average of nearly 91,000 tons since the beginning of January, and 114,000 tons in the same week of 1916 -a fall which was only partially neutralised by an improvement in the arrivals of flour. The imports of bacon, hams, and lard were maintained at a high level, and those of butter and cheese, though lower than in the previous week, are satisfactory when compared with last year. The imports of margarine and of barley remained considerably below the average./ The.total imports of fifteen of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, in the first 17 weeks of 1917, show a deficiency of over 550,000 tons, or 14 per cent., as compared with those for the same period of 1916. The articles chiefly responsible for the decrease are wheat (168,000 tons), oats (165,000 tons), barley (153,000 tons), sugar and glucose (130,000 tons), and wheaten flour (58,000 tons). The imports of maize are higher by 105,000 tons, and cheese, butter, and lard also show considerable increases.. ; ; &apos; Consumption of Meat and Bread.Meat. The supplies of dead meat entering certain large markets (Table B.), in the week ended 21st April, though a little higher, in the aggregate, than those of the previous -week (which were affected by the Easter holiday), were again considerably lower than in the corresponding week of 1916. At Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow the figures showed only slight changes from those of the previous week, but there were reductions of 2, 3 and 17 per cent, respectively as compared with a year ago. In London there was, an increase of 5 per cent, on the previous week, but a fall of 11 per cent, compared&apos;with the same week in 1916. The total reduction in supplies at all the four markets during the first three weeks of April, compared Avith the corresponding period of 1916, is about 8 per cent., or very much the same as in March.In the week ended 28th April, there was a marked further reduction in London, the supplies being 18 per cent, below those of the previous week and 2 per cent. below those of the corresponding week of 1916 (which were exceptionally low).The supplies of fat cattle and fat sheep at 51 markets (Table C), which had increased in each of the two preceding weeks, also fell considerably in the week ended 25th April. The number of fat cattle was 18 per cent, knver than in the preceding week and 5 per cent, below the average for the same weeks of 1914-16. In the case of fat sheep, the corresponding reductions were 10 per cent, and 13 per cent, respectively.The increase in the number of pigs marketed continued, however, the supply being 6 per cent, greater than in the previous week and 5 per cent, above the average for. the corresponding weeks of 1914-16.;,. Bread--Forms asking for returns as to the quantity of flour used for bread making and flour confectionery were issued at the end of April to some 800 members of the National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners and 667 completed have been received..,.   The following is a summary of the data : :..      &apos;.;   Quantity of flour used, j..- Number of sacksPeriod. ; (260 lbs.).Four weeks ending April 28th, 1917   - - - -   210,217Four weeks ending March 31st, 1917 - &apos;- - - 218,736 Four weeks ending April 29th, 1916   - -      , -    199,132
Wheat. The stocks of wheat on April 30th&apos; are estimated at 1,097,000 tons against 1,132,000 tons on April 23rd, and 3,441,000 tons at the corresponding date in 1916. &apos;Barley. The stocks are estimated at 395,000 tons on April 30th against 408,000 tons on April 23rd and 444,000 tons on April 1st.Oats.  Stocks on April 30th are estimated at 276,000 tons as against 319,000 tons on April 23rd and 584,000 tons at the beginning of April.Maize. Stocks on April 30th are estimated at 162,000 tons against 151,000 tons on April 23rd and 163^000 tons on April 1st.Wholesale Prices.The latest wholesale prices of food and feeding-stuffs (Table D.) again show increases in oilseeds and cake, the prices of Egyptian cotton-seed, palm kernels, and Calcutta linseed having risen by 56s., 53s. and 28s. per ton, respectively, since the previous week and those of linseed cake and cotton-seed cake by 13s. per ton. Palm kernel cake, however, the price of which rose considerably in the preceding week, shows no further change. There were also further marked advances, amounting generally to l\d. or 2d. per lb., in the prices of tea at the public auctions ; a recovery of 4s. per cwt. (following a fall of 11s. in the previous week) in New Zealand butter; and slight increases in the prices of Plate maize and of Irish and Canadian bacon.As a result of the Wheat, Barley and Oats (Prices) Order of the 16th April, the average prices of British wheat, barley and oats, for the week ended 21st April, show decreases of 3s. 9d. per 480 lbs., Is. Id. per 400 lbs. and Is.&apos; 2d. per 312 lbs. respectively ; and the price of country straight run flour in London, which rose last week from 64s. Qd. to 66s. a sack, has now reverted to 64s. Qd. Decreases are also recorded in the prices of beef (English 5s. Qd. per cwt., Argentine chilled 2s. Qd. per cwt.), mutton (English 4s. 6c?. per cwt., Argentine 7s. Qd. per cwt.), Danish bacon (3s. per cwt.) and Danish butter (3s. Qd. per cwt.). Imported wheat, town-made flour in London, rice, sugar and cheese show no change.Compared with a month ago, there have been increases of 78s. to 110s. per ton in the prices of oilseeds, 28s. to 43s. per ton in those of oil-seed cake, 6s. Sd. per quarter of 312 lbs. in British oats, 3s. per cwt. in Irish and Canadian bacon, and varying increases, equivalent to about 2\d. or 3d. per lb. for ordinary qualities, in the tea sold at auction. Flour, both country and town-made, shows a rise of Is, per sack. The principal decreases are 11s. per cwt. in Argentine chilled beef, 9s. per cwt. in New Zealand butter, 5s. Qd. and 6s. Qd. per cwt. respectively in English mutton and beef, 4s.. Qd. per cwt. in Danish bacon, and 2s. M. per 400 lbs. in British barley. Wheat, maize, rice, Argentine mutton, cheese, and sugar show little or no change in price.The increases since the corresponding date in 1916, which have affected every commodity dealt with in the Table except cube sugar, have been greatest in the case of palm kernel cake (163s. per ton, or 115 per cent.), British oats.(26s. 2d. perA   2955 1 ^ 3The figures accordingly indicate a decrease of some 4 per cent, in consumption during April as compared with the preceding month. Such a decrease is to be expected as a consequence of the warmer weather in the latter part of last month and May should show a further fall.  \&apos;:As compared with the corresponding period of last year the consumption shows an increase of only b\ per cent., as against the increase of about 10 per cent, for March oiven by the comparatively small number of returns to which reference is made in last week&apos;s Report.The returns on which the above figures are based only cover a small proportion of the total flour consumption of the country (about 6 per cent.) but they are made by representative firms well scattered all over the pountry and should give a fair indication of the general trend of consumption. If further returns are received in the course of the,next few days, the completed data will be given in the next Report.Stocks.
312 lbs., or 81 per cent.), linseed cake (17% per ton, or 71 per cent), Calcutta linseed (2&amp;ls. per ton, or 69 per cent.), Egyptian cotton-seed (161s.. per ton, or 56 per cent.), and rice (9s. 9d. per cwt., or 52 per cent.), English Cheddar cheese and. Canadian cheese have risen by 52s. Qd. per cwt. (46 per cent.) and 54s. per cwt, (50 per cent.) respectively; British wheat by 44 per cent.; maize by 35 per cent.; and British barley by 30 per cent. The price of country straight run flour in London is 23s. per sack (or 55 per cent.) higher than that of &quot;country whites &quot; a year ago, and the price of the new war flour is 14s. (or 29 per cent.) above that of London &quot;town households &quot; at that date. There have also been substantial advances in palm kernels (35 per cent,), bacon (28 to 38 per cent.), butter (19 to 31 per cent,), Argentine mutton (20 per cent.), and tea. The amount of increase in tea prices has varied with different qualities. It has usually been greatest in the case of the cheaper kinds, the prices of which have advanced by roughly 50 per cent., or about 6d. per lb., as compared with a year ago, when prices were also exceptionally high. So far as the commonest teas are concerned, the effect of this increase on retail prices will he partially neutralised by the arrangements recently made for the provision of a supply of tea to the public at a reasonable price.Apart from sugar, the smallest increases have been in Argentine chilled beef (6 per cent.), English mutton (10 per cent.), and English beef (16 per cent.).
