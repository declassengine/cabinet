Any further communication should be addressed not. to any individual by name, but to-The Director, Board of Agriculture and-Fisheries, Food Production Department, 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. 1. I and should quote the Reference Number and ! Date of this letter.Registered Telegraphic Address:-&quot;Growmore, Sowest, London.&quot; Telephone: Victoria 8240.I  B VJ^ 5x3 ALL ^t;:-t mrd of Agriculture and Fisheries,Food Production Department,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W.9th May, 1917.386i.Sir,I have the honour to submit the fallowing Report of the Food Production Department for the week ended 8th May:-Cultivation for 1918. A confidential letter has been sent *w&amp;*m*&amp;mmi*m-to the Chairmen of the Agricultural Executive Committees pointing out the urgent necessity, in view of the grave and increasing peril of the submarine campaign, of the utmost energy in extending the cultivation of land for the 1918 crop.     The need for immediate steps being taken in the Counties is so pressing that for the purposes of this Circular it has been assumed that the Cabinet&apos;s sanction will be given to the main proposals centained in the Departments programme, which was submitted on-April 20th.      The circular letter accordingly stated that 3 million acres ef grass land must be broken up in England and Wales, that not less than 5 million acres must be brought under wheat, an additional million acres under barley and oats, and an e^tra 200,000 devoted to potatoes.     Each Chairman has been informed of the share of increased arable that has been apportioned to his county by this, Department, and each Committee has been asked to proceed at once with the consideration of that figure and the apportionment of the County&apos;s quota to the varidus districts.     Great difficulty, however, is being experienced in getting County Executive Committees to take any definite action with regard to breaking up grass lands until they receive an official assurance that the essential additional requirements in the way of labour, horses, machinery andjfinancial assistance will be met in due course.     The definite decision cf the Cabinet upon these points is of daily increasing urgency, and its
postponement is causing very serious embarrassment.Drainage of Lands and Prevention of Floods. An addition has been made to Regulation 2M of the Defence of the Realm Regulations empowering the Board to exercise the powers of the Drainage Boards, Commissioners of Sewers and similar bodies, where these are not being sufficiently exercised, in order to prevent injury to land by flooding or inadequate drainage.     The Beard have been given the same power of raising money by rates and otherwise, as is possessed by the authorities referred tc... An Order has been made delegating these powers to Agricultural Executive Committees so that the Committees may secure combined action by authorities already invested with drainage powers. Several of the County Committees are getting forward with schemes in which the powers delegated by this and the earlier Drainage of Lands Order will be utilised.I. LOCAL ORGANISATION.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.Many of the Committees are actively engaged in formu-lating their programme for 1918, and have, as In Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire^ summoned meetings of land agents and occupiers of land, in order that they may carry the agricultural public with them in their efforts.     They are also exercising constant supervision over the operation of the Orders made by them with regard to the 1917 crop* and making fresh Orders for the purpose; thus, the Buckinghamshire Committee dealt, during the week, with about forty cases of this kind, the Hampshire Committee with about forty, Norfolk with about forty-five and East Suffolk with about fifty-five.     There are few instances of transactions concerned with fresh pieces of land, but the following matters may be of interest :-Bedfordshire - Temporary possession has been taken of 178 acres at Milton Ernest for the purpose of mole-draining, and of 60 acres at the same place for the purpose of cultivating.
Somerset - The Committee are taking possession of 50 acres at Alier in order to secure the cultivation immediately by a tenant, who would otherwise only come in at Christmas next.Suffolk, West -   The Committee have found that there is much more derelict land than they had anticipated, and are re-organising their staff and sub-committees in order tc deal with it. Sussex East. -   Possession is being taken, for the purpose of letting, of a farm of 345 acres at Etchingham, owned by a syndicate and left derelict, and also of a farm of 277 acres at &apos; illards Hill, Yorkshire, North Riding -   The attention of the Duchy of Lancaster has been invited at the instance of the Executive Committee t$ the case ef two upland farms in the Pickering district, reported te be practically derelict for want of reads and other essentials.Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2) Reports received as regards the operations in 908 Boroughs or Urban Districts show that out of a t$tal number ef 156,964 applicants, no fewer than 136,313 have been provided with plots containing a total area of 10,008 acres.In the County Brraugh of Norwich a Food Production League has been formed with a view particularly of encouraging the retention of plots after the period of the war, and arranging for the sale of surplus crops not required by the cultivators for their own consumption.An interesting report comes from the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey.     In spite of the difficulties of securing land for cultivation within its area, the Council has provided 135 plots, thanks to the generosity of several owners of land, and has distributed half a ton of seed potatoes, 9,500 plants and 56 collections of seeds.     One case of success in spite of obstacles is worth recording.     The Council entered on a plot in Denman Street, London Bridge, which is surrounded by tall houses and lies 20 feet below the roadway, but is open to the sun&apos;s rays between the hours of 8 and 4 for most of the season.     The land has been used as a dump for bricks, tin cans and dead cats, and one of the Board&apos;s
experts reports that, though he would not have previously advised its cultivation, the enthusiasm of the four plot-holders, (who havo unlimited supplies cf manure available) has already brought about such a change as to justify the belief that a fair crop of vegetables will be produced.Horticultural Section. Potato Spraying -   Small   growers are responding very readily to the invitation issued by the Department to purchase Knapsack Spraying Machines and materials for potato spraying.     260 Machines have already been purchased and orders have been received for 1,200 machines (making a total cf 1,460).     Orders for materials sufficient for spraying 10,000 acres have also been received.     Orders have been placed by the Department for sufficient spraying materials (600 tons of Copper Sulphate and 750 tons of soda) to spray 56,000 acres twice.     About half a million bags for holding the spraying material have been ordered, and instructions for the preparation of the spraying material are being printed on each bag.Demonstrations in spraying have been arranged in London and at Wisley, in Surrey, and applications have been received from the Mayors of provincial towns for speakers to address meetings on the subject of spraying.The number of local Horticultural Representatives is now183.Fruit Bottling -   The Ministry of Munitions is undertaking to secure a supply of bottles for fruit bottling and as soon as that Department is in a position to fix the price, steps will be taken to notify the public that supplies may be obtained through the Food Production Department.     From applications already received it is anticipated that there will be a demand for several millions . of bottles.Home Canning Plant -   The firm which is undertaking the manufacture of small canning plants has received the necessary Priority-Certificate from the Ministry of Munitions, and is already engaged
in the manufacture of 100 machines.II.   TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY.A Bulletin dealing with the feeding of pigs has been prepared and considered by the Sub-Committee.     Special stress is laid   on the value of the outdjcr system of pig keeping as a means of economising the use of purchased feeding stuffs.     The question of storing til-cakes through the summer is being considered.Steps are being taken to ensure that early information is Obtained of the outbreak of epidemic diseases of plants, and some twenty mycologists and entomologists in different parts of the country have been asked te act as correspondents.Notes have been communicated to the Press on - (1) Destruction of sparrows, emphasis being laid cn the necessity for avoiding the killing of other birds.     (2) Reasons for the present restrictions on feeding rf pigs and poultry.     (3) Suitable crops for late spring sowing.III.    LABOUR, Agricultural Labour and Military Service - As a result of the Deputation received by the Prime Minister on the 2nd April from the Federation of War Agricultural Committees, an agreement was arrived at between the Army Council and the Federation with regard to the calling up of men engaged in agriculture.This agreement has been embodied in an Army Council Instruction to which various additions have been made to regularise the procedure of the Military and Agricultural Representatives in the country.     The Army Council Instruction with a covering memorandum has been sent to the Executive Committees and to the Board&apos;s Representatives.     A memorandum indicating the procedure with regard to the issue of Certificates excepting men engaged in agriculture from the provisions of the Military Service (Review cf Exceptions) Act, 1917, has also been sent to the Agricultural Executive Committees.
Soldier Labour -   Numerous and urgent representations have been received asking that the Category &quot;A&quot; men due to return to their units en the 10th May, may be retained for a further period. This is a matter of very great importance, not merely because the calling up of the men must inevitably check and disorganise the final and supreme effort which is being made to increase the harvest of 1917, but because the withdrawal of indispensable labour already on the land, at the very moment when it is universally recognised that without a great increase sf labour the programme for 1918 must necessarily be a failure, is tending to paralyse the campaign for increased food production at its very inception.   Representations^ of an urgent character have been made to the War Office with regard to this matter, but so far without avail.Harvest Labour -   The scheme drawn up by the National Service Department for the organisation of Public and Secondary School Boys, Civil Servants, School Masters, Ministers of Religion, etc., for harvest work on the land is being circulated to all Agricultural Executive Committees.     The Committees are being instructed t^ appoint representatives to serve on the Advisory Committee tc be set up in each county for this purpose.Women&apos;s Branch. The number of women volunteering under the National Service scheme for w6rk on the land whose enrolment cards had been received up to the 7th May was 24,147.     While the demand for women workers in a few counties exceeds the number of recruits, in the majority of counties the number of women volunteering for work is far in excess of the openings available.     In this connection it is satisfactory to report that the Women&apos;s Committees are now co-operating in almost every county with the Agricultural Executive Committees, and it is becoming more generally recognised that for them to work effectively in an isolated manner Is impossible.
The number of National Service women at present receiving instruction is 1,072, 849 being at training centres, and 223 being in receipt of maintenance allowances while under instruction with farmers;    in addition, 662 women are receiving instruction who are not enrolled under the National Service scheme, making a total in all of 1,734.     Eight more Group Leaders have been appointed for part-time workers, and applications fcr further Group Leaders have been received from two further counties. Outfit.   The supplies of outfits are being received more satisfactorily.     In all, 1,167 complete sets have been issued to county stores, as compared with demands received by the Department for 2,281 sets.     During the week, about 1,000 pairs of boots have been received, and of 99 requisitions from various counties, 61 have now been completely satisfied.MACHINERY.A further 135 Tractors have arrived from America bringing the total number of Government-owned Tractors up to 523.     Out of the 600 Tractors ordered from the Ministry of Munitions 432 have now been received,.     A further 15 privately-owned Tractors whioh had been placed at the disposal of the Department have been returned.   -The work of the Tractors has improved since the advent of better weather.     Agricultural Executive Committees are now receiving from farmers so many applications for Tractor assistance that many more tractors than those available could be kept fully employed apart from the carrying out of the ploughing up programme for 1918*     Although it was originally intended to return all the privately-owned Tractors on the 1st May, the retention of the majority of them has been arranged for owing to the urgent demands from Executive Committees for more Tractors and to the excellent work which some of them have been doing.     In this connection it Is interesting to note that the demand by farmers to obtain
Tractors of their own is at the present time quite phenomenal, and that the criticism of the work of the Tractors which was prevalent during the very wet weather has new given place tc generous appreciation.IV. SUPPLIES. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Section. Sulphate of Ammonia.       Proposals for regulating the distribution of Sulphate of Ammonia have been discussed with makers, dealers and others interested, and a comprehensive scheme has been prepared which will encourage local dealers and cc-cperative. societies to store and in other ways secure satisfactory distribution.     The deliveries for agricultural use in April were about 30,000 tons, as against 8,100 tans in the same month last year.Basic Slag. Production in April was 34,500 tsns and the deliveries 33,800 tons, both of which figures are somewhat lower than in March.Superphc sphate.   The second cargt? cf superphosphate purchased by the Department has arrived, and by arrangement with the Irish Department it is being unleaded in Ireland.     The supplies in some.parts of England and Wales are now equal to the demand. Lime.       Considerable progress has been made with the enquiry as regards lime, and a number of steps have been taken with a view tc increasing production.     A machine for crushing chalk has been tested, and one is being installed experimentally at wcrks at Crsyden.Feeding Stuffs.     The Customs have asked the Department to become responsible fcr the disposal cf certain &quot;c&amp;ndemned&quot; food stuffs, and arrangements are being made with a view to their conversion into cattle food.
Seeds Section.mmmmSeed Corn.     At a conference with the Council of the National British and Irish Corn Trade Association - representing about 850 of the chief dealers in seed corn, manures and feeding stuffs in the United Kingdom - the general position as regards supplies for the 1918 programme was discussed, and the Association expressed their readiness to assist the Department and Agricultural Executive Committees in every way possible.     On the invitation of the Department they nominated three members tc serve on a Committee tc prepare a scheme for the selection and provision of seed corn in 1918,Seed Potatoes.   The total quantity distributed by the Department is 15,000 tons, leaving a surplus of rather less than 250 tons still to be disposed cf.     The supply available after meeting the orders - original and supplementary - of Agricultural Executive Committees has been allocated to various applicants, chiefly allotment-holders and farmers, who have applied to the Department for assistance in obtaining &quot;seed&quot;.     Certain areas infected with&quot;Wart Disease&quot; have been unable to obtain supplies of varieties which are immune to the disease, and an effort is being made to meet these cases by the purchase of immune varieties from Ireland.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M,P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
