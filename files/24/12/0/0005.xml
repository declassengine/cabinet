GERMAN EAST AFRICA.Note by the Representatives of India.The Committee of Cabinet on Territorial Desiderata having decided that it is essential to the safety of tlie Empire that German East Africa should be incorporated in the Empire by the terms of peace, we think it incumbent upon us to urge the claim of the Indian people to free and unimpeded emigration and settlement in German East Africa on the following-grounds :-First. The Indian Army has largely contributed to the conquest of the country, has suffered heavy losses in action and from sickness, and lias borne its full share of the toils and hardships of the prolonged campaign. The exclusion of Indians from permanent settlement on the lands thus won, or the imposition of invidious restrictions and disabilities on Indians visiting and residing in the Colony, would be felt to be an act of unmerited injustice and ingratitude. It would confirm the suspicions and distrust with which educated Indians are inclined to view the commercial and colonial policy of the Empire, and embitter the relations between India and the rest of the Empire.Secondly. For over two hundred years there have been intimate relations and constant intercourse between Western India and East Africa, especially German East Africa. A large Indian population has already settled in German East Africa, and large Indian interests have grown up. Emigration from India with a view to agricultural settlement has been encouraged by the German Government. The Indian people not unnaturally expect that when the colony passes from German to British hands these facilities will increase, not diminish.Thirdly. The settled policy of the Self-governing Dominions bars free access to them by Indians. We should indeed desire to see some relaxation of the present practice, and greater consideration for the position of Indians already settled in them, but we recognise the right of the Dominions to determine the classes of emigrants which they will admit, and we neither expect nor claim for Indians an unrestricted right of entry into them. But this makes it the more necessary to find some other field of expansion to which Indians may freely go for trade or settlement. It will now be available in German East Africa as a result of the war. No other territory is so suitable for Indian colonisation, or so convenient of access.Fourthly.-Indian colonisation would be for the benefit and progress of the new territory and its indigenous population. Except, possibly, in the high-lying plateaux, the native population is altogether insufficient for agricultural needs, and contains no elements of progress. The climate and the soil are well suited to Indian agriculture, and the Indian cultivator would bring with him methods and implements that the native population would understand and imitate.Austen Chamberlain.
