SJS C R g T.* 649.WAR CABIM?. 190SHIPMENT 03? WKHfrT FROM AMERICA.(Letter from Royal Commission on YJheat Supplies, to Food Controller, dated 3rd.May, 1917.)Dear lord Dovonport;,A matter of the greatest urgency has arisen on which I think a Cabinet decision should ho sought.   .As a result of the recent discussions the Ministry of Shipping have placed at our disposal 734,000 tons of shipping for May loading U.S.A. and:Canada for the4 United Kingdom.   It must be borne in mind that French end Italian shipments have also to be provided for, and cables from America indicate that we shall not be able to load mere then G4C.000 tons in May for the United Kingdom.     We have enough grain and other articles.bought to fill all the shipping offered us, and we found it difficult to understand what-caused the difficulty of shipment.     After discussing the matter with the Shipping Controllers Department, it appears that the reason.is that two British Government organisations eziet in America which control the movement of railway traffic for shipment. Mr.Guthrie-; who is the Shipping Controller*s representative con-trols the ocean transport of all Government cargo from the U.S.A., and has full charge of bringing forward grain for shipment, but the Ministry of Munitions also have a representative who has nothing to do with.ocean transport, but acts independently cf Mr.Guthrie and brings forward munitions to the ports for shipment. The result is that to some extent at all events munitions occupy railway cars, oven though there is no tonnage for their transport to England, thus causing car shortage and congestion, and it appears to be solely due to this divided control that the cereal shipments for May will not come up to our requirements.I understand that the Cabinet have decided that the prescribed minimum of food stuffs shall.have an absolute priority in the allocation of tonnage, but in practice this decision is not operating, because they have not at the same time made a definite decision that the minimum of food stuffs shall also have an absolute priority over the American rails.     It would, seem that there ia only ono remedy for this state of affairs, and that it should be put in force without delay, viz-, that the two Goverii-ment- organisations in. America having charge of this matter should be amalgamated and placed under the sole charge of the Shipping Controller, and that the organisation should be given definite instructions from the Cabinet that the minimum of food stuffs have an absolute priority in.passage over the American rails in the same -manner as they have priority in the allocation of tonnage.Yours very truly,(Sgd )     J..F.Beale.
