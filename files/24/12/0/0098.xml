-----------  This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1917.SECRET. G.T.-697.1PROPOSALS TO MEET SUBMARINE ATTACK.Letter from Ministry of Shipping to Secretary, War Cabinet.Sir, &apos; May 10, 1917.I AM directed by the Shipping Controller to inform you that, in connection with the memorandum by Sir Leo Money [Paper No. G.T.-660] &quot; Proposal to meet the Submarine Attack,&quot; for the consideration of the War Cabinet he desires to add the following observations : As the Cabinet are aware, the policy of concentrating shipping on the North Atlantic has been followed for some time past, and this Department has consistently urged that the Supply Departments should arrange for the maximum proportion of their supplies to be obtained from this source. The Controller welcomes the memorandum as showing that with America in the war, and given her wholehearted co-operation, it is possible to go very much further in this direction, and to secure that instead of having a deficit of ships there will be some reserve on the number required to bring in the minimum of essential imports to meet future losses.In order, however, that this may be possible, the following are necessary : (a.) The fullest possible organisation of the producing sources of America to secure that the essential requirements of the Allies in grain, steel, oil, &amp;c, can be met.(6.) Americans agreement to supply neutral countries with these articles only after the requirements of the Allies have been fully met.(c.) A complete organisation of the American Railways and Ports to enable the necessary traffic to be handled.(d.) A drastic reorganisation of production, consumption and distribution (with substitution for many articles at present regarded as essential of others less difficult to obtain) in the United Kingdom.(e.) A special effort directed to increasing with the utmost rapidity the discharging facilities at all Western Ports of the United Kingdom from Glasgow to Plymouth inclusive. The development of coastal mine laying (and the prospect of further development as the result of a convoy system), the increased risks in the Channel, the strain upon destroyers of east coast work, the convoy arrangements, &amp;c, all combine to make this action of the greatest importance and urgency, and the Ministry is taking it in hand at once.While the Controller fully concurs that it is of the most vital importance that the above reorganisation should be effected in order to render possible a reserve of vessels to replace future losses, and to keep the North Atlantic fully supplied with tonnage to lift both what America can now export, and the increased quantities which it may be hoped that she will be able to supply, he does not in present circumstances consider that this reserve need be formed by actually laying up vessels and keeping them idle. It might be better that the reserve be maintained by a policy of deliberately keeping a number of vessels on routes in which they are comparatively safe. The wholesale withdrawal of vessels from such routes would tend to take away from this country the neutral vessels which are still bringing &quot;imports, also the knowledge that vessels were actually laid up and idle would tend to frighten neutrals from our shores, and make it much more difficult to refuse tonnage to Trance. Italy, or Russia, or obtain it from America and the Colonies, and would greatly encourage the enemy. [620]
Subject to these observations the Controller recommends that the following action should at once be taken : (a.) That the Cabinet should issue definite instructions to the Departments concerned that, inasmuch as any shortage of shipping will force the country to rely almost entirely on the North Atlantic for all its main supplies except ore, sugar, and comparatively small quantities of other imports, every Department is at once to proceed as rapidly as possible to exchange their present source of supply for supply from North America and Canada; and that, in addition to such transference of supply as can be in this way immediately arranged, each Department is at once to prepare a complete programme including provision for reduced consumption, both Government and civilian, substitution (e.g., home meat for frozen, and wool now used for civilian requirements, and cotton instead of New Zealand wool), and increased production. This programme should be based upon the fact that we cannot expect to import more than a very small proportion of our supplies from other sources than the North Atlantic, and should include detailed statements as to the reasons for the Department; being compelled to go elsewhere: for any of their requirements. It is important that an early date for the production of these programmes should be specified, and the Controller would urge that the time given should not be long.(o.) As soon as these programmes are obtained further communications should be made to America urging her to organise her resources, including production, consumption, substitution, railway and loading facilities, and the prohibition of export (except of any surplus) to neutral countries in such a way as to enable her to meet the programmes and requirements of the Allies. A preliminary programme warning her of the nature of the request might be . sent at once.(c.) The Controller would urge that the effect upon Lancashire cotton trade of the prospective shortage of vessels for export should receive the immediate consideration of the Government. . (d,)&apos; It- is desirable that the India Office and Colonial Office, in conjunction with the various Dominions, should be warned at once of the necessity of taking off vessels plying between India, the Dominions, and this country in order that they may work out the consequences and make any necessary arrange-ments with the Treasury for affording relief.(e:) It is desirable that a specified number of vessels (e.g.,not less than four months&apos; net losses at the rate current from time to time) in excess of the number required to import all the North Atlantic can supply plus a specified quantity from other sources should be kept out of dangerous zones. The Ministry would then try to find employment for such reserve vessels, which would leave them reasonably safe and accessible-, and, so far as such employment is available, retain the reserve in this manner rather than by laying them up. If it is proved necessary to lay vessels up as a reserve, it would probably be preferable to do so in or near North America so as to be immediately ready to load.I am, &amp;c.(Signed)    &apos;   JOHN ANDEESON.o
