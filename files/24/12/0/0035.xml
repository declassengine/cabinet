DESPATCH Z 2.Subject : THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT AND THE WAR.British Embassy, Petrograd.31st March, 1917.I have, the honour to send some notes on the present military situation.The New Government.1. If the present cabinet had been appointed by the ex-Emperor of his own free will or under joint pressure of the Allies, the change from the old regime would have been all in favour of the more energetic prosecution of the war. The new Government has more brains, honesty and breadth of view than the old. It has the confidence of the vast majority of the Russian people, and it is sound on the war.The worst of it is that the majority of the Russian people has no means of making its will felt at the capital, where there is a danger that extreme elements may get the upper hand.2. The Council of worhingmen and soldier deputies. The mutiny on the 12th March came unexpectedly, and the harm was done in the next 48 hours. While the members of the present Provisional Government worked hard to prevent anarchy, the advanced group got hold of the mutinous army and organized the so-called Council of Workingmen and Soldier Deputies, to which each company, squadron, and battery sends a representative elected by the men. This Council interferes in everything, and has to be reckoned with by the Provisional Government, for it has control of the only military force in the capital. It represents at most the 219,000 workingmen in Petrograd factories and 150,000 so-called soldiers, about 20,000 of whom have rifles.3. The Social Democrats want peace and their paper, the Pravda, openly advises the troops in the trenches to shake hands with their &quot; German brothers.&quot; The great majority of the soldiers, however, are sound on the necessity for continuing the war. The Council of Working Men and Soldier Deputies has passed resolutions condemning a war of conquest but has gone no further.Under pressure from the Council the Provisional Government has promised that the men who accomplished the revolution shall not be disarmed or sent away from the capital. &quot; Order I,&quot; issued by the Council effectually undermined discipline by, telling the men not.to salute their officers except when on duty, and not to give up their arms even if ordered to do so by their officers.4. The troops. When the revolution broke out there were no regular troops in the garrison. If there had been a single loyal regular regiment, the movement would have collapsed at the outset. The troops in and around Petrograd are dep6t troops depot battalions, some 5,000 to 8,000 strong for feeding the Guard regiments at the front, and a few depot regiments, each about 10,000 strong affiliated to line divisions at the front. The officers consisted of those left behind on mobilization, those recovering from wounds and the last batch from the military schools. Such as opposed the movement openly at the outset were killed, but these were comparatively few, Most of the senior officers hid. It is natural that the men regard such officers with mistrust and refuse to allow them to return. The men have selected certain officers whom they allow to command them. These are generally men of talents other than of the military type.The conditions vary in different units. In the Preobrajenski Dep6t Battalion there are still&apos; officers confined by their men. In the Semenovski Battalion three officers were killed but the Colonel and most of the others retain their position. The Izmailovski Battalion has expelled three of its officers, the Finlandski 22. In the Volmski Battalion only three officers were killed, but all the officers who really belong to the Volinski Regiment some 40 in all have been driven away and the men have placed a guard over the mess to prevent their return.   Only the attached officers(b17/296)   20   5/17   h&amp;s   4463wo
remain and the battalion is commanded by an ensign who before the war was an instructor of gymnastics at Warsaw and who will retain his authority just as long as he carries out the wishes of the Battalion Committee of rank and file elected by the men. The 8,000 men of the Yegerski Battalion have expelled 22 of their officers and are now commanded by an ensign of 6 months service who before the war was a lawyer! At Tsarskoe Selo the relations between the officers and men of the Depot Battalion of the 1st Rifle Regiment of the Guard seem cordial, and only the three senior officers have been expelled, but in the 4th (late Imperial Family) Regiment some five officers, mostly with German names, were retained for several days under arrest. The 1st Railway Regiment has. only kept 16 out of 64 officers and treats these with contempt.Under arrangement with the Minister of War and General Kornilov, the Commander-in-Chief of the troops in the Petrograd military district, I have visited several units with Major Thornhill and have spoken to the representatives of the men, something on the lines of the notes in the Appendix attached to this report. We have found them with hardly an exception loud in their enthusiasm for the continuation of the war. The Battalion Committee are generally the best men in the units with here and there a sea lawyer. We both think that an officer of courage and character could very soon get the men under order, but such officers are unfortunately rare.Meanwhile the main idea seems to be to do as little work as possible. So called trained men, who have eight weeks service, only work four hours a-day, and recruits work for five or six. The General Staff offices are closed after 5 p.m., and the Artillery Department shuts an hour earlier. The men are children. One of them said to me in the Duma: &quot; Yfe have been slaves for 300 years, you will not grudge us a few weeks&apos; amusement.&quot;5. The Officers. General Kornilov, Commanding the Petrograd District, is retaining many of the discarded officers in Petrograd with the idea that the men will themselves eventually invite them back. It was indeed reported a few days ago that the Finlandski Battalion on restarting work found it could not get on without its officers and invited them to return.The position of the officer can be imagined. The soldiers new won liberty has gone to his head, and he loses no opportunity of making his officers feel that he is their equal. Numbers of officers come to the Embassy and ask to be sent to England to fight on our front. They say their position is unbearable, and many of them have no confidence in the continuation of the war by the new Russia. It would be easy to raise several battalions from such officers. Of course the depot officers are not the best in the army, but it is feared that those officers that depot units have discarded are many of them the best officers in Petrograd. There have; of course, been many instances of private revenge for the infliction of punishments that were no doubt richly deserved.Of course the officers have been in part to blame. They have lived apart from their men. In some cases, though it is believed rarely they have treated them badly, they generally lack character and ability to adapt themselves to new circumstances. Their great misfortune and ours for which no one has a right to blame them is that they did not come over with the men.Many of them are lazy. In one battalion visited lately after our interview with the men we were thrown in the air, after the Russian fashion, and were carried into the mess room. Immediately the men left twelve of the officers sat down to bridge. In another battalion visited on the same day the officers were working harder though then-methods according to our ideas were original. The Commander told me he had started a &quot; regimental university &quot; in which he lectured on &quot; the psychology of the masses,&quot; and his second in command on &quot; the military law of various nations.&quot; At any rate these officers were trying to get into touch with their men and to give them something to think about.6. Effect of the Revolution on the War. It is difficult to estimate the result which this upheaval will have on the conduct of the war. Any regular officers in close touch with the men are very pessimistic. My French colleagues think that Russia will play a very small part in the alliance. They fear a commune followed by a reaction. My Italian colleague who speaks Russian well and has been visiting units, is equally pessi-mistic. In one unit the men told him in front of the few remaining officers, that they regarded them as traitors. In the Litovski Depot Battalion, which has only 17 officers remaining out of the 123 it had before the revolution, the men, when they got him apart, said they would never serve under their officers and asked for officers from the allied armies. &quot;
v kornilov and his staff are rather more hopeful. the general himself is very popular, and he is working day and night to get things right. they think they will form a &quot;peoples army&quot; from 60,000 of the idle troops now in petrograd and that the j will be able to induce the others to go to the front. the peoples army will contain 24 2-battalion rifle regiments, formed from the 16 depot battalions of the guard, 5 dep6t line regiments, 2 dep6t machine-gun regiments and odd opolchenie units in the petrograd military district.it is just possible that there may be a wave of enthusiasm that will make up for everything. the enemy is still 300 versts from petrograd, and the thaw now setting in will prevent any important operations till the beginning of may. by then the russian army may have pulled itself together. the spirit of the troops in petrograd is worse than in other towns. major neilson brought back very disquieting news from the northern front, but odd information received from other parts of the front is more satisfactory. we can only hope that the mad ideas of petrograd will not infect the troops in the armies.7. The fleet. there is no use in trying to conceal the fact that the position is grave. kronstadt is still in a state of anarchy. the men have selected as their com-mander&apos; a general with no recommendation but extreme weakness of character. fortresses and ships cannot be commanded in war time by popularly elected committees. kronstadt will be ice free in three to four weeks&apos; time. the capital is full of german agents who spread all sorts of disquieting rumours. the people believe the worst always, and they are very subject to panic. they have no real patriotism or power of &quot; sticking it out &quot;in the sense of the western nations.8. Discipline. it seems doubtful whether the men will be satisfied with any con-cession that will not at the same time reduce the fighting value of the army to zero. in our visits they have always treated us in the most friendly manner. they ask many questions, often shrewd ones, regarding our discipline. in one battalion a man asked what would be done to a british officer that hit one of his men, &quot; for instance, in the face.&quot; the next question was &quot; what punishment would a british officer get who called his company a herd of pig-faced cattle.&quot; i got out of this by explaining that our language was poorer than the russian.Man poiver.- in a former despatch i stated that certain members of the legislature alarmed at the report that the late government was considering the desirability of calling out all men from the age of 43 to 55 sent a petition to the emperor. the following is a summary of this petition and the reply given by general gurko, then chief of staff.petition of 28 members of the council of empire anfi imperial duma (members of the special council for the consideration and collation of measures for the defence of the empire),the signatories address themselves direct to the emperor being of opinion that the danger which threatens the country can only be avoided by the direct intervention of the supreme power.the army now absorbs 300,000 additional men per month,so far there have been called up   ...      ...       14,500,000there remain of ages 18-43 ......       11,500,000total   ......      26,000,000this reserve of 111- millions would seem at first sight inexhaustible, but itincludes : 2,000,000 men left behind in occupied territory or absent without leave. 5,000,000 men physically unfit.3,000,000 men necessary for production in the country.there l-emain only 1^- millions, of which half the recruit class of 1919 only is of excellent material.it is evident that our free reserves will be exhausted in five months. there &quot;are two proposals : (a.) conscription for nationalities now free.(6.) calling up of men over 43 years of age. -       -  &apos;proposal (a) will give very few men and proposal (6) will only provide extra mouths to feed. &quot; &quot; %(4463)
It may be objected that we have only taken 10 per cent, of our population, while France has taken 16 per cent., but the taking of 10 per cent, in Eussia represents a heavier burden than the taking of 16 per cent, in France owing to various reasons such as the enormous distances in Eussia, the scantiness of the population in contrast to the extent of territory, insufficient railways, impassibility of unmetalled roads during a con-siderable part of the year, the distance of fuel supplies from metal mines, the severity of the winter necessitating extra work in combating snow drifts, the poor equipment in steam-power machinery e.g., the number of h.p. in France in 1908 was 15 times greater than in Eussia and, finally, the undoubtedly small productiveness for various reasons of the Eussian labourer in comparison with the labourer of Western Europe.We must not only abandon all idea of taking 300,000 men a month in the future, but we must make up our minds that no great proportion of the male population still in the country, except the class of 1919, can be taken without completely destroying the national fabric.What must then be done ?Two methods are suggested : (1.) The increase of the strength at the front by drawing men from the Lines ofCommunication. (2.) The decrease of the monthly casualties.In France the strength on the Lines of Communication, exclusive of depot troops, is to the strength on the front as 1 is to 2. In Eussia the proportion is as 2^ to 1, i.t., the strength on the Lines of Communication is proportionately 4 times as great.After making every allowance for the influence of the conditions alluded to above, this proportion is stilL altogether indefensible, and the worst of it is that the proportion of men on the Lines of Communication shows every tendency to increase at the expense of the number of troops at the front.Special plenipotentiaries should be sent throughout the Lines of Communication to pick out men for the front. At least one million men could be taken and the rear services would work all the better after their evacuation. Every effort should be made to increase the percentage of wounded that returns to the ranks, and with this object arrangements should be made for the treatment of the slightly wounded in the immediate rear of the army without evacuation to the interior of Eussia.In spite of whatever measures are taken the country cannot continue to supply 3.00,000 men per month, so we come to the second method the decrease of casualties.We must have recourse to everv method for saving life, such as steel helmets and improved entrenchments, for it would be sad indeed when at length our growing industry provides us with the technical equipment we require, we &apos; should be found lacking in the men that we now waste so lavishly.In conclusion it is recommended that : (1.) No more men should be taken from the country except the class of 1919, andthe classes of subsequent years as the men reach the age of 18. (2.) Nationalities now excused service should be gradually made liable. (3.) Skilled workmen should be returned to factories on substitution by men of the2nd Ban Opolchenie, or by White Ticket men. (4.) The number of bayonets at the front should be increased at the expense of therear services, and the lightly wounded should be treated in the immediaterear.(5.) Human material should be grudgingly expended till the further increase of our technical equipment enables us to deliver the final blow.GeneralGurko replied to these conclusions point by point by the Emperors order on the 22nd February. He wrote his reply in complete agreement with the Commanders-in-Chief of all the Fronts.(1.) It is impossible to tie the hands of the Command, as the result of the war depends on the campaign of 1917.However, the 150,000 men of the 2nd Ban Opolchenie and the 600,000 White Ticket men will only be taken as a last resource.(2.) The number of men of nationalities now free is small. Most are natural cavalrymen, and it is not proposed to increase the cavalry arm. Of the people formerly excused service in Turkistan, 263,000 have been taken as labourers, and only 55,000 remain. The Caucasus and Finland have been excused for political reasons.
(3.) the return of skilled workmen from the front is, except in special cases, considered undesirable by the command in the field. the selection of these men would be certain to give rise to discontent among their less fortunate fellow soldiers, to produce an endless string of petitions and abuses of all kinds, and to contribute to the demoralization of the army.(4.) the figures regarding the proportion of men at the front and in rear are disputed. it is said that on the 14th december the proportion of the army in front, including the auxiliary services was 65 per cent. every effort is made to increase the number of fighting men at the expense of the rear services, but any great change is difficult owing to the wretched . communications. it is impossible to treat the wounded in the immediate rear during big actions as they cannot be immediately evacuated in case of necessity.(5.) every effort has been made in the past and will be made in the future to economise men, pending the improvement in our technical equipment, but censure of commanders in connection with a matter so delicate would un-doubtedly affect their initiative and spirit of the offensive. the possession of. heavy artillery and of technical equipment, even if inferior to that possessed by the enemy, would of course lessen our losses, but of this we cannot dream for the present at any rate, and meanwhile the enemy is determined not to let the initiative slip from his hands and drags us into continuous fighting.in discussing the above petition with one of its authors he allowed that the chief reason why the burden of a loss of 10 per cent, of the population was felt in russia was the national lack of the power of organization.at the beginning of february the depot units contained 1,900,000 men, of whom 400,000 were permanent cadres. to this total must now be added the 750,000 men of the class&apos;of 1919.the white ticket men of the classes 1916-1910 numbered 126,000 and are now in dep6t units. the re-examination of the nine classes 1909-1901 will be carried out by the autumn of the present year. ( .; the class of 1920 may be taken at the very end of 1917 but not earlier.the mobilization section tried to persuade the stavka to take all men up to the age of 35 from the lines of communication for the front, but had no success.if the losses in 1917 equal those of 1916, the depdt units will be run dry by the end of the year as they were in the autumn of 1 915.in an interview with guchkov on the 7th march, five days before the revolution called him to the post of minister for war, he expressed himself as thoroughly in agree-ment with the idea of militarizing labour, but added that such a measure could only be introduced by a government with the confidence of the people. it is to be feared that the provisional government will never attempt so radical a change.many of the workmen are patriotic. some. 10 to 20 per cent, before the revolution would have welcomed defeat in order to strengthen their hands to overthrow the government. the remainder hate the germans, but disclaim any idea of conquest. their motto is &quot; national defence, but not offence.&quot; they do not wish to conquer constantinople, the straits or galicia. in the published opinion of this group before the revolution &quot; the whole strength of the country should be mobilized for its defence. the present political regime is not only designed for the oppression of the working classes, but is also an obstacle to the mobilization. of the whole living strength of the people for defence, and is thus bringing the country to military disaster.&quot;i have, &amp;c.a. knox, Brigadier-General,Military Attache.
