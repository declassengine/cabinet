Reduotion of horses15ifmemorandum hy the Secretary gl^taigjjFojJa .I circulate the following memorandum hy the Army Council :-1.      The War Cabinet, with a view to reducing the import of horses, asked (::&quot;&apos;ar Cabinet 12?  (12 (e)))  that a statement should be prepared whereby if necessary a reduction of alternatively 2%% or %% of the horses in Army charge could be made, and how such reduction should be distributed over the various branches of the service, and further hov&quot; far such reduction could be met by additional motor traction.2. As regards importation from America, mules, and artillery horses of the required stamp, cannot be procured in the united ivingdom in sufficient quantities; the Army Council are therefore strongly averse to cutting off that source of supply altogether, although the numbers will in future be limited to those which can be brought tc this country on the upper decks of cargo ships.The Secretary of State has spoxen to Sir Joseph idaclay cn this subjeot,&apos;, and the latter agrees that this would be perfectly feasible and would not mean the giving up of any space that could otherwise be utilizod for the oarrying of grain.3.      The Army Council have issued instructions for reductions in-the number of horses in Army charge in the United-kingdom, - which will aggregate roundly&apos;20,000.     As regards training units&apos; athome, it must be borne in mind that of the&apos;-horses allotted, those of the -mounted branches fulfil a double purpose, as they are required both for the instruction of personnel in equitation and arc also avail-/&apos;-able as drefts to replace wastage.   - &apos;      , .
4.      As regards reductions in France and other theatres of operations,  it must he remembered that vehicles which accompany fighting troops must be capable of moving off roads in and over.difficult country,.and such vehicles cannot be replaced by mechanical transport without destroying the mobility of the army as a fighting machine.Cf the 370,Co0 horses.with the armies in France 109,000 are riding horses, of which 30,COG are in cavalry units,  15,COG are pacx animals and 247,000 draught horses.The field for the substitution of mechanical for horse drawn vehicles is therefore limited, but the matter is being carefully examined in consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief in the Field, with a view to ascertaining what changes in that direction are possible without detriment to fighting efficiency.A reduction of the Cavalry in France is also being considered.5.      In regard to the question of motor transport taxing tho place of horse drawn vehicles,  the Council desire to place on record the fact that at tine present moment they are unable to obtain sufficient motor transport for existing requirements, and that until an increased cut-put of motor vehicles is assured any substitution of motor for horse-drawn transport is not a practical proposition,and any lmrge reduction of the number of horses in the -field can therefore only be made at- the expense of the mobility of the armies, with the exception of the Saicnik   theatre.- In regard to the latter,   the number cf pack animals was very largely increased during last summer and autumn in view of a possible advance into the mountainous, region, but steps have recently been taken tc reduce the animal transport tc the normal s-aale, and the animals thus rendered surplus arc be ills-transferred tc Egypt to meet new requirements in tho latter theatre,PEEBY.8in may,  1917-
