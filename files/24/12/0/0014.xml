From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 21 lh April 1917. (Received 28th April, 11.30 a.m.)Secret. Reference to your telegram of 29th March. Administration and political control of Mesopotamia and Arabia. Subject to following remarks, we readily accept general policy proposed by the War Cabinet. First and foremost, however, we would fully endorse the view of Sir P. Cox in the middle part of paragraph 12 and paragraph 13 of his telegram T. 1049, of 7th April.Our hold on Bagdad vilayet is by no means secure yet. Any attempt to introduce civil administration while martial law must perforce remain predominant can only lead to confusion and inefficiency.War Cabinet&apos;s conclusions contain no reference to military effects of their proposals, present or future.We presume there will be no alterations in the present practice of keeping Commander-in-Chief informed of all developments in the military situation in Mesopotamia. It should be remembered that India can now to a certain extent balance and check needs of Mesopotamia with the needs of other theatres in which she is interested and with those of India and her frontiers. If kept in ignorance of policy to be pursued in Mesopotamia and merely treated as a supplier of materials and personnel, there can be no assurance that India&apos;s resources will be utilised and developed to the best advantage.The same applies to Aden and the other potential theatres of war in the area to be transferred.It is, therefore, strongly urged that no change be made in the procedure now existing, but as there is no mention of intention in this respect, War Cabinet&apos;s orders on this point are required.Turning to conditions after the war, we would point out that so far as we can see, India will have for some time to be responsible for supplying troops required for the defence and garrisoning of Mesopotamia. In any case, she will probably have to provide reserves for all military operations. We would strongly urge, in view of these considerations, that some procedure be laid down by which India should be kept fully informed of all political developments which may necessitate a call for troops. Otherwise, it would appear that contemplated policy would be giving in fact to the prospective Government of Mesopotamia a blank cheque on India&apos;s military resources.Turning to specific points raised in your telegram :(1) We readily accept decision that occupied territories should be administered by His Majesty&apos;s Government and not by the Government of India. At the same time it must be recognised that India has shed her blood in the conquest of these territories in which she has already large interests, commercial, political, and religious, and that any restriction of free Indian immigration for trade and other purposes into Irak would cause bitter and legitimate resentment. Doubtless provision of a definite field for expansion elsewhere, preferably -in East Africa as already suggested in our Despatch No. 85 Secret, War, of 29th September 1916, in recognition of her war services, would tend to satisfy India and check an undue flow into Irak, and we trust that steps may be taken to arrange for this. In any case, in view of pilgrimage and trade interests of India in Irak, it would be desirable to post an officer of Government of India to Basra and perhaps also Bagdad to advise local administration on such questions.
(2) No remarks.(3) We entirety agree with Cox as to impossibility at present time of deciding precise constitution of Arab State at Bagdad under British Protectorate, and trust no precipitate action may be taken in this matter. Our experience of puppet rulers in India and Afghanistan is not encouraging. We endorse Cox&apos;s suggestion in paragraph 13 of his telegram that a Commission should be appointed to examine whole problem on the spot.(4a, o, c) No remarks.(4d) In practice it will be impossible probably for some time to dispense entirely with the employment of Indian Moslems in the administration, and though we in no way wish to encourage introduction of Indian subordinates, we think it would be a grave mistake to debar them absolutely. Such a course would excite legitimate ill-feeling in India,(5) and. (6) No remarks.(7) We agree with Cox&apos;s view.(8) We agree entirely, but Irrigation Department will doubtless have to indent heavily on India and services of Indian official subordinates will probably also be required. This would militate against rigorous enforcement of (4c?). We are quite prepared to meet such indents if given full warning. Further, if large irrigation works are to be started at once in Mesopotamia, it seems almost inevitable that labour should come from India. The control of large colonies of Indian labourers will present diffi-culties. Further, when large schemes have been carried out, it will be necessary to find good cultivators for the lands. We do not see how suitable cultivators can be found for a torrid country like Mesopotamia with a sparse and pastoral indigenous population without indenting upon India. &apos; For these reasons we think large schemes are to be deprecated until the country settles down and local labour is available. (&apos;9) We quite realise this is necessary corollary of (1), but (a) unsettling-effect on Gulf Chiefs who are accustomed to and trust Govern-ment of India will require tactful handling; (fe) Japanese commercial penetration will require uniform treatment in Gulf.(10) We agree gladly to the transfer of Aden and the lladramaut to the London Foreign Office.(11) We do not fully understand what is meant, and before expressing our views we should like to know precisely Avhat is contemplated, and what practical control the Government of India would have.These are our views in brief, but we propose to address you fully by despatch dealing in detail with the very important issues raised and with financial readjustments involved.
