From Viceroy, 4t/i May 1917.Secret. Mabsuds. My telegram dated 3rd May. Roos Keppel reports that so-called friendly Mahsuds took part in general tribal jirga at Kanigorum and sent letter to Political Agent to the effect that without a guarantee of exemption from eventual punishment they must cease relations with British territory and eventually join in hostilities. We cannot, of course, give these Mahsuds guarantee they demand, and shall probably have to face general&apos; hostility of whole tribe. To give, guarantee asked for would not materially-alleviate present situation and would hopelessly embarrass us in dealing-hereafter conclusively with Mahsud problem, besides being weak surrender of our declared [group omitted ?]. We are further strengthening troops in protected area and on border.
