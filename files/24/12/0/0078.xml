Military Effect of Russia seceding from the Entente1.   In the General Staff Weekly Summary of the Military Situation for 19th April it was stated that we cannot depend on the restoration of a stable government in Russia, and that the policy of that country is largely in the hands of a Socialist caucus animated by pacifist    and revolutionary ideals.    The result of such a situation was shewn to be that the efficiency of the Army and Navy had been so gravely impaired that Russia1s value as an Ally was greatly reduced, if not destroyed,  and that not only did there appear to be no prospect of her undertaking any offensive, but that there was a great probability that she would not hold the enemy divisions at present on her fronts.   Wbrile it may yet be too early to despair altogether of further military assistance from her, it is clear that if these disintegrating tendencies continue they must greatly impair her capacity for continuing the war and may ultimately render it impossible for her to do so, for it is folly to suppose- that an army without discipline, and efficient services of maintenance, can have any fighting value worth the name.   There is also the danger that the Socialists may seize the reins of . Government and endeavour t* put into effect their policy of peace on a basis of &quot;no annexations&quot;.    These dangers may perhaps be averted either by a counter-revolution, by the influence of the sounder elements among the troops and civil population, or by a realisation of the, practical difficulties; and disastrous consequences of making peace, yet the risk is sufficiently real to render it necessary to consider the effects of such a contingency and to decide upen our course of action in that event.(2) ; 7
It is impossible to say exactly how the general situat would be affected by Russia making peace, as this would depend on many incalculable factors such as the moral and political effect un the Central Powers and on our Allies... It is, for instance, possible that Austria might regard the elimination of her principal enemy as a means of securing relief fr om the necessity of further efforts and sacrifices, rather than of affording an opportunity to concentrate her forces for an attack on Italy - an attack the success of which would be doubtful and would necessitate heavy losses. Her dependence on Germany is due to the fact that the latter is her only hope for the security of her eastern frontier, That danger once removed she&apos; may assert her independence. The resumption of friendly/relations between the Central Powers and Russia, if it takes place, will be brought about through the efforts of the Socialists in these countries. This can&apos; hardly -fail to influence the irrternal political situation both in Germany and Austria, and may disincline public opinion to an indefinite prolongation of the war. The relief in both countries from the strain involved by fighting simultaneously on two fronts may tend to divert public attention towards the internal situation. Ifthe economic situation is not i2mediately&apos;&apos;relicve-d,,^. fee ling against the Government and agrarian classes is likely to become embittered a   As regards Turkey, when freed from all anxiety as to Constantinople, she might come to terms with Great Britain with respect to Mesupotamia and a recognition of an autonomous Arab state rather than prolong the war indefinitely in the attempt to re-take .prxrvin,ce-s-where, awing to difficulties of trans.port and supply, she can only main tain., limited forces.   These possibilities may tend to mitigate the result^of:&quot;i^sian^..^lerec-tiun,   though   they might not materialise   for   some   little   time   afterwards.

At the same time$   Exclusive of 15 divisions in process of formation in Germany which may later become available for- the Western Front...We cannot, however, depend upon any of these results and therefore we should prepare for the worst namely that the Central Powers will be free to concentrate all their forces against their remaining enemies, and will derive the full benefit obtainable from the altered conditions.3.:.    It must he assumed that the whole of the German Army on the Eastern Front will be available for operations in the Westo This does not mean that the whole of the 7 5 German divisions could he transferred to France and placed in line on the Western Front,  as such numbers could probably not be supplied by the existing railway system,    The surplus numbers which could not he supported on the  front would be kept in rear, and used to relieve, divisions in the front line.    Owing to -the difficulties of the transport situation in Germany, due to lack of engines and lubricating oil, it would take a long time to transfer these forces to the West, especially as it may be presumed that the exigencies jof the food situation would take precedence of troop transport and that a large amount of rolling stock would he devoted to bringing supplies from Russia.    Eventually, however, when these difficulties had been overcome and the whole of the troops -now on the Russian and Rumanian fronts were available for employment on the Western Front, the relative  situation of the opposing armies in the latter theatre would be as follows i-
it is obvious that offensive operations on our front would offer no chance, of success, and our best course would be to.remain on the defensive, strengthen our positions, economise our reserves in man-power and material, and hope that the balance could, be eventually redressed, by American assistance *4.     The Austrian troops now engaged on the Eastern Front would be available to reinforce the Italian Front, Here again the number of divisions which could be maintained on so narrow a front would be limited, but the enemy could keep surplus divisions for the relief of&quot;those in the front line.     Assuming that the whole of the troops now on the Russian and Roumanian Fronts were available, the relative situation of the Austrian and Italian Armies would be as follows:-&apos;Army, ,        Divisions., ,        Rifle Strength. .        Guns..Italian ... 54 1,201,000. 3,828.Austrian 79^ 711,200... 4,616.There is little doubt that the defection of Russia would have a serious moral effect in Italy, and it seems possible that the latter might come to terms with Austria,   The effect of this would, of course add to our difficulties, for even if the Austrians were unwilling to fight on the Western Front they would probably place their heavy artillery at the disposal of Germany, .-  If Italy did not make peace she ought to be able to continue her resistance against the Austrian Army, but the case would probably be otherwise in the event of an attack upon her being as sis ted-by a few German Divisions,
5.   The situation at Salonika would be affected by the release of Bulgarian troops from the Roumanian front and reinforcements of German troops might also he sent to Macedoni Although these numbers would be limited by transport and supply, the enemy could assemble such a force as would make it impossible for the Allies to hold their present front and very difficult to carry tut an orderly withdrawal.     At the recent Paris Conference the French and British Naval Authorit-ies agreed, that unless the Salonika forces are withdrawn by the end of the year they may starve owing to the break-down of sea communications; while the French and British Military.authorities agreed that no military object would be served by keeping a reduced force at Salonika.   Naval and Military opinion, French and British, is therefore, quite clear and united, and the future rests with the Governments, All that need be added is that it is quite clear from what has been said above that we must, if Russia is Vo drop out of the war, or even if she is to allow Germany t*&apos; withdraw divi-sions at her will from the Eastern Front, economise as quickly as possible all tur commitments in secondary theatres of war, and that the sooner the withdrawal from Macedonia begins the less risk there will be of the enemy being able tt interfere with the movement.6.    It is in the East that the effect of Russia&apos;s collapse is being most acutely felt by us.    Twt months ago when we were given definite promises of Russian co-operation against tho Turks, there seemed a good chance that we should be able tt assist the Russians to establish themselves on the Tigris at Mosul., thus definitely securing Mesopotamia and allowing us to reduce our forces in that theatre, while we concentrated our efforts in Palestine with the object of bringing about the defeat of Turkey.     We have since been definitely informed by Alexie/ff that he can undertake no offensive this year with his main Caucasian Army.
7.       This dis-a^jpolriiJ^^ part -of the Russiansentirely changes our prospects in Palestine/.   It is probable that the Turks could not maintain very much larger-forces in the southe.rnu.part of the country than they have at present owing to supply and transport--difficulties, but; being freed from. Russian danger in Caucasia;, they would be able quickly-to replace losses^ increase their artillery arjd--inaiBhJjie--guns, and thus make a much more effective resistances   in fact it is very doubtful whether we could reach JerumleoTf&quot;w^^out--an expendI-ture of force alto^e-ther^dispi-^aiH^ionate to the i^turu^e--^h^ild^---get, while we must abandon definitely all Idea cf conquering the whole of Pale-ebine and advancing on Aleppo,      In these circum-stances and in view of the many other- possible calls upon us, which we have no reserves to meet, the only prudent course is. until it becomes clear that Russia can and. will at least contain a large, part of the. Turkish forces, to confine&quot;xx3r^elve-S&apos;&quot;^riroarilyT to the defence of Egypt ,^J^ \n&amp;^&amp;r^ of anyfarvx)ur^ble.,op^rtunity for striking the Turks * 8, As regards Mesopotamia It is estimated that the areaMosul     Kifri - Tekrit is capable of supporting at least 200;000 men, of whom about 150,000 would represent rifle&apos;strength.    It is, however, very^d^oubtful &quot;iThether in practice this niunbeor,&quot;&quot;c-oulil  be maintained in the field south of Tekrit and the numbers available for attack on General. Maude-by -the- lligri^-an&amp;..JIifrl. routes would probably never reach this figuree     In any case it would take a long time before the transport for the movement of these numbers-eould be obtaineda   It would seem therefPre^that -G-enaral Maude, who is able to supply a fighting force of from 70,000 to 80,000 men at and north of Baghdad, and is occupying a central position between the&apos;&quot;Turkis.h lines of advance, should be able with his present forces to deny Baghdad to the enemyv But there w-ould be a danger of the Turks penetrating into Persia by the Kermansh&amp;hr-route0 and. this might make it necessary e^nd.reinforcements to Mesopcrtamia^-sufficient to close this
route, and also to provide the additional river transport and railway communications necessary to supply these increased forces.    In any event so long as we are to keep our hold over Baghdad any reduction of our force in Mesopotamia would be out of the question, and, as stated, we might have to send further reinforcements.One of the most important results of Russia making peace would be to relieve the blockade of Germany by allowing her to procure supplies from Russia, although it is uncertain to what extent she could do this.    It is, for instance, possible that a humiliating peace would intensify the chaos in Russia and even lead to civil war. In this case it might be difficult to obtain any supplies at all from Russia, especially as Southern Russia, whence most of the grain would come, has been less influenced by the Revolution than the Nort . and would probably be less inclined to peace with Germany. Assuming that no such difficulty were encountered, there would still remain great difficulties to overcome in respect to transport.       The first desire of the Russians would be to demobilise their army and resume normal conditions of life as quickly as possible, and for this purpose all the available rolling stock would be required for many months after the conclusion of peace, as no German or Austrian rolling stock could be used In. Russia owing to the difference in gauge. It is probable that the only means of supply which could be util-ised in the period immediately following the conclusion of peace would be by sea from Odessa and thence up the Danube. On the other hand, while there are no doubt vast stocks&quot;of grain In Russia, the general disorganisation and lack of rollir stock has hampered its distribution, and it seems possible that as long as important centres in Russia remained short of food, public opinion would insist on all grain supplies being re.-
t&amp;ihed in the&apos; country.    It is possible that German uffieiaiii- might fee permitted to organise the Russian railw&amp;y&amp;) but considering the reluctance of the Russians l&apos;c*- allow their own Allies to assist them in their internal aditdni^i^srtion even in war-time^ it seems doubtful if they would consent to German management in time Oif peace *   All these factors may militate against any immediate relief being obtainable ih respect to the food supply, but in c-cmrscw-of&apos;&quot;&quot;time substantial relief must undoubtedly be expect-edf.It will be seen from the foregoing that the results of Russia making a separate peace need not entail, disastrous conse-quences either in the Western theatre or ih Italy^ because the Allies&apos; strength should&apos; be sufficient to meet any Stf-bii-t^ the -enemy could make on these fronts. It is also possible that the food gitrua^ tion in Germany and Austria may not be relieved for a considerable time after peace is concluded^ and that this may greatly influence the internal situation in these countries. If this does not happen the Central Powers could continue until they&quot;were.-de*3d.sively&apos;beaiaen in the fluid. Providing the problem of coping with the enemy&apos;s sub- &quot;* marines were solved there is no reason why, with the assistance pf America, we also should not continue the war until we could gain terms of peace which would render the future position of the British -Empire, reasonably secure. At the same time the mpiaal ancT Tr^tnerlal effects of the withdrawal of Russia from the war would be so serious-that we should not only take every precaution to mitigate its effects but should also take every possible step to prevent its occurrence. No military methods of bringing the latter about l)e%tap than those agreed upon at the recent Paris Conference can be sugw gested,but every military success which we gain should be made the occasion for friendly advice and diplomatic pressure designed to bring Russia into line as quickly as possible.. It is equally imports ant that our diplomatic plans should be carefully thought out at once with a view to making modifications in our political aims which h^ve been publicly announced in regard to Austria and Turkeyt so that prompt advantage may be taken of any indication shown by Austria,Bulgaria, or Turkey to secede from the Central Alliance as a result of Russian defection.
o r o 39th May, 1917,11.     The more important conclusions which emerge from the above are(a) If Russia makes a separate peace the war may be greatly prolonged, and economy in shipping accordingly becomes even more necessary than at present.(b) We must therefore on this account keep our troops as near to England as possible,  and also because the maximum number must be made available to assist in holding the Western Front, so that the Russian defection may not be followed by the collapse of Prance.(o) It follows from this, first, that in any case we must get away from Salonika as quickly as possible and secondly, until, it becomes dearer what Russia is likely to do, our polioy,  so far as the remainder of the East is concerned,  should be a watching one, and if eventually Russia drops out of the War, we should limit our forces in Eastern theatres to the minimum required for the defence of our essential interests.(Sgd, ) ^.R^ROSERTSON.,C. l.*G.* S.,
