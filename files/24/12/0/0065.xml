WAR CABINET. FOR THE INFj3J3MAJ IQN OF TEE WAR CABINET.From First Sea Lord.The Shipbuilding Programme already approved provides for vessels of classes which either the United States cannot supply us with in numbers sufficient for our needs or which their Navy does not possess.     It is particularly in vessels for anti-submarine work that the U.S.A. is unable to meet our requirements.       The programme has been examined in detail in the attached statement, from v/hich it appears that the entry of the United States into the war has no effect upon the Shipbuilding already approved by the War Cabinet.C R E T .-665(Intd.)
