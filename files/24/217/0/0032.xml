At the Prime Minister&apos;s  request, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Shaw,the Chief Yvhip and I have  considered the revised draft Billwith a view to seeing whether the scope of the Bill could benarrowed or opposition  to  it  could be lessened by droppingor modifying  certain of its proposals.    It may be argued thatthe Government are committed  to the Bill in its present formby the statements which were  made to  the Party Meeting beforethe House rose, and  if  thfe Cabinet should decide to make any material changes  in  the Bill, it  will be necessary ts informour supporters and to furnish them with adequate reasons forthe suggested alterations.          In  our  view,  it  will moreover be necessary to consult with  the  Liberal Party before the Bill is presented toParliament in its final form.   Before  the House rose an outline of what the  Government had in mind was given toSir Herbert Samuel in the  form of an  expansion of theproposals contained  in  the  Long Title.    Mr. Henderson,
Mr. Shaw, Mr. Kennedy and I think it very desirableto confer with the Liberals immediately with aview to ascertaining their attitude to the specific proposals in the Bill.   Y/e propose to meet theLiberal representatives on Monday, the 5th January.and we shall report to &quot;the Cabinet on Tuesday theresult of our discussions.          Cur view is that if it is essential toreduce the scope cf the Bill raid to lessen itscontroversial character for reasons cf parliamentary time,somej if not all, of the following four Clauses could be dropped, as from the Labour point of view they are theleast important and valuable,          v/e felt that this view applies particularly tcClauses 8 and 10.          (1)  Clause 5 makes provision for facilitating               voting in the case of electors who change               their residence during the currency cf a               register.          (2) Clause 6 makes provision for enabling the               taking of polls to be postponed as regards               voters resident in islands who cannot               reasonably be expected to attend at the poll               having regard to the difficulty or               impracticability, by reason of stormy weather               of their reaching their polling station.          (3)  Clause 8 authorises the employment for pay-               ment of speakers at public meetings held for               promoting or procuring the election of a               candidate .          (4)  Clause 10 suggests two  alternative methods of               dealing with the proposal to  restrict the               expenditure of political organisation in               connection with elections.
cp n f*A/ (0 0     It should, howeveru he remembered that the Long Titlestates til- t the Bill will contain provisions on the pointsdealt with in these Clauses, and if, when the Bill is issued ,it omits some or all of these proposals, opportunity willbe given to our political opponents to create an embarrassingsituation for the Government.     Apart from these four Clauses, there are a few points on which a Cabinet decision still remains to be given :-          Clause 2 provides for the division of double-member constituencies.   The original idea w...s that theseconstituences should, not be divided, but the difficultiesof applying the system of the Alternative Vote to theseconstituencies are so great that there seems no choiceexcept between leaving them alone under the present systemof voting and dividing them.   I presume the C/binet will decide on the latter course-     If they so decide, how is the City of London to bedealt with?   The abolition of the Business Premisesqualification, which is proposed in Clause 5, will reducethe electorate from its present number cf a.bout 50,000 toabout 10,000 caretakers and. others residing in the City.It would be dif icult to justify the return of two members,or oven of one member, by so reduced an electorate.    Onthe other hand, my proposal to deprive the City of representation in Parliament is bound to meet with enormousopposition, and it is for the Cabinet to decide whether some special provision should be made for the City, and if so,what that provision should be.    If the Cabinet think itnecessary to make special provision for the City, two alternative methods suggest themselves -     (l)    to except the City altogether from the proposals           to divide up double-member constituencies rind to           provide that in the case of the  City the  Business           Premises qualification shall continue, subject to
9 9 ^the condition that a City eleotor who uses hisvote :5n respectof his Business Premisesqualificatishell not vise any other vote whichhe may possess elsewhere; or(3)   to  make proviLsion for some  special franchisefor the City.Clause 7-I would refer to page 4 of my previous memorandum (CoP.428  (30))  and shall  he glad if  theCabinet will now  decide  between the alternative proposalsfor  dealing with  the question cf the conveyance of  the sick and infirm to  the pollse    My  own view inclines to  thesecond  and simpler  alternative.           Clause  .11   The  application of the Bill  to northern Ireland  remains to be decided in consultation withthe  Government  cf Northern  Irelandc   I think that  it is&apos;probable that that  Government will  desire that the  majorityof the Clauses  should not -pply to  Northern Ireland, butI assume that in  any event  the Bill should contain  provisionfor  the abolition of the Belfast University constituency.(Initld)  J.
