At their Meeting  on the 10th instant, the Cabinetashed me to circulate  a memorandurn setting forth thevarious forms which the alternative vote might take,          So fax&apos; as the information in my possession goes,there are only three suggestions which have been made.They arc as follows:-     (l)  The First method  is that proposed by ProfessorITanson, and is published  in the Appendix to the Report cfthe Royal Commission of 1910.   The object of this methodis to avoid the elimination,  on the preliminary count,of a candidate who may have the most first and secondpreferences taken together.          The system works  in the following manner when there are candidates,  A,  B  and C.   If we take the firstpreferences of A, the  first preferences of B, and thesecond preferences of  C,  we obtain the result of a straight fight between A  and  B;   similarly, the firstpreferences of B, and  the first preferences of C, withthe second preferences of A,  represent a straight fight-between B and C;  and  the first preferences of C, thefirst preferences of A, and the second preferences of 3  .give a straight fight  between C and A.   Adding theresults together we get the total polls for A. B and Cin the three contests.  The candidate with the lowest                          1.
total is eliminated ana. the o arid, i date to be elected is thewinner of the straight fight between the ether two.   Itwill be observed that in the process of elimination thefirst preferences of A are counted twice, also the firstpreferences of B and the first preferences of C;  but thesecond preferences of A, B and C ere counted only once.The rule for the system is expressed in the formula &quot;give2 for for the first preference, 1 for the second preference,ascertain the totals and exclude the lowest candidate;then tale a direct poll between the two remainingcandidates, the same value being given to the first and second preferences given to these candidates.&quot;          It is important to observe that the rule gives the valae cf 2 to a first preference because it appearstwice in the process of e 1 imination, and not &quot;because a first preference is considered double the value of asecond preference at any stage of the proceedings.          It is assumed that every voter will have madeuse of both of his preferences.  If a voter does not infact snake use cf both of his preferences, the valueattaching to his first preferences is proportionatelyreduced at the preliminary staye of elimination.          This system is not in force anywhere for political elections, and I think that, whatever can be said in favour of it on scientific grounds, it is so complicated,especially where there are more than three candidates, thatit can be ruled out of consideration.      (5)  The second method is that proposed by the RoyalCommission of 1910.  Under this system, the voting papersof the candidate at the bottom of the poll are distributed among the remaining candidates in accordance with thesecond preferences given on the voting papers of the                           2.
rejected candidate.  If none  of the remaining candidatesreceives a  clear majority, the procedure  is repeated, byeliminating successively the  last candidate until the desired reaiilt is obtained.          This is the method  which was contemplated in trieRepresentation of the People  Pill as  it was introduced into parliament  by the then Secretary of State  (Sir George Cave)in 1917, and would have been  the method in force now hadParliament  decided, to include the alternative vote in the representation of the People  Act, 191.8.  This system hasbeen in force since 1918 for  elections to the House ofRepresentatives of the Commonwealth of Australia.     (3)  The third method, is that which has been advocated by Lord Craigmyle at the recent Electoral Conference.Lord Oraiguyle&apos;s scheme has been outlined by him in &quot;TheTines&quot; of the 26th July last, and, for the purpose of easyreference,  is reproduced in an appendix to this memorandum.          It will be seen that under  Lord Craigmyle&apos;s schemeall candidates other than the first two are eliminatedsimultaneously, and. the choice between the two candidatesat the head of the poll is decided by allotting among them the preferences given in the  ballot papers of all theeliminated  candidates.  This  more summary method is atpresent in  use in Queensland, and presumably the liberal party will  expect that this method will be adopted in theproposed. Electoral Reform Bill.          I think it is agreed that all forms of thealternative vote are bound to be inaccurate, in so far asthey assume that a candidate  who obtains fewer firstpreferences than another can  safely be eliminated at anystage of the proceedings.  If there are only threecandidates  A, B, C, it does not necessarily follow that,because C has obtained, the smallest number of firstpreferences, a majority of the supporters of A and B would                         3.
                                                            O 1                                                            0 xriot prefer to see C elected, than that either of the othercandidates should be elected,  but this is what the alternativevote assumes.          Apart from the fact that the Liberal Party willprobably press for the adoption of Lord Oraignryle 1 s scheme,that scheme seems to have the following advantages over thescheme contemplated in the representative ion of the People Bill,1517 : -     (i) The rules for operating it are simple compared       with the rules which would be necessary to give effect       to any other scheme.    (ii) It gives a second voice to a larger number of       voters than does the other method, inasmuch as the       persons who voted for the candidates other than the       first two will all have a say in deciding which of                it       the first two candidates should be elected.   (iii) The elimination of all candidates with the       exception of two at the first count will probably       appeal more to the average elector who does not look       at the problem from the scientific point of view.&apos;          A scheme on the lines of that proposed by LordCraignyle was considered by the Royal Commission of 1910.The Royal Commission in its Report referred to that schemevery briefly in the following terms:-             &quot;Should many candidates be standing, their         successive elimination may entail considerable         labour.  In Queensland, therefore, it is provided         that after the first count all candidates but two         are simultaneously eliminated, but this more         summary method sacrifices accuracy.&quot;I do not think, however, that thax comment of the RoyalCommission  is a conclusive objection because, as I have pointed  out, all forms of the alternative vote necessarily involved  some degree of inaccuracy.
          The important difference between Lord Craigmyle&apos;nohev.:e and the scheme contemplated in the Bill of 1917is.that under Lord Oraigmyle1e scheme no candidate otherthan the first two who head, the poll on the first counthad any chance of being elected., whereas under the othermethod all the candidates other than the last candidatehave a chance at each successive count of being put atthe head of the poll.          On the whole, I think that the balance ofadvantage lies with Lord Craignylo&apos;s scheme.  There were only .27 contests in 1929 in which there were more thanthrec oandidates.          In view of the decision taken by the Cabinetnot &quot;to include in the Electoral Bill a proposal for theabolition of double-member constituencies, I think ought to point out to my colleagues that, in the opinionof the Royal Commission of 1910, the alternative vote isnot a system which can conveniently be applied to double-iv;ember const ituencies, though, of course, it canbe applied, to such constituencies  if it is considered necessary to do so.  There are at present 14 double--.e.mber constituencies - 12 in Great Britain and 2 inl-o rth e rn Ir el and.                     (Initialled)o J. R. C.Home Office,  S. 7.1.12th December, 1930.
THE TIMES 26.7.30.                    LORD ORAIGMYLE&apos;S MEMORANDUM.                        THE ALTERNATIVE VOTE.      The following id the text of1 Lord Craigmyle&apos;s memorandum on theAlternative Vote (in which cross-headings have been placed) to which LordUllswater refers in the foregoing letter:-      I am grateful to my colleagues for the opportunity of putting before  them certain points which occur to me with regard to the alternative vote-  I shall endeavour to state them as briefly and helpfully as I can.      My colleagues will forgive me if, to begin with, I ask them to  consider whether too much has not been made of the effect of the changes  proposed upon this political party tc. the other.   A party caucus is too  apt to take this point of view, and most party caucuses are incapable of  taking any other,  But, as I look at it, what this Conference is concerned  with is to get beyond the caucus to the citizen and to secure that the  citizens shall have greater justioe done to them by a nearer approximation  of voting results to voting power.      I should like to testify that 1 do not know any public subject  connected with politics which has given greater dissatisfaction than this,  that individual constituencies in very large numbers find the majority  of their voters&apos;  views lost, and the constituency so far not represented  bu-1   srenresented.          The  alternative  vote docs  appear to be a step in the direction of  allaying that well-founded dissatisfaction, and is on that ground very  widely supported in the country.      Another point has been, I think, too little attended to, and yet it  is perfectly clear.  All the schemes appear to set out with the idea of  reaching nothing less than a perfect system.  The thing requires only to  be stated to be shown to be impossible.  I do not recommend the alternativ  vote on any such ground; but I think the Conference would do well to make  some approximation at least to alleviating what is thus widely felt to be  a present grievance and a grave constitutional defect.      1 think the proposal for the alternative vote has suffered from being  too much mixed up with proportional representation.  From one point of  view, the two things are essentially different.  The object of proportiona  representation is to provide against the under-representation or non-  representation of minorities; minorities are swamped.  But the object cf  the alternative vote is to provide against the under-representation or  non-representation of majorities.  A worse thing has happened than the  swamping of minorities; this time majorities are swamped.                       ELECTORS1 REAL VERDICTr      It is against this latter thing that the alternative vote stands out  as an articulately separate remedy.  In the event of P.R.. (with which  I in principle agree) being found inadvisable or not covering the whole  ground, then the A,V. - a clear and simply operated plan - may still be  found a most valuable aid to a belter ascertainment of the electors&apos;  real verdict.
      I expressly and purposely take the case of single-member con-3tituencies.  It is not necessary, so far as getting a judgment of theConference upon that is concerned, to mix it up wiih other reforms orchanges.  If plural voting be abolished, single-member constituencies willbe increased in number; if proportional representation in selected con-stituencies be adopted, single-member constituencies will be decreased innumb erj but wherever single-member constituencies,  continued or increasedor diminished as they may be, exist, to that the simple proposals whichI suggest would applyo      It is desirable to take the ordinary case, and no real help is givenby illustration of narrov majorities; narrow majorities are not uncommon inany system of voting.  So the safest way is to take the simplest and mostgeneral case of a single seat with three or more candidates0  No one has amajority of the combined votes.  What is to be done?  What it comes  to isthat a short leet must be made.  Unless you make such a short leet of two(for you must start somewhere) you drive the whole back again, and all the troubles of a second election or second ballot arise.  You wish to avoidthat, and so you. have your short leet of A and B, but neither of them withthe majority of voters behind him.  How then is the opinion of the majorityto be reached?  Manifestly by appealing to those outside the short leet  to declare their view as between A and B who are within it.  This is gathered from C&apos;s second preferences - and that quite simply - namely., from thefigures &quot;2&quot; on the voting papers *      The fundamental facts appear clearly enough in the composition of  thepresent House of Commons.      In 192S there were more than two candidates in 469 single-member constituencies.  Of these only 161 were supported by the majority of thosevoting.  On the other hand? no fewer than 308 were  elected by a minority of those voting.  It may be added that behind the 308 minority members  therestood a voting strength of 4,974,847 votes.  This gross minority figure  isconfronted by a majority figure of 6,318,075, with  no majority representativewhatever 0      I would beg my colleagues to consider that this  is not an instance ofpioking out individual cases or small selection of  cases, but it is  takingone  of the broadest electoral facts  of the day and  dealing with it.   Thatbroad fact is, as stated, that  in the present House of Commons there are308  single-member cases in which  after  a contest of three or more candidates,the member holds his seat for a minority, and not for  a majority, of thosewho vVont to the poll,,  That  is  to say,  to the  extent of one-half of  itsentire membership, the present House of Commons  is  a minority House,,       It appears to me to be, almost beyond argument,  plain that it  would besafer  for -the State and fairer  for  the  citizen to adopt some methodapproximating the majority of the voters1 opinion to the  strength of his power  as represented in the  Housen
                  &quot;A SHORT LEET.&quot;      The method 1 propose is the simple and familiar one of making ashort leet of the two highest cn the poll.  It need not be suggested thatthere is anything novel .about this.  It is in practice in Parliamentary  &apos;5elections in Australia today.  And, for instance, in Queensland there are under the Electoral Acts of lc&apos;9 2 and the Consolidation Act of 1905 what are called  &quot;provisions for securing absolute majority of votes&quot; and the78th of these gives a simple statement of what I call a short leet, and working in the uncommitted votes.  But one need not go so far afield.  Inall public meetings, on local, public, or church questions in Scotland,it is a familiar procedure.  I think it is also in England; and it worksperfectly simply and clearly and well.      The position of the voter exercising the alternative vote might atfirst appear to raise a stiff psychological problem; but all such difficulties quickly disappear.  Take a case of three candidates - A. B.and C - and of a voter who favours C.  He, the voter for C, is put in this position: He says, &quot;l approve of C, and he gets my first vote; but I mayfail; C may not even get into the short leet.  I sincerely disapprove ofthe politics of A and also of those of B.  What then am I to do? I thinkmy vo-ition must be that, seeing that 1 disapprove of the politics of both,I should judge between them on their merits anart from Parliamentary   .Tpolitics.  Into that reckoning will come - local knowledge, local service,ability, attainments, and most and best of all, character and record.  all those things being dedicated to public life, oven although the man is not of my way of political thinking, make me feel that the life of thecountry would be safer in the hands of one of these men, say A, ratherthan in those of B, of whom I have a different opinion and knowledge.Accordingly, if C (my first vote) fails, then A shall have my second vote and I mark him No. 2 on my voting paper.&quot;      I here express my belief (which is confirmed by the facts mentionedin the next paragraph) that there is a much larger proportion of the electorate than is generally taken into account that is moved by such considerations, and I think it is in this region that the alternativevote, which might be confusing to the caucus, would be most beneficial tothe citizen and most wholesome in public life.  I myself do not have any doubt that the alternative vote would be substantially influenced by those considerations; and that the development of it in constitutional practice would add to public security.,      I thought it might assist the Conference if 1 secured one figure -namely, the number of those whose position is that they gave their firstor No. 1 vote neither for the one nor the other of the two top candidates.Those whose nominee is in the short leet have already voted; they arealready committed by their Ik&apos;. 1 votes to A or to B; and these votes stand.But those whose first nominee is not on the short leet are uncommitted to either; what is wanted is to get at the mind of these as yet uncommittedvoters on the limited issue A or B.  This is the very thing which is fb undby the second preferences of these uncommitted voters, without any secondelection or further trouble, but from the very face of the voting papers.
                         - 4 -                  UNCOMMITTED VOTERS.      The point in most of our minds is -  are these uncommitte-i voters manyin number, or worth considering at all?  I have to thank Mr.  Markbreiterand his staff for their valuable assistance in -unearthing this figure.1 confess that I thought there might be half a million of them and I  was prepared to fight for that half million.  But the actual number is2,365,973.  I trust the Conference is agreed that this figure is  relevantand is valuable.  I venture to submit that it would be an advantage to theState to find a place within the voting system for an opportunity of ascertaining the opinion of that great body of voters on tho point whether their support, failing their own nominee,  should be given to  A or to  B.The result in all probability would in every case be to turn a minorityinto a majority representation.  For my own part, 1 had no idea that  therewas a body of nearly two and a half millions of my fellow citizens whosevotes, duly exercised, were thus treated as of no account, with resultsproducing such widely felt discontent.  To allay that dissatisfaction wouldbe an act of justice to that body of voters and could not but be  a strength to the Constitution.     - t/e should not undervalue the votor who would dare to say  franklyto the politicians:  &quot;A plague on both your Houses; but I know  both thesetwo men, I &quot;have watched their services in good causes which make  so much for public well-being, and 1 approve the conduct and record of  the onemuch more than that of the other&quot;,  Is this wrong? Does it lower  public life? On the contrary, the more we have of it, the better it will, Ithink, be.  I think it no defect but a commendation of the alternativevote if we gather in that large body of opinion, giving it an effectiveplace and opportunity in our political life.
