APPENDIX TO F.S.f29te7.  finance ial S ta t em en t.          The annual additional cost of maintaining the  &quot;Oxley&quot;and the &quot;Otway&quot; in the 1st Submarine Flotilla,  two  &quot;L&quot; classSubmarines being withdrawn and placed in reserve, is  54,690.          The annual cost of maintenance of &quot;K.26&quot;  in fullcommis si on is:-             Vote A - 67                20,425             Dockyard (refit).          18,000             Fuel and lubricants.        4,500             Sea Stores.                   600             Armament Stores.              800             Renewal of batteries.       3,300                         Total.         47,625          Tho annual cost of maintenance of &quot;M.3&quot; inmaterial reserve is:-                                          o                                          21*             Vote A - 17.                5,185             Dockyard exDenditure.       2,000             Fuel&quot;and lubricants.

Renewal of batteries.        -                         Total.          7,185          The total annual saving which would be effected by.scrapping both the &quot;K.26&quot; and &quot;M.3&quot; is therefore  54.810i.e., slightly more than the annual additional cost of themaintenance of the &quot;Oxley&quot; and the &quot;Otway&quot;.          As regards non-recurrent expenditure, the cost of sending out full crews from England to f-ydney to bring home the &quot;Cxley&quot; and the &quot;Otway&quot; is  5,000 approximately.  Thecost of the fuel which would be Consumed on the journey is 2,700.  These non-recurrent charges, however, would be morethan met by the money accruing from the sale of the &quot;K.26&quot;and the &quot;M.3&quot;, which are estimated to be worth as scrap;S5,800 and  5,000 respectively.

          In addition, a further sum could &quot;be saved this yearhy curtailing the refit and repairs of n]C26&quot; and an additionalamount subsequently for more extensive repairs to boilers,which would be needed to keep her in running order.  It isestimated that these sums would amount to some  9,000 or 10,000.
