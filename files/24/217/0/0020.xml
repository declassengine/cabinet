INDUSTRIAL ORGAITI b AT I ON,  Memorandum &quot;by the President  of the Board of Trade.;i.   The notes which follow show the latest position  inregard to the re-organisation  r.f the wool textile  and ironand steel trades.   A separate memorandum is being circulatedcn the position of the Cettcn  Trade-. (See 0oP--  421 (30)o)2.   It is doubtful how far the principle of amalgamationcan usefully be applied te the wool textile industry.    Thereis less bulk production? greater variety? and more dependenceen changing fashion than in the ease of  cotton? and the opinienthat relatively small units are best suited to this trade  is held by men of wide experience and proved success.    The lackof success of certain combines in the worsted section?  both inthis country and abroad? lends colour to this view    I amcontinuing to explore the position? however? and I expect  tofind sections af the trade in which improvements in organisa-tien are possible.5.   One such section is the woollen manufacturers cf theCcine Valley.   In this region there are some eighteen firms who make a woollen cloth for the medium  priced men&apos;s  tailoring.Each unit is organised vertically - i.e.  it carries the processright through from the raw wool to the finished clothe   Thesefirms have little outside competition to face?  but it issaid that among themselves the competition is very keen andresults in considerable waste? and that  there are  a number of directions in which amalgamation might -result in savings in thecost of productions                           -1-
      4c   A scheme of amalgamation which was under consideration      in 1928-29 failed to make progress; but? as there was reason      to hope that the obstacles would not now prove unsurmountable ?      a meeting of the interested parties was convened cn the 15th      November by Sir !&apos;iorace &apos; ilson? acting on my behalf and at my      request,    At this meeting it was clear that the majority sf      these manufacturers were prepared to agree that amalgamation      was necessary and even desirable,,   Unfortunately a leading      manufacturers whose attitude seems to have been one of the      causes of the earlier failures was not present ? and the matte)?      therefore could not be carried furthers   he has since been      approached again? and while&apos; he probably would not stand in the      way of a scheme if the others will give it active support? he      is not at present disposed to co-operate0   Steps are being      taken to explore the possibility cf getting others to take      the lead,2TD    5c,   It will be recalled that the Sub-Cemm.ittee cf the hconomic      Advisory Council on the Iron and Steel Industry recommended      that His Majesty1 s Government should take every step in their      power to urge on all concerned in the industry the importance      of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the formation of large      regional amalgamations, as the essential preliminary to the      recovery of the trade that has been lost.? and that discussions      have since been proceeding with representatives of the em-      plcyers? the employees and finance^-
6 o60   At a meeting held en the 12th 17ovember an encouragingaccount was given of the -progress which is being made.Shortly5 the position is as follows:-7.   &quot;ROLLING 2:iLLS AND STSIiL 170RAS.     In Bcotlands where drastic, ratiohalisation3 with con-siderable expenditure on new plant ? is required,, particularsin regard to the various units have been  placed  orivatelybefore an accountant with a view to the preparation  of a scheme.On the North East Coast it is hoped to bring together theDorman Long and South Durham groupss and  a scheme  is beingworked cut? but certain parties: are not yet in agreement.Another progressive firm in this region-  the 0onsett Iron Com-pany. has recently spent between  4 and . 5 million on modernisingits rolling mills and steel works.   A further  1  million mayhave to be spent on blast furnaces.   As  regards the Iiidlandssfrequent conferences are being held in an endeavour  to form a group with United Steel as its centres embracing also Parting-ton&apos;sand the North hast Coast.   In South . ales the heavy side ofthe industry is now rationalised5  and the finance  for the con-struction of a new rolling mill to meet all the requirements ofSouth 7ales at a coot of  1-*- -  2 million is under discussion.Reference was also made to a projected new steel workss by whichit is hoped to meet foreign prices for the :wliole of  a certainclass of steel product.   This might cost  5-g- million.   Theschemes under consideration contemplate in all an  expenditureof between  10 and  13 million.S.   SHEETS AND TI1-TH.ATV;S.     In this section there have been discussions with a view-to the concentration of production in the best works.   Vhile                               /
this would Involve scrapping the less efficient plants,the savings in costs effected should bring us a larger share of the trade in oversea markets than would otherwise be possibleo   Progress in this direction is difficultowing to the fact that foreign sheet bars are coming in atexceptionally low prices, so that firms re-rolling importedbars can make profits which are quite impossible for thosewho make their own barso   The former firms naturally place an exaggerated value on their assets, in comparison withthe latter090   FORGING-S AIID ARIlAJSITTGo     The position in regard to Brown&apos;s and Firth&apos;o is atpresent before the.Courtsc   bhen the former have obtainedfull control over the latter, it will be possible for themto approach other unitso   The hnglish Steel Corporation areexpected to improve their position following certain changesin the management,,10.   It was made clear that the City would not find money for piece-meal development, but would insist on co-ordinatedplans and big units, which v/ould mean the greatest possiblesavings in costs.   The meeting was informed that a full and comprehensive review of the industry had been undertaken, andthat there was hardly a corner of the steel trade which had notbeen looked at and in which discussions wore not going &apos;onc                          (initialled) &apos;w*G.Board of Trade, Qu\.
