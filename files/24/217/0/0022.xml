THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1930.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.   38CP. 422 (30).CABINET.THE SCHNEIDER  TROPHY  CONTEST,  1931.             MEMORANDUM BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR AIR.    AFTER the British victory in 1929 the late Lord Thomson brought before theCabinet on the 25th September, 1929,  the question what should be the governments attitude with regard to entering a Royal Air Force team for the next Contest in 1931.He did not lay a memorandum before the Cabinet, but urged that  the Governmentshould  not  enter again (for reasons  that are set out more fully in paragraph 11below), and that the task of defending the trophy should be left to the Royal AeroClub.  This view was accepted by the  Cabinet, whose  decision was as follows :     (a) That  the  Secretary of State for Air should inform the Royal Aero Club          that a  Royal  Air  Force team would  not again  be  entered  for  the          Schneider Trophy Contest.    (&amp;) That in future British participation in the Schneider Trophy Contest should          be left  to the Royal Aero Club and private enterprise, in  accordance with          the intention of the original founder.    2.  This decision was duly announced to Parliament, and the reasons for it were fully set out in a press communique, a copy of which is appended to this paper.  TheAir Attaches  at Washington,  Paris and Rome were instructed to  inform their governments  of the decision as a matter of courtesy.  The decision  was accepted without protest by the Royal Aero Club.  There was, therefore, no reason to thinkthat the Club  was  not prepared to enter a team for the Contest in 1931.    3.  The Air Ministry felt it would not be incompatible with  this decision to lend  certain aircraft and  afford certain  facilities for training from  the existing resources  at its disposal to whatever responsible body  undertook to organise a Britishteam on this  occasion, and an offer to do this  was accordingly made to the RoyalAero Club.    4.  During the greater part of  1930 there was  a dispute between countriescomposing  the Federation  Aeronautique Internationale  with  regard  to  theconditions under which the race should be held in  1931 the particular point a tissue being the amount of  the fee payable on entry.   This dispute was only settled at the beginning of December; and there is  now no doubt but that France and Italywill  send challenging teams for the Trophy next  September.  In the meantime,pending settlement of this controversy, the Royal Aero  Club had not taken  any active steps to organise the race, and, at the beginning of December, at a meeting with representatives  of my  department,  said that,  unless the Government would either lend them a team of  R.A.F. pilots or afford the same assistance as at the timeof the last  Race in 1929, they saw no possibility of putting forward  a  defendingteam, or even  of holding the Race in this country.    5.  It does not appear that the Royal Aero Club have made any real attempt toraise the necessary funds, and  the  submission which the  Club  have now  made      [22283]  &apos;
definitely entails a  reversal of the  Cabinet decision, if Great  Britain is to berepresented.  The reasons which the Royal Aero Club give, and my advisers considervalid, for their inability to participate without Government help are, briefly :_      (i) That, in order to provide a team of four pilots of the requisite calibre, they             would have to withdraw ten or more of the best pilots in the employ-             ment of the aircraft industry for periods up to six months a project             involving such disorganisation and  expense as  to render  it quite             impracticable.  (It would,  I might add, react unfavourably upon the             delivery of orders for the Air Ministry.)  The discipline of such a team             is, again, a matter upon which grave doubts exist,  having regard to             the intensive publicity to which individual pilots are subjected.&quot;     (ii) The cost of the Race, if held by  the Club with the degree of support already             promised by the Air Ministry,  would  be in the neighbourhood of              110,000. The Club would have to start a public appeal for funds, but             it is very doubtful whether so large a sum would be realised;  and, in             any case, expenditure on preparations must be commenced  almost at             once, whereas an appeal will take a considerable time, and its result is             uncertain.  As already  stated,  the Club  do not appear as yet to have             made any attempt to raise  the necessary funds.     (iii) The only suitable venue  for the Race  is the Solent, where there are no             sufficient facilities for  dealing with the  personnel  and aircraft of             visiting teams except at Calshot Air Station, and where the control of             shipping and organisation of the course must necessarily be carried out             by the Navy and Air Force.  (This could, however, still be done, even if             the Royal Aero Club entered a civilian team.)     6.  The Royal Aero Club give me to understand that the French and Italianteams are receiving  the  full support of their respective Governments, which haveactively pressed forward their preparations, in spite of the dispute to which  theywere parties in the Federation.  The Club, on the other hand,  took the attitude that, until the dispute was settled  in their favour,  they  would not assume that anyRace wTould be held.  They admit now  that they have really no excuse for approaching the Government  at the last  minute,  having  regard to the  Cabinet decision whichhad been communicated to them in unequivocal terms thirteen months previously, butthis does not help matters.     7.  Whatever the delinquency of the Royal Aero Club may be, we are now facedwith the position that either we must give the Government assistance asked for, orthe Race cannot be run in this country.   I do not consider that public opinion would permit its being run here without the entry of a British team; and  the alternativesare,  therefore, either to support the Club, or to hand  over the Trophy to Italy, thelast -winner (1925), for competition there.     8.  The rule as regards permanent  retention of  the Trophy is  that it must bewon three  times in five successive contests.   The Italians won in 1926, we won in1927 and 1929.  Thus, if we do not compete in 1931,  and the Italians win the race,we could retain it by winning in 1933.   If the Italians do not win in 1931, then wecould retain it if we won in 1933 or 1935. The Americans might have flown over thecourse in 1924, when there were no other aircraft able  to do so,  but in a sportingspirit they declined to do this and annulled the Contest.  As they had won in 1923and  won again  in 1925,  this would  as  it happened  have  given  them  the  Trophypermanently.  They lost to Italy in 1926.     9.  As to the degree of support to be given by the Government, if at all, I shouldnot be prepared  to lend a team of RAF.  pilots to the Club.   It  is,  therefore,  aquestion of putting the British entry  and the full control of the Race into  the handsof the Royal Air Force, as in 1927 and 1929.     10.  The arguments in favour of  defending  the Trophy with an Air Forceteam are as follows :       (a) Otherwise the Race and perhaps eventually the  Trophy will pass from this           country without defence.  This, it is considered, would be prejudicial to-           national prestige.  We have won the Trophy twice, and we are now faced           with the competition of two foreign Governments.

Thus, if we do not compete in 1931, and the Italians win the  race,we could retain it by winning in 1933.  If the Italians do not  win in 1931, then wecould retain it if we won in 1933 or 1935.

This,  it is considered, would be prejudicial to-           national prestige.  We have Avon the Trophy twice, and we are now faced           with the competition of two foreign Governments.
     (b)  There is said to be a very considerable value for trade purposes in a British           victory in this Contest.  British products have a high  reputation for           excellence of workmanship;  the aircraft and its engine,  which won the           Races in  1927 and 1929, were examples of that quality,  combined with           supremacy in performance.   The  recent  successes  of British aircraft           manufacturers in  entering foreign  markets are said to owe a great deal           to these two victories; the confession that we are unable to enter this           year, on our own ground, would probably have its reaction.   This would           be  particularly unfortunate in the case of the rich  markets in South           America,  where we hope to make great progress as a result of the Royal           visit  and  the naval  aircraft carrier  proceeding to the Buenos Aires           Exhibition next spring.     (c) There is, I am informed, a good chance of our winning the Trophy in 1931, as           we are at present situated, and with  a much smaller expenditure than           would be necessary if we were to enter in 1933 or 1935.  A large part of           the necessary facilities can be readily  made available  from our existing           resources, such as  the High Speed Flight.  Pilots can be found from the           Air Force without additional expense, and two out of the three racing           machines  required are already in existence and need  only modification.           The volume of research work to be undertaken in connection with these           aircraft and  their  engines is considerably less than in previous years, and           forms part of  the normal advance  which  we expected  to make in the           problems attendant upon high speed flying.     (d)  If we win the  Trophy  a third time  it  passes into our keeping and the           Contests end.  I  am informed  that the American precedent need not           apply to  the present occasion if we win;  that the termination of the           contest would now be generally acceptable in all countries; and that there           is, therefore, no need for renewing the contest, or with it the rivalry in           mere speed,  which, when  the limits of  safety have been reached, will           undoubtedly  tenrpt competitors  to enter   machines  that are  actually           dangerous to fly.     11.   On the other hand,  Government participation involves      (a)  An expenditure of approximately   80,000, in addition to such services as           may properly be rendered by the Navy and Air Force as part of their           normal activities.  This sum would be supplemented by an expenditure of            15,000 by the Royal Aero Club, making   95,000 in all.  (This is less           than the total cost if  the Club undertook the whole organisation, chiefly           owing to  the expense of providing pilots);     (b)  An appreciable interruption of normal work  in my Department and in the           Air Force;     (c) Further, if we enter  and lose, our prestige^the prospect of increased trade           will presumably be lessened proportionately.     12.   Lastly, a reversal by the Cabinet of their previous decision, which decision was duly  notified  to foreign Governments, is  involved;  and the effect of such a reversal must  be considered.   In the  view of  my advisers, national  prestige is the . first consideration; and it is  thought  that general public opinion, together with the [influence of informed critics,  would be in favour of our undertaking the Race.     13.   There are also new  facts since the Cabinet decided in 1929 not to enter a Royal Air Force team.  It was then hoped that foreign Governments would follow our lead in abstaining  from  active participation in  the contest; on the contrary, they have pressed it forward.   Secondly, private enterprise has proved  unable to undertake the burden, and the dispute within the Federation, which has ended iniestablishing the correctness of the British contentions,  has also postponed the making*of any preparations  by  the Royal Aero  Club.  It now appears that the Air Force alone possesses the pilots and the facilities necessary to success, and  by entering the contest has a reasonable chance of putting an end to the effort and expenditure which this international contest entails, without loss of national prestige.     14.  If we enter on this occasion and win,  the  contest Avill then  end, as the trophy will become the property  of the Royal Aero Club.  If we enter and lose, our national pride will probably be so affected that we should be obliged to enter again, and so on, from contest to contest, until the trophy is won outright  by someone.                                                                           A.     Air Ministry, December  30, 1930.
FUTURE  SCHNEIDER TROPHY  CONTESTS.                   Government&apos;s Decision not to Participate.The Air Ministry announces :      The Government  have had  under review the future policy in regard to theSchneider  Trophy  contest  in  1931  and  subsequent  years.   After  carefulconsideration, it has been decided that a  Royal Air Force tea m will not again be entered,  thus leaving British participation to private enterprise under the auspices of the Royal Aero Club.    Two main considerations influenced this decision :     (1) That, owing to Government participation in recent years, the contest has           assumed a character not in accordance with the intentions of M. Jacques           Schneider,  its originator and the donor of the Trophy.    (2) That, although the entry of a Royal Air Force team was calculated to give a           much needed impetus to the development of high speed aircraft and did           so notably in  the  two latest  contests sufficient  data have now been           collected for  practical development in  this direction, and the  large           expenditure of  public money involved  by Government participation is,           therefore, no longer justifiable.    This decision should not,  of course, affect the entry of British machines infuture  contests.   Convincing  proof  has now  been furnished of what the british aircraft industry can do,  and the wide public interest displayed should make it possible for our pilots and machines  to compete in what is intended to be a sportingInternational event on a basis of private enterprise.
