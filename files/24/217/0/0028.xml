Memorandum by tho Hoge Secretary.                      At its meeting  on  tho 10th  instant  the  Cabinet            instructed no to proceed  at  once with  the  drafting  of  the            proposed Electoral Reform Bill without waiting  for  the            decision of the Cabinet with regard tc the  alternativeReference   &quot;v ote . *Cabinet78  (30)                I have already  circulated a  memorandum  to myConclusion 3            colleagues on the question cf the alternative veto  and  I            now  circulate a draft  of  a Jill which  has  been  prepared            to carry out tho decisions taken by tho Cabinet at  the            meeting on the 10th December and also  raises  for  their            consideration the two  points which were Isft  open.                      The Prime Minister has stated that  tho  Bill            will be introduced before the Christmas Recess, and if            this is to be done the  &quot;Long Title&quot; of the  Bill must be            settled at once.   This will involve  the  Cabinet  taking            an immediate decision  on  certain points of  importance  in            connection with the Bill.                      My colleagues will notice that  the  &quot;Long  Title&quot;            in the draft Bill enumerates -all the  separate points dealt            with in the Bill,   This  is  necessary, as  my  oolleagues            will no doubt agree,  If discussions en the  Bill are to  be            limited to certain specific  points and not  to be  allowed to            range over tho whole  question cf electoral  reform.   The            &quot;Long Title&quot; suggested, however, is unusually long  and if            it is possible tc shorten it, that will be  an advantage.                      In order to  settle what  should  gc into  the            Long Title I should be glad  to have the                                  - 1  -
                                                   4 1 O                                                   i... o  -decision cf the Cabinet on the following points:     Clause I.   The Alternative Tote.    The Alternative Voteas applied to the double-member constituency becomes a very complicated thing, and it is suggested in the draft that the double-member constituency should be exempted from its operation.    The number ci such constituencies is fourteen.     Clause II.   Abolition of plural voting.   Two alternative forms of clause are presented.   The first carries out what i believe to be the wish at the Cabinet, namely, the entireabolition of the business premises qualification.   If 1 that is done, the effect will be that in future voters can cnly be registered in respect of residential qualificationis;  and though it will be possible for an elector tc have a residencequalification in mere than one constituency, he will onlybe able to vote once at a general election&apos;.     The entire abolition of the business premises qualificationhoy/ever, raises a great difficulty as regards the City of London.Ihe electorate of the City of London, apart from some few-thousand caretakers, is composed almost entirely of personsregistered in respect of business premises qualifications *The abolition of this qualification will entirely alter the character of trie constituency, and would make it impossibleto retain it as a separate constituency, or at any rate as a     -memberdouble/constituency.    Any such proposal, of course, will raise a storm ox controversy, and the Cabinet may think itbetter to avoid the difficulty by leaving the City of Londonalone.   Under the first form of clause 2 this could be doneby expressly excluding the City from its operation.   IheCabinet ought perhaps, however, to consider whether there wouldnot be some advantages in leaving the business premisesqualification alone and in simply making it illegal to vote more than once at the same election.   This would leaveunaffected tne position ox the City of London, and might beexpected to reduce the opposition to the clause.   Thissuggestion is embodied in the alternative form of clause                         -2-
     Clause 17.    The Cabinet when deciding that the Eillnot provide for the restoration of the half-yearly register,said that further consideration should be given to the possibilities-ity of making provision for the absent voter.   I understandthat the class of voters whom the Cabinet had particularlyin mind were persons who, during the currency of a register,move out of the constituency.     Clause IT has been drafted in order to let the Cabinet awhat shape such a provision would have to take.   The removedelector would be required to give notice to the registration officer (presumably on a form which, could be obtained at somexublic Office);  the registration officer would have to satisfyhiiuself by some method cf verification that the notice was bonafide, and, on being so satisfied, would  outer the name of theapplicant on a special list to be kept for the purpose.     The scheme  would require seme working out and may provesomewhat elaborate, but 1 do not believe that there would be anyinsuperable difficulty about it.     On the other hand I ought to add that the clause will addgreatly to tho work of the registration officer, and alsoincrease the complexity cf the proceedings at an election.  Thepresent absent voters&apos; list is a very small one and causes no serious difficulty, but the list of removed voters may be along one.     I think the Cabinet should also bear in mind that everyenlargement cf the principle of absent voting is an encroachmenton the secrecy of the Ballot Acf, and it becomes a serious matterwhen the number of persons voting in this way runs, as I think itwill run, into hundreds of thousands tnroughout the country.     I should also point out that any extension of the principleof absent voting will lead to further demands,   Many applicationshave been made to the home Secretary since the passing of thelast Representation of the i-people Act to extend the principle to various classes, such as the blind, invalids, Members ofParliament wording a constituency, etc., etc.   With eaoh.extension it will become more difficult to resist fresh demands.                           -3-
   QFLauso 8. use of motor-cars at -elections.  I was also  r/sk^fe.by the Cabinet to consider the desirability of amending thelaw so as to provide for the registration of all motor-carsto he used at an election and for placing them at  the entiredisposal of the returning officer.     Since the Cabinet meeting, the question has been discussed on a private member&apos;c Motion in the House of Commons on the10th December.  During the debate a promise was given bythe Government spokesman that the Government would seek todeal with the natter in the Electoral Reform Pill, and onthat promise the Motion was withdrawn.     Clause 5 has been drafted to give the Cabinet an idea ofthe shape \.hich a proposed on this subject would have to  take.There was a general agreement, during the debate in the Commonsoa. the private member&apos;s Motion, that the use of a  car by  itsowner for the purpose of conveying himself and members of his family resident with him, should not be interfered with.  Itwas also felt that prevision should be made for the conveyance of the sick,  the aged and infirm.     The first question which the Cabinet have to  decide  is whether the clause should remain in the Bill. Assuming thatthey decide this in the affirmative,  the following points havesto be taken into consideration,      (l) Is the clause to be limited to motor-cars or is itto include all kinds of vehicles? Presumably it Ghould applygenerally, as does the existing law in regard to the hiring of vehicles:     (8)  Is the prohibition to extend to convenance from  the poll as well  as conveyance to the poll? It will be representedwith some force as a very great hardship if a driver of apassing vehicle is to be prevented from offering a lift to atired voter on his way home from the  poll:     (3)  Sub-clause 2 provides for the conveyance  of sick,aged and infirm voters to the poll,  and suggests two alterna-tive methods  by which this can be arranged.   The first alter-native  would require the owner of a vehicle  who is -preparedto lend it for the/
purpose of conveying such voters to the poll, to place iton a register to be kept for the purpose by the returning officer, and would then leave it to the election agents ofthe candidates to arrange among themselves how the vehiclesso registered should be used for this purpose.   Thesecond alternative simply requires the owner of a vehicleto send the returning officer notice of his intention touse the vehicle for that purpose.     I have given careful consideration to the question andI think that either of the alternatives suggested in theSill affords a practical method of dealing with the use of vehicles at elections.   In any case I suggest that in no circumstances would it De right to impose on the returning officers the duty of allocating the vehicles put at their disposal.     Clause 6.   This clause gives effect to the decision ofthe Cabinet (1) that the payment of speakers should be legalised,and (2) that expenses incurred by any speaker, whether employedor voluntary, e.g., in coming to a meeting, should be includedin the candidate&apos;1 s expenses.     I should call the attention of the Cabinet to a serious difficulty that arises in connection with the clause.  Is itpractical to require that the return of election expenses should include, not only the sums paid to, and the travelling expensesof, speakers who are emplo3red by or under the authority of the candidate or his agent, but also speakers who are sent down by independent bodies, such as the Navy League, the Anti-vivisection Society, the Feminists organisations, etc., etc.,or speakers who intervene in the election and address meetings on their own account?  If any attempt is made to bring suchspeakers under control, will not the Government be accused ofof attempting to interfere with the freedom of speech?
i 9 9X W i-i      Clause Till.    This clause giv ea effect to tho decision of the Cabinet,   The Cabinet have not yet decided whether it is to apply to  all political organisations, national and local, or only to  certain kinds of political organisations, and if so, what kinds?   An Iranediate decision on this. point is neceasary .                              (Intld.)  J.R.C.Home Office,    16th December, 1930.
