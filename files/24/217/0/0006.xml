                       KEMORAKDU M ^                On  September  24th  last  the  Cabinet decided to cancel      their  previous  decision &quot;that the  disposal  of government-owned      arms and munitions  of war  to  foreign states,  whether directly      or  through private  contractors,  shmild not  be sanctioned&quot;;  and      decided that  &quot;the wider question of removing  obstacles from the      export trade  of this country  in  warships  and  war materials  should      be  reserved for consideration at a later  meeting of the Cabinet,      after  the  re turn of the Secretary  of State  for Foreign Affairs      from Geneva&quot;.                On  September  30th,  the Cabinet  agreed &quot;that the      Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign Affairs should do his utmost to      ascertain  the facts regarding the  policy  of the Italian Govern-      ment in the matter  of the  export of war material and warships      including  extended  credits&quot;. cy              The Admiralty have  supplied a tabular statement ofthe Tan.   instances  where Italian shipbuilding firms  have been successful rri-&quot; ^    over other competitors  in  securing contracts  from foreign govern-      ments  for  the construction of warships.   Although enquiries in      every  possible  direction have been made,  and reports have been      furnished  by  His Majesty1s Ambassador and the Naval Attache at      Rome,  the  Foreign Office can  add little to  what the Admiralty      statement  shows,  i.e. that there are very strong grounds but no      definite evidence for believing  that the  Italian Government gives      financial  assistance to Italian&apos;firms competing for foreign      warship construction.    Thus  it  is probable that subsidies are      given  secretly  by the Government in the form of remission of      taxation,  by  increasing the price  of vessels  building simultaneous-      ly  on  Italian Government account,  or again  by making good the      losses incurred by  Italian firms tendering  below cost price.                                 -1-                   x Cabinet 55(30),  Conclusion  8.
There is also reason to believe that the Italian Governmentintervenes to eliminate competition between Italian firmstendering for foreign biiilding orders.     The following facts are known for certain:-     (a) Italian Law provides for the payment of subsidiesin respect of merchant ships built in Italian yards.     (b) There exists an institution In Italy with a capital&apos;of 100 million lire subscribed by semi-governmental andpolitical organisations for giving loans to shipbuilders.The Government itself contributes 2\-f;. interest on loansgranted by this institution in respect of ships built in Italy.     (c) There is also in existence in Italy an officialscheme for underwriting export credit risks.. .  Although theprovisions of this scheme do not specifically apply tomaterial exported by Italian shipbuilding and armament firmsthere is no reason to suppose that credits are not in factavailable for this pxrrpose.     (d) The Italian Government grants exemption from duty toimported shipbuilding materials including materials, machinery and equipment imported for the construction or repair ofships of war or other type ordered by foreign governments in national yards.     (e) The Italian Government can guarantee shipbuildingyards against strikes.     (f) The Greek naval authorities state that the ItalianGovernment gave a direct subsidy of about  50,000 each tothe builders cf two destroyers bought by Greece,     (g) In the case of the contract for the first pair of turkish destroyers to be built in Italy by Ansaldo&apos;s (Genoa)                         -2-

                                                     32                                                       -it appears very probable that the Italian Government&apos; assumedresponsibilitsr for 5,. of the total 3ura to be paid by theTurkish Government, vh ich enabled the firm to borrow from the banks at a reduced pate of interest.   The shaky financialposition of Ansaldo1s and the fact that they allowed theTurkish Government payment over twelve years increase the probability of this.     There is no doubt at all that it is the policy of theItalian Government to secure for Italian yards all possibleforeign orders for men-of-warj  and although&apos;, the constructionloan facilities referred to under (b) above relate ostensiblyto merchant vessels, the presumptive evidence is that it isalso used for builders of warships on foreign account.     In conclusion, it will be observed that tiie foregoinganalysis of the question relates- solely to the question of theItalian Government1s support to firms supplying warships toforeign governments and that no reference-has been made to thegeneral policy of  the Italian Government  in respect  of thesupply of war material of which the Cabinet decision makesmention.   This omission is  duo to  the fact that no  direct evidence on this head exists in the 1&apos;oreign Office files.On the other hand, reports  from  secret sources make  it clearthat Italian firms are busily engaged in  supplying war material to ex-enemy countries, in particular to Hungary and  Bulgaria,No information is, however,  available, to show whether theItalian firms conducting this illicit traffic are also inreceipt of financial assistance from official sourcesa     On the wider  question  of removing obstacles from our export trade in warships and war material,  the Department of
                                                                 .3 o Overseas Trade have also been consulted,  and they have stated that although conditions vary in different parts  of the &quot;world,  loss of business to British firms is chiefly  due to  their inability to  offer sufficiently long credit  facilities.      In South America,  for  instances  there  is certainly a fairly regular and steady trade  in military armaments and munitions,;  but on  the naval side it is  clear that British firms are not  doing as nuch trade as they might,      The sane may be said of countries in Northern Europe, such as  the  Baltic States.   This country hss hitherto always been the chief purveyor of military Var material to these  countries, and this position is being  maintained without much difficulty, since  the armies concerned  having  always  been equipped with British guns,  rifles, e tc*  must addresr themselves to us for replacement,  repairs and ammunition.   On  the other hand  two recent  cases  in connexion with the supply of aeroplanes  and of submarines  have entirely turned on the question of credit being granted by the firms  concerned.     In  the Near East it appears that  in  Turkey British firms experience  the  same  conditions  and difficulties as in SouthAmerica.  British  firms  are  unable to  compete  in Persia owing to tho much lower  cost  of ar:is  imported from Russia,  and  (more recently) from  Czechoslovakia  and  Belgium^     In  Eastern Europe  and  in   the Levant,  the  Italians and the French  are  our  chief competitors.   Experience  shows that the chief cause of  tho  loss  of  contracts  is due  to  the difficulty of  granting the  long credits which most  of  the  lesser European countries require.   Hero Italian firms, as  already mentioned, gain a  definite  advantage through  the  support  of the  Italian Government.     It maybe  convenient to quote  instances where inability to  offer  long credit jeopardises British  chances  of securing important orders*  It has recently been reported  that  thoYugoslav  Government  contemplate an early  development  of their
neval  strength.  IIi;s Ma.je.sty1 G Minister  at Belgrade  drew  theattention  of  the Foreign Office  in June  last  to  tho  importanceof  encouraging Yugoslavia  to  seek British  assistance in thedevelopment of hor naval activities, pointing out  that MessrsYarrow have rceentljr obtained e  contract for  the constructionof  certain shipyards,  and  entertainthe  idea  of  extending  their activities possibly in conjunction with  Messrs Armstrong--vickers,and Thorn;&apos;&apos;or oft 5 and constructing shipyards capable  of buildingwarships for  the Yugoslav  Government. Tho -Department of OverseesTrade conveyed this information  to Messrs. Yarrow, Arnotrong-Vickers and Thornycroft, who  replied that theywere  watching thesituation and co-operating inthe hope of obtaining  business. Thequestion of credit, however,  constitutes a great difficulty inall matters relating to the placing of orders for  Yugoslavia, andthe Department of Overseas Trade stated  that  the City would pro-bably require guarantees from His Majesty&apos;e Government if  pressed to extend credits to interested British  firms.     To take  another example. At tho invitation  of the roumanian government an Admiralty official recentlyexamined the possibilityof constructing a naval base  in  the Black Sea, and reportedinJuly last in  favour of a base involving  an expenditure of  someten million pounds. At tho wish of the Roumanian G-overnnc-nt he alsosubmitted tothemrecomnendations for a  considerable programme ofship construction. The usual  question of finance has up to newdebarred the Roumanian Government from taking any decision both with regard to the naval b  ase and orders for  the new ships.. It isto be anticipated, howover, that as soon as a favourable opportunity-nity arises the Roumanian Government will invite tenders for these schemes and the question as to whether British firms will  obtainthe contracts will depend  entirely upon  whether  they are able tooffer the necessary long term credits^     The final example I would mention Is that the portuguese government recently announced their intention to place orders                          -5-_______
     in the next few years for ships etc.to the total value of     ten million pounds.  It is expected that tenders will very     shortly he invited from selected British,  French, Italian     etc.  firms in connexion with the first part of the programme.     Preliminary circulars have already Been sent to British firms.     His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Lisbon fear that  Italian firms,  owing     to what clearly appears to be the financial support of their     Government;  will stand the best chance of  obtaining orders.               The foregoing completes the  information which the     Foreign Office has  been able  to collect.   It inevitably     raises  the question of the expediency  of extending the     Exports  Credits  Scheme  to  include  the  export of  arms,     munitions  and  war material, but on this point  I  must  give     it  as my emphatic opinion  that  such a  measure  cannot be     entertained.              Apart  from  the fact that  it  would  involve legislation     to modify  the Exports Credits Scheme to include  war material     it would place His Majesty&apos;s Government in an  almost     untenable position as regards their policy of  limitation of     armaments.   His Majesty1s Government  are at present in the     forefront of the struggle  to secure world wide limitation and     reduction of armaments, and it would be totally  inconsistent    with their principles and their policy to promote legislation    permitting them to extend credit facilities to the export of    arms.    This aspect of the question is of fundamental importance    and must be borne in mind in the consideration of any steps    which it may be thought necessary to take with a view to    assisting British armament firms to compete in foreign markets.                               -6-s  The exclusion of munitions of war from the Trade Facilities Bill   of 1921 was the result of an amendment moved by Lt. Com. Kenworthy   on 27th October, 1921, and accepted by Sir R. Home on behalf of   the Government. (Sea Hansard Vol. 147: col.  1119).  There is no   record of it being discussed in the Cabinet.
