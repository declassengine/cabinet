THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1930.SECRET.Copy  No.36CP. 409 (30).CABINET.FUTURE  OF SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN RHODESIA.   Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the                      Secretary of State for the Colonies.    WE desire to bring- to the notice of the Cabinet that important questions arelikely to arise in the near future affecting Southern and Northern Rhodesia and therelations of both to the territories to the North and to the South of them.    The facts and the considerations involved will be set out in a later memorandum,which is in course of preparation.  In  the meantime,  as our colleagues will  havenoticed, there have been  several  Parliamentary Questions and  discussions  recentlydealing with partial aspects of the problem, and we are somewhat apprehensive lest,if these continue, the issues involved may become a matter of party politics in thiscountry.    Our view is that these issues are of such importance to the future of southern and  Eastern Africa that any  decision reached should,  if  possible,  have  theconcurrence of the Leaders of all Parties in this country, so that continuity of policymay  be assured.  We therefore seek the  authority of the Cabinet  to inform theLeaders of the  Conservative and Liberal Parties that we are now engaged in con-sideration of the whole problem;  that we should like to study it  in consultation withthem;  and that we hope they will feel able to nominate responsible members of theirParties to go into the problem with us as soon as we are in a position-as  we hope to  be  after a  few  weeks to put  before  them  all the  facts and the  relevant considerations as we see them.(Initialled)J.  H. T.P.Downing Street, December 5,  1930.[22176]
