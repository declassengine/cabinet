7&apos;QTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.B9m-                                           COPY NO.   ?S&quot;CP.  418(30).                                     --                         CABINET.                The Voluntary School Problem.   Memo ran dun ^ by ^ th e^ P r e s i dent of the  Board of Education.     I have had a series of disouBsiono with selected Members ofParliament of various  religious opinions in order  to  arrive ata more widely accepted form of an arrangement  under whichVoluntary Schools required for present re-organization  ofeducation could be assisted out of public funds.   The  result is the proposals which I set forth below.   They are the same inall essential principles as those which we had in  the  secondClause of the Bill in  the summer.   The main scheme of  a voluntary agreement between the Local  Education Authorities andthe Managers remains the same.   The teachers still become public servants,  appointed and dismissed by the Local Education Authority,as in the first proposals.     The following are the modifications of the prcposals:-             The Denominations are encouraged  to set up   Associations of Managers who may be expected to deal with   the Looal Education Authorities in  a more satisfactory and   responsible  manner  than the small separate  Bodies of Managers.             The Local Education Authority and the Managers were,   under the first proposal,  to be able to agree to any sum, small   or great,  as the contribution of the Local  Authority towards   the re-conditioning or enlargement  of a school.   Under the   new proposal the contribution is to vary between a minimum of   50 and a maximum of 75 per oent. of the cost.   The Local   Authority will be responsible for improvements  in later years.             Under the new proposal, the agreement may  contain   a stipulation that  an agreed syllabus of religious teaching                               1.
 should he obligatory in the school.           Under the new proposal,  the agreement may adopt any one of three ways for the appointment of the teacherswho are reserved by the Denomination.   As already stated, none of them violate the fundamental principle  of teachers becoming public servants,           Finally,  the new proposals contain a  method of solving a deadlock between the Local Education  Authority and the Managers.                      PROP 0 S A L S.           Local Education Authorities may make  agreements      with Managers of Non-provided Schools which are      required for purposes of re-organization,  or for      raising the school leaving age.           Associations of schools may be constituted in      the area of any Local Education Authority  representa-      tive of the Managers of the schools of any particular      Denomination and of its Church Authorities.   Such      Associations shall be entitled to make agreements      under this Section on behalf of their constituent      Managers and to act for the Managers in every other      respect under this Act.           Such agreements are to be made between Local      Education Authorities on the one hand,  and, on the      other,  Associations of Schools or Bodies of Managers      of individual schools.   Throughout the proposals      the word &quot;Managers&quot; moans either Associations of      Schools or individual Bodies of Managers.           Schools which oome within an agreement shall be      aided towards the necessary improvements or re-      conditioning to the extent in the original agreement      of not less than 50 per cent,  and not more than      75 per oent, of the oost by the Local Education      Authority.
     Future improvements are to be the responsibilityof the Local Education Authority-  But the duty cf the Managers to keep the aohoclhov.se in repairremains unaffected.     The school oannot &quot;be olosed without the consentOf the Lc*.al Education Authority.     The&apos; agreement  may Stipulate that religiousteaohing accuraing &quot;oo an agreed syllabus shall beobligatory in the school.     The teaohex^ are to he in tho employment of theLooal Education Authority and are to be appointed and dismissed by them.     The agreement shall lay down how many teachersshall to&amp; reserved, as having religiov.s qualifications.The unreserved teachers shall &quot;be appointed as inprovided schools.  But the agreements shall permit a varioty of arrangements as to the methods of appointing the reserved teaohers.     The agreement may speoify alternatively -either (a) that the Local Education Authority shall            appoint the reserved teaoher,  provided            that he possesses some oertifioate of            oompetence or other qualification in            relation to religious teaching as agreed            on between the Looal Education Authority            and the Managers;or      (b)  that the Managers may hare the right of            refusing a teacher on grounds  of            unsuitability to the school for religious            purposes;or      (c)  that the Managers may have the right  of            recommending a teacher for appointment            from the applications sent to  the Looal            Eduoation Authority for  the vacant
                    teacher-ship, on the understanding that  the                    Local Education Authority do not  refuse to                    appoint the recommended teacher on grounds                    Bolely connected with his religious                    suitability and competence.               Reserved teachers are to be diomissable by the          Local Education Authority.  But the Managers may          request the dismissal on religious grounds.               In oase of a serious deadlock between  the          Managers and the Local Education Authority  as tc          either appointment tr dismissal,  the matter shall          bo decided by an arbitrator appointed  by the B  arc1.          tf Education, assisted by two assessors - cne          appcinted by the Local Educatitn Authority, tho          other by the Bishop af the Denomination tc  which  the          school belongs.     The question which needs immediate deoision is what  further steps are to be taken to secure a settlement and what I am  tobe enabled to say on the Report Stage and Third  Reading of  theEducation Bill.     During the Committee Stage the Catholics in our  Partydefinitel3r intimated that unless there were some sort of settlement likely to be arrived at they would probably have to vote against the Third Reading.   Mr. Scurr said in Committee -            &quot;I wish to give the Right Kon.  U-entleman  an       opportunity to oonsider the representations ,.7hioh  have       been made to him, the various ideas  &quot;which have been       placed before him,  the proposals svibmitted. to  him  by       myself and by other people,  in order that  he may be       able to come to the House later on and say to  vis:       &apos;Let this Bill go through because.se I  pledge the vjovern-       &apos;ment to introduce the other Measure vhich -/ill give       &apos;those schools the assistance which  they need.&apos;  If                             4.
           &quot;that does not come at a later stage,  and if no           provision Is made for the non-provided schools I an           prepared to vote against the Bill.&quot;     Moreover, apart from the situation in relation to theEducation Bill, it is a matter of vital importance to our Partyto he able to meet the demands of the Catholics as far as theyare compatible with proper public control.   2tfo betteropportunity is likely to arise than the present.     The Archbishop of Canterbury is of opinion that theproposals are as satisfactory to his Church as the previousones, and he has no doubt that they would be acceptable.The Heads of the Catholic Chur&amp;h have expressed themselves asdefinitely ready to aocept those proposals.  It is prettyelear that Nonconformist opinion would remain divided, as itwas in the summers     The oourse SThich I recommend is that I should be empoweredto announce on Wednesday that the Government are now in aposition to put forward what they regard as a satisfactory solution of the Voluntary School problem.  But beforeintroducing a Sill embodying -their proposals the president ofthe Board of Education proposes to invite representatives ofthe chief parties interested, namely the looal EducationAuthorities, tho Church of England,  the Eree Churches, the catholic Church, and the Teaohers, to meet him in conference inorder to discover how far actual agreement can be arrived at.It is proposed to hold the conference in the beginning ofJanuary so that the Government may be in possession of itsviews a3 soon as Parliament re-assembles.
