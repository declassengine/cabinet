Klg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.,^CRETc.1^416(30).COPY NO,                         CABINET.                       RUSSIAN &quot;DUMPING&quot;.       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I attach, for the information of my colleagues, amemorandum summarising the information available in myDepartment concerning the sale of Russian goods on the british market in conditions which are alleged to constitute &quot;dumping&quot;.     It will be observed that except in  the case of wheat and timber no substantial Imports have up to the present takenplace? and only a few isolated trades are concerned.     &quot;With regard to price, definite and  reliable information isdifficult to  obtain.   The Russian Government, however, inpursuance of  their five-years&apos; plan are  under urgent necessity to secure foreign exchange, and it is not unlikely that inorder to dispose of as large quantities  of goods as possiblethey will be  ready to underbid their competitors in this andother markets.     As regards possible action to prevent the so calleddumping of Russian goods, it is perhaps  worth pointing out thatthe effect of large Russian exports on world prices would be practically the same whether she sent them here or elsewhere.In France and Belgium action has been taken to control importsof certain commodities from Russia by means of a system of licences.   &quot;We, on the other hand, in common with Germany andother countries which have concluded treaties with Russia, areprecluded from differentiating against Russian goods (whetherby duties or  licences or prohibitions) under the terms of theexisting commercial agreement;  this agreement could only be denounced&quot;at  six months&apos; notice, and then only if we wereprepared to contemplate the policy of breaking off all trade relations with that country.                                -1-
       In this  connection  it is perhaps worth noting that our   exports to Russia have since the signature of the agreenent   increased far more  than  our imports from that country.   The   agreement was signed  and took effect  on April 15th.   In the   five months,  May to September,  1930,  exports of United Kingdom   produce to Russia amounted in value to 3^ millions sterling as   against a little over 1^ millions  in  the corresponding months of   1989,  while imports from Russia, admittedly far greater in   value, have increased from little  over 12 millions to  rather   under  13  millions.       In reply to frequent questions in the House  of Commons   asking what action  is being taken  to  check imports of &quot;dumped&quot;   goods  from Russia,  I  have pointed  out that the only way in which   action can be taken is by duties or prohibitions, and that I am   perfectly  satisfied that the  loss  to  our trade from any action   of that kind  would  be greater than any gain;  His Majesty&apos;s   Government  therefore  do  not propose to take  any powers to   prohibit  or restrict  the importation  of  goods  into this country   on the ground of the prices at  which  they  are  offered.   With the   concurrence cf my  colleagues  I  propose to  continue to take   this  line.                                   A7.G.Board of Trade,   9th December, 1930*
                                                                S3            THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF RUSSIAN &quot;DUMPING&quot;                      IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.   (l) Wheat.  A table is attached (Appendix I) showing thoimports of wheat fram Russia for the crop years 1910-14 and19 20-1930.   In the five crop years 1910-14, approximately 15?$of our imports of wheat came from Russia.  In most seasons sincethe war imports from Russia have been very small, the highestfigure (before the present season) being reached in the yearAugust 1926 to July 19 27, when they amounted to 4J- million hundred-weights (about 455 of the total imports).  Since the present seasonbegan, out of a total import of 39,839,837 cwtsc 11,277,074 cwts.or 28 per cent, have been received from Russia.  The amount andproportion of the Russian supplies have been rising rapidly, and during the last month have been over 50 per cent,, but it is notto be expected that this rate will be maintained throughout theseasqn*-     Oomparison of prices is difficult owing ts the variations in&apos;quality, but there is no conclusive evidence that Russian wheathas been sold in this country except at a competitive price.     It has been estimated that the requirements of wheat importing puntries this year will be 396,000,000 cwts.  and that the surplusavailable for export; from the wheat exporting  countries this year will be 613,000,000 cwts.   The recent large decline  in wheatprices has been caused by this excess of supply over  requirements and to this excess the Russian contribution is expected to be60,000,000 owt.    (2) Fruit Pulp. Imports of preserved fruit  from Russia devolped in  1929 and  1930.   In 1929 Russia  supplied 53,000 cwts, of fruit^preserved without sugar, out of a  total import of 1,037,000 cwts.The Russian  supplies consist mainly of strawberry, raspberry, andblackcurrent pulp.   Prices of all  imported fruit pulp during thepresent year are said to have been extremely low.
   (5) Sugar Product3.  Imports of glucose from Russia have developed during the last few years, and in 1930 became important.During the first nine months of the present year, 129,000 cwts. ofliquid glucose were imported from Russia out of a total of459,000 owts. imported.   The average value of this Russian glucoseas indicated in the import returns has been approximately 15-3lower than that of glucose imported from all other countries duringthe present year, and works out at  13/3d. per cwt. exclusive of theduty of o/4d. per cwt., i.e. 18/7d. per cwt. duty paid,,  Accordingto the London Corn Circular, the average price of English liquidglucose this year has been approximately 20/Sd. presumablyincluding the excise of 2/8d.     Imports of confectionery from Russia have also increased, andamounted during the first nine months of 1930 to 8,962 cwts.,valued at  23,192, out of a total import of 53,530 cwts,, valued at  195,153.  The average value of  Russian imports&quot;has been only about two thirds of that of the imports of confectionery from othercountries;   different kinds and qualities of confectionery,however, may be in question.    (4) Cotton Goods.  In the early  months of this year there wererumours that large quantities of cotton goods were to be imported intothis  country from Russia at extremely low prices.      There is nothing to show that  such importation has taken placeexcept in very  small quantities.  Information was subsequentlyreceived that British export houses had been approached fromRussia  with offers of a wide range of cotton goods at very low prices  (sometimes 40*3 below those of corresponding Britishproducts) suitable for the various  markets abroad in which thosefirms were ongaged.      In June of  this year after negotiations with the ManchesterChamber of Commerce, iir. 3ron  (the  head of the Russian trade delegation)  gave an assurance that  it was a definite policy
approved by  the  Soviet  Government  not  to  export  any  ootton  goods tothe United Kingdom at all.   Certain assurances were  also  givenconcerning sales of goods  for disposal In other  parts  of  the  BritishEmpire.   (5) Timber^  Before  the war a large proportion of our  supplies  ofsoft timber  came from Russia.  Since the  war imorts from Russiaproper have  been on a smaller scale, although in addition largequantities have  come from Finland, and other Baltic countries  formerlypart of the  Russian Empire.  In 1933,  however,  the British  market was disorganised by drastic reductions in price of Russian  timberin the latter part of the season, due to  an endeavour to  sell a largesurplus.  In 19f!9, in order to stabilise  the market, a  number ofBritish buyers combined to purchase the whole quantity which theRussians had for export to this country.    It was proposed to do thesame for the present year, but the earlier negotiations failed, andthe Russians have largely imported their supplies unsold, andendeavoured to dispose of them to firms not in the combine.  As a-result there are stated to be large unsold stocks in this country.Quite recently an agreement has been  reached.  The Central SoftwoodBuying Corporation, Limited, has agreed to take over a certainquantity of the surplus remaining this year, and to purchase thewhole of the Russian export  (fixed at a certain amount) for  1931;it has also an option  on the Russian  export for 1932.   It is under-stood that the  quantities involved represent a very considerable increase on those  sold in this country from Russia  in earlier post-Iwar years.  The increase in  supplies  from Russia Is causingIIconsiderable difficulty to Scandinavian, Finnish and other Baltic$exporters.     For  some time past there has been considerable disorganisationfpf  the market,  but the recent agreement should result In a stabilisation-Ition  of prices  though  perhaps at a  lower  level than some years ago.
   6. Doors,  It has been stated in the Press that  largeQuantities of Russian doors are to be imported at extremely low prices.   It appears that an agreement has been reached betweenArcos Limited and a British firm providing that the latter shall take the unshipped balance of the 1930 output of four Russianfactories (some 50,000 doors) and the entire production for 1931,which may be as much as 600*000 or 700,000 doors.   The purchasershave also an option on the entire output for 1932.   No public statement has appeared as to the purchase price, but it has beenalleged that the price of these doors is 5/3d. as compared with10/3d. stated to be the loweet price at which doors could be madein this country or imported from other sources.     The United Kingdom output of builders&apos; woodwork  (window frames,doors, etc.) was valued at , 3,000,000 in 1924, while the  totalimports were  700,000 in that year and  1,350,000 in  1929  (mainly from the United States of America and Sweden).   Russia has not                                                 -previously been a supplier.   It may be noted that in the yearended March last, about 200,000 working class houses were built inEngland and Wales:  allowing 10 doors to one house, 600,000 doorswould supply 60,000 houses.     It is  stated that the Russian factories concerned are includedin the &quot;fair list&quot; kept by the British Amalgamated Society ofWoodworkers.  The condition for admission to this list appears tobe that the conditions of work at the factory  shall have been agreed between the employers and the operatives&apos; organisation in  thecountry of  production.   7* Furs.  Attention has recently been drawn,  at a  meeting ofthe  trade organisations concerned, to the importation of Russianfurs, both  dressed  and undressed.   It was  stated that Russia wasestablishing well equipped factories for treating skins and was already exporting dressed and dyed goods in such a way as  to causedisorganisation in.  the market.  There appeared to be  no basic priceeither for  Russian  raw skins or for dressed and  dyed  skins, and
many of the latter were being offered below the price of the  rawmaterial.     Imports of undressed fur skins into this country in 1913were valued at  4,300,000;  of these about 12 per cent, came  fromRussia.  Imports of manufactures of fur in 1913 were valued at 1,600,000, and of these just over 1 per cent, came from Russia,In 1925 imports of undressed fur skins were valued at  9,100,000and In 1929 at  10,200,000;  about 30 per cent^ came from russian 1925 and about 11 per cent. In 1929.  Figures for dressed  furs,on the other hand, shew that in 1925 out of a total import valued at  3,300,000, about 6 per cent, came from Russia, and in 1929  thepercentage from Russia was approximately 9 out of a total valued at  5,900,000.  The actual value of dressed furs imported fromRussia rose from  198,000 in 1925 to  546,000 in 1929.  Thus  therehas been a tendency for the imports of furs from Russia to consistto a larger extent of the manufactured article.   8. Stearine and Oleine.   Complaint has been received from animportant British firm that the Soviet Government were negotiatingfor the sale of considerable quantities of stearine and oleine  fromRussia at prices below the present price in any country.  So  far,imports of these commodities from Russia have not been large.
