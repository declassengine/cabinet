IS, S C E, E T.In.P. 421(30)C A B I N E T.THE COTTON SITUATION.COPY HO,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs and the Presxdent of the Board of Trade,1.     On Thursdays .November 20th (accompanied by Sir Horace\wilson ) we again visited Manchester (the previous visit is described In CoP, 367 (30) in order to continue our discussions with representatives of the Spinning Section.   As before, ourmeetings were held under the auspices of the Joint Committeeof Cotton Trade Organisations.2.     In the morning we had a meeting with the representatives ofthe Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Association whom we met on our previous visit.   The discussion was taken up fromthe point at which the previous meeting  ended.   We endeavoured to shorten the talk about external factors (monetary policy,return to the gold standard, fall in the price of silver, etc.)and their effect upon Lancashire, and to focus attention uponthe more immediate problems of the&apos;cotton industry.So     On the question of Spinning  amalgamations the spinnershave stated that they are prepared to believe that amalgamationsmay offer the possibility of achieving some degree of success,but there is some scepticism as to the competitive value of thelarge unit as compared with the smaller unit capable of being actively supervised in all its details by a competent spinner.4.     With regard to technical matters, the representativesassured us that they were fully alive to the economics whichwould, in certain circumstances, be secured by the use ofIndian and other short-stapled cotton.   They pointed out that                                                          &quot; ill(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF. HIS BRIT^TIC r^JHoTY&apos;.8 ,government!rp::,HT) .
it vac all a question of relative cost:  Lancashire has for -ears                                                                 Dipast used Indian cotton when it has paid, to do so,          Similarlys with regard to the substitution of ringspindles for mule spindles? and the introduction of machineryfor high draft spinning and high speed winding and warping? therepresentatives said that they were continually examining thepossibilities of such changes and making them wherever it wasprofitable to do so.   The. capital expenditure involved wacoften not inconsiderable and trey had to &quot;be sure that the economies which might be secured would give a fair return onthe outlay:  and the extent of the economies often depended onthe willingness of the Trade Unions to agree to altered ecnditiLcrosr.cf w orkingo5         This meeting? end the home Secretary&apos;s public speech at Oldham on the following evening? afforded an opportunity to dispel some of the misapprehensions current as to the lancashire cotton Corporation.,,   There is an impression that the very lowyarn prices which it has quoted - ana which it claims arebringing new trade to Lancashire - represent unfair competition?subsidised by loans free of interest from the Sank of England.It was made clear not only that is there no Government money inthe Lancashire Cotton Corporation cut that the advances whichit lias received from the Bank are loans on which interest is payable and which will have to be repaid^   The low prices which it quotes are? we understand? made possible by theproduction economies resulting from a large scale amalgamation.,6r,    .     Although it is not possible to point to any concreteresult f rcm this meeting? the dis&quot;cussicn was by no means fruitless sThe age-long individualism of Lancashire is not easily/ convertedand in any case the men in the trade are oppressed by the overwhelming effects of the adverse world position - the boycott?the Indian duties? unrest in China? cheap labour costs in Japan?etc, - and it is far from easy to demonstrate that the economies
to be derived from internal re-organisation will do  much to overcome these difficulties.   If, however, the lancashire cotton Corporation proves a success - at present the spinnersare frankly dubious about its prospects - the whole  attitudetowards amalgamation should quickly change and this  would bring in its train greater financial ability to go aheadmore speedily in the field of technical improvement.7.         Mr. Herbert Lee, Chairman of the Joint Committee.arranged for us to meet the leading Indian shippers, who wished to bring to cur notice the catastrophe which has fallenupon the Lancashire cotton industry as a result of the recent events in India, and to urge the Government at the Round table conference to have very much in mind the vital importance Ofthe Indian market to the prosjerlty of Lancashire,   A  separatenote has been circulated upon this question (CP. 397(30)),8.         In the afternoon we received a  joint deputation fromthe American d Egyptian Spinners1 Sub-Committees who propoundedcertain proposals for fixing minimum prices for yarn and forapportioning the available trade  among the members of the conventions.  These proposals (Statutory backing is demandedin  the case of the American scheme)  affect ether interests andother sections of the trade, and  it was not possible to express an  opinion upon them until the views of others were available.In  the circumstances we could only promise to give theproposals our most careful consideration.   In order to elicitthe views of  the trade as a whole, we intend to ask theJoint Committee, as representing  every section of the industry,to  examine these schemes.9o         At the meeting, the promoters of the American scheme were asked to furnish an estimate of the funds which were likely to be available to give effect to the provisions of thescheme for eliminating surplus spindleage.   The promoterssubsequently asked Sir Horace Wilson to discuss this point, and
he held a further meeting with them on the 9th December?.when, it became apparent that the document placed before uson the 20th November was by no means complete and t hat theSub-Committee were still in process of formulating their proposals?   These proposals will have to be considered by theGeneral Committee of the federation of faster Cotton Spinners&apos;Associations before they can be referred to the Joint Committee.10i        Ve subsequently had an informal talk with somerepresentative spinners from the Royton and Shaw districts.These spinners have until quite recently been prosperous, butthis trade like the rest of the industry is now feeling theeffects cf the slump:  in addition it-has been affected bythe competition of the L.C.C.   &apos;./e explained the finance of theCorporation - see para, 6 - and so removed misunderstanding onthat point.   The principle, cf amalgamation has not appealed to these firms5 but we had an interesting discussion with them on the value of co-operation which? we hope.will bear fr-u.it.11.        v/e have still to meet again the Manufacturers&apos; .Federation.   This part of the trade  is peculiarly difficultto handle.   As a preliminary to our meeting with the largerbody, Sir Horace Wilson has had a number of private meetings with representative bodies of employers from the principalmanufacturing centres.   It will probably be necessary to defer our further Lie ting with the main body while the  &quot;eightloom&quot; Question is in its present critical phase.
