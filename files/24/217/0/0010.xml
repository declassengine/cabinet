Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.     I circulate, for the information of my colleagues,a note &quot;by the Secretary for Mines on the Coal Minessituation.VT nBoard of Trade,    5th December, 1930.
Coal Mines Situation.     The Prime Minister, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary for Mines met the Executive Committee cf the miners Federation on Wednesday evening, prior to the Miners&apos;Delegate Conference the following day.     A long discussion of the situation took place.   In  thecourse of it, the Government made the suggestion that, inorder to give the industry a &quot;better opportunity to ascertain the benefits to be derived from the measures of reorganisationunder the Coal Mines Act, the Federation should approve districtagreements for a &quot;spread over&quot; of hours for a temporary period,of, say, three months, subject to wages rates being maintained,and without prejudice to those districts which are not affectedby the Act or to those which have already reached agreements on a rigid 7-1 hour day.     At the Delegate  Conference it was recognised that  the&quot;mandates&quot; with which the delegates  came to the  Conference made it certain that any direct or  immediate vote for  or against  spreadover must result in an adverse decision.  Mo  such vote, however,was taken0     The  Conference voted first on the question  of recommending a national  stoppage.    The result was  230,000votes  to 209,000 against a national  stoppage  (Yorkshire,,Lancashire and Scotland  are reported to have  voted  in favour,and South Wales  to have  abstained) ,,   The  Conference  then considered the policy suggested by  the Government,  and  ultimatelydecided to  refer the  question to  the  districts.      The  following questions have  accordingly been addressed  by,t&apos;ne Federation  to  all districts.   (a)  Do yon agree to accept  the  suggestion of the  Prime        Minister  that  the  Federation give  the  Industry a chance        to get  its  re-organisation schemes  of the Coal Mines        Act working effectively by approving spreadover        applications  for  a temporary period  of three months        without  any reduction  in  wages,  and  without  prejudice        to the  position of those  districts not affected  by the        Aot  or  those  who have  arrived at  settlements on the        basis of 7-g hours per  day?
     If you are not in favour of (a) a vote should &quot;be given on one of the following alternative courses -     (b) To remove the veto of the Federation in Section 14.          Part III of the Act.     (c) To withdraw workmen now employed on epreadover or          prosecute the parties concerned.     The answers are to be returned in writing by Thursdaynext, and will be considered by the Executive, no adjournedmeeting of the delegate conference having been arranged.     Towards the end of the Conference it was proposed toconsider making a recommendation concerning the position inScotland, whore the bulk of the men are on stop, but thePresident of the Scottish Miners at once suggested that that matter should be left to Scotland to consider.  A delegate conference of the Scottish Miners is being held this after-noon.  I do not anticipate any difficulty on the part ofthe Scottish owners about maintaining wages, under a spread-over, for throe months.  The attitude of the South Walesowners towards this question is more uncertain, but, ifScotland reach agreement on those terms during the week-end,I anticipate that South Wales (where a meeting between owners and men takes place on Monday) - and the other (smaller)districts similarly affected - will follow suit.     As regards the legal aspect of the situation, it is clearthat whilst there was at least a tacit understanding byyesterday&apos;s Federation Conference that districts working undera spread-over would continue to do so pending&apos; the result ofthe  reference to the Districts, there was, for the reasonsindicated above, no direct or immediate vote on the questionwhether spread-over agreements should be approved.  In that respect the position appears to have been left &quot;sub  judice&quot;.
4G   The Scottish Miners&apos;  Executive met this morning.They have recommended the acceptance of the &quot;Spread-over&quot;to the delegates without reduction in wages and ask for ameeting of the Coneilation Board to-morrow morning.   Itis proposed that the spread-ever should he temporary forsay,  three months.      I now av/ait the result of  the Conference this afternoon.  In the event of its heing unfavourable Ipropose  to travel to Scotland to-night,  arrange  a meeting between  owners and men  and endeavour to  obtain  the best possible settlement,      As  soon  as all  districts are at work on temporary agreements I  shall  try  to  arrange a national meeting &quot;between the  owners  and  men with a view to arriving at a permanent settlement.E.S . 5/12.
