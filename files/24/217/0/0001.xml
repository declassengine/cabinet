EQUIPMENT 0? PRIVATE SIDINGS TO ENABLE THEM                     TO ACCOMMODATE 20-TON WAGONS.               Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.              I desire to inform the Cabinet of the present position      in regard to tho above matter in connection with which I was anked      to assist.              It will bo recollectod that the Standing Committee on      Mineral Transport in  their First Interim Report recommended that      Government financial  assistance should be accorded to the owners      of collerics and private sidings for the adaptation of screens      and other necessary alterations to enable 20-ton wagons to bo      accommodated and that the 3cope of the Development Act should be      extended by whatever  machinery may be most  suitable to cover this      work which in their view was essential to the,development and      re-equipment of the means of mineral transport.  The Cabinet last      April approved a proposal made by the Minister of Transport      and the Secretary for Mines  (CP.113/30) to tho effect that      negotiations should be entered into with the Railway Companies      with a view to tho adoption  of a scheme under which tho necessary      works will be carried out and tho capital provided by the Railway      Company concerned under agreement with such owners as Yforo      prepared to mako satisfactory arrangements with tho Railway      Company for the repayment by instalments of the capital provided.              Negotiations  with the Railway Companies took place      accordingly, and they eventually agreed so  far as they were      concerned to adopt the necessary arrangements,and, as stated      in the Memorandum submitted  on the 30th July by the Minister of      Transport to the Panel of Ministers for Unemployment (U. P .(30)19),                                                                 to / CRET.Trim, (so)
to submit to the Development Committee schemes for theImprovement of terminal accommodation to deal with 20-ton wagonswherever they can come to an agreement with the colliery ortrador c once modi   The Railway Company will give to the collieryor trader a 15 years period for the repayment of the cost of conversion and re-cpuipmont and will pass on to them the benefitof the Treasury grant, and they have now agreed to withdraw thestipulation,which they made at first, to the effect that theyshould be indemnified against default on the part of traders.        I understand that the Treasury and the development committee are prepared to concur in these proposals, but theRailway Companies urged upon the Minister of Transport that before putting them into force he-should submit thorn to the traders witha view to ascertaining ho?; far they would bo willing to  co-operate and a conference was accordingly arranged. Matters had reached this stage when the Cabinet asked me to report to them and,after consulting the Minister of Transport I presided over the firstconference.  Neither the Mining Association nor the NationalFederation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers would give any definitereply and it was necessary to hold a second conference, deferredat thoir request till last week.  I cannot say that the attitude on the part of the traders is so far very encouraging. The Iron andStool Federation,while not criticising in any way the proposed arrangements,doubt whether,in the present financial position of thoindustry,the scheme is likely to be largely taken advantage of bytheir members.  The representatives of the Foderation,however,stated that tho Federation would bo prepared, If the scheme were introduced,to recommend their members to tako advantage of It in suitable cases.  Mr*Evan Yifilliams on behalf of tho mining association took tho lino that the scheme as it stood was notoufficiontly attractive,,and that further financial concessionsboth on the part of the Government and of the Railway Companies(particularly in connection with the reduction of railway rates on traffic sent in 20-ton wagons) wore required.

Mr*Evan Williams on behalf of tho mining association took the line that the schorao as it stood was notDufficiontly attractive^and that further financial concessionsboth on the part of the Government and of the Railway Companies(particularly in connection with the reduction of railway rates on traffic sent in 20-ton wagons) wore required.                                                      I /
G                  I  made it  quite clear  that  the  generous  terras  of         financial assistance  offered &quot;by the  Government  (which are         likely  to be  equivalent  to  30 per  cent or thereabouts of         the  cost  of the  works) could not be  increased,  and  that I         regarded  the  terms  offered  by the  Rrd.1v/a;- Companies  (which         include an  offer to provide the necessary funds in the first         instance) as  going  as far as the Railway Companies could be         expected  to pledge  themselves to go  in their present circum-         stances,  I asked whether the Mining Association were prepared         to make a recommendation to their  members on the  same lines         as the recommendations which the Iron and steel Federation         were prepared to make,   Mr. Evan Williams said  that he was         precluded by  the decision of his Committee from agreeing to         take such a  ction3 but that  he would  report back to them and         would probably be able,  he  hoped,  to announce the decision         of his Association  early in December,                  At the  same  timer,  neither body  wished  the scheme to         be withdrawn, and while  I reserved decision on  this point for         the Cabinet,  I -think that,  although  it will he  seen that it         is not possible to obtain assurances that the scheme will be        widely adopted it would  be  desirable, if the Mining Associa-         tion arc  prepared to recommend their members to take advantage         of it in  suitable casess that it should  be put  into operation         and its effects tested.
