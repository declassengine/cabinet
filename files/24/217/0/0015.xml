Copy No. J?PCP, 415(50).           AGRICULTURAL LAND (UTILISATION) BILL.       Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.                 With regard to the discussion in the Cabinet on       Agricultural Policy, there Is one special point on which a       decision is urgently required.                 It arises out of the Agricultural Land (Utilisation)       Bill now before Committee, and was brought up in the discussions       in Committee this morning.   It involves an extension of tho       scheme for small holdings beyond the point anticipated during       the conversations I had previously had with the Chancellor of                                      -       the Exchequer and the subsequent agreement reached between us.                  In substance the proposal which is put forward by tho       Liberals,  which I gather the Conservatives will support,  and       which some of our party on the Committee would like to support,       is  that an agricultural worker should be placed in the same       position as an unemployed person with regard to applications       for and provision of small holdings.                 As a result of an arrangement with the Treasury with       a view to  meeting the most pressing cases,  It was  agreed  that       those who  would be entitled to small  holdings under tho  terms       applicable to the unemployed should include  agricultural  labourers       who have lost regular employment  on the land by reason of the       acquisition of land undor the  Bill,  and are  unable  to obtain       employment of an equally beneficial character in the  same locality                 The conditions under which  unemployed are to be provided       with small holdings include where   necessary tho provision of loam       free of interest,  for a  time for working capital,  stock,  etc.,       together with a maintenance  allowance  not  exceeding  50 in all,       or  3 0s.  in any week.                                     1.
      If  the  agricultural workers  on bloc -  were given tho same privileges,  namely,  the provision of a holding,  including capital end a  maintenance  allowance there might be almost an avalanche of applicants,  with far-reaching effects on farms where trained  let us; is  essential.   Some  of our colleagues however think that notwithstanding the  attractions workers would generally be slow to  apply  where  the:/ already  had good employment.      The  case  generally made is that we arc leaving the agricultural worker  out in the cold and creating a favoured class of  small  holders.  As  a matter of fairness it is, of course, difficult to defend  bringing an unemployment:/ed miner to a village and providing him  ;/ith an  equipped holding ,  an advance of capital and free  maintenance for a time and den?/ing similar privileges to  a man  who has been  an agricultural worker all his life and who is anxious to  obtain a holding.     The Chairman of  the Committee has ruled that this proposal may be brought forward as a new clause,  which should bo reached by  Friday, so  that a decision on  this matter is Immediately required.     A note  on the proposed amendment which has been handed to  mo by  tho Liberals,  is annexed.    -  I am fully alivo  to tho dangers which would be involved in the acceptance of  the  principle of the Liberal Amendment,  but I feel that I  should warn my Colleagues that if it is decided to resist the point v;b ,may bo defeated In Committee.                                        (Intld.)   C.A.stry of Agriculture and Fisheries,     9th December,  1930.I                           -2-  - :&apos;
                 APPENDIX TO CP,  415 (50)              LIBERAL MOTS ON AL35MDHEMT TO            AGRICULTURAL   LAHP (UTILISATION) BILL.          IThile realising that the main purpose of this -Bill- &quot;is to provide for unemployment, we wish to point out that itdetermines the oonditions of land settlement for many years to come,  and would,  If unmodified, raise in en acute formissues as between the industrial and rural worker.          The case is as follows:The agricultural worker is the lowest paid vsorlcor in tho       country.lie has no unemployment insurance.He has little opportunity of advancement and no inducement tc      remain on the land, and therefore the process of migra-      tion into the towns continues.   If the unemployed worker      from tho town is equipped with a small holding and      financed, while the agricultural worker is not, there      is a definite and strong inducement for tho agricultural      worker to le^ve the land and overcrowd the urban labour      market as a preliminary  to  securing a small-holding.If the Bill  is passed as at present there will be a prcat      sense  of injustice amongst  the agricultural workers.Tho financial&apos;cost will depend upon tho number placed      annually upon the land.Tho fear expressed by tho Kini3try that tho applications of      agricultural workers will be so  great  as  to  swamp the      boat  and that it will be difficult, if not  impossible,      to carry-an adequate number of unemployed parsons is-1-
     ex aggeratod, as  a number  of  agricultural  workers will     not wish to  carry tho responsibility  of a holding and     will prefer  to be employed at  a regular wage.Tho number of applications from all sources will probably     excoed the number of persons actually plaoed upon the     land and the number placed will depend -               (a)  upon tho scale  of operations,               (b)  tho,time they takt;               (c)  tho finance available.Tho Minister will have the pewor of selection  and he will     hold a roasonablo balanoo between applications from     unemployed persons and agricultural workers, and thus     secure that tho main purposo of tho Bill, in providing     for unemployed persons is adequately secured.
