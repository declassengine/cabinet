UMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.(30)                                                 COPY NO,     35                              CABINET.                    DYESTUFFS (IMPORT REGULATION) ACT.             Memorandum by  the President of  the Board of Trade.          The House of Lords yesterday amended the Expiring Laws      Continuance Bill so as to extend the operation of the Dye stuffs      (Import Regulation) Act, 1920,  (which  is due to expire on the      14th January next) until the end of 1931.          Lord Hail sham explained that he moved the amendment for      two reasons.  One was that  there was danger that the German      and United States dyestuffs industries might when importation      into this country became free dump their surplus production of      particular dyeetuffs here at prices far less than the cost of      production in the United Kingdom and far less Indeed than the      cost of production in the country of manufacture.  The other was      that the German industry, which is constantly producing new and      improved dyestuffs (in present  conditions admitted under licence),      would make the supply of these  novelties to British users condi-      tional upon their undertaking to purchase their bulk supply of      the more ordinary dye stuffs from Germany.  He accordingly urged      that the Act should be continued for a year, during which time      enquiry  should be made into the reality of the dangers indicated.          The Government have now to decide what attitude they will      adopt when the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill comes again before      the House of Commons  to-morrow, Wednesday.  I propose that the      Government  should ask the House of Commons to refuse to accept      the amendment and to  return the Bill to the Lords in the form in      which it was originally submitted to that House.-1-
     If the Lords insist on their amendment, however, it willI fear be necessary to accept it in order to avoid losing the expiring Laws Continuance Bill.     I have considered whether in that event it would be desirableto indicate that the Board of Trade propose to issue a general  openlicence under Section 2 (i) of the Dye stuffs Act for theimportation of all the commodities to which the Act relates, at  thesame time promising to revoke the licence so far as regards anyparticular commodity or class of commodities if it is shown to  the satisfaction of the Board that it is being  sold or- offered for  salein the United Kingdom at prices so much lower than the priceselsewhere or subject to such  conditions of  sale as to show thatthere is a deliberate attack  on the British industry.    Such anundertaking should meet the reasons put forward in the House ofLords for the continuance of  the prohibition.     There appears however to be considerable doubt whether theBoard have power to issue a Licence of so wide a  character, whichwould in fact render the Act nugatory.   Even if the Board have  this power there is a further difficulty in the  fact that the Act providesfor an Advisory  Committee to advise the Board on applications forlicence to import Dye stuffs.    It would  I think be difficult to announce my intention to issue a licence before  consulting the Committee.    It  is probable that the majority of  the  Committee,including the representatives of the makers and the  independent members and possibly some of  the user representatives, would adviseagainst the issue of a licence  of the kind  I have referred to.    It is true that the Board are not bound by the  Committee1 s  advice (although throughout the term of the Act they have  consistentlyfoliowed it), but to issue a  licence in  the face  of a  strongexpression of advice against  this  course would  obviously create  a difficult  situation.     An alternative  course would be to accept the  continuance
of the prohibition but to indicate to the  licensingcommittee that the Board are not prepared  to  refuse  an import licence in any case in which British alternativesare not readily available at as low a price,  unless  thereis good reason to suppose that the lo^er price of theforeign article is due to a systematic attack on theBritish industry.Board of Trade,    16th December, 1930.
