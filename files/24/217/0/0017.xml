HOUSING (HgBl4&amp; WORKERS) ACT, Jig 86^.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF^STATE gpR SCOTLAND                       AS TO CONTINUATION OF THIS ACT FOR A FURTHER PERIOD0          This Aot,  which was passed on loth December, 1926, h&amp;afor its  object the provision of better housing accommodation forrural workers by giving grants towards the reconstruction and   -movement of existing houses0  Expenditure an works of ordinaryrepair or upkeep is not eligible for grante except in so far as   338 may be incidental to or connected with the works of   srovemento  The grants are made by the local authorities,, andthe Exchequer contribute 50 per cent, thereof by way of an annual payment  for 20 years0          Under Section 2 (2) (c) of the Act,, grants can only begiven in respect of applications received by local authoritiesbefore 1st October,, 1931 ^  It Is therefore necessary to considerthe question -whether the operation of the Act should be extended for a further period..          Section 3 of the Act lays down the conditions on which ;he grant, is given,, including conditions that the house during a period of 20 years is not to be occupied except by a person, ofthe agricultural worker or like economic class,, and that what the -at terms &quot;the normal agricultural rent&quot; cannot be increased by    owner in respect of the improvements by more than 3 per centoon the.portion of the cost of the works he himself requires tobear.  The grant given by the local authority does not exeeacltwo-thirds of the cost of the works0 subject to a maximum grant  - . 100e so that the amount by which an owner may increase the rent Is relative^/ely small..  Moreover, in the casa of cottages on&quot;arms-, the question of an inorease of rent does not affect the*&quot;arra servant as no rent is paid by hlou                                                        The/

Following particularly on representations                                                     -made to the Department of Health for Scotland by the Scottish3?arm osrvants1&apos;  Union,  the Department have been, in eommunioationwith L0.2&amp;3. authorities urging them to have a survey made of thehousing conditions of rural workers and to follow that up bycommunications  to owners urging the necessary sr-ssedSaJ, action.-In this way the attention of owners is directed to the assistanceavailable under the Act for improvements as distinct from repairs-,          The progressive increase in action under the Act ieshown by the following particulars-The Act is,: however,, also applicable in burghs which inThe reason for the extensive use of the provisions ofM  &quot;    &quot;  1926oS1  &quot;    &quot;  1929.&quot; 30 th.

          As at trie last mentioned date,, grants had &quot;been paid on,463 houses amounting to  395;,339., while work was in progressan 2,, 430 houses o          The grant under the Aot 1b available not only to ordinaryowners but also to landholders within the meaning of the SmallLandholders (Scotland) Acts,  As at 30th. September,, 1930., of thetotal grant of . 530,, 264 premised.,  29,, 812 had &quot;been promised to small landholders in respect of the improvement of 333 houses,, endof this sum  13,759 had &quot;been paid in respect of 166 houses on.which work had &quot;been completed.  This is a class of the communityspecially deserving of assistance in improving houses.          In addition to air&apos;f lOTisirsts? local authorities to givegrants,  the Aot also authorises local authorities to make loans to assist owners in the improvement of houses -  This part of theAct has been more or less a dead letter, only some  2,721 havingbeen promised &quot;by way of loan in respect of 39 houses,          i3h.ile considerable advantage has &quot;been taken of theassistance under the Aot - more in some counties than in others -much yet remains to &quot;be done for the improvement of houses In the rural areas - a matter which the Scottish Farm Servants8 Union are constantly bringing to my notice,  I am, therefore,, of opinionthat it would &quot;be to the gain of rural housing if the operation ofthe Act were extended for another period of five years, and would urge that the Government take the necessary steps to arrangefor this extension,          I have consulted with the Minister of Health regardingthis proposal,,  and he has expressed the view that, so far asScotland la concerned.,  there seems to &quot;be good ground for theextension which 1 suggest,, and that, if the extension is made,, itmust apply also to England,          The Act has operated smoothly,, and there does not seemoccasion so far as Scotland is concerned for any amendment of itsterms0   Suggestions,, however,  have &quot;been made for amendment so tmto widen the classes of workers to which the Act applies,,  tout Ido not propose that this be flone,  for the following reasons;;-                                                            1%/
     It would be exceedingly difficult; to amend the Housing        (Rural Workers) Act without raising considerable        controversy o     A simple re-enactment of the Act for a period of, say, five        years would be likely to absorb less Parliamentary time,,       . and excite little opposition.     We had a considerable period devoted last Session to a        Housing Aoto          As already stated the Housing (Rural Workers) Act applies to all  applications received prior to 1st October,,  1931. Thepurpose I  have in view would be served by the introduction of thenecessary  Bill early in 1931o  And this I reoomraendo                             WMo ADAMSONoScottish Office.     11th December6  1930.
