REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.(a)  Composition and Terms of Reference.   1.  ON  the  24th July.  1930.. the Economic Advisory Council(E.A.C./7th Meeting, Conclusion 2 (c)) appointed a Committee withthe  following terms of reference :       &quot; To examine the figures of unemployment benefit and their   significance, and to indicate the abuses which have grown up in   the system and to submit recommendations for their removal.&quot;   2.  The Committee is constituted  as follows :    Mr. G. D. IT. Cole (Chairman).   Sir John Cadman, G.C.M.G.   Sir Sydney Chapman, K.C.B., C.B.E., Chief Economic Adviser         to His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   Mr. II.  P. Henderson.   3.  Sir Sydney Chapman has been prevented by his duties atGeneva and in connection with the Imperial Conference from taking part in our deliberations, and his signature is therefore not appended to this Eeport.   4.  At an early stage of our inquiry, we decided that it would be helpful to know what success  had attended  the measures adoptedin Germany for dealing with similar problems to those covered by our terms of reference. We therefore invited Mr. H. D. Hendersonand Mr. II. C. Emmerson to proceed to Germany for the purpose ofobtaining  this information.  By  arrangement with the Ministry ofLabour, Mr. F. S.  Flint,  of that Department,  accompanied theMission.   The Eeport of the Mission, which has been  invaluable tous, has already been circulated to the Economic  Advisory Council(Paper No. E.A.C. (H) 126). It  sets out the main conditions of the.British as well as  of the German system, and should be read inconjunction with this Eeport.   5.  The greater part of the documentary evidence placed beforeus has been  the same as that provided for the Advisory Committeeon Unemployment Insurance, consisting of representatives of thethree political  parties.   We have  also had the benefit  of  other information from the Ministry of Labour.   6.  We have had to take cognisance of the announcement in theKing&apos;s Speech  at  the opening of the present session of parliament that  a Boyal Commission would be set up immediately to inquire intothe whole question of unemployment insurance, and  in particularinto  the allegation of abuses of its provisions.  In view of  this pro-posal,  we considered  reporting to the Economic Advisory council that  we saw no reason for continuing our work, but we are convincedthat, as the matter is so important, such information and recommen-dations as we could offer  to the Economic  Advisory Council wouldnot be wasted.  As the proposed Royal Commission will be able  to investigate these   questions in  a much  more  exhaustive  mannerthan has been  open to us, we have not thought it worth while  tomake recommendations  in any detail  as to  the  specific remedies  tobe applied to  particular  abases, but have  confined ourselves  toputting forward  a broad  proposal  for reconstructing  the  unem-ployment insurance  scheme.Mr.  II.  V. Hodson, Assistant  Economic   Advisory Council.Mr. H. C. Emmerson, Ministry of Labour   joint secretaries   to theCommittee.(b) Procedure adopted by the Committee.[21969]B 2
   7.  Wo have interpreted our terms of reference so SIB to include those practices under the unemployment insurance scheme  which,while strictly legal, cannot have been in accordance with the inter; -tion of Parliament, and which constitute an unnecessary charge uponthe resources  of a contributory insurance fund  or, in the case of transitional benefit, upon the Exchequer.                  (o) Arrangement of Report.   8.  We have divided  our Report into two main parts.  The first(Section  II) deals with  the  abuses  which have  grown up  in  thesystem of unemployment insurance,  and which are reflected in thefigures of unemployment benefit: the  second part (Section III) con-tains the  outline  of  an  alternative  scheme  of  UnemploymentInsurance and Benefit, which we believe would serve to remedy thegreater part of the abuses.      II. DEFECTS AND ABUSES OF THE  SCHEME.   9.  In  considering  the  defects and  abuses of the  scheme  a distinction  must be  drawn  between  ordinary  benefit  paid out ofcontributions by  employers, employees  and  the  Exchequer,  andtransitional benefit paid entirely by the  Exchequer.  Some of theabuses are  peculiar  to  the transitional  arrangements, but others are due  to exploitation of  the rules for  the  payment  of benefit under the  ordinary- insurance scheme, and the latter are perhaps the  more  serious.  It  follows  that  the conditions  under  whichordinary benefit is paid deserve fully as much attention  as those relating  to  transitional benefit.   10.   We have not  attempted to draw up  an exhaustive listof abuses   and  defects,  but  the  following  will  illustrate  their nature:      (i) The ease  with  which a weekly income can be obtained by          systematically  working one,  two  or  three  days  in  a          week and  receiving benefit for the  others.   This applies          to short-time workers and to casual  workers.    (ii) The grant of  benefit  to seasonal workers  who are not          normally in employment in the off-season.    (hi) The grant of benefit for long periods  to  married women          who are unlikely or may have no real  desire to resume          industrial  employment.    (iv) The payment of benefit to  certain classes of workers out          of all proportion to their contributions.     (v) The payment of non-contributory benefit without regard  to          need at the same rates and on much the same conditions          as ordinary  benefit.    (vi) The payment of transitional benefit without limit  to persons          who  have  practically  no prospect  of  further  industrial           employment  because of  age,  physical  defect  or  other           permanent  disability  (including persons  in  receipt  of           workmen&apos;s compensation  who have had no employment           since their accident).    11.  The effects  of such abuses and  defects  may  be divided under two heads,  namely :      (i)  Excessive and  unjustifiable expenditure from public  funds           through the grant of benefit to persons who would  be           disentitled on sound insurance principles,  and  would  be           able to support themselves  without  the  assistance  of           Unemployment Benefit.     (ii)  Increase  of  economic  friction  and  the  encouragement  of           methods of industrial organisation which are  harmful to           trade and  employment in  general.    12.  Many features of the present system are,  of course, open to objection on both these grounds.  Almost every abuse which results in a continuance of  uneconomic methods of  engagement of labour results in unnecessary disbursement of public money, and to some extent the reverse is also true.  We desire, however, to emphasize
the dual need lor a reform of the scheme.  The exigencies of  the budgetary situation lend emphasis to the first class of effects at this time, but the waste of public money should not be allowed to obscurethe  consequences of  the  present   scheme in  creating  artificialrigidities or encouraging  uneconomic methods of organisation, and thereby diminishing  the  total  volume  of  employment  and  the productivity of the community.(a) Married Women.    13.  There is one class of beneficiaries to whom a great deal ofpublic attention has been  called in the past few months, whoseexistence  does not lay any particular burden on our competitive position., except  through the general weight of  taxation,  but whoare undoubtedly costing the Exchequer large sums of money whichcould be  saved  without  genuine hardship  to anyone.   We refer to those married women  who, while in many cases unable to fulfil the  requirements of  the  repealed  &quot;&quot;genuinely  seeking work&quot;condition, are now able to qualify for benefit by satisfying the localInsurance Officers and Courts of Referees that  they  are  availablefor work, or, where they apply for transitional benefit, that they will normally seek their employment in an insurable occupation.  Thereis no direct  evidence of the numbers of  claimants such  as thesewho have been  enabled  to draw benefit by the  relaxed conditionsoperating  under  the Unemployment  Insurance Act of 1980, or of the married women  whose  receipt of benefit might have been described as an abuse  before the passage  of that Act. The attention of  theCouncil may be  drawn, however, to  the recent large increase in  thenumbers  of married  women   drawing   Unemployment   Benefit.Between the 28th October.  1929, and the 27th October,  1930,  thenumber of  women  on  the  register of  Employment  Exchangesincreased  by 134 per cent., while the number of men increased by only S3 per cent.  On the 24th February, 1930,  the number ofwomen  claimants was  295,536, of whom 43-6  per cent, weremarried: on  (he 7th July, 1930. the number of women  claimantswas 433,927, of whom 45-9 per cent, were married; and on  the13th October, 1930,  the number of  women claimants was  477,253,of whom  50-0  per.cent, were  married.   The number of  marriedwomen  among  all  insured female workers  is stated   by  theMinistry of Labour to he  probably not  more  than 20  per cent.Further light is thrown  on this question by the division between&apos;&apos; wholly unemployed &apos;&apos; and &quot;&apos; temporarily stopped &apos;&apos; claimants  for benefit.  Of the married women claimants on the 7th July,  1930,67-7  per  cent,   were wholly unemployed, while  the correspondingproportion of the single  women claimants wholly unemployed wasonly 38-7 per  cent.   Between  October 1929 and July 1930,  thenumber of single women on transitional  benefit was  quadrupled,while the number of married women  on transitional  benefit was-multiplied  nearly six  times.    14.  The significance of these figures is  unfortunately  obscuredby the exceptional growth of unemployment  in the cotton industry,which employs  not merely an abnormal  proportion of women butalso probably a proportion of married to single women higher thanthe average.  The growth in  the  proportion of  married womenclaimants, however, is  not  confined  to textile areas, but extends toall  parts of  the  country.  This  is illustrated by the figures for theLondon and South-Eastern  Division,  which show diat  the pro-portion  of married women to  all women  claimants  increased asfollows :                                            Per cent.          February 24th,  1930     ......     38&quot;8          July  7th, 1930     .........     46&quot;7          October 13th,  1930 .........     49 n    15.  We are  convinced that  one  of tho  first steps to be  taken inrendering  the Unemployment Insurance Fund solvent and in reduc-ing tho  cost  of transitional benefit to  the Exchequer must be to fiedsome remedy for this particular abuse.  We  do not wish to put for-ward any  proposal in isolation,  but  we  have borne this matter vmind in devising the scheme which forms Section III of our Report
(b)  Short-Time Working.   16.   Among the abuses whose  direct effect is to diminish the-productivity of the country as well as to lay an excessive burden onthe Exchequer, the largest and most important appears to us to bethat of short-time working.  In formulating schemes of short-timeemployment, owners and managers of works devise their regulations in such a way as to obtain for their workpeople the largest possibleamount of Unemployment Benefit, and in particular to prevent theirdisqualification from benefit on account  of the continuity rule.  Inthis way, short-time schemes are rendered much more acceptable tothe workers than  they would otherwise be, and employers, secure inthe knowledge that their  labour force will be maintained for themwith little likelihood of its drifting away to  other firms or oceupa-tions, are encouraged to prefer this type of scheme to the permanentclosing  down of  some part  of  their  plant.   During  temporarydepressions, short time is to be preferred, as a rule, to  permanentdismissals and closures, especially on account of its social advantages,but those industries, such as the cotton  trade, which have resortedto it most since the War can no longer claim that their depression islikely to  last only a  few  months.   In such circumstances, theexpedient of working short time inevitably delays that reorganisation of the industry which is necessary if it is to stimulate demand andcompote successfully with its foreign rivals.  As between one methodof industrial organisation  and  another,  unemployment  insurance should at least be impartial, whereas in  the matter of short time ithas definitely taken sides and in fact encouraged the less salutarymethod.   It is realised, of course,  that the reduction of short-time working   would  result  in an  increase of  the   numbers  whollyunemployed; this is inevitable, but it would reveal the extent of thesurplus of workers  in industry,  and would release that surplus  for transfer to other districts and other industries.(c)  Week-end Work.   17.   Apart  from recognised  short-time working, there exists alarge  body of workers whose normal working week is less than six days.   Before the advent of State Unemployment Insurance, by nomeans all of the workers now working less than  a full  week and receiving Unemployment  Benefit  for partial unemployment wouldhave regarded themselves as unemployed or have sought to obtainfinancial relief  from any source but their own earnings.    This isespecially true where the short-time work is concentrated on specialperiods of the week, and high rates of wages are earned by arduousbut concentrated work.   Most cases bearing this description wouldbe more properly classified under the head of casual work, but at thispoint  attention may be drawn to  the position of week-end workersin the  printing trades.   The Ministry of Labour has  furnishedinformation  which  shows   that,  of  350  printers&apos;   assistantsregistered at the City Employment Exchange in London, 50 percent,  are working only on days at the week-end.   Of 50 printers&apos;warehousemen,  one-third are week-end workers.   Of  40 porters,one-half are week-end workers; and 12 or 14 motor-drivers in the printing trade work at week-ends only.  Wages are paid  at the rateof time and a half  for Saturday work and double pay  for  Sundaywork.  The week-end earnings of each of the types of workers men-tioned above ranges from  2 to  3.  A number of week-end workersin the trade work only up to midnight on Saturday and thus would receive 25/- to 30/- only.  The first statutory  condition  (which requires the payment of 30 contributions in the past two years) isalmost  invariably  satisfied.   These men,  like  other  short-timeworkers, pay a  full week&apos;s  contribution even if they  are employed for less  than  one day.  Most of them draw  benefit  for five andoccasionally for six days a week.  Here, perhaps, the most seriousaspect is the misuse of public money, but there can be no doubt thatthe existence of unemployment benefit assists in securing for  the printing and publishing trade a reserve of workers  who are availablefor its fluctuating demand and upon whom thore is no great pressure to find more regular employment.   From the  point of view of thenational  dividend  it  is  important  that  such trades  should be encouraged to devise  methods of  spreading their  work  more  regu-
larly through the week, or, if they are unable to do so, should payadequately for the labour reserve that they demand.(d)  Casual  Work.   18.  Casual  work  is  also   encouraged  by   Unemployment.Insurance  from  the  point  of  view  both  of  the  employer and  of  the  worker.   For  tho  latter,  the  disadvantages  ofan occupation winch he knows may bring him no more  than two orthree days&apos; work a week on the  average are greatly diminished byhis  knowledge that he can secure  unemployment benefit for theremainder of the week.  The employer,  assured of an ample reserve of labour, has less  compunction in turning olf men whom he  might continue to employ,  or might employ  more regularly, than  if he felt himself  alone  responsible for securing to  them an  adequateincome, and there is  far less pressure upon  him  to arrange with his fellow employers an organised scheme of labour engagement.  Theseremarks  apply to  the  casual standing-off of men by employers in almost  every trade in  the country,  especially those situated in areas where unemployment  is  heavy, as  well as  to   those industries where casual employment: has always  been a  regular and important feature.  It is in  the latter, however, that the  relationship of Unemployment Insurance to casual labour wears its most seriousaspect.  The system  of employment  in the docks is at  present, thesubject  of  inquiry by  a  Committee under the  Chairmanship ofSir Donald Maclean,  and we do not wish to go into it here in detail.but we must emphasise the  abuse which results from the applicationof Unemployment  Insurance  to a system  which retains in  someports a labour force twice  as great as the employment  offered.   19.  The Eeport of Inquiry into Casual Labour in the MerseysideArea,  published about a  month ago, contains  the results  of a sample  test of one in twenty-five taken  in the  quarter ended the.28th  March, 1930.  This  showed  that unemployment benefit of varying amounts was paid  during the quarter to  217 out of 384 men whose average weekly wage wras nearly  2.  The following extractfrom the Eeport illustrates the results of the present system :       &quot; The effect upon benefit  received of a break in  continuity   depends,  of course,  on the rate of benefit.   A man  with  a wife   and three dependent children is entitled to 32/- a week benefit   (17/- ordinary benefit in respect of himself, 9/- for his wife and   2/- for each of his three children).   If he  works  on Monday.   Tuesday  and  Wednesday, is  unemployed  on  Thursday and   Friday, but works  on  Saturday, he would  lose 10/8d.  (?.c.,   two days at o/id.  per day), if he were again in work  on Monday,   Tuesday and Wednesday in the following week.  His wage for   Saturday would probably be 6/- (the normal rate for  half a day),   so that if he were unemployed on Saturday instead of working   he would get 16/-  in  benefit as against  6/-  in wages and no   benefit.  As he  may have no certain knowledge as to his position   on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, he has a strong incentive   not to get work on  the Saturday.       &quot; It will also be noted that in the example cited, the difference   between the wage for  Saturday and a day&apos;s benefit is  only 8f/.&quot;   20.   According to the Eeport, approximately 75 per  cent,  of thetally-holders lodge  claims in the course of a year, but the majorityof men whose  average weekly earnings exceed  3 do  not  claimbenefit.  Nevertheless,  some men receiving relatively  high  wages for a short period of work, e.g., by overtime, night work  or week-endshifts, do claim benefit for other days  within the  same week.  in contrast with this, owing  to the effect of  the  continuity rules, aman  obtaining half-day  jobs on four separate days  each   week,and  earning 24/-, would  not be entitled to  receive benefit.(e)  Seasonal Work.   21.   The problems  presented by the application of Unemploy-ment Insurance to  seasonal  work  are  in  some respects similar.
In  so far  as  Unemployment  Insurance diminishes  the  desireand   the  efforts of  the  workman  employed  for  part  of  theyear  in a  seasonal  trade  to  find  work in some other trade forthe rest of  the year, and in so far as  it diminishes  the need felt by employers to even out then- work as far as possible over the whole year, it injures the national dividend in  very much the same  way asthrough short time  and casual working.   There  can be  little doubtthat to a certain extent Unemployment  Insurance has hindered thedovetailing of seasonal jobs.  We are not inclined, however, to regard this  as of very large  scope.   In  this field,  the  most importantaspect is undoubtedly the  excessive cost  to the Exchequer.   22.  The Ministry of Labour has supplied figures to illustrate the effect of the Unemployment Insur ance Act of 1930 upon thenumbers in l-eceipt of benefit in the Island of  Lewis.  In the mainthe men belong to an agricultural and fishing community and thereis little industrial work for them on  the island.   The women, ingeneral, follow no industrial occupation other  than  that of seasonalfish workers.  Some, but not  all, &quot; follow the fish &quot; to East coast ports, and at  present the season for this is on.  At the 8th July,1929, 220 men and  12 women were in receipt of benefit.  By the7th July-, 1930, these numbers had risen to 489 men and 61 women,and by the 13th October, 1930, to 700 men and 192 women.  Thus,in the course  of  15 months, the  number of  men  in receipt ofbenefit had more than trebled,  while the number of women in receiptof benefit had risen sixteenfold.  A further increase in  the numberof women in receipt of benefit may be expected when  the presentEast  Coast season ends.   The umpire has held in the case of a woman fish kipperer residing in Stornaway that as she  was  willingto take such work  as was available  locally  between  the  fishingseasons,  she was entitled  to  benefit  under the  Acts between theseasons if she did not obtain employment, since she was available for what local work (other  than kippering)  there was.   It was agreedthat there was little work of any kind available in Stornaway betweenthe seasons.  The intervals  amount  to about six months.   23.  The above paragraph is intended only as an example of thekind  of abuse that we have in mind.  It is necessary  to distinguish between purely seasonal industries like fishing, and those industries where the, volume of employmient, though it varies according to the season of the year,  is  always considerable.   Building  is a  typicalexample  of the  latter class of industries.  From its  inception theunemployment insurance scheme  was  quite  properly  intended todeal with seasonal variations of employment in building and similartrades; it was not intended to support in the off-season workers whowould not  normally  seek employment during the greater portion ofthe year.(f) General.    24.   Under  the  heads  of married women, short time workers,casual workers and seasonal  workers, we have outlined what  seemto us to be the chief abuses of  the present Unemployment InsuranceScheme.  It must not be supposed  that they are by any means theonly  abuses or that  we have not considered any others.  We havebeen impressed by  the hindrance which is provided in  the present Unemployment  Insurance  system  to rapid transfer from industryto industry or from place to place.   While  we are  in agreement that  those  who are entitled  to  benefit  under a self-supportinginsurance  scheme should  not  be  forced,  on  pain  of forfeiture ofbenefit,  to  accept  employment outside their own trade or  at a distance or at  a rate  of wages substantially lower  than that towhich they have been  accustomed, we are convinced that there isroom for a relaxation of these limitations  upon the work which maybe offered to recipients  of transitional benefit.  The world is passing through a period of  rapid  technical change as well as  a period of falling prices.  Any artificial rigidity  which is inserted into theindustrial  system acts  as a  serious handicap  to  the  country inwhich it  exists.  Unemployment  Insurance  in its  present  formconstitutes  such an artificial rigidity.
   25.  We are now able to sum up the conclusions of this sectionof our  report.  We  have divided  the effects of abuses  of  theUnemployment Insurance system into two classes    (a) An excessive and unjustifiable burden upon the Exchequer.   (b) The  encouragement of  methods of  industrial organisation         which prevent the  most economical use of our resources          both in  capital equipment and in labour power.   We wish to call attention  to the danger that the second class ofeffect may be obscured by the  urgency of the  first.  In all of thefour chief classes  of abuse which we have  examined in detail,  we find  that  waste of public money accompanies  waste of economicpower.  While payment of benefit to married women not genuinelyseeking work (in the equitable,  not the legal sense) does not provideany  direct  handicap to industry, it is expensive from the point ofview  of the Exchequer.   Organised  short time  is highly  expensivefrom the point  of  view  of national  productivity,  as well as being very  costly  to the national purse.  Casual work seems  to us to be encouraged  and the dovetailing of seasonal work discouraged by thepresent Unemployment Insurance Scheme.  So long as  industries are encouraged to retain a labour  force much in excess of their needs,  unemployment  on  a   considerable   scale  must  be   aphenomenon of good  times as  well as of bad.   In these  and otherways the present system of Unemployment Insurance introduces an element of rigidity into the  economic structure of the country.That rigidity  is one of the most serious penalties of the  social andeconomic advantages  which our workpeople have  enjoyed underthe system  of Unemployment Insurance.        III. THE  OUTLINE  OF A  NEW SCHEME.   26.  In  the  light of the  deep-rooted  defects which we  have described, there is evidently a very  strong  case for the completerecasting of the  unemployment insurance scheme.  The conditionswith which it has  to deal are radically  different from those in contemplation when it  was originally drawn up; and subsequentattempts at  merely  piecemeal modification  have reduced it to amass of unrelated and indefensible expedients.  Early in the courseof our work, we reached  the  conclusion  that the difficulties andabuses to which the scheme in its present working gives rise call for a fundamental revision of the administrative and financial basis on which the scheme rests.    27.  We do not propose,  in this  report,  to  attempt to putforward a new scheme in detail.   That could be done  to advantageonly after hearing evidence from the various interested parties andwith more  time  than has been at our disposal.  We think, however,that it may be  useful to suggest the broad principles on which  asatisfactory scheme  might be based, in order  that these proposals may  be subjected  to critical  examination  on  points  of  principlebefore the  attempt is made to work out their detailed application.We have accordingly left many of the secondary difficulties arisingout of the  present scheme aside, and concentrated  our attention onfundamental points  of structure  and administration.    28.   In  the first place,  it  seems to us essential  to  make an-absolute separation of the  finance of that part  of the scheme  whichcan properly be treated as insurance from  that which  cannot.  Itwill be seen that this involves, to a substantial extent, administrative separation  as well;  but this cannot and should not he so complete as the financial separation.    29.  Secondly,  the  entire  administrative  structure of  the scheme, in both its  insurance and its non-insurance aspects, should be recast,  so as to  provide for the making of regulations for its working by a Statutory Commission, subject to the consent  of the Minister of Labour and the approval of Parliament.     80.  Thirdly, the  scheme  should  be made less rigid  in its working,  so as  to allow special regulations  to  be  framed for particular  types or  classes of workers.      [21969]                               -               r
    31.   Fourthly., radically different conditions should apply  tothe receipt of benefit under the insurance and non-insurance sectionsof the scheme.    32.   Fifthly., the scope  of the scheme should be. extended,  soas to bring within its range certain classes at present exempted  orexcepted from its operation.    33.   Sixthly, the financial  conditions  should  be  revised,  so  asto provide both  for greater  elasticity  in the matter of contributions and benefits, and for a different method  of granting State aid.    We  now proceed to elaborate our  proposals under  these  sixheads.        A Insurable  and  Non-Insurable  Unemployment.(a) Insurable  Unemployment.    34.   The liability of the insurance scheme proper, hereinafter referred  to as Part I, should be confined within such limits  as thescheme can afford, on the basis  of  contributions  by employers,workmen  and the  State.   Any failure  of  the scheme  to balanceshould be met bj revision of the scales of contributions or benefits,or both,  and not by borrowing, save to meet a purely temporaryemergency.    35.   Having discussed at length the question whether the state should continue to contribute to the insurance part of the scheme,we are agreed that on many grounds the State contribution is  tobe regretted, and that a self-supporting insurance  scheme shouldbe  the  ultimate aim.   We hold, however,  that at the presentmoment, when unemployment is abnormal and a scheme involvingState contributions is already in existence, it would be impracticable to withdraw the assistance of the State altogether.    36.  The  Act  should   lay  down,  as  at  present,  statutorydisqualifications  and conditions for the receipt  of benefit, and shouldprescribe the initial rates of contributions  and benefits, but shouldalso  give  power  to   vary  these  rates  by regulations  shouldcircumstances change.   37.  No person should receive  benefit under  Part 1 unless hehas  paid  a qualifying  number of contributions within  a  recentperiod.    Benefit  should  be paid  in proportion to contributionssubject to  a limit of a fixed number  of weeks in any consecutiveperiod of  52 weeks.   38.  In  considering claims  to benefit, account should be  taken of working periods outside the normal working week (e.g.., overtimeand  week-end work),  and benefits for partial unemployment shouldbe paid only where the claim still  lies, after  such working periodshave  been taken into account.   The guiding principle  should bethat benefit should in  no case be  payable to such an amount as would make the amount of earnings plus benefit equal to the normalearnings  of a full ordinary working week.   39.  Consideration should be given to the  question whether any industry  whose personnel is capable  of a clear demarcation  mightbe allowed to make a special scheme for its own body of workers.Such a scheme  would be  subject to approval  by the statutory commission proposed below, and by the  Minister of  Labour,  whoseconsent would only be given if such a scheme     (i) embodied the general  statutory  conditions for  the  receipt          of benefit,  and any other conditions that  the Statutory          Commission,  with the consent  of the Minister of Labour,          may prescribe:   (ii) provided  for the same minimum rates of contribution as are          or may be laid down for workers  not included in a special          scheme.   40.  In  the  case  of such special  schemes, the State should  if desired provide the necessary  administration, but should mal*i no
financial contribution to the cost of  the  benefits provided.   Anyspecial scheme should be authorised, as far as the standard rates of contribution allow,  to  pay supplementary benefits,  provided that payment of such benefits should be suspended if  the scheme couldnot provide them out of its  own resources.(b) Non-insurable unemployment.   41.  All workers who have exhausted  their claims to benefit.under Part I, but continue in other respects to satisfy the conditions under Part I, except the condition of having paid a fixed number ofcontributions  during a  definite  period, should  come  within  the purview of Part II of the scheme, and, subject to  the provisions ofparagraph  45 below, remain so as long as they continue to satisfythese conditions.   42.  Part II should be entirely separate financially from Part I,should be non-contributory, and  should be  paid for entirely out ofthe Exchequer.   43.  The maximum  amounts payable  in donation  to  any indi-vidual under Part II should  not exceed the weekly rates  of benefitpayable under Part I, but should be subject to reduction where  theclaimant is unable to establish his claim to the full amount of benefiton a basis of need.   44.  Regulations  for  the payment of  donation under Part  ii should be made by the Statutory Commission proposed below, subjectto the approval of  the Minister of  Labour and to the consent ofParliament.  These  regulations should, when  desirable,  lay  downspecial conditions for the  payment  of benefit to particular classes:of workers  and  prescribe  special  conditions  or  disqualificationsapart from those applicable to  insurable unemployment.   45.  Part II  should  apply  only  to workers  who  have been atsome  time  in receipt  of benefit under Part I.   There should be nofixed limit to the number of weeks  for which donation  under Part IIcan be drawn;  but any contributor  who is  unable  to show a fixedminimum  number  of  days of insurable  employment  within twoyears should cease to be regarded as an insured worker, and shouldnot be eligible for further donation under Part II until he has  againbecome qualified for  benefit as an insured contributor  under Part I.                 B. Administrative Machinery.   46.  We  consider  that  the present  system of  administeringunemployment insurance, while it has shown itself highly efficientfrom the administrative point of view, is nevertheless  unsatisfactoryon two grounds.  It is  unduly rigid; and it fails to  enlist the full co-operation of employers and workers in furthering its efficiency and  in  preventing abuses.    As long as  Parliament attempts  to prescribe, on a fixed and uniform  basis, the full conditions for thereceipt of benefit,  this rigidity is inevitable,  and those  who areresponsible for administering the Act can  do nothing  to  prevent it.Moreover, under present conditions, neither employers nor workers as a rule regard it as their affair to co-operate in working the schemeto the best advantage ; nor can they under  the present  system secure its adaptation  to  the  varying needs  of  different industries  andclasses of workers.  Many of the abuses which exist under the scheme as it stands could be remedied if the administration were made lessrigid, and employers and Trade  Unions  invited  to  co-operate  inadapting its machinery to special cases and conditions.   47.  We therefore suggest that the general responsibility forthe  administration of the Act, within the conditions  laid down byParliament, should be entrusted to a small  Statutory commission appointed by  the  Government.  This Commission,  which shouldhave a full-time chairman, should consist in part of leading repre-sentatives of industry, appointed by the Government,  together with persons chosen on account of their expert knowledge  of  economics,insurance  or industrial  administration.    [21969J                                               D
1-2    48.   To this Statutory Commission  should  bo  entrusted  the care of both parts of the scheme, and the task of making regulations and orders providing  for its   actual administration.   All  such regulations or orders should,  however, require the sanction of the.Minister of Labour, who  would have power to refer back  anydraft of which he did not approve.  Further, all regulations should require to be laid on the table of the  House of Commons, and should become operative only if no resolution  hostile to them were carried by  the House.    49.   We  believe that   a  Statutory Commission  of this  sort.including  representatives   of   industry,  could   be   effective  inregulating a great many matters connected with  the administrationof the  scheme outside the range of day-to-day political controversy.This in itself would  be  a very great  advantage; and we  believe  thatin  addition it  would  go  far to ensure the  real co-operation ofindustry  as a whole in working the scheme, to  make  possible itsadaptation to differing needs  and  conditions,  and  by  giving  itflexibility to diminish the need  for frequent  recourse to parliament for changes in the  Act.              C. Provisions  for  Greater Elasticity.   50.   We  have  suggested  above  that the  proposed statutory commission  should be  authorised to  make regulations  for  theworking  of both parts of the scheme, subject  to the approval of theMinister of Labour and the consent of Parliament.  The consent ofParliament and the  approval of the Minister  are necessary becauseboth parts of the scheme will be concerned with the expenditureof public money; but, subject  to this  consent and  approval, webelieve  that  the  Statutory  Commission  should have  a far  greater freedom  than is now possessed by the Department to make regula-tions  governing the actual working of  both  parts  of  the  scheme.We see in this freedom at once the most effective safeguard againstabuses and  the surest means of  enlisting the  real co-operation ofindustry in  making  the  scheme a success.   51.   We  accordingly  regard  it as vital  that  the provisions ofthe Act governing the scheme should be  confined strictly to mattersof principle,  so as to leave the Statutory Commission with a widediscretion in  making regulations and orders within the scope ofthe Act.  In especial, we  believe that  this  method will be foundmost  effective  in  dealing  with  such abuses  as may  arise in theworking  of  the scheme as it applies   to particular  industries orclasses of insured workers.   52.   The Statutory Commission would have the duty of  makingregulations governing  both the provision of  benefits under Part Iand the  granting  of donation under Part II of the scheme.  Anyspecial schemes under Part I would require its approval, and underboth Part I and Part II it would have the duty of drawing  up rules governing the payment of  donation to particular classes of workers,such as married women, casual workers, workers on short  time, orworkers  in any occupational group to which special conditions may apply.  We  hold that the present conditions for receipt of benefit by certain of those classes may need drastic revision ; but we believe,this  could be  better secured  through  the  action  of  a statutory commission  than directly by  legislation or by  the  arbitrary fiat ofthe Ministry of Labour.                  D.-Adjudication on Claims.   53.  As the essence  of our  proposal is that  there should be a sharp separation between  the two  parts  of  the scheme,  dealingrespectively with insurable and non-insurdde employment, it isclearly necessary to provide separate machinery for adjudication onclaims to benefit under the two parts.  For the considerations whichwill apply  will be radically different in the two cases.  In the case
L3of claimants under Part I, the sole question will be whether theclaimant can  establish  his  title to benefit under the Act and. theregulations.  This is, indeed, the essence of any scheme based on theprinciple of insurance.  But in the case of claims under Part  II itwill be necessary for the claimant not only to establish his eligibility for donation  under  the  conditions  of  the scheme, but  also to demonstrate his need  of assistance from the  State.   These  twofunctions,  that  of determining eligibility for benefit or donation,and  that  of assessing  need for donation alone, which claims to benefit  have been exhausted, call for different  methods and for adifferent attitude of  mind  on the part of  the adjudicating body.It is, therefore, necessary  to provide  special machinery for  eachtype of case.   54.   We therefore suggest that,  in respect of the conditions laiddown in the Act and in  any regulations made under it for the receiptof benefit irrespective of need, all claimants either for benefit underPart I or for  donation  under Part II should have their cases  dealtwith  by  the  Insurance  Officers  and  the  Courts  of Beferees,constituted as at present.   But, whereas claims to benefit underPart I will  be definitely determined by the decision of the Court ofBeferees, claimants under Part II will  require to prove their  caseon the  score of  need  also.  For this purpose, we suggest that theyshould  appear before a both Committee, constituted on the same lines as the Court of Beferees, but consisting in each area of separatepersons, and working under a different set of regulations drafted bythe Statutory Commission.   Thus, whereas any question arising ona claim under Part I would be settled by the Court of  Beferees, aclaimant under  Part  II, once his eligibility  was  established, would go before the both Committee, which would be concerned solely withassessing the amount of his need, with attaching conditions,  such asattendance at a  Training  Centre,  to  the grant  of donation,  andwith determining cases arising  out of  the  alleged  refusal  by  theapplicant of  any offer of suitable  employment.   We   contemplate that,  whereas  a claimant to  benefit under  Part I would  not normally be  disqualified  for  refusal to  accept employment  outsidehis previous trade, the both Committee would have a wider discretion in determining  what sort of employment the claimant to donationunder Part II ought  to accept, or forfeit his right to donation.    55.  If the  scheme which we have proposed  were  brought into-operation,  the   Umpire  would  retain   his  present functions in deciding  upon  claims  arising  under either Part  of  the  scheme. But we do not suggest that there should be  any appeal to the Umpire in respect of the adequacy of  the donation granted to any individual under Part II.  On all such matters,  the decision of the local both Committee, acting under regulations and orders issued by the. Statutory Commission, should be final.    56.  It should, however, be noted  that, under the scheme here proposed, the Umpire&apos;s position would be changed, in that he  would become an interpreter at least  as  much of regulations and orders issued by  the Statutory Commission, under authority of the statute, as of the statute itself.  It would not be the Umpire&apos;s business to question these regulations, as long as they conformed to the powers conferred by the law upon the  Statutory Commission, but only to interpret  them.   If in  any case  the  Umpire  held   a  particular regulation or order issued by the Statutory Commission to  be ultra  vires,  the question should be settled by the High  Court.                   E.-Scope of the Scheme.   57.  Under  the  present  unemployment  insurance  scheme,certain classes of workers are excepted, and certain others exempted from contribution.  The most important of the excepted classes ar^private domestic servants,  agricultural workers, Civil Servants andcertain classes of railway workers and of municipal employees. W ohave not  been able to go into the  question of the scope  of  the    [21969]                                            D  2
scheme  at  any  length,  and  wo  do  not  offer  any  definiterecommendations with  regard  to  if.  but when the details of our plan are  worked out consideration should be given  to the followingdesiderata.   58.  The inclusion of club,  hotel and  restaurant workers  in thepresent, scheme  makes  the line of demarcation between uninsuredand insured domestic service as now drawn  somewhat unreal, whilethe exclusion  of private  domestic servants  from  insurance putsobstacles in the way of  the acceptance of work  of  this sort  by workers  who may. by  accepting  it,  forfeit their claim to-- benefitthrough failure to maintain their contributions.   59.   In  the  case  of  agricultural workers,  there  are  serious difficulties in the way of their inclusion within any  general scheme.Serious consideration might, however, be given to the possibility of devising  a special scheme to meet their needs, based on lower ratesof contributions and benefits, and  on  special provisions to deal withthe problem of seasonal employment.  The devising of such a scheme might w7ell be referred to the Statutory Commission proposed  above.and power taken in the Act to apply such a  scheme by regulation, ifthe difficulties in the  way  could be surmounted.   60.   We can see no case for the continued exception of the  special classes of railway and municipal employees  who have been exceptedunder  the present scheme.  In other industries and services, manyworkers  who have personally little or no liability to unemploymentare compelled  to contribute.  At present,  benefits are drawn  byrailway7 and municipal  workers who are  not excepted,  but, the main body of such workers makes no contribution on their  behalf. If ifis made  possible for an industry to frame for itself a special scheme under Part I,  the case for the continued  exception of the  classesnow excepted from contribution is still further weakened.    61.  We have  not given  any protracted consideration  to  thequestion  whether  the  present  income   limit  for  compulsorycontribution to  the scheme should be revised. There appears to usto be a case for fixing the limit at a higher level  than at present:but  we  are  not  in  a  position  to  put  forward  any   definiterecommendation on this point.               F.-Financial  Basis of the Scheme.   62.  It will be seen  that we propose  that the cost of Part 1  ofthe scheme should  be divided between  employer, workman and state,  and that the  Exchequer  should bear  the  whole  cost  ofPart II, which cannot reasonably  be placed on  an insurance basis.The method of financing  non-insurable  unemployment by  meansof overdrafts on the Treasury by the Insurance Fund,  as practisedup to last year, is in our view radically wrong.  The whole provisionfor non-insurable unemployment should  be a direct charge on theExchequer.    63.   In respect  of insurable unemployment,  we hold that themethod by which the  State  makes  a contribution is  unavoidableunder  present  conditions;  but  we  are not  satisfied  that this contribution need be continued indefinitely or that it has been madein the past on the most satisfactory basis.  The  system  under  whichthe  State contribution  is based  on  the amounts  contributed  by employers and workers actually  results in  the reduction  of theState&apos;s  contribution  when   the  need   for   it   is  greatest.    Werecommend that the State should contribute  so much per week foreach  insured  worker, irrespective of the number of contributions paid by  the workers and employers.                      G. Other Proposals.   64.  The above six groups of proposals cover the main groin:work  of an alternative scheme  to that now in force.  We deanapart from these,  to  put  forward certain  additional suggestioiWe hold that, where in special cases such  as the  docks, thewfvidence that a  faulty system  of  engaging labour is causing
unnecessary drain on the Unemployment Funds, or resulting in anunnecessarily  high  turnover of labour  or prevalence  of  casualemployment, it should be open  to the Statutory Commission, withthe  approval  of  the  Minister  of  Labour  and  the  consent  ofParliament, to schedule any  such  industry  and to issue a  specialorder relating to the engagement of labour in it.    65.   We hold that the present system of granting benefits for short time or casual employment  is being exploited, and sets upundesirable limitations on the mobility of labour.  This applies evenmore to workers who would  be  entitled to  benefit under Part I ofthe proposed scheme than to workers who have passed beyond the range of legitimate insurance;  for the part-time worker  often getshis card stamped every week, though he may be regularly in receipt-of benefit  on account of partial unemployment.   Accordingly, wehold  that the  conditions relating to the receipt of benefit for short time  should be revised.   We doubt, however,  if this can be doneeffectively  on a uniform basis for all industries;  and,  accordingly,we recommend that the granting of short-time benefit or donationshould  be a matter to be dealt with by the Statutory Commission bymeans  of orders and  regulations applying to  particular classes ofworkers.  These conditions might be different for Parts I and II ofthe  scheme:   but it  would  be,  in  our view,  essential to make regulations dealing with claims  under Part  I as well  as underPart  II.                          H. General.   66.  We have based the above scheme on two assumptions.  Thefirst  is that it is indispensable to make a sharp separation betweenthe provision for insurable and non-insurable  forms of unemploy-ment.   The second is  that it is out of the question to hand over tothe Poor  Law,  even in its recently  reconstituted form, the main body of those workers who would be excluded from benefit  by theapplication of a  strict insurance test.   To do this would, apart fromthe extreme unpopularity of such a course, either impose an impossiblestrain  on  local finances in the depressed  areas, or upset the entirefinancial basis of the recent Local Government Act. It has thereforeseemed to us indispensable to provide,  in Part II of the scheme,  a form of donation financed wholly from National funds.   67.  There will, however, remain, under the  scheme which wehave proposed,  a  residue  of claimants ineligible  for either  benefit under  Part I or  donation under Part II of the scheme.   These will include both workers in occupations which  continue to be exceptedfrom the scope of insurance, and workers who fail to satisfy the eon-ditions under either part of the scheme.  For such classes the PoorLaw must remain as the only  form of provision.   68. We have not considered that it falls  within  our  terms ofreference  to discuss either the methods that might  be pursued by theState in providing work for certain sections of the unemployed, orthe question of training centres.  We recognise the difficulties in theway of providing work or training on  a large scale, but we hold thatthe methods of  overcoming them should be submitted  to full andsympathetic examination.   69.  We  desire   to   place  on  record  our  view  that  theexisting training  centres of  the  Ministry of Labour,  within  theirnarrow scope, are doing excellent work, and that every effort shouldbe made to extend their sphere of operation within both Part I and part II of our scheme.  In the case of donation under  Part II of thescheme, we are  strongly of the  opinion  that, to the fullest possible extent, the grant of assistance should be accompanied either by work or by  training.   We have three reasons for urging this provision :first, the need for testing the claimants desire for work; second, theimportance of securing some return for the money paid out in dona-tion;  and,  third,  the desirability of  preventing the  progressive^moralisation of the unemployed worker.
   70.  The principles which have  guided us in formulating thescheme outlined in the foregoing paragraphs are as follow.  the welfare of  the  nation depends,  primarily,  upon  its  individual members.  Action which  tends to diminish the necessity for each individual  to exert himself in useful work,  is detrimental to theinterests of the State.  The employment of public and other funds to maintain unemployed workers in idleness entails an immediate and  double loss  to  the State.   The burden of  maintaining theindividual  is added to  the national expense; and his withdrawal from  productivity decreases  the  national  income.   71.   Unemployment insurance was intended for the purpose ofmitigating   the   effects  of   individual   unemployment   by  theexpenditure of funds accrued  during a period of employment.  Thatpurpose is  sound  and entirely justifiable.  On the other hand, it isindefensible to allow the unemployment insurance scheme to become a means of subsidising unemployment,  by confusing the paymentof insurance benefit  to those who are properly insured with thegrant of special assistance to those who are not, and, at the  sametime, by giving the individual no incentive or opportunity to work.   72.   With those  principles  in mind  we  have  adumbrated  ascheme which, we believe,  would tend to produce  the  followingresults :    (a) Elimination of wasteful expenditure entailed by the  present          scheme.   (b) The encouragement of both employers and workers  to take          a personal  interest in  the operation of the scheme and          in its efficiency  as a measure of insurance.   (c) The establishment  of  a financially sound insurance scheme;          supplemented by a secondary scheme, comparable to the          present system of  transitional  benefit,  but differing          radically in  that  it would  (i)  impose  conditions  more          onerous than those pertaining to  the  insurance  scheme          proper, and  (ii) relate  amounts of benefit to individual          need.   In general, the scheme we propose should, we think, raise relief of the unemployed from its present chaotic condition and establishit upon a firm  basis designed  to  cope  not  only with  normalunemployment, but also with a period of severe depression  such asthat through which we are now  passing.                       IY. SUMMARY.   73.  We have  included  as abuses  those  practices under  theunemployment insurance scheme which, while strictly legal,  cannot have  been in  accordance with  the  intention of Parliament, andconstitute an unnecessary charge upon the resources of a contributoryinsurance fund or, in the case of  transitional  benefit,  upon  theExchequer.  Many of the abuses are  due  to exploitation  of  therules for the payment of benefit under the ordinary insurance scheme.(Paragraphs 7-10.)   7$.  The effects of the abuses which have grown up in the  systemof Unemployment Insurance  may be  divided under two  heads,namely:    (a)  Excessive and  unjustifiable expenditure from  public  funds.   (b)  Increase of economic friction  and  the  encouragement  of          methods of  industrial  organisation which  are harmful to          trade and employment in general.   The waste of public  money  should not  be allowed to obscurethe  consequences of  the present  scheme in  creating  artificialrigidities  or encouraging  uneconomic methods of  organisation.(Paragraphs 11-12.)
                               17   73.  Money, which could be saved without hardship to anyone, isnow  being  spent upon married  women  who have  no  equitableclaim to benefit.   (Paragraphs 13-15.)   76.  Among the abuses whose direct effect is to diminish the productivity of the country as well as to lay an excessive burden onthe Exchequer, the largest and  most important appears  to us to bethat of short  time working.  As between one method of industrial organisation and another, unemployment insurance should at least be impartial,  whereas in the matter of short time it has  definitelytaken  sides and, in  fact,  encouraged  the  less  efficient method.(Paragraphs 16-17.)   77.  Casual working is encouraged by Unemployment Insurancefrom the point of view both of the  employer and of the worker.  this applies to the  casual standing-off  of men in  almost  every trade  inthe country as well as to those industries where casual employment has always been a regular and important feature. (Paragraphs 18-20.)   78.  There can be little doubt that to a certain extent Unemploy-ment Insurance has hindered  the  dovetailing of seasonal jobs.  Weare not inclined,  however, to regard this as of very large scope.  Inthis field, the  most important aspect is undoubtedly the  excessivecost to the Exchequer.  (Paragraphs 21-23.)   79.  Any artificial rigidity which is inserted into the industrialsystem acts as a serious handicap  to the country in which it exists.Unemployment Insurance  in  its present form constitutes such an artificial rigidity.  (Paragraph 24.)   80.  In the light of these deep-rooted defects, there is evidentlya strong case  for  the complete  re-casting of the unemploymentinsurance scheme.  We have suggested the broad principles on whicha satisfactory scheme might be based.  (Paragraphs 26-27.)   81.  The broad principles which we have incorporated in our planare these (Paragraphs 28-33) :     (i) Absolute separation of the finance of that part of the scheme          which can  be  properly treated  as insurance  from that          which cannot.    (ii) Appointment of a Statutory Commission with wide latitude          to make regulations for the working of the scheme.    (iii) Extension of the scope of  the scheme.    (iv)  Less  rigidity of working so as to allow special regulations to          be  framed for particular types or classes of workers.    (v)  Application of radically different conditions for the receipt          of benefit under the insurance and non-insurance sections.    (vi)  Revision of the financial conditions so as to provide both for          greater  elasticity  in the matter  of  contributions  and          benefits, and for a different method of granting State aid.   82.  The   revised  scheme   which  we  have  proposed  (Para-graphs 34-69)  involves four other changes of major importance  inthe conditions on which benefit is granted:     (a)  A ratio of days of benefit to contributions should be restored         in the insurance part of the scheme.   (b)  After the expiry of insurance rights,  benefit under Part  II         should  be subject to the  applicants ability to establish  his         claim to the full amount of benefit on a basis of need,
(c)  The granting of short-time benefit or donation, and other      matters out of which abuses are liable to arise, should be      dealt  with by  the  Statutory  Commission  by  means of      orders  and regulations applying to particular classes of      workers.(d)  To  the  fullest  possible  extent, the grant of non-insurance      donation should be accompanied either by  work  or by      training.(Signed)G.
