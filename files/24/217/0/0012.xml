Note &quot;by the Minister of Labour.        -  M* &quot;i &quot; *.....-i-n- -mill ii Hi i i i - -- - . --w p--     I have carefully examined the note on this subjectcirculated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     There is no doubt that the building of warships end the manufacture of munitions for foreign powers provide cconsiderable amount of employment so long as the orderslast.     Regarded purely from the point of view of employment,a proposal for extending the application cf the export credits Scheme to the export of munitions might be welcome.In view, however, of the Government1s disarmament policy,I think it is clearly impossible to press such a proposal,even though other countries may- be grenting financialassistance for a similar purpose.SECRET.CAB I F E T.CF.412(30) .COPY NO(Intd.)   1....
