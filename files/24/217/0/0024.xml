Memorandum &quot;by the-First  Lord of the Admiralty.               On Monday * the 8th December, accompanied by the Minister       of Labour, I received a doxnatation from the Shipbuilding       Employers&apos; Federation.  The deputation had wi3hed to wait       on the Prime Minister and the representations they made       were addressed to the Government rather than to me as       First Lord of the Admiralty.  Their point of view,  which       was put forward by Mr. A. L. Ayro,  (&quot;President of the       Federation)  speaking not only on behalf of the warship       producers but of the whole, shipbuilding industry, was as       follows.               The unemployment situation in the industry was so       serious, and would become so much worse in 1931, that thoy       felt justified in asking for acceleration of Government       warship work, having regard to the amount of work available       which might be inferred from the Statement Explanatory of       the Naval Construction Programme 19.30 issued in July last       (Command 3620).               At the present time, due to the world slump, there       was almost a complete absence of orders for ships and 1931       was likely to be one of the blackest years ever  known in       the history of the  industry.  It v?as reckoned that the per-       contage of men unemployed in the industry would have risen       from ZZ% a year ago to 50J8 early in the coming year.  The       one thing that could help the industry, the whole future                                                              of /S C R E T.P.424(30).
                        - 2 -future of which seemed, in jeopardy, was the acceleration ofGovernment warship building.  Hot only should the orders forthe 1930 Programme be placed as soon as possible, but byanticipating other construction such work as possible shouldbe given in 19310  Mr. Ayre suggested that the Governmentshould place orders for 5 cruisers, 4 submarines and morethan the usual flotilla of destroyers in 19310  This yearrepresented a trough in the trade cycle which should belevelled as far as possible in this way to save the industry from disastero   He drew attention to the fact that italy was now doing more warship work than the United Kingdom due,he thought, to the special arrangement s made in regard to finance by the Italian Government,,  He suggested that theindustry in this country deserved Government support,,  Theyhad done probably more than any other industry to meet theirpost-war difficulties by organisation, management, equipment and progress in conciliatory machinery,  Ke mentioned alsothe new National Shipbuilding Security, Ltd,s formed withthe object of removing redundant capacity,,  In these waysthe shipbuilders had been able to hold the home market prettywell as long as there were any orders going0        On the financial side mm Ayre urged that money wouldhave to be found by the nation sooner or later for the war-ship building in question and that prices could not beexpected to be lower than they were to-day; in fact somefirms wore even taking Government work at a loss. On the other side of the picture was the saving on the UnemploymentInsurance Fund.  Calculations would show that since 80$ ofthe total cost of a warship went in wages,&apos;something likehalf that amount, i.e.s 40$ of.the total cost of the naval programme would form a saving to the Unemployment InsuranceFun d0                                                      In /
        In reply I explained that very little acceleration of the date of placing the orders for the 1930 programme wasin any case possible now and as regards the proposals for1931 I drew attention to the difficulties;, &quot;both politicaland financial, and to the International complicationsinvolvodo  I was accordingly unable to give any encouragement to the deputation to suppose that their suggestion would be acceptable to the Government but undertook to report theirviews0                                A.
