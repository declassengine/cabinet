TO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.3GThis DocumerrIt is requested that special care may be taken to     ensure the secrecy of this document.SECRETSI.C A B I N E  r.CP. 40? (30)ELECTORAL REFORM BILL.Memorandum by tire Home Secretary.      The Prime Minister has asked me to consider the preparationof an Electoral Reform Bill, and to submit a memorandum to theCabinet in regard to its provisions as soon as possible.to draft a Bill, it is necessary for me to obtain the decision ofmy c-olleagues as to the scope of the Bill.Alternative Vote.      I assume that one of the main objects of the Bill will be tomake some change in the system of Parliamentary Election.  Mycolleagues will remember that the first and most important matterdiscussed by the Conference on Electoral Reform, over.which LordUllswater presided, was the question raised by the Liberalrepresentatives .of adopting some system with a view to &quot;securing that the composition of the  House of Commons shall properly reflect the views expressed by the electorate&quot;.  As the published reportof the Conference  (Cmd. 3636)  shows, the  Conference was unable toreach any agreement on this question.  The Liberals suggested thatproportional representation should be adopted over as wide an areaao possible, and that the alternative vote should he adopted inthe remaining areas, which should  remain as single-member constituencies.  The Conservatives considered that if a change ofsome character HIUBU De mane, it should take the form of some measure of proportional representation.  The Labour representatives were unanimous against the adoption of proportional representation.      Seeing that there was no chance of the Conference acceptingproportional representation, the Liberal representatives explainedthat they  would be prepared to consider the adoption of theBefore I can give instructions to parliamentary Counsel
alternative vote generally as being preferable to the  presentsystem.  The Conservatives were unanimous against the  adoptionof the alternative vote in any circumstances.   The labour representatives explained that they were unwilling to  supportthe alternative vote in itself, but that some  of them  wereprepared to accept it on condition that other  reforms  were adopted at the same time.      From the attitude adopted by the representatives of thethree Parties at the Conference, it seems clear that if theBill is to deal at all with the system of electing Members  ofParliament, it must be on the lines of substituting thealternative vote for the existing system.  It  is to be anticipatedthat the Conservative Party will oppose this proposal  in theHouse, and they will no doubt base their opposition on theadmittedly unscientific basis of the alternative vote  system.They will also argue that the adoption of the  alternative voteis a device for aggregating the votes cast in favour of Liberaland Labour candidates against a Conservative candidate who  has  amajority over either of the other two Parties, but not overboth together.  On the other hand, the alternative vote was re-commended by the Royal Commission of 1910, and is actually  inoperation in Australia, though it must be pointed out  that  thecircumstances in which it was recommended by the Royal Commissionand the conditions under which it operates in Australia, are different from those which now obtain here.  At the time whenthe Royal Commission reported, they had in mind the situation arising from what is known as the- split vote,  and in australia to-day there are not three absolutely independent parties,  buttwo main parties and a third party which has split off fromone of the other parties, but still maintains a very close connection with it.
Reforms proposed by the Labour Party Representatives.      In addition to dealing with the system of parliamentary election, I assume that the Bill is to contain most, if not all,of the reforms proposed by the Labour representatives at theUllswater Conference.      Three of these reforms would, in all probability not meet with any opposition from either the  Liberal or the conservative party, namelyi-      (1) Speakers&apos; Ex^naea.      The proposal is that the law should be altered so as tomake the payment of  speakers  and their travelling expenses legal^ provided $hat they lare included In the Returns of candidates and their agents.      (2) Returning Offioers* Deposits.      The proposed alteration of the law would reduce the quota of electors from one-eighth to one-tenth below which theoandidatefs deposit with the Returning Offioer becomes forfeited.      (3) Double-member Constituencies,,      This would involve the abolition of double-member oon-stituencies, but It is doubtful whether this proposal could beapplied to, or would be popular with, the City of London.      The other reforms which would be  likely to meet with opposition from various quarters are as follows:      (4) Reduction of Election Expenses.      The proposal made is to reduce a candidate&apos;s  expensesat a Parliamentary Election from 6d. to 5d. per elector incounties, and from 5d. to 4d. in boroughs.      It is difficult to estimate what would be the- strengthof the opposition against this proposal, but it is  certainthat the Conservative Party would oppose it, though individual members might view it with favour.      It is of interest to note that, had the proposed scale
of expenditure been in force at the time of the last GeneralElection, 132 successful, and 302 unsuccessful candidateswould have exceeded the scale.  The new scale would have affected only 10 Labour candidates.     (5) Party Election^Exoenditure.     The proposed amendment of the law would require thepublication of accounts by political parties nationallyand locally, and would prohibit political parties from spend-ing money on elections unless such expenditure appears inthe Election Returns of candidates and their agents.     The existing law (Section 34 of the Representation ofthe People Act, 1910) already provides that expenditure incurred on account of holding public meetings, or issuingadvertisements, circulars or publications for the purpose of promoting or procuring the election of any candidate at a parliamentary election shall be Included as part of the candidate&apos;s election expenses.      The proposed amendment  of the law would involve  a statutory definition of a Political  Party.   It would  be necessary,  in addition,  to take steps to prevent  evasion of the  law by organisations which do not form part of any recognised political party but nevertheless incur expenditure in support  of a particular political  view.      (6) Motor Oars.     The proposed amendment of the law would make the use of motor cars  illegal for the purpose of bringing people to the poll, except under suitable Regulations laid down by the returning Officer in the  case  of persons  infirm,  sick and disabled.     The House of Commons will debate a motion  on this subject,whioh will  be moved by dr. Toole,  LLP.,  on  Wednesday, the 10th  instant, and before  coming to a decision whether aprovision on this subject  should be included in the Bill, it seems better to see how  the proposal  is received by Parliament.
     I shall be glad if the Cabinet will consider thevarious proposals for reform which I have outlined,  andwill decide whether all, and if not all, which of them should be embodied in the Bill.                                        J.  R.  C.4th December, 1930.      (7) Plural Voting.     This would involve the aboliti.on of all plural votingand the repeal of the Business Premises qualification andthe University qualification for the franchise.     This proposal was considered by Parliament when the representation of the People Act, 192P was under discussion,and the House of Commons then rejected it.  It is certainthat the proposal will be opposed by the Conservative party and probably by at least a section of the Liberal Party.     ( )  Half-yearly Registers.     The proposal is to amend the law so as to requireReturning Officers to compile two registers of electors eachyear, namely, in the Spring and in the Autumn.  The presentsystem of a single register was adopted in 1924 for purposesof economy, and to return to the previous system of a half-yearly register would, it is estimated, Involve an expenditure of approximately   500,000  a year.     (9)  Election Petitions.     The proposal is to alter the law so as to reduce costs and to simplify the procedure.     I am not aware that any specific suggestions have beenmade for altering the law in this direction, and before any proposals could be embodied in the Bill, I think it would benecessary for the whole question to be carefully examined by a Committee of legal exports.
