SWEEPSTAKES PROMOTED - IN THE JERJE SH _PR.EE -STATE.t             Memorandum by the Home Secretary.13(30)              A situation of considerable difficulty is developing in        connection with sweepstakes and I should like  to put the        matter to ray colleagues before committing myself to any        definite line of action.              It is commonly said that our law on the  subject of        lotteries (of which sweepstakes are merely one form) is chaotic,        That is not the case.  All public lotteries of whatever form,        wherever promoted and for whatever purpose, are illegal.  The        practioal difficulties that have arisen from time to time in        the administration of the law have been due to the necessity        for determining in a particular case whether for instance a        lottery is public or private - a private lottery being by        long established convention immune from PolJ.ce interference        in England - or again whether, as in many so called competitions;        a sufficient element of skill has been introduced to take the        proceedings outside the category of a lottery.  Those are pure        questions of fact such as must always give rise to difficulty        in borderline cases whatever form the law may  take.              The law, as I have said, is clear-   All  public lotteries        are unlawful and the sweepstakes with which I  am now concerned,        namely, those promoted from Dublin on racing events in this        country, are undisguised public lotteries.  The fact that they        are legal in the Irish Free State under a law  passed this year        does not make them the less unlawful here and  any person within        our jurisdiction who takes part in the promotion of ouch a        sweepstake, including persons engaged in the sale and        dj.industries.but.on of tickets, commits  an offence and renders        himself liable to substantial penalties.

SWEEP STAKES PROMOTED  IN THE JLKISH ,PREE -SjTATE .t             Memorandum by tho Home Secretary.13(50)                 &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;.              A situation of  considerable difficulty is developing in        connection with sweepstakes  and I should liko  to put the        matter to sny colleagues before committing myself to any        definite line of action.              It is commonly  said that our law on the  subject of        lotteries (of which sweepstakes  are merely one form) is chaotic^        That is not, the case.  All public lotteries of whatever form,        wherever promoted and for whatever purpose, are illegal.  The        practioal difficulties that  have arisen from time to time in        the administration of the law have been due to the necessity        for determining in a  particular  case whether for instance a        lottery is public or  private - a private lottery being by        long established convention  immune from Poli.ce interference        in England - or again whether, as in many so called competitions.        a sufficient element  of skill has been introduced to take the        proceedings outside the category of a lottery.  Those are pure        questions of fact such as must always give rise to difficulty        in borderline cases whatever form the law may  take.              The law,  as I have said, is clear-   All  public lotteries        are unlawful and the  sweepstakes with which I  am now concerned,        namely, those promoted from  Dublin on racing events in this        country, are undisguised public  lotteries.  The fact that they        are legal in the Irish Free  State under a law  passed this year        does not make them the less  unlawful here and  any person within        our jurisdiction who takes part  in the promotion of ouch a        sweepstake, including persons engaged in the sale and        distribution of tickets, commits  an offence and renders        himself liable  to substantial penalties.              The first of these sweepstakes was organised in connec-        tion with an event known as  the  Manchester November Handicap,,
                    - 3The particulars now available  shew  thai, of a total subscriptionof about  790,000 not less  than   600,000  came from outside theIrish F^ee  State and probably  at  least  550,000 from GreatBritain,,  Out  of the same total,   400,000 went back tosubscribers  in the form  of  prizes,   25f?,000 was swallowed upin expenses, including comtriission on distribution of books and sales of tickets, and  132,000 was  set apart for the benefit of free State  Charities.  The  second sweepstake - on the GrandNational - has just been launched and although this race is notrun until March tickets  are already on sale.  The promotersappear to anticipate an  even larger turnover than on the first occasion.   It  has been announced  that other sweepstakes will follow.      When  it  came to the notice  of the Home Office that thesale of tickets for the  sweepstake  promoted in connectj.on withthe November Handicap was being  organised in this countrycertain steps  were taken? but, as may be  gathered from thefigures quoted above, they were relatively ineffectual.  Infact the matter had already gone  too far.  The arrangementawere in the hands of a well-known Dublin bookmaker, who nodoubt was able to profit by a  somewhat extensi.ee experience in running  illegal sweepstakes on his own account and employedmethods involving a minimum of publicity, so that it was not until the concluding stages that  the magnitude of the enterprise,so far as this country at any  rate  was concerned, became apparentHad the sales  here been  sporadic  and of small dimensions, itwould unquestionably have been good policy to ignore the wholething.      The second sweepstake in the  series will shortly be infull swing  and if there  3.s no  interference a very large numberof individuals and organisations, including trade unions, willbe engaged during the next few weeks in pushing the sale oftickets in  order to earn the substantial commission offered
                    - 3 -by the promoters..  Clearly those responsible for the enforcement of the lav; cannot allow it to be systematicallybroken in this way and it will be my duty to co-ordinate theaction of the various authority.es concerned so as to ensureas effective a result as possible.   Nothing like completesuppression can be anticipated but I have no doubt that agreat deal can be accomplished by such measures as the stoppage of literature and books of tickets at the Customs and in thepost and. by the prosecution of the principal distributors oftickets after due public warning.  If the Free StateGovernment, who are not without responsibility in the matter,could be induced to use their influence with the promotersto discourage sales in this country that would be of great assistance, and I hope the Secretary of State for the Dominionsmay be prepared to make suitable representations to them.They should at any rate be left without any excuse of Ignoranceas to the state of the law in this country and the action thatwe find it necessary to take.      Action  such as I have just  indicated will be welcomed by those in this country who are  opposed to lotteries on grounds of principle? but it will be resented by all those whothink the existing law grandmotherly and out of date.  Thelatter I believe form a fairly numerous class and I think wemust expect a considerable outcry, which will be all the louderon account of the loss of hoped-for commission.  There is alsoa considerable ho&amp;y of persons who think the law should be changed so as to permit lotteries to be carried on, but only under proper  safeguards, as a method of raising money fordeserving objects, and who, while not objecting to the strictenforcement of the existing law,  will find  in the incident anopportunity for renewing their demand for an impartial reviewof the whole  question.  I am disposed to think that if such a
HOME office   9ol2.30cdemand is made it would be well to receive it sympatheticallywithout, of course, committing the Government in any way,  I gather from the press that the hospitals are considering thematter and may possibly take steps to test the opinion oftheir regular subscribers,  1 shall have to make a fairly full statement in the House of Commons when explaining the steps that must be taken to enforce the existing law, and if my colleagues agree 1 could make it clear at the same time that the Govern-ment, without committing themselves to any final view on thequestion of prinoiple involved, would be prepared, if therequest were made to zlaem  on behalf of any substantial group of  existing charitj.es, to  set up  a Committee to consider, asa practical question, the  conditions and safeguards which wouldbe  appropriate and necessary ijl lotteries were to be permittedas  a method of raising money for  approved public purposes,                                      J&quot; o Re  C c -
