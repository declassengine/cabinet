                                                                 2GTHIS DOGUiviENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.CP- 405(50)                                            COPY NO,                        CABINET.                EDUCATION (SCHOOL ATTENDANCE) BILL,            Memorandum  &quot;by the  Chancellor  of t he Exchequer,              I desire  to bring  to the  notice of,  the Cabinet    certain important financial  reactions of the  Education (School    Attendance) Bill of which  I  have  only just been informed.    The Financial  Memorandum attached to  the Bill estimated the    total annual charge involved for  England and  Wales at     6,250,000 per annum,  of which  4,350,000 was the Exchequer    share.    The usual  addition  of eleven eightieths must be made    to  the Exchequer portion of this charge for Scotland,   The    greater part of this expenditure  will be for  Maintenance Allow-    ancep. in respect of children who  will be kept at school    another year.   It  now appears that in two respects the Bill     imposes  further charges on  public  funds in respect of the    same children.         (1)   Under Section I(.2.)  of the Contributory pensions Act    1925,  the allowances (5/-  or 3/-  a  week) to widows in respect    of  children, and orphans&apos;  pensions  (7/6 a week) cease at 14    unless the child is in each  case  under full instruction in    a day school.   Practically all allowances now cease at the    end of the school term in  which the child reaches 14,    but,as a result of  raising the school leaving age to 15,    they will go on for another  year  and  an additional charge    will in consequence be thrown upon  tho Pensions Account    estimated at  400,000 in the first  full year,rising to
 450,000 per annum.  An the Exchequer Grant to the PensionsAccount has to be  the amount re paired to keep it solvent,this  additional charge must sooner or later fall upon theExchequer.      (S)  Under the Unemployment Insurance j-..cts the benefitto a  married man is increased by 2/- a week in respect ofevery dependent child, i.e, &quot;any child under the age of 14years who is maintained wholly or mainly at the cost of theperson entitled to benefit or any child between the ages of14 and 16 who is under full-time instruction in a dayschool and is so maintained as aforesaid&quot;.    If,  as maywell  be the case,  the Umpire under those Acts rules thatchildren in respect of whom an allowance of 5/- a week is being paid  under the Education Bill are nevertheless being &quot;mainlymaintained&quot; by their parents.the cost of unemployment benefit will be substantially increased by the raising of the schoolage.   Vilh the present live register the maximum increase is estimated at roughly  .500,000 per annum, of which about one-quarter would fall directly on Votes and. the other three-quarters would have to be advanced by the Exchequer to theUnemployment Fund,          Thus the Bill as it now stands may involve an expenditure from public funds of nearly 21  million a year inrespect of cases in which it is also proposed to give MaintenanceAllowances from Education funds (60 per cent of which will fall  upon the Exchequer).   Inasmuch as under both the foregoingheads thy allowance in respect of the child is expressly given on condition of his attending school, and. the Maint.onanc.0Allowance under the Bill will be payable to the same child, i must  ask my colleagues to consider the position that thusarises.
do          Somewhat similar to the foregoing cases if. theposition under the War Pensions Acts-   In theso easesallowances varying from IS&apos;/- to l/- a week are payable toor in respect of children of men hilled cr disabled in theWar.   These allowances are payable up to the age of 16years,irrespective of whether the child is in attendance at school or not.   The riuriber of children attending elementary schools who 7*ill under the Bill become eligible for anadditional a/-- a week is estimated at 50 ,CC0 on 1st April1351, representing an annual charge of  400/000 a year.  As,however,the period of fifteen years from the date ofdemobilisation draws to a close the number of cases of double allowances rapidly diminishes,and by 1st January  1953when under the revised proposals of the Government themaintenance allow aness would begin - the number will have                                            tofallen to about ID,000 and the annual charge/about  200,000.During 133b this class will have disappeared,                           (Intld.)  P. S.Treasury 0hambers,   Whitehall, S.W.I.      December 1st, 1950.
