DO GUMP NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                       CAB  I N B T .                   COAL MINES SITUATION.       Note by the President of the Board  of  TradeB     I circulate, for the information of my  colleagues, afurther note by the Secretary for Mines on the Coal  Minessituation.,SET^.1.414 (30) copy No.37W. G.Board of Tradec9th December, 1930.
                     COAL MINES SITUATION.     Since tho circulation of the note dated 5th December(C. P .410(30)) an agreement has been made in Scotland for a resumption of work ow a temporary agreement till 28th February.The terms of the agreement are the spreadover withoutreduction in wage rates.   Some opposition to the arrangement was evident on Monday at certain pits, resulting in a percentageof the men refusing to work.   But, generally speaking, work hasbeen resumed.     A meeting of the South i-ales Conciliation Board was heldat Cardiff yesterday (8th December) when it is understood thatthe owners offered to extend the present temporary terms to theend of January and suggested that a joint sub-committee should meet as soon as possible to consider  the whole question,     A meeting was also held yesterday in Lancashire, where thepresent agreement ends on 51st December,    It is understood that proposals were put forward by the owners and that these will beconsidered by a delegate conference on Saturday,.     Tho replies of the districts to  the questions addressed tothem by the Miners&apos; Federation after  last we3k&apos;s Conference are due to be returned by Thursday, and there still remains thopossibility that theso replies may show a majority against thespreadover, even as a temporary arrangement.      It is not  certain whether in this event the Federation willpronounce definitely against the &quot;spreadover&quot; principle, orwhether they will find some means of  either making nopronouncement or of postponing one.     Nor  can it bo said with certainty whether there would bea  stoppage in the spreadover- districts or whether the men would  continue to work under it even  in the face of an adversedecision  of the Federation,1-
     It is clear,, however  that, if the decision isunfavourable- there is the certain prospect, at any rate insome districts, including South Kales and Scotland, of either a stoppage or a continuation of spreadover agreements withoutany positive approval by the Miners1 Federation,     unless it would be possible, in the absence of a definiteveto by the Federation, to treat their attitude as amountingto constructive approval, and on that basis to legalisedistrict spreadover agreements by Order, I see no means of avoiding either stoppages or alternatively, breaches of thelaw except by either suspending Part III of the Act or byrepealing the provision which requires the approval of the miners Federation,,     Either of these courses is highly objectionable c   At theleast it would amount to forcing upon the Miners1 federation the principle of spread-over to which they had formallydeclared themselves hostile, and to which some districts are said to prefer a reduction of wages0     Otherwise the only  course appears to be to instituteproceedings in any district in which the spread-over is -or has been - worked,,    It would not be a satisfied satisfactory, crpossibly an effective, method of dealing with the situation,.It only punishes, and does not necessarily  stop, the breach0It would moreover be represented as prosecuting people for keeping at work without  industrial dislocation or reductionof wage So   The responsibility however would clearly rest upon the Miners1 Federation by reason of their refusal to approve the spread-over, and the Government would be freed ofthe accusation of &quot;winking at&quot; the breach of tho Act,     The first step, however, unless the replies of thodistricts this week  are  such as to rule out the prospect ofa stoppage in any district, should,  I think, be to urge the
-o-Federation to call a further delegate conference.    It  isunderstood that this would also ho the view taken by theFederation officials, who would probably rule that a nationalballot was necessary before national action  could be takenB                                            E.S.                                             9.12.30.
