aegis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .                                                      Copy No.   30                                  CAB  I N E T.                                STATE OF TRADE.                Mamorandum by the President of the Board  of Trade,             &quot;With the exception of the  woollen industry,  in which the         slight improvement reported  last month is maintained, and a  few         hopeful signs in the cotton  trade, the staple trades of  the         country remain  severely depressed and the position, especially         with regard to  iron and steel,  has deteriorated  still further,.         There has been  some seasonal activity in certain trades  such as         hosiery, and boots and shoes, but rather less than might be         expected,.    In  general, there is no evidence that wholesale         prices have reached bottom except  in the finer qualities of  wool.         In  the  case of  both cotton and  wheat the indications point to  a         further fall In price, and  I cannot discern  in the reports made         to  the Advisory Council any  definite grounds for expecting an         early upward turn  In trade.              In coal the numbers  employed  remained fairly steady during         November and the production  per week - probably  in  some  part         owing to apprehension  of  a  stoppage *  increased  slightly as         compared with  October.    The average for the month was            i         4,942,000 tons, as compared  with  5,331,000 tons  for  November,         1929u    In  Durham  the  demand for  coking  and  gas  coal has, however,\         been  strong and it is  stated,  more than  justifies the  quota         allotted to it  by  the  owners under the   Coal  Mines Act.    Trade in         Scotland was affected  by  the week^s stoppage which dislocated         business,.             The position  in  the  iron and  steel, industry continues to         deteriorate:   the  number  of  furnaces  in blast  at the  end of         November was only  94,  or  25  per cent,  of the. total.    TheSE CRIST iCP. 431 (30).
Continental price agreements have now completely collapsed andpig iron quoted at 67/6 f .o,b. Antwerp In January, 1930, is now50/-,   The steel cartel has, however, been, renewed for afurther six months which should mitigate over-production anddisorganisation, of prices.   Home production of both iron andsteel has fallen heavily again while imports of both pig ironand manufactures of iron and steel continue to rise.   in volume our exports of iron and steel goods during November were only 53 per cent,, of those for November, 1929, and actually lessthan our imports;  the value of the exports remains much higherthan that of the imports.     There is little indication of recovery and the depressionhas begun to affect the tinplate trade which up to now has been fairly well employed.   Demand remains slack from the shipbuilding and constructional engineering trades; -but thework on the new Cunarder will to some extent assist the steelindustry in the New Year,     As regards export trade in engineering products, trade withRussia shows Improvement, exports of machinery from this countrybeing valued at  1,850,000 for the first 9 months of the year ascompared with about  1,740,000 for the whole of 1929 (andslightly less in 1928),   Further contracts have been signed, itis reported, for the supply of machine tools and  coal cuttersfrom this country during next year to a total value of  76 0,000,     Special attention is called to the fall in the proportionof our engineering exports to Australia to the total of such goods Imported by that Dominion;  the 1927-8 and 1928-9(Australian) trade returns show a drop from 53.7 per cent, to47,6 per cent, over all.   The best items are electrical cable and wire (95 per cent. United Kingdom 1920/9), boilers  (95 percest,) and crunes, hoists, etc,  (88 per cent,);  the worstdairy machinery (5 per cent,) and agricultural machinery (17 percent,),   3fcwas also complained that Australia had be comopraotically a closed market for motor cars,                            -2-
A A Oj     In the motor industry demand for cheaper and medium cars is greater than in 1929 and registrations are up, but production facilities are in excess of immediate demand.   The Americansespecially have overestimated the demand in all export markets,though this may benefit the British industry in the long run.1     The position in the rubber trade is fairly satisfactory,especially as regards tyres.     The position in the textile trades is a little more hopeful.Competition in the export of cotton goods continues to be verykeen especially from Japan, Italy and France, but the Chinesemarket shows a hopeful expansion and piece goods stocks are lower in India and at home.   IThe improvement in the finersections of the woollen industry, viz. worsteds, has been maintained and, as stated above, there are indications that rawwool prices, at any rate for the finer qualities, may havetouched bottom.   Unemployment, however, remains very high in cotton (40.37o this month and 41.3$ last month) and in wool isstill high for the whole industry (29,1$ this month and 24.9%last month).   There is keen competition from foreign manufacturers of the fine qualities of artificial  silk  cloth, and there are signs that the Chinese as well as the Japanese will become largeproducers  of rayon goods.   The reports from the various hosierycentres are  conflicting, but there is, on the whole, fairseasonal activity.     The shipping position  Is  slightly better.   The freightindex number rose 8 points  (1.0. to  86, on the 1913 basis of 100),and the chartering from Russia was replaced  by chartering from theArgentine  and Australia.    The number of  ships laid up remainsvery large,  however, and all the principal layingr-up berths arestated to  be full.     The shipments of Russia wheat appear to have  stopped for  thepresent, but there are now  large stocks in Great Britain and elsewhere  (e.g. Antwerp).    In the last few  weeks  there has been
considerable activity in shipments of wheat from the argentine and crops in both that country and Australia are heavy.   On thewhale, there is no prospect of a rise in price.     The chemical industry reports a bad year, though it has suffered less than other trades.   Regret was expressed at thedecision of the Government not to renew the Dyestuffsprohibition, but assurances were given that the industry would endeavour to maintain its position and especially to keep upresearch generally, though it was not certain that all the firmswould he able to maintain their research work.     The decline in railway traffic receipts  continues, thetotal figure for November this year being 7.06 per  cent, belowthe figure for November, 1929, and for general merchandise thedifference was as much as ll-J per  cent.     The  cash volume of retail trade is less than last year, butthe number of transactions has increased, and  the fall in valueof turnover probably represents an increase in quantity.   food prices In departmental stores are  stated now  to be  in many  casesdown to  pre-war levels.     The numbers unemployed increased from  2,237,501 at the endof October to 2,286,400 at the end of November, and this included a rise of  109,268 in the  numbers wholly unemployed.The increase was largely  In the London  and  Southern Divisions,the North Eastern Division showing a slight decrease,  due to  animprovement  in  cotton  (5,800).    There  was  also an  improvement  of10,334  In Wales.     There  is not much change to  report  in the position  in  theSouth American  markets.   The economic  situation  in the Argentine continues  to be difficult, and  the power  of the  country  to  absorbimported goods  must remain restricted for  some time.   The  trade situation in Brazil continues depressed, but  owing  to  therestriction  of  imports the trade  balance  remains  favourable,                                -4-
     Notwithstanding withdrawals to France and Germany the reserves at tho Bank of England stood on December 3 at 45,5 percent, of liabilities, as compared with 31,8 per cent, a yearago, and during the week ending December 3 a large expansion of notes in circulation ( 8,000,000) occurred,                                        W.G.Board of Trade,  3 0th December, 1930

MEETING OF THE BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL,    on Tbxu?Bday,. 11th December, 1930^COAL .     SIR WALTER RAINE.  Sir, I should like to give you the position of the coal trade in Durham.  It is very strongindeed and all kinds of coking and gas coals are in greatdemand, but as mentioned last month, this is not unusual atthis season of the year.  It is with regret, however, that Ihave to criticise the way in which the Mines Act is beingworkedo  There are no minimum prices issued yet for Durham.The Quota has been placed at 70  per cont. of what it wastwelve months ago, to commence as from the 1st of January.  Itis correct, however, to state that this may be increased by afurther 10 per cent, after allocations have been made to the developing collieries, but having regard to the fact thatalways in the winter time there is an enormous demand forDurham coals, one would have thought that as the collierieshave closed up most if not all of their uneconomic seams, therewould have been at least 100 per cent, allocation for thefirst three months of noxt year.  Since preparing my noteyesterday, I have read in a last nights Newcastle eveningpaper, the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;, a statement which ratherconfirms what I have just been saying, relative to the  giving of notice to 300 men at Montagu Pit,  That  is one of thecoking coal collieries, and the Manager said yesterday &quot;AfterJanuary 1st, we have enough trade for twice the output weshall be allowed by the Government.  Considering the seasonit Is doubly hard lines on the men, but we have hopes that by tho end of March the colliery will be reinstated to itsnormal working&quot;.  As I mentioned last month, and as I say againtoday, in Durham County in particular at this time of theyear, they could easily do with 100 per cent, allocation,whatever the price is,  Of course, from the 1st of April,when the demand from the various Gas Works, both British and continental, becomes reduced to a minimum, a reduction in the quota for Durham would not matter so much, but at the presenttime,  it Is, in my opinion, suicidal.  Theoretically, somecollieries will have no coals to export, and the salesman forone of the largest groups of collieries in Durham, said to meonly three days ago, when I was attempting to negotiate somebusiness with him, that there was no doubt whatever that agreat  amount of trade would be lost to the Durham districtthrough the action of the quota.SHIPBUILDING.     With regard to shipbuilding, there is just a crumbof comfort so far as the Wear is concerned, because orders have been placed for two Hoppers for the River Wear Commission,and another firm has received an order for two Trawlers, eaoh150 feet long, but on the other hand, as the shipyards havebeen finishing off their present jobs, they have had todischarge their men.  According to the latest statistics,given at a Ministry of Health inquiry two days ago, thenumber of unemployed in Sunderland is considerable over17,000, and in addition, there are 8,787 people receivingPoor Law Relief.
     So far as shipbuilding on the Tyne is concerned,it is a little better placed than tho Wear, but more orderswould certainly he very welcome.     Shiprepairing has become much quieter on tho JTorthEast Coast, and on tho West coast, it is still very slack.     As the result of a statement made to you a month ago,I have been making inquiries, and thirk it might interestyou to know that tho prico of Empire Butter charged by theRetailer is fivepence per pound less than Danish butter.That is. actual experience In Sundorland last w-eek.COAL.     SIR ALFRED FAULKNER.  I would like to roply to oneor two points made by Sir Walter Raine in his first fewopening sentences.  In the first place he said he thoughtDurham could produce a lot more coal than they were allowed by the Government to produce.  I would like to say, first of all, that it is nothing whatever to do with the Goverranenft^     SIR WALTER RAINE.  I was reading that from a newspaperarticle.  I did not use the word * Government!.     SIR ALFRED FAULKNER.  I&apos;m sorry.  That ie so but youdid not correct tho statement that it is the Government1saction.  It is not.  It Is the coalowners themselves whohave fixod their allocation for the first three months ofthe year.  They have fix*d that allocation for the country as a whole on the b&amp;Bi? of 90 p*r cent, of the output for the&apos;first quarter of last year, and as the output of the pitshas been going down steadily from this time last year itis not unreasonable f*r them to anticipate that the sales inthe first quarter of next /ear may be rather less than the sales in the first quarter of last year, but provision is madethroughout all the schemes to permit increases if it is foundthat the demand for coal is groater than the supply allowed by the schemes.  So that there is provision to meet thesituation wh.Ich.vSir Walter Raine anticipates will arise.  Thenext point is,  gjSir Walter Raine said they had been allowedan allocation dr 70 .per cont. and they might have a further10 per cent.  Ths exaet position is that they have allowedan interim allocation of 70 per cent, because a considerablenumber of collieries in Durham have put in appeals against their amount of standard tonnage, which is the basis of the calculation, and in order to safeguard themselves against thepossible results of these&quot; appeals the Durham Committee havekept in hand 20 per cent, tf the standard tonnage.      (At this stage the President of the Board of Trade          arrived and took tho Chair).     SIR ALFRED FAULKNER (Continuing).  So the true, positionis that while there is an allocation of 70 per cent, there is kept in hand a further 20 per cont. and not 10 por cent.** See p. 8  in Minutes  of  the  proceedings for November   13th, 1930.
     SIR WALTER RAINE.   I am afraid you did not hear exactly what I said.   &quot;it is correct, however, to state that this may beincreased by a further 10 per cent, after the allocations havebeen made to the developing collieries&quot;*   I had that from acolliery owner,,     SIR ALFRED FAULKNER.   The amount in hand is 20 per cent.That is the point I want to make.     SIR WALTER RAINE.   I said the allocation was 70 per cent.and I said there may be a further 10 per cent, allocated afterallocations have been made to these developing collieries.Some of these developing collieries have put in very big demands,and naturally so,.   As for the Government, as I said before,this was a quotation from a newspaper, one of last night1spapers,/and I never used the word Government1 at all so far as my observations were concerned.     SIR ALFRED FAULKNER.   I just wanted the Council tounderstand the exact position which I thought, from thequotation from the newspaper, at any rate, would have been.mi sundorstood.CHEMICALS o      DOCTOR CLAYTON.   I have here, Sir, a Report on the general position of the chemical industry in 1930.   I propose to hand that ln,*   It ends with the statement that the chemical industry has passed through.at least one of the worst years of its history so far as the commercial asg*ect is concerned from the viewpoint of the chemical manufacturer.   One can only take some comfort in the fact that the industry has not suffered to tho extent which other industries have suffered, but at the same time it must be borne in mind that almost all of Its output is absorbed by these industries which have been so depressed during the past year, and sooner or later the chemical industry will feel the full effect of that depression.      Heavy Chemicals:  There Is a distinct Increase in the consumption of chemicals and, whilst this should not be relied upon as an Indication of a permanent revival, it may signify an increase in confidence, when considered In relation to the more.. optimistic atmosphere prevailing.      The, substantial advance in deliveries of alkali Is attributable to both home and export trade, the industries previously reported still showing Increased activity.   The revival in the artificial silk trade reported last month appears to have been momentary, and the relapse which has taken place has had a slight effect on  chlorine sales.   The depression in the metal trade has reduced sales of hydrochloric acid, but the consumption of sulphuric acid continues to increase.   This is, as previously stated, not due to any particular trade.      There is *a decrease in consumption of fertilizers, but this is not abnormal considering the depressed state of the agricultural Industry.* See Appendix p. 47.
     The slackness in the textile trade continues to affectsales of dyes.  Some ground Is being regained againstcompetition in indigo markets abroad,  A special note on the dyestuffs position will conclude this report.     Opal Tar Products: No outstanding change has occurred inthe market for coal tar products, and with the exception of light oils such as benzole, demand has been dull through-out the section.  On the export side, creosote and oresylicacid have been a little brighter, but prices have not been satisfactory.     Fine Chemicals; The slight improvement in the home trade reported last month cannot be said to have been maintained.     In regard to the Indian boycott, the improvementreported a month ago has been well maintained.  Buyers in Calcutta are now beginning to order again, but not in Bombay,The improvement may be said to be real but very slow.     Dyestuffs. I should like to make a short statement fromthe point of view of the chemical trade on the dyestuffspo sition,    &quot;The chemical industry deeply regrets the decision of theGovernment to allow the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act,1920, to lapse on 14th January, 1931.  It wishes to assure the President of the Board of Trade that it will make everyeffort to prevent foreign-J.nroads into our unprotected market,and to continue the progressive development of an industry which has such an important bearing on our national prosperityand security, but it cannot guarantee that it will succeedagainst the powerful forces arrayed against it.  The effects of the Government decision are already being felt; a number ofnew developments have been suspended; men have had to be discharged; the Swiss have openly declared their Intention of supplying many of their dyes  from Switzerland instead of having them made in this country by their subsidiaries as heretofore, and the Germans and Americans are making arrange-ments for  sending large quantities of dyes into the country as soon as the Act lapses.  All these points will be carefully watched and reported to you month by month.     I do not wish to  encroach on the subject of politics, butthe chemical industry feels strongly on the following three points:-           (1) That the Government decision was unduly               delayed  and did not give the industry adequate               time  (it was less than two months) to make               arrangements to cope with the adverse               conditions under which it will have to be               conducted.
          (2) That while all the facts In support               of the makers were made public for anyone               to criticise and challenge, the data on               which certain sections of the users,- and in               particular the textile trade, have based               their objections, have not even yet been               published.  Thus the industry has not only               been given no opportunity of replying to               the criticisms but Is in fact still unaware               as to the precise arguments advanced.          (3) That such a novel and important experiment               in political economy as the Dyestuffs               Act has not been made the subject of an               impartial investigation on judicial and               scientific lines, removed from the area               of party politics, so that the country               at large may be given an authoritative               statement of all the facts of the case.     It is bflped that even at this late hour theGovernment will see its way to order such an enquiry intoa matter which is admitted by all parties to be of thegreatest national Importance,  Surely it is not much toask, since it is in accord with the usual principles ofBritish justice.&quot;     Then there is a letter in to-day&apos;s &quot;Times&quot; from theFederation, of British Industries.  It gives a resolution passed by the Executive Committee yesterday:-       &quot;The Executive Committee of the Federation         of British Industries is strongly of         opinion that in a matter of such importance         fffom the point of view of national prosperity         and security there should have been an         impartial enquiry into all the facts of the         case before the decision was taken to allow         the Dyestuffs (Import Regulation) Act, 1920,         to lapse in January, and urges on the         Government the necessity of extending the         Act for such period as may be required to         enable a judicial investigation on non-         party lines to be made&quot;.     That is what I was asked to bring to your notice.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  Thank you, Dr.Clayton.I appreciate Dr. Clayton&apos;s report and,  of course, I must not from the Chair, as Dr. Clayton himself said, engage in political strife, but on one or two points I should liketo say something.  The decision was taken in 1921, was it not,when a specific period wa.3 inserted in the Act together withthe words, &quot;and no longer&quot; so that from the start the industry has had ten years notice of the proposition.  Is that nottrue?     DR. CLAYTON:  That is quite true but then tho fact thatthe matter was under discussion and was openly underdiscussion led them to doubt whether the Act was really goingto be made to lapse.  There were all sorts of enquiries going on on the subject and right up to the last moment they didnot know what the Government^ deoision was likely to be.
id     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  On the point ofenquiry, the question turned very largely on the report ofwhat was, I think, speaking from recollection, a statutoryGommittee, the Dyestuff Industry Development Committee andthere you had a very full review of a quite impartial kindrepresentative of &quot;both producers of dye stuffs end users ofdyestuffs, than which I should have imagined you could not get a better tribunal.  Their report was published months ago and I indicated in Parliament that after very long delibera-tions they were still unable to agree to make the Governmentany recommendation as to the future of the Act.  TheGovernment accordingly had to take its decision with referenceto a large number of industries and in particular to thecotton and woollen textile trades, but I do not think it canbe suggested and Dr. Clayton will be the last to mis-understand me that the whole subject was not very fully and very carefully reviewed by people who were in a powerfulposition to make that review.     DR. CLAYTON:  No0  Of couroe one does not wish tosuggest that a very careful enquiry was not made, but our suggestion is that after the decision was made the time was too short for us really to alter our manufacturing etc., to suit the new conditions.  We were very hopeful that eventhough it was not extended for a matter of say 5 years, atany rate for one year it would be continued.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  I appreciate that point, Dr. Clayton, but you do not dispute the terms of theAct.  They were specific.     DR. CLAYTON:  I do not.  I know &quot;che Act quite well,     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  May I ask where is it proposed to dismiss the men and where actually will therestriction in development occur?     DR. CLAYTON:  In the individual works.     PRESIDE?&quot;T OP THL BOARD OP TRADE:  In which works?     DR. CLAYTON:  In the dye works.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD 01-&apos; TRADE:  In which part,  inwhich actual firms?     DR. CLAYTON:  That I have not got.  V7e  are veryhopeful of maintaining  the numbers employed, but if what wefear happens, if foreign producers of dyes who havespecialities insist that in.supplying those  specialities theymust also have a quota of the ordinary dyes we produce, then we shall have to reduce our men.   .\     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  But in your  report youstated  that men had been dismissed.  Where have they beendismissed?     DR. CLAYTON:  I  could not tell you.  I  do not think inour own works,     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE:  Do you know  of  anyother works where they have been dismissed ?     DR. CLAYTON:  I  could get it lor you.  UnfortunatelyI  only  got that  this morning, that report.
     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  Another point,that report indicated that you had information regardingarrangements to dump into this country considerable supplies,I gathered from certain Continental sources.  &quot;What is thebasis of that statement,,  Have you information regarding the stocks and if they are likely to come into this country?     DRS CLAYTON:  There is no doubt they have huge stockson the Continent in the same way as we have stocks here thatwe cannot get rid of ourselves, and they would certainlycome in.  We are perfectly certain of thatD     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  You see my difficulty.I do not ask these questions in a controversial spirit.  Itis so vitally important to get at the facts in these cases.I know the fears of the industry,, but in other connections -and I am speaking now quite impartially of duties - whenduties have been removed large quantities of goods have notin fact been dumped into this country at all.  Take the caseof the lace industry.  Although trade has fallen off thefact remains that in the succeeding months the imports have actually declined very considerably, probably more than would be accounted for by the ordinary trade depression.     DRo CLAYTON:  Might I call attention to this sentencewith regard to the large quantities of dyes v/hich vieanticipate will come in, &quot;All these points will be carefully watched and reported to you month by month&quot;.  We will give you those particulars definitely as soon as we have them and keep you informed as to the movements of those foreign dyes,but we have every reason to believe that, especially withregard to the Swiss dyes, that the djres at present being madein this country in subsidiary works are going to be made inSwitzerland which will mean, of course, in  that c ase adischarge of workers in the English works.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  Dr. Clayton, we erevery grateful to you for the information that you propose tolodge, but I should like to say end   am sure the members ofthe Council will agree  that this was a ver; difficult decision for any Government to make.  We had to weigh the representations of an industry so established on the one s ideand the representations which were made by  the employers andthe Trade Unions in the great textile industries on the other side.  I made it clear  in the House that it was not an easydecision to make and it was one that v/as only reached afterver, careful consideration.  We do hope that these diffi-culties will not in fact arise, the fears Dr. Clayton has expressed.  I am certsinlj&apos;- grateful to him i or what he  saidregardin. the efforts that the dyestuffs industry itself willmake.     MRo TITTERINGTON:  There is one question I would likato  a.sk, whether Dr. Clayton made any reference  to the stoppage of research work.
\S ij     DRo CLAYTONs   No.  I hope my company will not feel itnecessary to limit research.  We hope not,  hut wears  not  theonly dye makers and we  are really in a happier position thanmost of the others &quot;because it is not the largest portion  cfour business, so that we can carry on even under depressingcircumstances in the dye trade whereas some of the other  dyemakers are solely dye makers and if the dye industry  is goingto be a non-profitable  one &quot;obey will close down.  They cannothelp it.  That is the difficulty.  My own company have everyhope of maintaining their research, but I am not so happyabout the others.WORK OF THE COUNCIL.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   Perhaps, Gentlemen,  atthis point you would allow me to intervene with just one very short statement regarding the work of  the Council.   I haveregretted that because of Cabinet and  other duties it has beenvery difficult for me to be present at more than one or tv/o ofthe meetings, or at any rate not at all of them.  I hope toattend as many as possible.  The question turns rather on making the best use of our time at the meetings of the Council.I think it is true that practically all members lodge a written statement similar to the statements which have been made thismorning and probably members would agree that in order tomake the best use of our time it would be better to lodgethe written statements which of course are circulated later,and then leave as much time as possible for discussion at the meetings of the Council on questions that arise, because Ithink it is in that way that we get nearer to the heart of  manyof our commercial and trade difficulties at the present time.I submit that with great respect to the members of theCouncil.    I think probably that suggestion will commend itself to all members of the Council as one that willenable us to make the very best use of our time at these meetings.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:   When xould you like the written statements submitted, a day or two beforehand?     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   There is no doubt thatwould be an advantage but it is not essential of course.Members might simply lodge their statements here and thenconfine their verbal statements to the Council to the salient features of. their report, bringing out the heads and so on.That would give us more time for questions and discussion.   Forexample, this subject Dr. Clayton&apos;has  raised is vitally important and there will be a full opportunity for discussionof the position of that industry or any other industry.  I  makethe suggestion this morning.  I do not know that we needtake the final decision on it at this  meeting.  It mightbe considered by members and they could make any remarksregarding it at the next meeting of the Council.     SIR HORACE HAMILTON:  The members of the council may remember that these meetings used  to be held in the first week of the month, but they were postponed till the second week of the month in order, amongst other things, that more information in regard to the trade position in the
preceding month should he available.    I think., therefore,the position is that if we are to have as full information  aspossible in regard to the trade activities of the precedingmonth we could not expect to have a report much before theThursday on which the meeting is held.   For that reason it would probably be most convenient if members broughttheir reports with them and put them in.  There is noquestion of studying the reports before we hear the statementsfrom the members of the Council, but we have felt it would  bevery useful if these written statements could be put in onthe day and then that the statements made by members of theCouncil should be confined to the salient features of thesituation.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   If there is noother question, perhaps we might leave it at that and then atthe next meeting members may express their views.     SIR WALTER RAINE:   Why not try it next time?     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  It is open to members of the Council to apply it at once, if they choose.They can consider it next time.     MR. FUG-H:  Mr. President, what follows the giving of our written reports?   What occurs to me is this, one can come and say things are very bad and point out that theyare very bad here and there, but unless one brings outin some detail what the circumstances are it seems to medifficult to find a basis for discussion.  If it were contemplated that members of the Council should put inreports which the Council as a whole would have had anopportunity of seeing, then I could conceive of discussion on the information supplied, but if it is merely to be a curtailment of what is to be said before this Council, onewonders whether there is great advantage in your suggestionapart from the saving of time.  I have not noticed onthe request from you to put questions on the various reportsthat there has been very great anxiety to ask questions andI am wondering therefore how we are going to use the time that will be savedby putting in our reports without bringing them before you in detail.     MR. CLAUSON: I think that rather depends on thenature of the report.  I put in a report on ColonialTrade which I should describe as entirely unreadableexcept in the privacy of one s chamber.  I tried to pointout what the principal points in that report are and topromote discussion on them.  Several of us were in that position.   I think it depends on the nature of the reportin each case.     MR. FUGH:  We will not all admit that our reports are unreadable, and we will not take that  as a criterionof what is put in.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:   I should not take that gloomy view, Mr. Pugh, and it is not theintention to take any step which would lead to the loss ofany information.  It is rather the desire to make the best use of our ti;.\e.   I think members would have no difficulty
in preparing a written report and then bringing out intheir statements the salient features of  that report,because it is desirable I think to encourage rather morequestioning and discussion that we have had  in the  past.  Thatwould he very valuable to all of us.     MR. FUGH:   I quite agree, Sir.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:   I  think it istrue at the moment members do net ask many questions,  butI sometimes think that maybe due to  the  fact that  othermembers have statements to make, and  there is only alimited time and all of us are pressed by other work and can only give a limited time even to  this important task.It is really in that spirit the suggestion is made.     MR. WALKER:  Is it intended that these  discussions should as it were occur on the spur of the moment?I was going to say it would be helpful at the same time if members could put in some subject  they v/ould like tohave discussed or possibly the Government might wishto have the views of industry on some particular thingand could give notice of some such subject for discussion.I have always thought that would be extremely helpful.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD CP TRADE:   I  should notthink so offhand.  The second suggestion is not finallyruled out, and that might be considered from time to time,but at the moment the desire is rather to get the reportsregarding all the industries represented  and then toprovide fuller opportunity for questions  and discussionsarising on those reports.COTTON.     MR.  LENNOX LEE:&apos;&apos;4  The slight improvement that was reported in October v/as not maintained during November.   Somehome trade firms however have reported more enquiry towardsthe end of the month,  but the export trade particularly inthe Par Eastern markets has been lifeless.  The politicalsituation in India has continued seriously to interfere withthe sale of imported piece goods in both centres andparticularly in Bombay.  China, on the other hand, presentsa brighter outlook with a much improved political situation.Districts which have been out of reach for many months havenew come into the market and this accounts for the great improvement which has taken place in the clearance of localstocks.  The Japanese are reported to b e still liquidatingstocks at very 3ow prices, but for new goods theirquotations are much higher. - Owing to Russian competitionthe demand from fersla is practically dead, whilst thedifficulties in obtaining Persian exchange have seriouslyinterfered with Baghdad shippers and business has recentlyfallen off in consequence.* Extracts from a written statement handed in by Mr.  Lee   are attached-   Appendix page 57.-in.
     Competition in Egypt from France and Italy has continued and this together with the diminishing purchasing power of thenative has resulted in the continuance of depressed conditions.     Business from South America continues to be very poor.The low prices that have been obtained for the stapleproductions of this market have seriously restricted purchasingpower.   Depreciation of the currencies in most Republics hasadded to the difficulties of the trade.     Competition from France, Italy and Japan has been intensified as a result of the endeavours which those countries are making to find new markets following the interruption, ofbusiness with India and the depressed conditions ruling elsewhere.     Stocks of piece goods are however reported to be below normal.     MR. LINDSAY:  Does Mr. Lee confirm that there has been adecided clearance of stocks in India?   I understand that  therehas been, especially in the South, in the Madras markets.     MR. LENNOX LEE:  Yes, and in Calcutta and in Karachi.     MR. LINDSAY:  So that the clearance of stocks that hastaken place in China has bean accompanied by more or lesssimilar clearance in India?     MR. LENNOX LEE:  In most of the  Indian markets but not in bombay.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  How long has theimprovement In China been in progress?     MR. LENNOX LEE:  About nine months.   We&apos; are now gettingmore orders in regard to all the work we are  interested in shanghai.     iR. CLAUSON:   Is the drop in the price of silver likely to upset that at all?   It was at bottom price yesterday.     MR, LENNOX LEE:  No, there has been stabilisation, it hasbeen a very small drop.WOOL.     MR. T LITERINGTON:  During the past few weeks, machinery,in the merino combing and botany spinning branches has been fairly well employed as a result of the substantial coveringmovement in October.   In the West Riding alone there has been areduction of 2,000 in the number&apos; of unemployed in worstedspinning, mainly amongst workers &quot;temporarily stopped&quot;.Unemployment still remains high, however, owing to the depressionin the crossbred branches.   There has been a seasonalimprovement In worsted weaving, helped  also by the acceleration
of deliveries of goods to Canada in order to avoid paying thehigher duties recently imposed.   The woollen trade has shown a seasonal decline.   The net result is that unemployment does not show much change compared with recent months.     There has been a sharp decline in prices of crossbred wool.Prices of fine wool stiffened a lit Lie during the October buying-spoll, but have eased again to the lowest point since the war,line wool, however, is still regarded with a good deal efconfidence, because the demand is running strongly towards finequalities,   lool values as a whole are about 35 per cent, lower than in 1913,     In the dyeing and finishing industry a communication hasbe^n received from the employers&apos; organisation inviting thetrado unions to take part in a joint  conference with regard tothe conditions prevailing in the industry..   The cemmu-iicationis couched in terms which appear to indicate that the object ofthe conference is a reduction of coats of production.     The recent discussion in the House of Commons has againdrawn attention to the prevailing conditions, and one hasnothing further to add at this stage.IRON AND  ST3JL.     MR, wALIvSSLEY:   No improvement in the Iron and Steel industry can be recorded for november  even the extremely low figures ofproduction registered in October have not proved to be the lowestfor the year and Steel iiakers have little hope of any earlyimprovement.   Although one blast furnace was blown in on ferroalloys during the month, this was more than counterbalanced by three furnaces going cut of blast, so that the number of blastfurnaces in operation fell during the month from 96 to 94, and production of Fig Iron fell from 415,000 tons to 305,000 tons.Already in December cne furnace at least in tho Midlands has gone an slack blast.     The lack of demand for Pig Iron on tho Continent consequent on the slump in Steel has resulted in tho complete collapse oftho Continental price Syndicates, and Foundry Pig Iron which wasquoted at the beginning of the year  at 67s,6d, per ton f,o,b,Antwerp is now quoted at 50/- and transactions are reported tohave taken place under this figure.    Imports of Pig  Iron haveincreased and after averaging 9,700  tons per month last yearaveraged 22,000 tons per month  in the first quarter of thisyear, 24,500 tons in the third  quarter and rose to 29,700 tons  inOctober,    Imports of Steel and wrought  Iron during Octoberamounted to 234,000 tons.   Steel production in Great Britainamounted to only 440,000 tons In November compared with 512,500tons in October,   November figures  for  imports and exports arenot yet available,-;:- but returns for  the Teas show that exportscf Pig  Iron fell from 2 2,944 tons in October to 12,301 tons inNovember, and manufactures of Steel  from 40,724 tons  to* November returns for iron and steel and manufactures thereof    shev/ for imports a decline from 264,400 tons (October) to    209,769 tons (November) and for exports from 264,370 tons    (October) to 203,919 tons (November),
1 E 3Jl  0 -35,117 tons.   Imports of Pig Iron and Steel into the Tees,however, were also lower in November than in October,     A report from the North East Coast states that the tonnageon the order books at the end of November shows a considerable reduction and that acute depression continues without sign of recovery.   The demand from the Motor industry remains at a low level and shipbuilders and constructional engineers are short ofwork.   Constructional engineers are obtaining small contractsbut the tonnage involved is only trifling and hardly sufficientto replace work that is being completed.   Locomotive engineeringconcerns complain of lack of orders and have considerabledifficulty in keeping their works employed.     A report from Scotland states that many furnaces have ceasedoperations until a resumption is made after the New Year holidayperiod.   Mills are to a great extent working up stock material of which there appears to be sufficient to meet all expectedrequirements until the end of the year0   Orders are no more plentiful and as a result of the merger between Messrs., DavidColville and Sons Limited and Messrs, James Dunlop and CompanyLimited, which comes into operation as from 1st January next, theCalderbank Works of the latter mentioned firm have alreadyceased operations so that the better equipped mills may have a chance of working a longer week, but even this is not having amarked effect.   Shipbuilding yards and constructional works inthe area are still finding it a difficult matter to obtain furtherbusiness and although strenuous efforts have been made in thisdirection, the results have been almost entirely unsuccessful,although a few small vessels have been placed with one or two ofthe less important yards.   The world position as regards trade generally remains stagnant and until there is a sign of activitycommencing in some quarter, there is not much chance of animprovement in the shipbuilding industry on the Clyde.   Messrs,John Erown and Company Limited, Clydebank, have now officiallycommenced work on the big Cunarder and as their supplies are largely drawn from the steel works in Scotland, this will helpthat district to some extent, but much more is required, moreparticularly as there is every likelihood of the demand fromother sources diminishing rather than otherwise.     The export market shows no sign of reviving and no  contracts ,of substantial tonnage have recently been placed.      It is hoped that Continental prices have touched bottom.The lowest figures for finished and semi-manufactured steel were reached about the middle of November, and there has been a generalrecovery of 5/- to 7/6 per ton since that date.   There is,however, a feeling on the Continent at the moment that these advances are not likely ti? be maintained.   It is believed that alarge tonnage has been bought by merchants and consumers in thiscountry, so that a considerable increase in the import of .eteelmay be expected during the next few months   Ln spite of thepersistent fall in prices on the  Continent since the early summer,most of the countries have been able to maintain their production at a high percentage  of  capacity.
     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP trade: What is the positionof the European steel Cartel now?  I think it is almostbroken up or ineffective for the time being.     MR. WALMSLEY:  It was almost broken up but en Saturday-last a tentative arrangement v/as made to keep it in beingfor a few months longer.  It is not quite clear whetherthey have extended it to the 31st March or the 30th June,but I believe to the 30th June on a slightly modified basis.Of course that Cartel dees not regulate prices, it onlyregulates output and arranges certain fines and bonusesfor under production and over-production, as the case may bej  all the prioe syndicates have disappeared entirely.They  are  all fighting free prices.   It was impossible toconsider even reviving the price syndicates until the rev/as some certainty regarding the Cartel, because all theprice syndicates hinge on the Cartel, and now the Cartel hasbeen provisionally renewed there is the possibility that someof the price syndicates will come to life again.  I hopethat may be so.     PRESIDENT OP TH2 BOARD OP TRADE:  With the subsidieswhich they are obtaining now I find it very difficult tounderstand in view of the gap between the Continental andthe British prices why they do not sell at a price nearer atall events to the British price, because one would assume that if they keep the market here they need not unload at such very low prices.     MR. WALMSLEY:  That is a very natural question, and Iam afraid the only answer is because they are foolstf  Honestlythat is the only answer to the question.  Before the war when I was in very close touch with the German market for aperiod of many years it was entirely handled by the StaalwerksVerband and at that time the Staalwerks Verband was more powerful cn the Continent in relation to their people thanit is today.    I suppose the alteration in the steel productionfigures arising from the war which has put Prance in a stronger position than she was has tended to diminish the influence of the Verbandc  Before the war you may say that Continentalprices for all except the poorest quality were ruled by that organisation,; and they did in those days maintain their prices at levels very much nearer to the British prices.  They hadthe sense to do that.  In other countries they are not sufficiently united to take that sensible course with theresult that we saw this price of  2 or more below our price,simply because they had not got their organisation sufficientlytied up to enable them to get the best results from their trade in this country.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  Attention was directed to the influence of the subsidies they enjoy,possibly at Government expense, and it was pointed out thstin view of the drop in prices and increase of financial difficulties in Germany especially things were ratherdifficult, and that element might be removed in the nearfuture.  Well, that was the one faotor that was so farholding prices, but you have given the only reply that Ithink one could offer as regards the reason for it.  I have asked again and again and I cannot find out why theycontinue to do that at such margins.
     SIR WALTER RAINS:   The same applies to Polish coal,but the answer to that is that their charges are 17/- aton free at the works or on truck to the home  consumer,so that together with the cheap  railway carriage whichamounts to a subsidy, they are able to quote ll/3dc f,o.b.to the State railways, whereas our price was 14/6d.     PRESIDENT 05&apos; THIS BOARD OF TRADE:  It is a verydifficult situation.   Is it not also linked up with adefinite policy for  improving one of their important jjorts?     SIR WALTER RAJNE:  I quite  agree, and I also  agree  with your remarks that there is no earthly reason why theseprices should not meet each other rather than  be ll/3d.  asagainst 14/6d.     PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  I am sorrygentlemen, that I have to go to  a Cabinet meeting  now, butI should like to thank you very  much for the continuedassistance you give us in the Advisory Council.             (Mr. Gillett then took the Chair).                    CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.     MR.  VARLEY:  In cash values our trade is  down by7.8)o as compared with a year ago, and yet in some  directionsour sales are increased in quantity.   Por instance- ourflour trade is up 7* 5?o in volume;  milling offals  12*55$,margarine 16.5$, lard 5.6&apos;fo*   As far as the prices areconcerned sugar has gone down in the twelve months,^wholesale price 15.48$, and in retail prices 15.39$.  Butterwholesale, 25.365o down and retail 24fb.   Plour, 31.17fS downwholesale and retail 24.14?o.   Bacon has gone  dov/n, vholesale22.91 and retail 26.32.   There  has been a slight  increaseof 8.93;o in the wholesale price  of lard but the retail price remains the same.   Cheese is 25c63?:i down wholesale,and 22-22$o down retail.   In butter there is a differencebetween the Danish and Australian prices that  I mentionedlast month.   Danish is very dear.   Danish is down by65/Sd.  since twelve months ago,  Swedish by 6l/6d* , Finnish by64/-, Hew Zealand by 69/- and Australian by 71/-.     As far as sugar is concerned the conflicting  reportsabout the Cuban negotiations which I mentioned a month ago*appear to be the cause of a period of weakness in  the priceof sugar.   It seems definite now that the 1-g-  million tonswill be removed temporarily irom the market.   The Committeeappointed to negotiate crop restrictions with  European andJavanese representatives is now  in Amsterdam and started work on Saturday 29th ultimo.    On Monday the  1st  instantthe market opened firmer and the old established refiners,as distinct from the home grown  factories, advanced their prices 3d. per cwt.   The future trend is uncertain until some definite news comes from Amsterdam,*See Report of Proceedings for November, p.6.
     There is nothing -unusual in the tea and coffee  trade.In bacon and hams the Danish killings continue to operate on an enormous and unprecedented scale - the record  of133,000 killings being reached last week, and the average for past few months totalling 125,000 per week as against40,000 in 1913-1914,  and bacon prices, it is assumed,  havenow reached the lowest level recorded since pre-war  times.The trade in general in fact is experiencing considerabledifficulty in clearing supplies and some cuts are being offered at prices which constitute a record low level.     I come on now to wheat.   During the last four  weeksprices have varied considerably, but in the end all  marketsare  on a lower basis.   In Canada at last the situation inthe world wheat market is being realised.   The holdingpolicy has proved to be a mistake, and although our  advice on the recent deputation did not please everybody, we werethe Pool&apos;s best friend in advising them to get on sellingall the wheat they possibly could.   Our principal wheatbuyer has been over in Canada in recent months investigating the whole problem of wheat in the States and principallyin Canada.   In the United States of America the Farm board by supporting the futures market has kept prices higher thanthose prevailing in Canada, and it would appear thatartificial means are being employed to keep the price ofwheat in America above the world parity,   President Hooverindicated that this would be the policy  so that we wereforewarned of what  was going to happen.     As far asRussia is concerned they continue to  sell wheat  freely and large quantities are  stored in  the various grain ports ofEurope unsold.   These stocks will keep  the market in checkand prevent any serious advance for some time.   Australiais harvesting very good crops,  and greatly alarmed at thelow prices now prevailing.   Government  do not seem to beable to devise a scheme to improve matters for the farmer,and we expect the wheat will have to  be  sold.   Por the timebeing the price is the highest  among  export wheats.    india are as much disturbed about the low prices as anybody else,and her wheat surplus will have to be exported under world conditions.   In the Argentine  great  efforts are being madeto  assure the world  that the crop was heavily damaged.  TheGovernment threatened with deportation any who did not support them on their rust reports.   The truth  is nowemerging, and good crops are being harvested.    In spite ofall efforts  to hold the wheat back it will have  to be soldand shipments must increase.    There  is  a good supply of maize at prices slightly better than  a month ago.   There isa  curious thing in the milling  of offals.   I mentionedsome months ago the low price and now we find, and the millers generally? the price of offal.is now  quite good andthere is not much difference between  the price of the offalof wheat and wheat itself.     In the general grades of drapery and woollens and readymades there  is a great slackness.   Travellers are at themoment  ont s*.road with the new  season1 s  samples, and  theorders  received up to the  present  show  a falling off  ascompared with  those placed for  the  corresponding period oflast year.   Present  demands  are  for  the cheapest class ofgoods.     The Co-operative Societies have  exported  during  the past month  to  the U.S.S.R. goods  to  the  value of  69,693.   Asto grain  that  has been imported from  Russia  the  total amount
of contracts entered into by the Russians from the 1stJuly up to 1st December is 936,878 tons of which 698,000has been wheat.     MR. &quot;WALKER:  How does that compare with a year ago.     MR. VARLEY:  There was no  irheat from Russia lastyear because they had a bad crop, but in 1926 they had agood crop and  then they exported.     MR. WALKER:  They say Russia is starving and yet theyare sending wheat over here.     MR. VARLEY:  I have not been in Russia, but mycolleagues who have been in Russia do not confirm what isin the newspapers.     MR. PUGH.   Hoy; does that compare with pre-war in quantity?     MR. VARLEY:  In pre-war days the quantity was many times what it is today.     MR. CAIRNS:  I was in Russia during last summer and I found that some classes were not being allowed supplies offood.   People who had ration cards did not do badly butgreat distinctions were made between classes.   Things were very very dear.   Butter was 12/- a lb. but as I say peopleworking in factories v/ere all right.               OP-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR. CAIRNS:  Our accounting period for the second halfof the year ended last month, and shows a reduction of practically 6 per cent in sales.   The decrease is even greater in the value of our factory productions, which amounted to  2,707,311 &quot;or 10.6 per cent, less than for thecorresponding period of last year.     Some primary articles *f food, notably sugar, butter,hams, while they show a smaller trade when expressed in money values, show greater weights when quantity is taken as the term of measurement.     Flour, on the other hand, shows a decrease under bothcategories, and it is curious to observe how, under thesensational fall in price that has taken place during theyear, the demand for flour has not been in any degreestimulated by a reduction in the price.   Either the fallin price has not been sufficiently passed on to the consumer,or there is a surprising want of elasticity in the demandfor flour, when, with this fall in prices, the consumptionof bread has become less.    Probably this reason ought to be supplemented by the remark that while the sales of plainbread are almost everywhere showing a downward tendency, the sales of fancy bread in the form of biscuits, cakes andpastry are moving upward.     During the last month or two while the quantity of butter sold has been greater than it was a year ago, thedemand has been relatively less for Danish, and more for colonial.   Though the price of Danish touched, in November,the lowest point for that month in any year since 1909,Colonial is obtaining the more increased sale of the two,as it is the better value.
The comparative prices are:-DanishNev ZealandA o o o o o a U Cf8/18/80,  132/-  112/-2/12/89, 195/6da 178/-Helped &quot;by the prohibitive duty which has been imposed uoonbutter imported into the Irish Free btste, the end of the butter-making season in that country has produced a completecessation of exports.  Evidently the amount of butter incold store, together with the trifling amount of the currentmake is deemed both neceaoary and sufficient for home wantsat this season,  The Nev Zealand butter which has hithertofound a marlcet in the Irish Free fctate during winter, and hasnow been excluded, will doubtless have found its way into our market, and be increasing the copious supply here.     During the past month, the sugar market has beenirregular, though taken as a whole, there hes been verylittle change in price.  Foreign granulated is still b/9d.per cwt, cheaper than a year ago,     &quot;With the supply diminishing, home eggs advanced sharplyin price, but the movement -was brief, as with ample colonial and&quot; foreign uupplies available, the demand for the homearticle abated at once.     The recent tcarcity of Irish hams appears now to be overcome, and the quantities offered are sufficient to meetnormal requirements.  The average price is 15/- per cwt,,lower than it was a year ago.     Our bacon Factory in Ayrshire it finding pigs more plentiful and easier in price than they were, and Ayrshirebacon is now l/ld. per lb, as compared with 1/4a, at the  sametime last year.     At the farm, the prices for the top quality of Scotchcheese are 76/- to 78/- per cwt, for Cheddars and 72/- forDunlops,     The season is -hist beginning for New Zealand cheese, andquotations are low.  The opening prices in Glrsgow for thefirst direct shipment were from 60/- to 62/- per cv.t,  Lincethen, the London market has dropped, and the latest quotationsare for coloured 56/- to .59/-, and for white 59/- to 60/-per cvt.  These figures represent a ver  lov level of price,.and if they continue, must have the effect of bringing dormthe prices of home (Scotch) cheese, lot.- as their are meantime.     Oats have been in greater supply, and with theircondition improved, still prices are again lower, owing tothe large quantities of foreign, oatt in the market,  -cotchoatmeal has been reduced in price, but the demand for it remains flat,     A month ago, Rangoon rice was regarded as extremelycheap at 9/6d, per cwt, but again a reduction has taken place,and it is now offered at 8/6d, c.i.f0 Glasgow for January/February shipment.
     Supplies of fish at Abcrd.ee-. have been very goodlately, and our Pish Department there shows a considerable increase of trade for the month.     Owing to the special interest taken in the questionof the Orderly Marketini-. oi farm produce, I have latelyreported monthly on our experience, which i;-. -that of thelargest mil&apos;:&apos;: distributors in the country, of the positionand police of the Scottish Milk Pool.  The peculiar formof competition which resulted from the large withdrawal of farmers from the organisation since let November stillpersists, that is, the Pool has reduced its selling price tolOd. per gallon to distributors, in spite of the highercost of producing Winter mil:c.  Recognising that lOd. per gallon was below the co.jt oi production, we began by paying a normal price of 1/2-^d. per gallon, but finding our tradeslipping &amp;\way under the influence of low priced milk fromthe Pool, we reduced our price to lid. which is &quot;the utmostwe can pay on the basis of the present retail price whichthe Pool has established.  The Pool was originated to help the farmers by securing for them an economic price for milk,but this price cutting has had the opposite effect, and hasintroduced irregularity and disturbance into the marketing of this commodity.     In a former report^ on the trad.e in Brown WrappingPaper, it vae explained that under the operation of theimport duty of 16.2/3 per cent, on this Paper there was aconsiderable transfer oi  business in foreign paper to thatmade in our own mills.   Latterly the price of the foreignarticle, probably owing to the general depression of trade,has been falling lower and lower, and now it it, taxincluded, almost on a par with the price of home made paper.     While the jute factory is running full time, businesshas been very unprofitable during the last 6 months, owingto continued depreciation in the value of the materials that have to be carried as stock.  However, a feeling exists thatthe botto:o. has been touched, and that the industry will nowenter a period of ampler and more satisfactorj? business.     In the Drapery and Furnishing Department s ,the sales forthe last 6 months present a decrease of nearly 5% ascompared with those for the same period last year, but as theaverage fall in values is estimated at 10$g, the reductionin the cash drawn is not entirely ominous.  It is in mining areas that the restriction of business has been most severe,as the idea that a trade disnute might be impending inducedthose c nnected with the mining industry to curtail spending.     MR. GILLETT:  We are glad to welcome Mr. Bostock thismorning.  It is his first meeting.*Minutes for June 16th, 1930.  Page 5.
BOOTS AND SHOES.     MR. BOS TOOK:   Our industry is not at all well servedwith statistics, so that we are not in a position to quotevery much definitely in that way.   The trade generally isdepressed and dull, and, as you know, v/e are a secondaryindustry depending on the general state of trade.     The wage position gives rise to some anxiety.  4&apos;e havehad a very good record in settling cur wages by agreement,now running over 35 years.  Our national conference, which met last month, appointed a sub-Committee which has come toa deadlock.  That National Conference meets again in January,and I hope we shall find some way out of the difficulty.  TheUnion asked for a rise in wages, and the employers would not agree with that and they asked for certain reductions and theooeratives refused to discuss those, so that for the momentwe are at a deadlock.  The agreement runs for 6 months, andI should hope that we shall get over the difficulty.COTTON.     MR. GILLSTTMr. Barlow is also a new comer, and we welcome him also.     MR. BARLOW:  The condition of the cotton industry remainsone of almost unrelieved depression.  The raw cotton marketis approaching a condition of disorganisation.  The egyptian government has considered closing the futures market, andthe position in that respect is at the moment obscure.  Theheavy purchases of the Federal Farm Board in the United Statesexercises a depressing influence and prevent the purchase ofcotton.by merchants because of the artificial character of thefutures market which inhibits hedging operations.  Therehas been some small improvement in demand in lower grade fabricsfor India, but up to now no call for the better qualitieswhich absorb the finer Egyptian yarns.     Price cutting In artificial silk yarns has abruptly stopoeddemand for rayon and mixed cotton and rayon fabrics , but if somestabilisation in prices is effected trade will probably improve.     Great complaint is made by English manufacturers of thelow prices quoted by foreign manufacturers in fine cloths, thatis to say fine rayon cloth, and there is increasing competition in a considerable number of cotton and mixed cotton and linengoods from Holland and Belgium.   It is, however, probable thatthis competition ie partly due to the depression in the textile industries whioh universally exists, and if there were a general trade improvement this competition would diminish.
     Towards the end of the year, there is always a cessation of demand for obvious reasons, but stocks of finished goods throughout the world must now be low, andsubject in general to the effect of world conditions whichaffeot every industry, and in particular to the presentobscure position of the raw material market, there areseme grounds for hoping that there should be an improveddemand for cotton in the New Year.     MR. GTI.T.STT:  Does your information confirm what mr. Lennox lee said about the improvement in China ?     MR. BARLOW:  Yes, there is some improvement in China,but there has been a new fall in silver, and that operatesof course more severely in China than in any other market in the world.    I have not yet heard whether there havebeen as a result any cancellations, but there has undoubtedly been an improvement in China, and especially in fanciesand our better grade goods.     MR. TITT3RINGT0N:  Has Mr. Barlow any informationt-egarding the sending to China from Japan of volumes of artificial silk fabrics?     MR. BARLOW:  The Japanese are increasing in efficiencyevery day and it is only a question of time, I am afraidas far as one can judge from the present situation, whenthey will capture the greater part of that trade.  Not onlythe Japanese, but the Chinese themselves, are now beginning to produce what are known as lOCfj artificial silk fabrics,and if we project our view sufficiently far ahead it seemsto me probable that the competition which will be mostacute in the Far East will not be from Japan but from Chinaitself.HOSIERY.     MR. WALKER:  As regards hosiery, I will put in theusual reports, but it is curious to find how much thereports from the different centres differ.     For. instance, Leicester speak about trade being verydefinitely better, largely due to the seasonable weather,seasonal demand for underwear, and so on, and Nottinghamquite definitely one might almost say, report a good tone.Nottingham report, &quot;The better tone prevailing in thehosiery industry referred to in last month&apos;s Report is still being maintained, and winter underwear with the advent ofmore seasonable weather is selling freely, although thevolume of orders is not so large as one usually expectsat  his time of the year.&quot;  It goes on to speak of hose andouter wear all being reported as fairly good.  On the otherhand, Loughborough, a few miles from Nottingham, say that,&quot;Trade is bad in this district, &quot;worse than last month andworse than e, year ago.  Short time is being worked in mostbranches&quot;.    From hansfieid, which is north of Nottingham,you get again a report that trade is not so good, &quot;Here thestate of trade is no better, and if anything is worse than last month, with the exception of the pure silk trade which is extremely good, though at lower prices.
i. 0 :jEvery other hranoh is dull, though there has been a spurt in the fashioned fancy half-hose trade, but this appears to be principally for the export markets&quot;.  In Hawick trade seems to be rather better, &quot;The slight season improvement in trade which began in October was continued throughout November, and some firms during the latter month were able to do something approaching their November figures of last year.  The milder weather of the past ten days has again had an unfavourable effect and the improvement of November has not been maintained.  Any business which is being placed is at very keen prices.  The prospects are not encouraging and there is still much short time and idle machinery&quot;.      While, therefore, there are fluctuating reports with regard to the hosiery trade generally, I think one can say that &quot;undoubtedly at this time of the year manufacturers do expect to be reasonably busy, and that has given a fillip to trade, but undoubtedly, of course, things are not as good as they were a year ago, and I should think that unemployment and short time are just about double what they were a year ago.      MR.  GILLSTT:  Are these differences in any way due to the different lines of the industry?      MRo  WALKER:  Undoubtedly,  Every district has g4t almost a little speciality of trade to itself.IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH:  My report will, in substance, be a repetition of what you have had from Mr. Walmsley, and as I do not want to quench whatever spark of optimism there may be in theCounoil I will not impose it upon you.  I w ill hand it in, *It goes into some detail.     I would only say that the very low prices at which bars,for example, are now being imported has not had any effect in stimulating the re-rolling trades.  The sheet trade, forexample, is still suffering from depression, and it is nowhaving an effect on the tin plate trade which up to now hasbeen fairly well engaged.     Our latest report is that of 78 works in South wales and Monmouthshire, 31 were idle at the end of November^  Tosome extent that will be due to the stop-week arrangement,so it is possibly net a true reflection, but certainly thetin plate trade is not doing as well as it was.  It is, I suppose, feeling the effect of the general world depression.See appendix Page 63
     SIR  IKNEST GLOVER.  Two months  ago, Russia  practically dominated  the  freight  position  in  shipping wheat and  other grain so  freely.  Apparently they shipped  far too much wheat  at the time, more than they could sell, and not only  forced  the  price down, hut  came under the necessity of  storing  a  lot cf  wheat. ,d3out the middle of November they  tried to make  arrangements with many of the steamers which were homeward bound to use the steamers as  warehouses.  It was only arranged in two or three  cases, but they tried to  do it with practically all the steamers that were homeward bound.  The immediate  result  was  a cessation of chartering from Russia for further shipments - whether  they have chot their bolt or not we do not know  - and after Russia practically retired it  opened the door  for  the  Argentine and Australia to come in,  and during the last  few  weeks there has been very active chartering from the Argentine  for  wheat,  which is rather extraordinary as it is quite  the end of the wheat  season there.     There has also been some renewal  of chartering from Australia and the rates of freight have gone up  slightly.     So far as Canada  and the United States are  concerned, in spite of what Mr.  Varley was saying  about  wheat  in Canada&apos;&quot; it does not show itself in shipments-  We have no  shipments from  the east side of Canada in full cargoes  - of  course it  may come  in parcels - and there have been only one or two  transactions from the other  side of Canada.     I am purposely abbreviating my  report which I will put in.  /&quot;with regard to outward business, the export of coals  remains very lew.  October this year shows one million  tens less than last year, and the consequence is  that rates of freight have fallen outwards, especially to South America, in response to the  demand  for homeward tonnage.   The outward  rates fell at  once as the  homeward rates wentup, and the outward rates are so low now that  many steamers have gone %o the Argentine  in ballast rather than take an  outward freight.     The laid up tonnage remains, I  think,  vory  much  about the eamo in quantity.   A number of steamers which  were laid up have started and gone to the Argentine to load  wheat.    I have not got the 1st November figures.   The information we  get from  nearly all the principal ports in the country is  that  there  are  no furtherlying up berths available, that the Tyne,  the  Tit ear and  the Pal are practically full so far as they can  accommodate  ships for lying  up.     As regards shipbuilding, there  is nothing to report in the  wayof the  placing of orders for tramp tonnage.  The  only things thatone hears  of are two or throe small  ships  for  special coasting orrailway service, no ocean-going steamers at all.    I will put in my statement and the usual statistics,** but I think that gives a synopsis of the shipping position  today.     MR. GILLETT:   I suppose that these orders booked to theArgentine  and Australia are a better factor even  than the tradewith Russia was?     8th URKTSST GLOVER:  Much better.  The longer the  haulage wehave the better we  like it,  because  it takes the   tonnage off themarket  for so much longer. Cf,  page 16.           / See Appendix page 47.See Appendix page 48.        p.SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.                 i- C ;
     MR. GIT.LETT.   What arrangements would the Russians makewhen they asked a ship to keep wheat on board?     SIR ERNEST GLOVER.   Their suggestions generally were topay a ship  10 or  15 a day while she was lying up, with the proviso that she had to be ready to move off to another placeif ordered,, and with a further proviso that if, while she was laid up at this particular port they wanted to discharge partof the cargo at any time, they should be enabled to do so, andthat the owners of the ship should remain responsible for goodcare being taken of the cargo.   Those were the difficulties,really, because that imported further considerations, to do what they wanted you to do you would have to keep your crew onboard, you could not simply pay the  crew off and l^y the shipup because you had to keep the ship available for moving.That was the main reason why, as a ship would be costing about 30 a day, the owners were not very ready to accept  10 a day to do the work.     MR. GIT.LETT.   So there has not been much done?     SIR ERNEST GLOVER.   Only two or three steamers,  I think.When they found that they could not make this arrangement, theyvery often kept  ships waiting a few days at falmouth before deciding, and ordered them to go to Manchester, Hull,  Sunder land,or London to discharge the cargo into store.COLONIAL TRADE.     MR. CLAUSON.   I will put in the usual figures^.   Thereare rather more tables than there were before.    We have aboutas many tables as we can produce now with the information we have.I am afraid they are not very cheerful reading, except that wherethe Empire proportion of imports to total imports is available,which is only In the case of certain territories in Africa,that proportion seems to be going up.   There is a generaldecrease in value, both of exports and imports.   The decreasein value of exports is usually the greater, I am sorry to say.That is what is to be expected, I suppose.     There is a bright spot in the Gold Coast where exports are up and imports down.   That is all the more peculiar, for a reason which I shall explain later.     In Ceylon there is a striking decrease both in imports and exports.   Exports for the nine or ten months of this year forwhich we have figures are down from 24-g million to 19 million,and the imports are down from 23 million to 18 million.     The fact, I think is that our raw materials in theColonies are suffering a change which is really very like thatwhich Is taking place In manufactured products owing to theincrease in the efficiency of manufacture.   The output of the unit is going up.   Of course, it is an old joke to say thatfor the raw material for a lady1s outfit a silk worm working under Trade Union  conditions is now doing the work which twosheep used to do before the War working under sweated labour conditions, but  I  do not think that people realise how much progress has recently been made In producing bigger and bettercrops from the same area.   That is particularly true In our* See Appendix, p.35,
if p r\i t? Jcolonial Empire, and I think in the Dutch colonial Empire.   Allsorts of curious things are happening.   In this country thereis a stud farm for parasites.   Parasites are bred to killearwigs and that sort of thing - quite new developments in theway of dealing with animal pests and crop pests generally which make for bigger crops.   There is an extraordinary development in producing more rubber from the same area.   The Dutch say thatthey can produce - I forget the exact figures, but quantitativelyit is three or four times the same amount of rubber from thesame number of treesj  and we are doing the same kind of thing.The result, of course, is that there is bound to be a genuineover production until there is- some adjustment, and there is anadditional cause in the fact that where some particular group of individuals somewhere has started a new crop and made a very good thing of it, there is a lot of Imitation elsewhere.   Thatis particularly true in citrous fruits, for instance.   Thefirst people who produced grape fruit-and large oranges didvery well out of them, and now a lot more land has gone under that kind of crop and we shall, I am afraid, have over-productionIn that kind of thing,     I might just mention two rather interesting instances.   Incocoa in the Gold Coagt we have something that looks almost like a strike of producers.   They are refusing to sell their  cocoaexcept at a figure which merchants are not prepared to paybecause they cannot.   What will happen I do not quite know,I am told that if you keep cocoa too long it ferments andbecomes intoxicating,   I do not know what will happen In that case.     Mr. Varley mentioned the question of sugar.   There we havea very unsatisfactory state, and there is this  Chadbourne plan for &quot;taking 11^ million tons off the market and  selling it slowlyover the next five years.   That seems to me to be like a pillto cure an earthquake, because the effect will be to keep upprices, and that will keep up production^ and the sugar industry will continue in difficulties even longer than  it would otherwise,I am afraid.   Of course, sugar is in a very peculiar position,because It is not like wheat and those kinds of commodities whichare produced because there is nothing else to produce in  thoseparticular areas.   There are a lot of countries - and I am afraid that our own is one - where sugar is being produced underuneconomic conditions, for reasons which have no connexion with trade at all, and until some of the uneconomic  producers  can beshaken out I am afraid things will be very bad.     MR. GILLETT.   Do you see any solution to &quot;this  cocoadifficulty?     MR. GLAUS ON,   I think probably a certain  amount of thestock will go bad and the growers will have to  sell  it for whatthey can get.     MR. GILLETT:   Will the supplies from other parts of theworld be sufficient for the time being?     MR. CLAUSON,   I am afraid they may be,    I imagine  it isvery much the same everywhere..    I think that French West africa is probably in the same difficulty.   We  can always get a salefor Trinidad cocoa because it is the best,     MR. VARLEY,   Nigeria are producing an increasing quantity?     MR. CLAUSON,   Yes,   That is another example of what  I mentioned, one set of producers doing very well and promotingimitation in other areas.
     MR, GJT.iT.RTT.   The cocoa is grown by natives, Is it not andnot by European Companies?     MR, CLAUSON.   In the Gold Coast it Is entirely the nativefarmer.     MR. GIIJuETT,   If he chose he could just give up cultivating?     MR. CLAUSON.   Yes.   It will mean that we shall sell themfewer bicycles, and cloths and gramophones, and that kind ofthinge   It is a very unsatisfactory position.INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY.   I have a very short report to give today.This is the time of year when our trade usually begins to look up again, from November or December, but unfortunately  I have not mytrade figures for November yet, and so I  cannot point to any eventemporary rise.     The fall in trade over the past year amounted to 30 per cent.In total values, In harmony with tho fall In prices  over the sameperiod^   Our index number of general wholesale prices In  Calcuttawas 141 in 1929 as compared with 100 pre-war,  and It is now about111 - a fall of about 30 per cent.     I have a few miscellaneous items which may be of interest.Mr. Varley mentioned the wheat crop In India.   We have been rather short in our wheat crops during the last year or two.We have had on occasion to import in order to  make good a deficiency.   This year we shall have a surplus, and theGovernment of India have decided to reduce railway freights inorder to facilitate the export of the surplus.   That  concessionis to extend to February of next year in  the hope of clearing of four surplus crop,   Our normal production is about 10 million tons, and about 9 million tons are  consumed locally.     I cannot say that there is any particular improvement at themoment in tea and coffee.   One development which may be  ofinterest is that we are hoping to be able to induce  distributorsto sell straight Indian teas and coffees, and  so take advantage  ofthe movs in favour of Empire buying.     One healthy line of trade with us at present is the  raw cotton export trade, for our cotton is moving  off fairly well.Of course a great deal depends on the margin between our  cotton prices and the American cotton prices.    In August the marginwas 3.17 pence - just over 3d,,  in September  it was just  under -gd.;  in November lfd.j  and today the margin Is between 1-gd,and lfd.   That means that our  cotton prices are not falling as rapidly as the American prices are falling and the drag  isprobably due to the&quot;fact that the overseas demand for  our  cottonseems to be pretty well maintained.    In  that  connexion  it is  ofinterest to note that today&apos;s margin of 1.68d.  is practically thesame as it was pre-war, l,65d.    In these quotations I am givingthroughout No. 1 firae Conrah, a single grade of  Indian  cotton. In 1913/14 the average price of American  middling was  7^d, and
17ithe average price of cotton No. 1 fine Oomrah, was 5.62d. a difference of 1.63d,   The difference today is between 5.63d. for american, and 3.95d. for Indian.   So that although the margin isthe same prices have fallen very much below the 1913/14 averagepri ce .     Ml. GILL3TT,   Have you any idea whether more business in cotton piece goods is being done without having the actualfigures?   I think it has already been stated that more business was being done between this country and Calcutta.     MR. LINDSAY.   There has been a slight recovery,   I wasreferring more particularly to the fact that stocks seem to bevery low indeed in many of the chief centres in India, though not In all.   On the Bombay side&apos;the progress has not been so great as it has been in Madras and Calcutta.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER.   Is it not true that, in spite of Indiahaving exportable wheat, she is also still importing some wheat from Australia?  Whether that Is owing to wheat being wanted Inother districts of  India than the wheat-growing districts, I donot know.     MR. LINDSAY.   I think those imports are the result offorward transactions entered into last year chiefly byspeculators.   The  imports are very much reduced.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR RALPH WEDGWOOD&quot;.   I have not much to report, and what Ihave is not very cheeringe   Where the tendencies of traffic arenot downwards they are tendencies susceptible to ratherunsatisfactory explanation.     Taking railway receipts as a whole, the month of Novembershows that we have lost a good part of the improvement that we saw in the month of October.   If I may give the figures for railway traffics as a whole, we were down 9j per cent, in themonth of September, as compared with the previous year.   InOctober we were down 6-f- per cent, which is so far an improvement,but for the month of November we are down again 7 per cent.In so far as the month of November comes near to the month ofOctober in the decline, that is largely due to coal and coke.Coal and coke have shown in the three months a steady recovery.They were down by 9 per cent, in September, 6 per cent, inOctober, and 3i per cent, in the month of November, so thatthere has been a steady improvement as compared with last year,though the tonnage will still be below last year&apos;s tonnage.   Themain reason for the improvement, at any rate in the month ofNovember, has been merely the anticipation of a strike, merchantshave been laying in stocks and consumers have been increasing their stocks for the same reason.   It is to be feared that thenext few months will show a worse tendency as far as coal isconcerned.     In merchandise, which covers everything except coal and coke, the position is that the slight improvement in October has failed, and we are now in much the same position as compared withlast year as we were in the month of September.   In September the decrease was llf per cent., in October 9f per  cent. - In each  casebelow last year   and now in November we are 11% per cent, belowlast year.   That decline is mainly in the heavier classes of
goods, as is indicated by the  fact that while  the  receipts  areonly down ll  per cent, for the month of November, the  actualtonnages are down 22 per cent.   That confirms what Mr. WaLmsloysaid at an earlier stage about the very depressed  condition ofthe heavier industries.   In fact, to take one area, In thesaddlesbrough dlstri-ot our forwardings of recent weeks  havebeen down between 30 and 40 per cent, as compared  with  last year.     One satisfactory feature  in the merchandise,  which coversall classes of goods - again I am afraid it is rather a precarious situation - is in regard to sugar beet.   So far as england is concerned we are getting a record year  for sugar&apos;beet.   I am not sure what subsidy is paid to that industry,but I believe it undergoes its second stage of reduction at a fairly early date, and it is Impossible to say what the resultof that further reduction will be.   It is interesting  to know that the sugar beet industry,  so far as England is concerned,is flourishing, to the extent  that we are having a heavier year than every before.   In Scotland, it has fallen very flatindeed, and the factories that were put up for dealing  withsugar beet are now very largely being turned on to refiningimported raw sugar.     As to employment, the railway shops are now to the extentof about 80 per cent, on short time, that is working five days a week only.   Employment in the other grades of the railwaysis also down in sympathy with the general decline in business.To what extent employment is reduced it is difficult to say,but it Is probably about 5 per cent, as compared with last year.(The proceedings terminated).
RUBBER,     SIR GEORGE BEHARREL sent the foil owing report.     Shorts, Gooos.  The position it much the same as lastreported&quot;except that the demand is turning towards the loweroriced articles.     Tyres,&apos;  The  conditions in the Home Market are standing.up very &quot;veil.  There has &quot;been a blight improvement with first equipment business although the figures are below those of last year.  In the Home Market the Replacementbusiness has been fairly maintained due in some measure tousers postponing  the purchase of new cars and maintaining their old cars.     The Export Market generally is depressed and trading conditions in India are particular^ difficult.  The exports from Great Britain are, however, more&apos;than holding their ownwith those from other producing countries.     Boots and Shoes.  Home Market,  The demand f or winterfootwear is good.

                    BOOTS AND SHOES,     MRe  BOSTOCK handed in the following report:-     Trade generally oontinues dull.   The report in the  TimesTrade and Engineering Supplement for December 6 from theirNorthampton correspondent sums up the position very fairly -        &quot;In the middle of the &quot;between seasons&quot;period when   orders are always difficult to obtain, business continues   very much on the lines of recent weeks,,  It would scarcely   be accurate to say that trade has declined;  on the other   hand,  there is certainly no improvement.   Most of the   business is to satisfy immediate requirements, orders being   for small consignments and for practically immediate   delivery, a circumstance which suggests that there is good   foundation for the belief that retailers are working  on   minimum stocks.  Spring orders are not arriving in the   volume desired, and while there is some activity in women&apos;s   fashion footwear, there are few firms which can view  the   L-situation without concern,        A few firms catering for a special class of trade, are   working to capacity, but factors and retailers are   generally disinclined to look ahead, and the consequence   is that bulk orders are movinp very slowly.  In the fashion   trade the doubt that always exists about the line which will   be popular is  still a potent factor, and until what  appears   to be a safe lead is given business will remain light.  The  *   men&apos;s section is still sluggish.  Buyers are putting up   price proposals which manufacturers cannot entertain if they   are to obtain a fair return on the goods they produce, but   the tendency of the day is to place price first, and until   there is a general trade revival which will enable buyers   to think less of cost and more of quality than some of them   are doing at present Northampton is certain to suffer.        In the country centres a number of firms have   experienced a slackening in demand during the last seven   days,  A fortunate few are having to work overtime, but   there does not seem any doubt that the country manufacturers,   taken as a whole, are not maintaining recent standards of   production,&quot;     What is  said about Northampton applies to the rest of thecountry, subject to the reservation that here and thereindividual firms are better supplied with orders than their competitors.     The National Conference, which met  in November, appointed a  oub-Committee of eleven members on each side to furtherconsider the matter and report to their  respective organisations.     The bub-Committees after two meetings, broke up, as theemployers were unable  to accept the operatives&apos; proposals lora  reduction in the number of working hours, while the operatives refused to discuss the employers&apos; proposals forreduced wages.     The situation is  not without anxiety, but in view of thepast record of the industry it is to be  hoped that when theNational Conference meets again in January some way out of thedifficulty will be  found.     The agreement regulating wages continues until terminatedby six months1 notice  given on either side.
DISTRIBUTING TRADE.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE sent the following report.     I am putting in two tables,  one showing percentagevariations in Sales and Stocks for October,  as comparedwith the corresponding month last year,  and  the othershowing variations in Sales for the third quarter of  thefinancial year, namely, August, September and October,as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1929.     It will be observed that for October, Sales were downby 4.4% for Great Britain as a whole,  while  the reductionfor the quarter was no more than 3.3^&apos;     The Explanatory Report published in the Board of TradeJournal on these figures, brought out the important factorthat, having regard to the fall in the cost  of living bysome    during the intervening period, the figures could  beregarded as by no means unsatisfactory under the circumstances.     In Germany, it may be interesting to point out,  turnoverduring the third quarter, July, August and September, fellby IX.6% as compared with 1929, after having fallen 8&quot;. duringthe first half-year.   I noticed from Mr, Varley&apos;s remarksat the last Meeting, that the Co-operative Societies werealse down some 8fo in their October figures.   It is clear,therefore, that retail trade all over the world is finding it very difficult, in the light of falling prices, to maintainlast year&apos;s turnover, although in the case of this countryevidence is accumulating every day that a larger number of transactions are being handled but owing to  the fall inprices the cash volume is lower than last year.     So far as November is concerned,  the completed figures are not yet to hand., but it is unlikely that the report willmake any better showing than for October. Conditionsthroughout the month have been very difficult, and havebeen made more so by the renewed break in prices,  especiallyin the case of foodstuffs.  In many cases these are now downto pre-war level, and in other commodities the sameinfluences are operating.  The preliminary figures suggestthat the fall in turnover will be at least ifo for thecountry, but it is again significant that the London results are worse than those for the rest of the country.

CLAYTON handed In the following report:-     As the present will be the last meeting of the year,it may be useful to deal very briefly with the position inthe chemical industry during 1930.    A year ago, it was stated that, in the absence of a saheme for the collectionof production data over the whole of the chemical industry*an exact view of the relative position could not be made.and on this occasion we shall have to content ourselvesagain with the Board of Trade indox of production; for 19S8this, for the chemical industry was given as 110.3; in1929 it was 115.8.  Fdr the first three quarters of thecurrent year, the oorresponding figures are 104*9, 101.3and 106.7, all noticeably lower than those-for 1968 or1929.  It may be that the figure of 106.7 for the Septemberquarter of 1930 $ being higher than that of 101.3 for the june quarter, indicates a true improvement * but on the otherhand the employment figures have not moved in sympathy.In faot, the figure of 15,344 unemployed in the ohemioalindustry at October 31st 1930 represents 14.9* of thetotal insurable employees in the industry, ag compared with6.8?c at the end of 1929.   Strict comparison between theseproduction and employment data must, however, be avoided asunfortunately, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labourdo not cover exactly the same ground in their &quot;chemioalindustry&quot; groups.     Overseas trade data, as the Board will know quite well,are also disappointing ii regard to the chemical industry.Without quoting the actual values, it Is sufficient to saythat exports will be about 12$ leSB than for 1929, judgingby the data available for the first eleven months of the year,while imports can be oxpeoted to shew a 1758 reduction.   There-export figures shew a slight  inorease, and not havingmoved in sympathy with the rest of the overseas trade would at first eight appear to indioate that this country has suffered particularly as compared with others,  in regardto the two first groups - i.e. Imports and Exports.                 SHIPPING AND SHIPBUILDING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER handed in the following report:-     Once more Russian activities have had an effect on the chartering position and some market changes have taken place.It appears that Russia overshipped grain with the consequencethat cargoes were kept waiting at ports of call to find adestination and in many oases had to be stored.  It looks as though further shipments of grain were not likely to takeplace for some time.  The result of Russia practicallydisappearing from the grain market has prompted &quot;business fromthe Argentine and Australia.   The Index number of freightshas risen to 86 or 14 pwints below the 1913 figure, whiohshows an improvement of 8 points in the month.     Black Sea,  $wing to the cessation of the Russian businesschartering for some weeks has been practically at a standatill*
-f p, J10&apos; 6     South America.   General market outwards.  There is no definite improvement though manufacturers are talcing a more hopeful view of prospects and it is thought that theforthcoming British Trade Exhibition has stimulated enquiriesfor fine goods,     Homewards.  There has been a keen demand for earlytonnage with less urgent enquiry stretching into January/February.       For immediate loading some steamers, havingfair outward freights, may possibly make voyages showing someprofit.  The demand for early tonnage has however had to besatisfied by steamers going out from this country in ballastat figures which probably show a loss very much like the costof lying up,     Hast.  General cargo outwards.  xt has been a quietmonth but merchants here are also taking a more hopeful viewthough there is not much evidence of business materialisingyet.   The boycott still exists and is of course prejudicial to shipments.     Homewards.    Owing to steamers being laid up and theabsence of outward business there has been a very distinctscarcity of tonnage for homeward employment and there has beenin consequence some advance in rates,     East Africa.  There is nothing special to report inoutward business though hopes are entertained that the loanwhich ha3 been floated in London, will give an impetus to the outward trade.   There are expectations of larger maizeshipments during the neat few months.     Australia.   The same scarcity of Tonnage which exists inIndia is apparent in this market.  There is practically no outwardbusiness available for tramp ships to Austran.ia and the necessityfor attracting tonnage to go in ballast has advanced rates byabout half a crown per ten.     Canada &amp; United states of America.   Business has notdeveloped beyond a few isolated o aerations from the Vancouverdistrict.     Cuba.  Sugar remains a dead letter.     Outward Coal Freights.,  There is very little change toreport.  Rates to the Mediterranean were pushed down too farand have had a slight reaction.  No business seems to be possibleto the East.  ^ates towards Couth America have fallen as a resultof homeward improvement and are just slightly above ballastparity.     Shipbuilding.  There are still no orders for tramp steamersto report.  Two or three orders for steamers for railway andcoasting trade have been placed.     Shipment sf Coals.    The October shipments were ratherbetter than September but more than a million less than October1929.     Laid up Tonnage.     Some of the laid up tonnage of thelarger type has been sent to sea to take advantage of theargentine demand but the amount remaining laid up is so great thatthe principal ports are  refusing to give o&quot;&apos;niers facilities forlaying up more ships as  they consider their ports are full.   ..ithregard to figures, my latest to hand are for the 1st October,which hardly apply to the present position.

MR.  G00DEN0UGH sent the following report: -     During November,  somewhat firmer conditions wereexperienced in the short loan market and, at times, somestringency was in evidence.  Since the distribution onDecember 1st of approximately  50 millions in interest on the5 psr cent. War Loan,  however, supplies of credit have beenplentiful.  The outstanding feature of the month has been the steady withdrawal of standard gold from the Bank of england for France, which, in the aggregate, is believed to haveexceeded  8 millions since November 6th.  This development is generally attributed to the desire of the French banks tostrengthen their liquid resources in France, owing to thebanking difficulties experienced in that country and alsoto the inclination on the part of the French public todraw and hold notes at the present time instead of investingin securities.  At the moment, there are no indications ofan early cessation of the French demand for gold.  Frenchbuyers have also secured nearly all the South Africanbar gold which has arrived in London in recent weeks. Early  -in December as a result of the appreciation of the reichsmark,gold was taken from the Bank of England for Germany.Compared with a year ago, however, the Bank of England returnscontinue to disclose a favourable position.  The gold held
1 qf:in the Issue Department on December 3rd amounted to 154.6 millions, against  160.4 millions on November 5thand  133.7 millions on December 4th, 1929, while on the samedates, the percentage of the Reserve in the Banking Departmentto Liabilities was 45.5, 59.4 and 31.8 respectively.  Thisseason of the year is usually characterised by additional demands for currency to finance the Christmas trade and in1929, the Bank of England notes in circulation rose betweenNovember 27th and December 25th by  25.0 millions.  In view ofthe present depression in trade and the fall in prices, itis possible that this year the demand for notes may be lower,but it is noticeable that between November 26th and December3rd, 1930, an expansion in notes in circulation of  8.1millions occurred, against an increase of only  6.5 millions inthe corresponding week of 1929.     The discount market has been under the influence of thegold withdrawals and although rates have fluctuated thequotation for three months&apos; fine Bank bills which, onNovember 1st, was 2 1/16, had risen by December 8th to 2 7/32-2^.     The depressed condition of international trade is reflected in the turnover in foreign exchange which shows aconsiderable decline.     Taken on the whole, sterling has lost ground sincethe beginning of November, but a slight improvement hasoccurred during the past few days.     The French franc remains substantially lower than theexport point for standard gold from the Bank of England,although there have been considerable shipments of gold to France from this country, but the latest quotation of123.66 is appreciably higher than the quotation of 123.51a week ago.     There has not been a great amount of business on theStock Exchange, but the demand for investment stocks has enabled several issues of that description to be brought out with success and the prices of gilt-edged securitiescontinue to keep up.  Home Railway stocks have been flat,especially because of the wages question and the poor trafficreturns and the market in industrial securities he,? beenquiet.     The uncertainties in regard to the future of the 5 percent. &apos;.Yar Loan still dominate the position in the gilt-edgedmarket and there has been a general-expectation that somethingwill be done in the way of a Conversion scheme which, it hasbeen felt, should be of great benefit to the country.     SIR GUYGARNET sent the following report:-     The rates for call money from the date  of  the  last meeting up to the end of November compared with thoseruling previously were distinctly firmer although the discountrate weakened during the latter half of the  month,  fallingfrom 2i  to 278%  or three months Bank Bills, notwithstanding
i C: RJu &apos;J Uthe steady outflow of gold from London to Paris whichnormally should have stiffened the discount rate.   Thepayment of the War Loan dividend on December 1st put anend to any semblance of firmness in the day to day ratefor floating money which fell from 2&amp;S to 1$ as soon as this dividend disbursement had taken effect.   Such moneyhas continued to be easy owing to the large supplytemporarily available, but the bill rate rose to the region of 2^s on the 5th instant although the quotation for money was so low.   The situation in the money market has,during the second half of the period under review, therefore,been the reverse of what it was up to the end of November,i.e. rising rates for money and a falling bill ratefollowed by cheap money and firmer discount rates.     Heavy purchases of Treasury Bills by the home Bankswere responsible for the first mentioned state of affairs and the possibility of shipments of gold to Pariscontinuing for some weeks coupled with the depreciation of sterling in the New York and Berlin lixchanges, togetherwith a cessation of the demand on the part of the banks,have caused the discount rate to harden.   Withdrawals ofgold from the Bank of England for German account have onlyamounted to a few hundred thousand pounds, but shipments to Prance have totalled about  2,000,000 per week duringthe past four weeks, and in addition Paris has secured themajority of the bar gold offered in the open market during that period.    These shipments are mainly due to thewithdrawal of 2&apos;rench balances from London and will continue until they cease to draw on their funds here.   It isunderstood that French banks have made arrangements for shipping gold on the present basis until the end of January.The quotation for sterling in the New York Ex^nange lostground and at one time the possibility of golu shipments to New York was being discussed, but lately the rate hasexhibited a firmer tendency and the talk of gold shipments to that centre has ceased.     The situation outlined above has had its effect in themarket for gilt edged securities, prices for which declinednotwithstanding the disbursement of the V/ar Loan dividend,With the exception of the &quot;gilt edged&quot; market the volumeof business in the Stock Exchange has been small and in thegeneral markets there has been little sign oi interest onthe part of the public.   New Capital issues of a strictlyinvestment character have met with a good reception, themajority of such issues being considerably over-subscribed,but speculative issues have met with a poor response;  inone case the public subscribed for only 4$ of the offer.Technically speaking the Stock Markets in this country arein a much healthier condition than a year ago and practically immune from the possibility of trouble inconnection with other centres.    General business, however,is not expected to revive until there are more definite  signsof an improvement in the trade and industry of the country.                           WOOL.     MR,  HAMILTON sent the following report:-     The slight improvement in the Worsted section of theIndustry, particularly in the Spinning process,  has been
maintained.   The census taken during the first week ofNovember showed a Machinery activity of 70?$, as against 66.7 for the previous month.     On the other hand there has been a decline in the woollen section, the corresponding figures being 67.9ji for November, as against the previous return of 69$.     Taking the Woollen and Worsted trade as a v/hole, therehas been a slight increase in activity, but that this is dueto a better demand for Yarns - probably for export - andnot for cloth, is proved by the returns of loom activity,which, for the first week in November, are as follows:-              Percentage.                        affective.Pull     Short       .

SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR,. HOSE sent the following report:-     The difficulties of the economic situation in Argentinacontinue to find reflection in  the regular official returns ofthe foreign trade of the country.   During the first nine months of the current year, exports from the Republic,exclusive of gold movements, totalled only 482,426,000 pesos.(gold), as compared with 775,006,000 pesos in the correspondingperiod of 1929, a reduction of 292,580,000 pesos.   The totalweight of exports for the period also decreased, from 13,683.000tons in 1929 to 8,076,000 tons in 1930,  a falling off cf5,607,000 tons.     The Argentine Government has undertaken a thorough investigation of the position of the national finances, andthe present Minister of Finance has made a preliminaryannouncement giving an approximate idea of the state of affairs.The Budget for the year 1923 had, with slight alterations,been made operative by previous Governments for each year upto and including 1930,   The Provisional Government, however,is determined to prepare a fresh Budget for 1931 on a :reorganised basis consistent with present conditions.   Thenew Minister of Finance states that there has been discloseda deficit in the national finances which will probably reach a total of 698,000,000 pesos (paper) by the end of 1930, ofwhich 303,000,000 pesos represents administrativeexpenditure - which had steadily increased under the previousregime, despite&apos; the diminution in the national revenue -whilst the balance of 395,000,000 pesos represents expenditureon public works.   The latter should have been met by theemission of bonds, but, in fact, only 40,000,000 pesos (paper)of the latter had been issued, so that the public expenditure under this item had constituted a heavy burden on the funds of
A to Q10 0tho Treasury,   There was also outstanding a sum of 380,000,000pesos (paper) of Treasury Bills which should bo consolidated assoon as possible, and, in all the circumstances, the Ministerclaimod that there was every justification for the drastic plan of retrenchment which the present Governmont has adopted.Briefly, the policy of the new Government is to extinguish the deficit by large reductions In expenditure and better collectionof revenue, to consolidate State Indebtedness by the proceeds ofbond issues, and gradually to utilise Argentina&apos;3 metallicreserves in order to raise, without undue disturbance, the valueof the peso to its normal level.   The Minister of Finance addedthat it was recognised that the Argentine monetary system is inadequate for present-day commercial needs and that thenecessity for the creation of a central banking system wa3 widely recognised, although at the moment other problems were of a morepressing nature,     The latest advices received regarding the crop situation in argentina continue to give promise of a fairly satisfactoryharvesto   The tone of the grain markets abroad, however, isstill unfavourable, and undoubtedly the power of the country to absorb imported goods must remain restricted for some time to come..     In Brazil, pending clarification of the situation as a wholefollowing the revolution, the trade situation continues to be very  -depressed.   Unfortunately, the market for coffee - the chiefexport product of Brazil - has been seriously affected by thedisturbed conditions.   Since the close of the revolution, therehas been some activity in the Santos coffoe market, but the numberof transactions has been small, there having been little interestshown from the principal consuming markets abroad.   The purchaseof export bills continues to be a  monopoly of the Banco doBrasll, although open market transactions in exchange are permitted under certain severe limitations.   Until such exchange restrictions are removed and tho future policy of the CoffeeInstitute is made known, there would appear to be little prospectof any material recovery in the coffee trade.   The ProvisionalGovernment has Issued an announcement that, in view of thesupreme importance of the matter, any modifications of the officialpolicy towards coffee will be carried out only after  carefulinvestigation0    In the meantime, all regulations and measures atpresent in force in the coffee producing States will continue tobe observed.     Owing to the restriction of imports, the balance of Brazilianoverseas merchandise trade continues to be favourable, despite thefalling off  in exports.   The official returns for the first nine months of the current year show that the aggregate value of imports was   42,786,000, against  66,401,000 in the corresponding period of1929, while  experts totalled  53,947,000, against  72,152,000,there being  thus a surplus of exports this year of  11,161,000,against only  5,751,000 in January-September, 1929.     There is little  change to report In the general tradesituation in Chile, which  continues to be affected by world economicconditions,,   Progress  continues to be made towards the proposedconsolidation of the nitrate of soda industry of the Republic into one  economic unit, and  the closing down of some of the oficinashaving high  production  costs has necessarily resulted in umemployment in some directions and tended to slacken the movementof trade    Negotiations to provide for the necessary financing ofthe  Compania de Salitre de Chile, which has become known as&quot;Cogachn; are proceeding in Now York between representatives ofthe  Chilean  Government, Messrs. Guggenheim, American bankers, andother Interests,
     The Chilean Government  has  shown immediate  recognition ofthe effect upon the national economy of the  world-wide  businessdepression, which, as in the case of the other South american countries, is reflected in Chile mainly in a decline In exportsof primary products.   Thus, the Minister of Finance, in a recentstatement dealing with the national accounts for the fiscal year1930, said that the Government,  in its anxiety to keep OrdinaryExpenditure within the limits of Ordinary Revenue, had alreadyconsidered and were applying reductions in public expenditure fOran estimated total of nearly 90,000,000 pesos.   A small deficitis anticipated In the Ordinary Budget for 1930, whilst theestimates for 1931 provide for roductions In both Revenue andExpenditure, and a small net surplus.   The  Government has already taken the precautionary step of  drastically  reducing all publicworks provided for under the Extraordinary Budget, with theexception of those likely to deteriorato by  suspension.     The general eoonomic and commercial situation In Peru isstill unsatisfactory, owing partly to labour difficulties in themining aroas and to political uncertainties.   It is to be noted,however, that the Government of  the Republic has been reconstructedand is not now of an entirely military character, the personnelincluding two civilians, one being the Minister of Finance, whowas previously the President of  the Banco do Reserva del Peru.During Octobor last, the ox change value of Poruvian currencysteadily declined, and, although a partial recovery ensued, thecurrent rate is no better than 15.87-1 solos  to the   sterling,  ascompared with the parity of 12,166.   The lack of confidenceresulting from the suspension of payment by  the Banco del Peru yLondres and the wido fluctuations in the exchange naturally tondstowards further restriction of imports.   In the meantime,considerable interest attaches to any reform proposals which maybe put forward by the Kemmerer  Commission, which, it is understood,will visit Peru towards the close of 1930 or early in 1931,although the outlook for any appreciable recovery in the earlyfuture must be considered obscure.     Afexican conditions continue to be  characterised by economicdepression, which, if anything,  has become accentuated.   Exchangehas weakened within recent months, and unemployment is increasingas a result of the restriction of activities In tho miningIndustries of the Republio.     In  Colombia, the political  situation is satisfactory, andthere are indications of a  slight Improvement in the general commercial situation.   Important legislative proposals are beingconsidered by  Congress, and theso, If approved,  should have afavourable effect upon  the general economic position of thecountry.     The general  commercial situation in Salvador oontinuesquiet, but Improvement  is expected shortly, the  coffee  crop, whichis reported to be satisfactory, being early this year.   business in the  local  coffee market  has been active.    There has been nodevelopment tending to  clarify the political situation, and business generally waits upon the result of the forthcomingPresidential Election.     Business  conditions  in Venezuela are fairly  satisfactory,and  improvement  is anticipated  so  soon  as the  coffee crop begins to  come  forward  for marketing.   General business in Nicaraguafails to show any appreciable improvement.

MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR CYRIL HURCOMB sent the following report:-     The number of motor vehicles (excluding motorcycles)  newly registered in October 1930 was 846 morethan in the corresponding period of 1929.    This increase is made up as under:-                                       Increase C+)     Description cf                       or       Vehicle.

LZiiNNOX L&quot;JE handed in the following report:-     The spot price of Middling American on November 4th.was 6a27d. but since then it has fluctuated between 5.90d.and 6,10d. with no great appearance of strength.    Pull;&apos;&apos;good fair Sakellaridis fell from 10.10d. on November 4th. to.35d.  on November 28th. and the buying of the raw material,in consequence of the weaker tendency, has been conducted with less confidence than was noticeable during the previous month.     A fair amount of enquiry has been received for yarns andcloth,  but business generally has been limited, offers inmany cases being much too low.     So far as bleached goods are concerned reports reflect the conditions ruling in the trade generally.   The improvementin the volume of cloth handled during October was notmaintained during November, and the usual seasonal improvementsexpected at this time of the year are not materialising.     There is little change to report as regards the ds^edgoods section.  The depressing conditions which obtained in previous months continued during November, although the home trade is reported to have maintained its position.     The slight increase in the volume of business which wasnoted in the Calico Printing trade in the last report was notkept up during November.  Some home trade firms,  however,have reported more enquiry towards the end of the monl&apos;.h,  butthe export trade, particularly to the Far Eastern Markets,has been lifeless.
MOTES ON NON-.FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON sent the  following  report:..     Copper:  Little business of consequence has been passinglately, and consumers seem to be buying only against actualorders booked.     Tin;  The enquiry for tin has been about normal in Swansea,Recent rates of production of tin plates, however, are:**                      October.....  60%                      November       50$with little indication of a change up to date.     Lead:  There has been some improvement In demand as far asthe cable makers are concerned, but In other departments freshenquiry is slow and the tendency is for buyers not to enter into further contracts for delivery this year.   Stocks in consumers1Works are about average.     Spelter:  Demand has revived to some extent, and a fairamount of High Grade and Intermediate Grade has been purchased.The galvanising trade, at the same time remains dull, and afurther cut of b/- per ton In the price of galvanised sheets was recently announced.   We hear from Swansea that several firms have orders on hand for about 2 weeks1 work but nothing muchbeyond that.TRADE IN SCOTLAND.MR, MITCHELL sent the following report:^     Coal.   The trade has been dislocated by the Strike of miners during last week on the bringing into force of the NewMines Act.   An arrangement has now been arrived at on the basisof a spread over of 90 hours per fortnight as offered by theCoalowners,     The rates of wages paid in November will be continued for atemporary period until the end of February, provided a specialeffort is made before the end of January to come to an arrangementregarding the future.     The prospects for export are unfavourable as reductions in price are being made in Germany and contracts arc being taken byPoland at very low prices.     The local demand for industrial coal has been very poor butthe demand for house coal was a little better before the strike.     Pig Iron.   The production of Pig Iron in Scotland for october was 2&apos;l,600 as compared with 23,400 for September and58,200 for October 1929,     The production for Great Britain in October Is 10,000 tonsless than for September.
*) 0 0A* 0&apos; *2     m October the imports of Pig Iron Into Scotland were15,730 tons;  of this 9,210 tons were from India.     Pig Iron from India and the Continent is being offered at low prices for next year.     Steel.   The Works are still on short time and some have been entirely closed for periods during the month.   Calderbank SteelWork has been shut down.   The fusion between the Steel Works ofDavid Colville &amp; Sons and James Dunlop &amp; Co0 has been carried through and it is possible that the  Calderbank Steel&apos; Works willnot be re-opened.     The production of Steel for October was 01,700 as  comparedwith 104,800 tons for September 1930 and 151,900 tons for October1929.     The imports continue heavy, but there is a reduction of theimports of steel plates, not under -g-&quot; in thickness, to  2,552 forthe month.     The Imports of Scrap for the country generally shew areduction in October, the exports an increase,   Poland took9,767 tons of tho exports mainly from the Thames and South Coast,     The Import into Scotland for October was 7,471 tons and theexport 213 tons.     The price of Scrap remains about the same but there is verylittle business being done owing to  the lessened production at the steel Works *     The Tube Trade is poor in almost all classes of Tubes andthero has been short time at most of the Works,     There is no improvement in Shipbuilding, and there is generalcomplaint of want of business in all classes of manufactures.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR WILLIAM MORRIS sent the following report:-     Home Market conditions, taken very broadly, are perhapsbetter than might have been anticipated,   With certain exceptions,the demand for the small and medium powered and priced carsappears to be above the level of 1929,   There Is, however, adecided fall in sales of the more expensive rangos of cars, andthis is creating considerable anxiety to the private coach buiider.     Competition in the classes for which a fair demand exists, iskoenor than ever, and it is perfectly evident that production facilities are coneiderably in excess of any immediate demand.This situation, in certain instances, i3 likely to lead to financial difficulties where Banks are limiting credit,     Tho uncertainty of the future in relation to public servicevehicle licenses under the Road Traffic Aot, is one of severalfactors which is restricting purchases of omnibuses and coaches.Both in respect of these types of vehicles and of the heaviertypes of commercial goods vehicles, the demand is below the levelof last year.
     The market for the lighter types up to 30 cwt, capacity is fairly steady - but competition is very keen.     Unemployment figures generally, though not serious, are inexcess of last year, and in relation to what should be a busyseason, afford considerable ground for anxiety, unless conditionsimprove.     The virtual elimination of Australia in the export market is serious.   The last quarter1s returns shew a drop in imports ofno less than 2,000 British vehicles.   The corresponding fall in imports of United States chassis exceeds 15,000,     Stocks of American cars in all oxport markets are still very heavy, and liquidations are general.     New Zealand and South Africa shew signs of promise, but bothmarkets are affected by heavy American stocks, and these arebeing offered, in many instances, at absurd prices.     There is not the slightest doubt that United Statesmanufacturers have grossly over-estimated the potential demandfor motor vehicles in every export market, and although, in thelong run, this may prove to the benefit of Groat Britain, for thetime being it has created an extremely serious position both totheir distributors, and to any remunerative business in Britishvehi cle s,EMPLOYMENT.MR, PHILLIPS sent the following report:-     There was a further increase during October in the numbers unemployed on the Registers of Employment Exchanges.   Except fora slight fluctuation In the middle of the month the increase wascontinuous.   The tctal numbers on the Registero increased by48,959 from 2,237,501 at 27th October to 2,286,460 at 24thNovember.   The numbers wholly unemployed (including casuals)Increased by 109,268 and the number temporarily stopped decreased by 60,309.     This change may have been due, in part, to thereclassification of some of the unemployed in the cotton industryformerly included as temporarily  stopped, who by reason of prolonged unemployment passed into the wholly unemployedcategory.     During the period the number of men on the Registerincreased by 37,898 and the number of women by 13,539, while thenumber of juveniles decreased by 2,478.     In the London, South Eastern and South western Divisionsthe numbers unemployed again increased steadily during the month and these increases were no doubt largely due to seasonal causes.The increase in these Divisions amounted to 39,391     In the Midlands Division there was a net increase of 3,053,in  the North Western Division a net increaso of 2,328 and inScotland an increase of 17,305,   In the North Eastern and WalesDivisions there were n^t decreases of 2,974 and 10,224respectively *
     There was some improvement in the coal mining industry,hut the decrease was entirely in the numbers temporarily stopped,   The numbers unemployed increased, however, in theiron and steel industry, in general engineering and in shipbuilding and ship repairing.   There was a slightimprovement in the cotton industry the numbers unemployedfalling by about 5,500.    There was little change in the woollen textile and motor vehicle industries.     The total number of insured persons in employment at24th November, 1930 is estimated provisionally to be about32;000 less than at 27th October and about 718,200 less thanat 25th November, 1929.

IRON AND STJjBL.r &apos; &apos; y    MR.  PUGH handed in the following re port:-     The depression in the ircn and steel industry hasbecome,  in most districts, more accentuated.   In Scotland itis estimated that there are now 8,000 workers unemployed andthe rest are acutely under-employed.  In South-Vest Wales thereare about six or seven thousand idle.   The only districtsshowing any indication of improvement are Sheffield and certain of the Rolling Mil?.s in Lincolnshire.  .-LS there is no changein the position of the melting shops, manufacturers wouldappear to be using up stocks of ingots.     Pig Iron Trade.  The pig iron trade shows no change,although it is reported that the Midland firms are obtainingmore orders for foundry iron and orders from Denmark and Italyhave somewhat stimulated the 3ast Coast hematite trade.     At the beginning of November only 96 furnaces were inblast out of a full complement of 382,  The following shows the position in eaoh district:-	No. in	TotalDistrict.	Blast.

Steel Trade. The steel smelting section of the industrydoes not improve.  The present position being that in scotland works with 25 furnaces are completely idle, two works not having operated this year, and the rest of the plants are working part time only.   On the North-East Coast two importantworks, the Port Clarence and 3ritannia Works of Messrs Dorman,&quot;Long and Company, are shut down? and the rest working about 50*capacity.   The Bessemer plant at Workington (Cumb.) has closed down since the 18th October, 1930.     In the Sheffield district, 4 plants are completely idle andthe total number of furnaces out of commission is 54 of a fullcomplement of 85.  Of the four plants with 23 furnaces in theLincolnshire area one t with four furnaces, is completely shutdown and the other three have 9 furnaces idle out of a totalof 19,  At the Monkbridge Works, Leeds, their two furnaces areshut down.   In the Midlands four works with twenty furnaceshave eleven idle.  Three of the five works in Monmouthshireare idle, and at the other two 8 furnaces were wording at the
In South Wales 8 werksend of November out of a total of 16.are completely stopped and of a total complement of 98 furnacesin tho area, only 29 are now working.  So far as concerns sixplants situated in Lancashire and Forth Wales, only 8 furnacesare working, four at Hawarden and four at Irlam.Works also is idle.The Barrow     Polling mill plant is in a similar position to that of the melting seotion; about the same proportion of plant is closed down and the rest of the works are providing employment forthe men at an average of about 502 of their normal time.     Imports of steel commodities, as will be seen from thefollowing examples, are still very high as compared with 1913,this is due of course to the cheaper Continental product:           Imports &amp; Comparative Prices of Steel Products.Proriunt                Imports           Lowest Quoted Prices                                               4-/12/30._  1913            ContinentalMthly Av.

It will be appreciated that Continental steel is being sold in this country at even lower figures than those qiioted; forinstance, it is stated that sheet bars can be obtained free ontruck in South Wales at  3.13.6d. as against the quotedContinental figure of  4.13.9d, and the quoted British figureof  5.0.0.Wrought Iron Trade.  The wrought iron trade is in a                   number of works throughout Scotland,                             having been closed for a                             of the e stablishments just                             of capacity.

Continental bar ir*n is being sent to Birmingham  at 5.7.6. per ton, whereas the cheapest iron in the home marketis that of nut and bolt iron at a price of  8.15.0d.  The importsof bar iron, rods and shapes amounted to 14,900 tons in October.     Steel Sheet Trade. The steel sheet trade had, up to 1928,been consistently very well employed;  since then, however, itis in as much a depressed condition as other sections of theindustry.     Of the two important works in Scotland one, consistingof thirteen mills, is completely idle and the other works (10mills) is working about 50?? of oapaoity.  In the North ofEngland four works with thirty six mills have twelve idle andthe others are finding work for about four or five shifts perweek.   Fourteen mills in the Midlands are working at about 75*capacity and four are idle,  In Monmouthshire, one works hasbeen closed down for six months and the others are findingemployment for about half the usual number of operatives at less than half the normal working time.  At the end of Novemberof the total of seventy-one sheet mills in South Wales, onlytwenty-eight were engaged and in North Wales and Lancashire oneworks is closed down and the others, with a total of 89 mills,have 47 idle.     Tinplate Trade. The tinplate trade up to recently has been fairly well engaged and the men have had regular employment, butthe market now appears to be dropping off.  Of the 78 works inSouth Wales and Monmouthshire, 31 were idle at the end of November,but as some of these will be disengaged because of the stop-weekarrangement, the comparison is not quite a true reflection ofthe state of the industry.     Tube Trade.  The tube trade is on a par with the other sections of the industry, inasmuch as less than 50it of normaltime is being worked.    In Scotland, of nine welding furnaces, one is completely idle, while the others are very poorly employed, butthe fitting and socket makers are fairly well engaged.  At theBritish Mannesmann Tube Company&apos;s works at Newport, the menworked only two weeks in November, whilEt the Company&apos;s other works at Landore is idle on account of a dispute, which, however,has now to be arbitrated upsm, and the plant is re-starting ona day-to-day notice pending a decision.  The fitting and sockettrades in the Midlands are working short time,     Sheffield Special Steel Trades.  Crucible steel - Particularsthe number of crucible steel furnaces in existence and at presentoperating are not available, but it is reported that not one-thirdare working to full capacity.     Electric Furnace Practice. -  A slight improvement took placein November, but it is considered that about 60$ of the fulloomplement of furnaces are totally out of commission.     The foregoing gives a brief indication of the deplorablestate of the various sections of the industry, and the Ministryof Labour s percentages of unemployed for November toll theirown tale:-            Pig Iron Manufacture                 34.63            Cteel Melting, Iron Puddling             and Iron and Steel Rolling Mills    41.4$
BNGINSERINGI             MR. ROWLAND sent the following report:-Review of tho current position,     m our usual monthly Abstract (soe Table 1 apponded) will bofound recorded the latest trade and other statistics available,which are those relating to the month of October last.   It maybe said at once that the figures do not reveal any sign efdefinite recovery from the very low level in recent months.There was a very slight improvement in the October foreign tradereturns as a whole compared with those of September, but this mayalmost entirely be explained by the fact that the returns for september were exceptionally poor, whereas October is a longerworking month, and in any caso some slight factor of seasonalrevival must be allowed fer.     Exports of machinery in October amounted to 44,133 tons asagainst 30,300 tons in September, making the total for the tencompleted months of this year 411,130 tons as compared with465,782 tons in 1929.   Export tonnage of iron and steel was alsohigher in October as compared with September, 264,000 as against200,000 tons, but a very ominous fact Is that the imports for thelast two months have actually exceeded the exports.   Theproduction totals of iron and steel were even less than inSeptember, and it is significant that tho number of blast furnacesin operation throughout the country decreased during October from104 to 96, out of a total of approximately 400 blast furnaces inexistence.                  t     As regards the employment situation, October statistics showa further deterioration and reflect statistically the widespreaddiminution of Industrial activity in tho country,,   The unemploymentindex for the engineering industry at the end of October S3 20,6$as against an average of 18.7^ for all trades and industries.   Theindox for the iron and steel&apos;Industry has risen rapidly, and now stands at 40,7%, which is almost equalled by the figure of 40,1$in respect of the shipbuilding trades.     Further valuable statistical evidence of the prevailingIndustrial slump is afforded by the latest compilation and publication by the Board of Trade of the index numbers of national industrial production.   It will be remembered that these indices,which are based on tho year 1924    100), represent a venture whichwas inaugurated by the Board of Trade officials to supply whatfcr long was sorely lacking, namely, a means cf measurement ofproduction.or output in our principal industries.   The totalindex number of production, and the corresponding figures foralmost all the individ^^al industries, show a steady recessionduring the current year.   The index for enginoering and ship-building, taken jointly, fell away very perceptibly in the september quarter, declining to 111*6 after maintaing a relativelystable level (approximately 120) for the preceding twelve months,  xBritish quota of Australian machinery imports.     In view of re cellt political developments, it is of no little importance to ascertain tho relative quota of tho imports OfBritish machinery into Australia,   The accompanying table (No, 2appended) which gives tho main items of imports of machinery into-6 6-
911&amp; A -Australia during the last tv/o completed fiscal years, shows that britain&apos;s share of the total machinery imports from all sourcesdeclined from       in the former year to 47,6fr in the latter.This trend is parallel to the quota represented by Britain in thetotal import trade of all descriptions, where the Britishpercentage fell from 4206 to 39,7   It will be seen that our participation in the Australian market as regards machinery isstill appreciably greater than In respect of total trade, althoughthe decline in 1928/29 was relatively greater in the case ofmachinery.     As regards the individual items of machinery imports, thefigures show that we hold almost a monopoly in the cases ofboilers, cranes, hoists and other lifting machinery;  and electricalcable and wire.   Britain also retains a commanding position withrospect to electrical machinery, boot-making machinery andweighing machinery.   In textile machinery, however, our quota hasshown an alarming drop from 62,2% in 1927/28 to only 42.4JS in1928/29,   Similarly in the case of prime movers, British importshave fallen from 40,6% to 27.9?o of the total importedB   On theother hand, with regard to air and gas compressors our share has risen considerably from 21,4^ to 37,9;i;,     Dairy machinery and agricultural machinery are cases in whichimports from Britain represent only a very small proportion oftho total coming into Australia, and in pumps and in printingmachinery our present quota scarcely exceeds one-third of thetotal in each  09.se.   In these four last-named instances at leastthero should be considerable room for improvement in British-Australian trade.Statistics of Anglo-Russian Trado.     In Table 3 (appended) we have summarised the salientparticulars as extracted from a special table recently published inthe &quot;Board of Trade Journal&quot;, setting out the details of Anglo-Russian reciprocal trade down to the latest available date,    Inview of present conditions, the prompt supply of this available information is much to be  commended.   It will be noted that thevolume and value of trade between Britain and Russia in all categories has been at a much accelerated rate in the current year as  compared with 1928-1929.   Further examination reveals that,as  regards the general totals of imports and exports, the bulk ofthe increase has taken place, in the third quarter of this year.This does not apply, however, to exports of machinery to Russia,which have been evenly spread throughout the year.   But theincrease In the tonnage as  compared with 1929 is very remarkable;exports of prime movers, for instance, for the ten months ended october 31st  amount to 1,973 tons as against 956 tons in thecorresponding period of 1929, and exports of textile machineryamount to 7,627 tons as against 5,699 tons.     Attached will be found the usual notes of recent importantengineering contracts placed with British firms.

H0SI3RY.     MR. vAALKER handed in the following Statement:-     Leicester.   Host Ladies&apos; Outerwear departments have been on full production for the past month.   Underwear, Knickers,and Jersey departments have also been  fairly good, except thatthere is a tendency to buy lower priced articles, which reflectsitself in lower turnover.   The improvement is probably due tothe demand for seasonable goods.     Nottingham,   The better tone prevailing in  the HosieryIndustry referred to in last month&apos;s report, is still being maintained and winter underwear, with  the advent  of moreseasonable weather, is selling freely, altnough the volume oforders is not so large as one usually  expects at  this time ofthe year.     Business in Cashmere Hose is fairly active, whilstArtificial Silk hose is only moderate;  the full  fashioned silkhose trade continues good-     The Outerwear trade is now shewing signs of  increasingactivity and orders are beginning to  come in with a fair amountcf freedom.     A certain amount of reluctance is being shewn in placing orders for Spring delivery owing to the fluctuations which have occurred in raw material prices during the past week.   Never-theless, manufacturers  are shewing considerable enterprise andin an endeavour to meet the keen foreign competition in cottonunderwear, have produced some wonderful lines which for noveltyand attractiveness should incite the  public to buy British madeunder7/ear.     Bathing -costumes are shewing well and a considerable amountof business for forward delivery is being received.     In  the Shipping trade,  a decided improvement  is being experienced in some directions, but in others remains sub-normal.     Loughborough.   Trade  is bad in  this district, worse than last month and worse than a year ago.   Short time  is beingworked  in most branches.     Mansfield,   Here,  the  state or  trade is no  better and  if anything is worse  than  last month,  -  with the exception of thePure Silk  trade, which  is extremely good, though  at lower prices.
fj 1 5     Every other branch is dull,  though there has been a spurtin the fashioned fancy half-hose trade, but this appears to beprincipally for the export markets *     Hawick.   The slight seasonal improvement in trade which began in October v/as continued throughout November,  and some firmsduring the latter month were able to do something approachingtheir November figures of last year..     The milder weather of the -gs.st ten days has again had an unfavourable effect and the improvement of November has not been maintained.     Any business which is being placed is at very keen prices.The prospects are not encouraging and there is still much short time and idle machinery.
