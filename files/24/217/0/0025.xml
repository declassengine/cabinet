Electors have from time to time taken the view  thatthe problem can be solved by the provision of additionalpolling stations on their own or neighbouring islands, andhave frequently na&amp;e representations to the Lord Advocate.under section 31 (2) as read v/ith section 43 (17) of the representation of the People Act, 1918, requesting him to review the decision of the Returning Officer not to  grantsuch stations.   Returning Officers and the Lord Advocatehave, however, adhered to the principle that polling stationscan only be granted in islandF  PO situated ai;&apos; to make itreasonably/
reasonably oertain that ballot boxes and PresidingOfficers can reach them on the day appointed for the poll,   It has been thought undesirable to incur thorisk of nullifying an election for an entire divisionby providing a polling station in an island whichweather conditions might render completely inaccessibleon the day of the poll.     The general problem has been considered inconsultation with Returning Officers - both in dividual 3. yand collectively;  and it hap been agreed that asatisfactox^y solution can only &quot;be reached^ through-legislation.   This conclusion is based upon a numberof general considerations:-   (l) The statutory interval between nomination andpoll  (in a General Election the poll takes place on the ninth day after  the day of nomination, and in a EyeElection not less than six or more than eight cleardays  after the day of nomination) has been found to be too  short to allow of ballot papers being printed and sent,  with the necessary appliances, to existing pollingstations without very  considerable  difficulty.Special  steamers have  in certain  cases had to bechartered, and even so the uncertain seas and inadequatelanding  places have marie the  timeout onening of the polla matter of  extreme  difficulty.   In at least one case it was found impossible  to  open  the poll  before teno^look.    In  others  it  in  said  to  have been &quot;touch and go&quot;  whether the  poll  could  be held  at  all.    (2) A similar,  though less marked,  difficulty  has  been experienced in returning the  votes  in  time  for  the  count.                                               (3)/
   (3) Conditions which render it difficult to takepolls on islands which already have polling stationsmake the provision of fresh polling ptations - underthe present lavr - impracticable on islands still more remote.   Where islanders cannot get off the island to vote, there is small prospect of the necessaryofficers &quot;being able to land in order to take the poll.   (4) Difficulty is also experienced in making thenecessary arrangements for the election owing to the uncertainty of communication.    Telegraphic facilities are liable to frequent and lengthy interruption, andinstances are recorded where the Post Office authoritieshave been obliged to entrust telegrams announcing the holding of a poll to the skipper of-the vessel deliveringthe ballot boxes.   (5) Returning Officers are  satisfied that theseconditions involve a risk that there will one day bebreak-down in the arrangements for polling a, particularisland, and that there will consequently be a possibilityof the election for the whole  constituency being voided.They are unanimously of opinion that steps should betaken to guard against such a contingency.     Various remedial measures have been proposed and the one which commends itself to me, and is most likely to be generally acceptable, is a general provisionempowering the Returning Officer, in the case of ScottishConstituencies which include islands, to take the pollin any island polling district at a later date than thatprescribed or originally fixed,  if in his opinion it is                                     impract impracticable/
impracticable to take the poll on the earlier date.     In my opinion some such provision is longoverdue.   1 sec no reason to suppose that it wouldbe controversial,  and I therefore desire the  authorityof my colleagues for* the inclusion of such a  provision in the Bill,                                  WM. ADAHSON.Scottish Office ,       Whitehall.    16th December,  1930.
