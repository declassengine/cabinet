In connection with the subject of the Export         of Wear Materials and Warships, which is doum for         consideration at the next Feeting, I am instructed         by the Prime Minister to circulate for the information         of the Cabinet the attached draft Report by the Chiefs         of Sta&quot;&apos;p Sub-Gommittee on Russian Plying &quot;oats *                  It should perhaps be explained that thia         draft Report was prepared entirely independently of         the question before the Cabinet.  The information it         contains, however;, regarding the  large orders  for         Plying Boats given by the Soviet  Government to Italian         firms, and the numbers already delivered, are  a further         illustration cf the extent to which Italy is competing         in the international armaments industry,                               (Signed) M.P.A.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1930.SECRET.                                                     Cbpy No.C.0.S  257.                                                      &apos;&apos;(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 1030-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee.RUSSIAN  FLYING BOATS.(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 253.)                                  REPORT.    OUR attention has been drawn by the Chief of the Naval Staff to the large orders for flying boats recently placed in Italy by the Soviet Government, and weconsider that this is a matter meriting consideration by the Committee of ImperialDefence,  in view of its bearing on the defence situation vis-a-vis Russia.    2.  In April  1930 a  report  was received  to the effect that  the RussianGovernment were about to order 280 flying boats of  the &quot; Savoia&quot; (S. 62)  type froman Italian firm at Milan, and  that it was hoped to  arrange for the construction ofa further 300 flying boats of the same type in the  Crimea.    3.  Reports differ as to the number of flying boats ordered, but, as explained inparagraph 5 (below), the eventual acquisition by  Russia of a total of 280  is  apossibility.  There is no confirmation of the proposal to construct 300 Savoia flying boats in  Russia.  It is probable that the type delivered up to June 1930 was theSavoia S.55, which has a smaller endurance than the S.62.  Confirmation of the typeis difficult to obtain, but it is considered that the possible existence of the Savoia S.62type in the Black Sea cannot be ignored4.   The performance of these two types are as follows :- 	Speed.	Endurance.	Bomb Load.&quot; Savoia &quot; (S. 62) ..	120 m.p.h.	7 hrs.	1,100 lbs. approx.&quot; Siwoia&quot; (S. 55)	120 m.p.b.	3ihrs.	1,763 lbs.		(probably greater)	    If the bomb load of the S. 55 is reduced to 1,000 lbs. its endurance can be taken as 5^ hours,  which gives it  a radius of action  of,  say, 300  miles  as  comparedwith the 400 miles of the  S. 62 type, with a similar weight of bombs.       As  regards  actual  deliveries,  the  most  recent reports  indicate  that^5 &quot;Savoia&quot; flying boats have been delivered, and  that, in addition, if the creditprovided  for in the Aircraft Section of the Russo-Italian Trade Agreement is usedto purchase further &apos;&apos; Savoia &quot; flying boats, 70 or 80 more could be bought during theyear ending June 1931.  From this it may be inferred that the  acquisition  by theRussians  of  a total of 280 &quot;Savoia&quot; flying boats is a possibility.      [22205]

    6.  Although owing to the lack of information regarding the activities  of soviet Russia it is difficult at the present stage to reach any definite conclusion asto the purpose /underlying the acquisition of such a large number  of flying boats,such&apos;intelligence as is available tends to show that Russia  proposes to adopt-ailaggressive policy in the Black Sea, and  it is felt that the primary reason for thelarge orders for flying boats is the need for air strength with the contemplated Sovietbattle fleet in the Black Sea.  The short Russian coast line in the Baltic is stronglydefended by heavy  guns,  and it is known  that  the  intention is to lay extensiveminefields in the Gulf of Finland.    7.   By transferring the battle fleet to the Black Sea and  providing it  with strong air reconnaissance and air offensive power, Russia no  doubt  feels that, whileher security in the  Baltic  would be in no way impaired, she would provide aprospective enemy with a difficult problem  to solve in the Black Sea.
