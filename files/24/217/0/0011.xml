    [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                    Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1930.SECRET.CP. 411(30).                       CABINET.          NORTH-WEST  FRONTIER:  The Afridi Situation.   The following extracts from North-West Frontier Situation Reports are circulatedby the Secretary of State for India in  continuation of CP. 3G8 (30), together with thefull text of  the  Government  of  lndia&apos;s  appreciation of the position, dated  27thNovember.   9th December 1930.                Extract from Situation Report, 17th November 1930.   Jirga, numbering between five and six hundred, was  seen to-day at Jamrud by political Agent and  Assistant Political Officer.  All maliks were present, and jirgawas fully representative of Government elders of all sections and pensioners.  Attitudeof jirga indicated some desire to effect settlement, but discussion  did not get beyondpreliminaries.  Jirga will be seen again to-morrow.  Rhilafatists  in Tirah are said tohave sent emissaries to Shiah Orakzais to win them over to  their side.                Extinct from Situation Report, lSlii November 1930.    Political Agent,  Khyber, resumed jirga with Afridis  to-day at Jamrud.   Chiefspokesmen were elders  of  Malikdiu Khel and Qambarlvhel &quot;sections, who repeated that they had oniy. one suggestion, namely, that of sectional responsibility as alternative to Governments measures on Khajuri and Aka Khel Plains.  Other sections may make further suggestions to-morrow -  Reports from Tirah indicate  that  no emissaries willbe sent to Shiah Orakzais until result of Jamrud jirga is known.                Extract from Situation Report, 19th November 1930.    A report was received at Landi Kotal  from Bazar last night that 300 hostiles had left Maidan the  previous  day to attack  troops in  Khajuri.   Other reports received to-day indicate that parties of Aka Khels,  Bara Zakka Khels and Sepahs had collected in caves  at the mouth of the Bara for the last two days.   Reports, possibly emanating from Peshawar City, have been spread in Tirah to effect  that Government had decidedto withdraw troops from Khajuri Plain,  and that peace would be  made  on those terms.   Hostiles were advised to attack  troops during  withdrawal.   Political Agent,Khyber,  continued to hold jirga to-day at Jamrud.  Maliks insisted that withdrawalof all forces, regular or irregular, from Khajuri  and Aka  Khel Plains was sine qua.lion, and that even Khassadars would be impossible there.  They admitted definitely1the guilt of the tribe  as  regards  the incursions of June  and August last, but said&apos;that only punishment they would hear of was (a) possible construction of some roads:across plains on  condition  of evacuation  as  soon as roads  were  constructed;1(6)  imposition of some fine in  rifles, or amount to be   settled in  consultation with;jirga;  (c) bonds furnished by each section  for limited  amounts ; and (d) eradicationof Khilafat and Congress organisation among Tirah Afridis.  None of these proposalsconstituted a serious attempt at finding alternative to Governments decisions.   It wasalso clear  that jirga&apos;s attitude  was  dictated by knowledge that hostiles had  againdecided to  defy them by advancing down  the Bara.  Maliks and elders said they hadno further offer  to make and would  prefer to return home.   Maliks will probablyremain at Jamrud to-morrow, but elders are more likely to return to Tirah.                Extract from Situation Report, 20th November 1930.   Reported  that.gang, of  170 Afridis,  mainly Aka Khels, was in  neighbourhoodof Amal Chabutra  on  night of 19th.   This may he  same as gang mentioned  in another report as numbering 200 and consisting of  Aka Khels, Malikdin Khels, andQambar  Khels in  vicinity of Mandai ou  Aka Khel Plain.  Three other gangs, one of     4862D    75  12.30
Sepalis, one of Zakka Khels and a third not specified, are reported to have been seen on outskirts of Khajuri  Plain.  All these gangs of hostiles  must have left Tirah  withhostile intentions as soon as Afridi jirga of maliks and elders started  from  Tirali forJamrud.  It is thus clear that Afridi maliks and elders were premature in thinking that they had regained control over hostiles before they left  Tirali.  Intention ofliostilcs to defy maliks  has been demonstrated  by their  sniping  our troops everynight and once in broad  daylight.  This is actual reason why maliks and elders brokeoff jirga yesterday afternoon.   Although they declared their intention to return homeat once, they  wavered again this morning and held  meeting at  Sheikh Baba Ziarat,above  Jamrud.  They  again  failed, however,  to come to a decision  in  any wayunanimous and  broke up into small  parties  and  left for Tirah to renew consultationregarding their future action.   Apparently,  they  expect hostiles  to commit the wholetribe by some serious overt-hostility  in next few days;                                                                                &quot;                Extract from Situation Report, 2Ath November 1930.   Chief  Commissioner saw Afridi maliks  at  Peshawar  to day.   They  presentedwritten statement  confirming  their   replies   to  Political  Agent,  Khyber, ou19th November.   Only  addition to  previous statement  was that  not only did  theyobject  to any roads on Khajuri and Aka Khel Plains being protected after construction,but they also  objected to  such roads being repaired, although they said  they nowbelieved that  Government was really  in  earnest about protecting Peshawar from attack.  It is not certain that this statement of theirs is sincere.  More movements ofgangs to and from Bara &apos;Valley are reported.      Telegram from Government of  India, Foreign and Political Department, to              Secretary of State for India, dated 27th November 1930.   3852 S.  We have now had opportunity to discuss Afridi situation with Pears andare in a position to  provide  general  appreciation of existing situation, as  well as to formulate some conclusions regarding course to be adopted in immediate future.   Afridis&apos; terms and attitude as disclosed in recent jirga and other negotiations, videSituation Reports  for. 19th. November, 20th November, and 24th November, contrastfavourably with the arrogant demands of a few months back, but  on close examinationfail, in our judgment, to secure what His Majest.y&apos;s Government, with us, have felt tobe sine qua nous  of any settlement.  We  will content ourselves with some obviouscriticisms :      (a) Construction of permanent roads, imless  we are able to ensure protection and         maintenance, is sheer waste of mone3r.     (b) For this reason, as His Majesty&apos;s Government have recognised, one or more         posts must be included.  At  later stage we  might be  prepared to consider         notion of protecting these by Afridi force, whether Khassadars or Militia (on         Scouts lines) or both, but it is premature to discuss this at present.   Proposed sectional bonds and undertaking to eliminate Khilafatists and  Congressare alike  valueless.  As regards first,  probability of  such sectional  bonds being-enforced is remote, and, in  the event of any general opposition of tribe to Govern-ment,  desire  to  enforce these  internal undertakings  would  itself  disappear.  Asregards second, there is no reason to suppose  that  our  supporters, though  their position has improved, are any more  able yet to do  this than they were able duringthe siimmer to control the same elements.   It  will be  remembered  that the  Afridis  themselves decided  this year  not  to resort  to  Kajuri and Aka Khel Plains.  Presence of our troops in that region has,no doubt, fortified this resolution, but it was originally taken spontaneously.   Certain sections have also  been  excluded by proclamation from access to  british india.  Tribe is, in consequence, beginning  to feel the effect of economic pressure.   Whether in consequence of this or for other reasons, it now appears, from  facts which Pears has supplied and which perhaps have not emerged in Situation Reports,party  exists,  probably  of  considerable  dimensions,  which is definitely  prepared tosettle  with  Government, conceding, at any rate,  substantial  part of ^ Governmentdemands.  This party includes half of the important Kuki Khel  section, who arefreely  using their grazing grounds north of Bezai Spur undeterred  by presence oftroops and have taken contracts for unmetalled  road work in that area.  Similarly,Zakka Khels living in Khyber proper are favourably disposed.
                   Extract from Situation report, 3rd December.   The lashkar of 800 Afridis which was to have reached Khajuri to-day to opposetroops is reported to have been held up  owing to opposition of  maliks and elders andpensioners.  Aka Khels of Bara are also  said to have objected strongly to passage ofany such lashkar on ground that aerial  reprisals would certainly fall on  them.   Aseparate gang  of about  100 Qambar Khels reached Alam Kili  in Aka Khel  Plainyesterday and attacked covering party from Miri Khel to-day.  Khushal Khan, leader of Khilafatist  party among  Malikdin  Khels, is reported to have left for Jalalabadwith deputation.  Aerial  reconnaissance  to-day observed large numbers of lrakzaifamilies with cattle on move towards Lower Mastura.  These are probably Feroz KhelOrakzais moving down to winter quarters on Kohat border.   Maliks of all  sections also, when interviewed by Pears, displayed friendly spirit,and although they are still obviously unable to  carry tribe with them, their continuedfriendly attitude is asset of undoubted value.   Afghan Government is maintaining correct and helpful attitude.   Other  tribes are showing no sign of any disposition to engage themselves in theAfridi cause.   Reconnaissances over Kajuri Plain have so far failed to locate source of permanentwater supply which we regard as essential factor in determining the  site  of  the postor posts to be constructed and consequent alignment of permanent roads.   Till wateris discovered, which we have no  doubt it ultimately will,  troops  must therefore remain in occupation more or less in their present positions.   Our conclusions  accordingly are  that good grounds exist to justify expectation that  the present policy, if  steadily  pursued,  without  any unnecessary  provocativeaction on our part,  combined with  natural economic pressure and manifest proof ofour intention to implement our policy, will before long so strengthen  the hands of themaliks and moderate elements that final decision  may be achieved without furtherembroilment with  the tribe.
