TO  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document. p s GOvEFuWENT .)Copy Ho ...... .&apos;C A B I I E T .INCITEMENT TO SEDITION BILL.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary, the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War and the _Secretary of State for Air ._We circulate for consideration by the Cabinet the attached copy of a Bill which has been prepared after consultation between the Defence Services, the Home Office, the Attorney General,  the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Intelligence Service . .The primary object of the Bill is to provide a summary method of dealing with attempts to sediice members of His Majesty&apos;s Porces from their duty and allegiance.     These.^ acts are already offences against the law but can only be dealt with by indictment for felony.      The second main object of the Bill is to empower Justices of the Peace to grant search warrants where they are satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under the Bill has been committed.It will be seen that the Bill contains alternative provisions to meet an eventual decision whether the Bill should or should not apply to Civil Servants .      If it is eventually decided that the Bill shall not apply to Civil Servants, the second alternative in Clause 1(1) is the more appropriate form of words and has the advantage of following existing provisions of the statute law relating, to His Majesty&apos;s Porces.     The question of the scope of the Bill is a matter of policy which will be discussed later in the Memorandum.As regards members of His Majesty&apos;s Porces, the existing law relating to incitement to mutiny is contained in an Act of 1797, which provides that &quot;any person who shall maliciously and advisedly endeavour to seduce any person or(THIS DOCUME:- &apos;:..jS E  C R E T . CP.  230 (33)
persons serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces by sea or land from his or their duty and allegiance to His Majesty ..... shall be adjudged guilty of felony&quot; .     The procedure under this Act is by indictment .     This procedure has been usefully employed in more serious cases where it has been possible to fix responsibility on particular persons for actively distributing literature to the troops.      But the procedure by indictment, though appropriate to serious felony,  is not particularly appropriate to the case,  e.g. of a down and out unemployed man who without any particular Communist leanings may have attempted for some small payment to distribute pamphlets of the contents of which he has no accurate knowledge.     Such a case is obviously better dealt with by summary proceedings. To bring such an offender to trial by jury would give an exaggerated importance and advertisement to the case .     The delay between the offence and the conviction might deprive the sentence of much of its value as a deterrent.      In a case occurring outside London there may be a delay of weeks or possibly months between committal and trial, and the proceedings at the Assizes will often not take place until after the emergency,  which was the occasion of the offence, has come to an end.      The result is that when offences are committed in connection,  for example, with an industrial dispute,  the punishment is too late to be effective as a warning at the time when a warning is most needed,  and the Government is liable to be accused of vindictiveness in continuing the proceedings after the emergency or the industrial dispute has been settled.Clause l(l)  of the Bill attempts to overcome these difficulties by providing that conduct which is already an offence under the Act of 1797 but can only be dealt with on indictment for felony shall be an offence under the Bill, while Clause 1(4)  provides for summary trial and conviction.
mClause 1(2) of the Bill makes it an offence to have in one&apos;s possession or under one&apos;s control without lawful excuse documents of such a nature that the dissemination of copies thereof would he calculated to seduce members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces from their duty or allegiance.      Under the existing law, mere possession of such material is not an offence although the publication and distribution of such material would contravene the law.      The action of the executive authorities in combating the activities of the Communist organisations in this country is seriously handicapped by their inability to take action owing to the lack of statutory provision against persons known to be in possession of such material.     Should the Intelligence Authorities be at any time aware of certain premises v/here this material is being produced, they would &quot;be powerless without some such amendment of the law as is now proposed to take any action until the material is actually distributed.     A further consequence of the existing state of the law is that the law punishes the subordinate who distributes literature of this kind but leaves untouched the persons really responsible for the production of the literature.Clause 2 of the Bill, which confers the power of search, is the most controversial but,  in our judgment, the most essential part of the Bill.      The existing law in the matter of incitement to mutiny contains no provisions for preliminary search in aid o-f evidence on which a charge could be based.      The law relating to preliminary search generally is extremely haphazard.      Certain statutes - to take a few examples, the Betting Act,  1853,  in the  case of betting offences, the Obscene Publications Act,  1857,  in the case of obscene publications, and the Petroleum Consolidation Act, 1928,  in the case of offences under that Act - provide for the issue of search warrants with a view to the detection of offences, but many statutes dealing with far more serious offences contain no corresponding provisions for preliminary
search.     The experience of the Defence Departments and of the Director of Public Prosecutions has shown that without a power of search the authorities are very seriously handicapped in dealing with the offence of incitement to mutiny,  and we are strongly of opinion that the time has come when it is necessary to arm the Executive with powers of search if any effective action is to be taken to curtail the activities of those who are engaged in attempting to seduce members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces from their allegiance.The final question of policy is whether or not the Bill should apply to Civil Servants.     We are advised that there is no evidence of attempts on any large scale to create disaffection among Civil Servants or to induce them to withhold their services,  and accordingly there is not the same case for applying the Bill to the Civil Service as there is for applying it to the Defence Services.     Even were the position otherwise, we nevertheless think that there are strong arguments against applying the Bill to the Civil Service.     The terms under which Civil Servants are employed and their allegiance to the Crown are different from such terms and allegiance in the case of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. Ho statutory provisions exist which deal either with, e.g. a strike on the part of Civil Servants or with the conduct of persons who seek to induce them to withheld their services. In this respect the Bill,  if it were to include the provisions as to Civil Servants, would be creating new lav/ and could not be supported on the basis indicated earlier in this Memorandum.      Furthermore,   it would seem undesirable to incur the risk in the promotion of a Bill of this character of raising any such vexed question as the right of a Civil Servant to withhold his services either alone or in combination with others.     Until this question is settled,  it is  obvious that to create a new offence of incitement of Civil Servants by
10th October,  1933 .outside persons would pave the way to criticisms based both, on law and policy.We have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer and he agrees that the Civil Service should not be included within the provisions of the Bill.J .G . B. E-M. H . L.
