Germany and: the Disarmament Confer enceDIn connection with C&quot;i&apos;P..&quot;340 which the Cabinet are to consider on Monday, October 23rd, I circulate herewith a record of a conversation which I had with the German Ambassador on the evening of Friday, October 20th,(Initialled)        JYS.
Foreign Office,20th October, 1933.Sir,I asked the German Ambassador to come to see me this afternoon.     It was the first time I had seen him since Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference,,2.,     I first asked him to convey a private message to Baron von Neurath from me expressing my personal regret that I had had to have any public controversy with him,, especially as he was the former Ambassador here and a personal friend of so many of us.     The Government felt that some answer must be made publicly to Herr von Neurath&apos; s comments and we maintained view expressed in my broadcast.     But the last thing any of us wanted was to embitter controversy, especial-ly on personal lines,     Herr von Hoesch promised to send the message, adding that as soon as he heard my broadcast he had communicated with Herr vcn Neurath, advising him not to carry the controversy further,3c     The Ambassador and I then went over various points together and I told him that there could be no doubt that I had correctly reproduced Prince Bismarck&apos;s communication, for, when I reported it to our Ambassador in Rome, it was found that the Italian Government had already received the German document and there appeared to be no difference in the versions,     One small matterv/hich ...excellency the Right HonourableSir E, Phipps, K.C.M.G., C.V.O., etc.,    etc.,   etc.
which Herr von Neurath had made a good deal of, I had not dealt with in the broadcast from a desire to limit the controversy.     It was a mysterious suggestion that the American Government had in some way been misled and were thus induced to make a reference to the Anglo-German Treaty which they subsequently withdrew.     I knew nothing, at all about it;   Mr. Norman Davis9 as I understood, received information of the German connunica tion from Herr Weizsiicker at Geneva and presumably transmitted correctly;   and the only reference to the Anglo-German Treaty in this connexion known to us was a telegram in the &quot;Times&quot;&apos; from an unofficial source. I hoped, therefore, that the Ambassador would explain this to the German Foreign Office, as I wanted to remove all suspicion       misrepresentation and quite agreed that controversy on these lines should now cease.4.     The Ambassador then talked freely for some time about the German attitude, prefacing his remarks with the warning that this was only a friendly conversa-tion.     What he said summarised very effectively the German position and I record it in some detail.5.    Germany, he said, had been angered by the course recently followed in the conversations between the Great Powers about disarmament.     The British plan had been accepted in June, not only as the basis for discussion, but as the basis of the future Convention. Germany considered that what had since transpired amounted to a departure from this basis for the follow-ing reasons.     The Draft Convention had contained two provisions very difficult for Germany to accept: (1) the abolition of the Reichswehr and (2) a system of supervision.     Germany had been much pressed,especially ...
$specially &quot;by Mr, No man De.vis and ourselves, to make the concession of yielding on these two points in order that in return Britain and America should put great pressure on France to agree to disarm.     Very unwillingly, according to the Ambassador, Germany consented.    But what had happened?     The German concessions which had been extract-ed from her, were now put by the French in what was called a first periods and any provisions for actual disarmament were postponed to a second period,     That was not main-taining the basis provided for by the British plan. Indeed, Germany suspected that the re-arrangement which Prance had suggested, and which we were prepared to support, was designed by France to reduce the efficiency of the German professional array and then to find reasons for refusing to disarm on her part at all.     General Weygand, said Herr von Hoesch, is calculating that M, Daladier&apos;s Government will have disappeared long before the next four years are up; but the French General Staff will be there still, and they are confident that they will find some reason or other for declining to fulfil the second part of the programme.     Further, Germany resented the suggestion that the modification of the British Plan should be justified by an alleged change in the atmosphere of Europe which was attributed to her,     If reasons of that sort were to justify departing from an arrangements an international convention would have no solid basis,.6.,     I reminded the Ambassador that Germany in the past had always bitterly complainod that the Reichswehr had been Imposed on her and had insisted that the system of a long-term professional army did not meet her requirements,     So far as I could recall. Germany had never .,.
never exhibited any desire to retain the Reichswehr until it was proposed to transform it.     The British Plan was never put forward as though it were inspired like Holy Writ;   on the contrary, Mr, Ramsay IlacDonald had express-ly stated that it would be liable to modifications, and the necessity of modifications of some sort is now admitted by everybody,     As for subsequent events, our position was as follows:   we had signed our name to the Declaration that Germany was entitled to receive the application of the principle of equality in a regime of securityo     The Ambassador knew very well, especially from his former service in Paris, to what lengths the French carry their conceptions of security,.    We were not at all disposed to adopt these extreme views on the subject and . to treat Germany as though she should be in the hands of an international police, but as practical men who earnestly wished to bring about an international agreement for disarmament, we tried to find a means by which France&apos;s claim to security could be satisfied.    The report of an impartial body that the provisions of the Convention were being duly observed would provide such security.     We had always opposed the idea that any one country could be the judge as to this;   the decision must be the decision of the Permanent Disarmament Commission itself.     Neither had we ever consented that the disarma-ment in the second, period should be left vague or should be determined only when the first period was concluded. It must all be defined in the document to start with, For these reasons we did not consider that we haddeparted ...
indeparted from the spirit of the British. Plan which remained, in our conceptions in principle, the way in which international disarmament could he reached,,70     Our whole interview was exceedingly friendly and I thanked the Ambassador for explaining so fully the German point of view and added that I hoped there might be opportunities of discussing the whole subject further0 I am, with great truth and respects Sir jYour Excellency&apos;s obedient Servant, (Signed)       JOHN SIMON,
