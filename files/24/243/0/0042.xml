faBCRET.CP. 241(33) (Revise)Copy No.CABINET.BRITISH COTTON AND ARTIFICIAL bILK INDUSTRIES&apos;DELEGATION TO INDIA.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.At a meeting of the Cabinet on October 26th, 1933, (Cabinet 57(33) conclusion 2), I promised my colleagues that I would report again as soon as definite information was received of the discussions on cotton and rayon then proceeding in India. The Delegation under bir William Clare Lees has now returned and its report has appeared in the press.    The results of the Delegation^ work may be summarised as followsj-I. United Kingdom - India.Two main results have been achieved:-(a) An Agreement with the Bombay Mlllowners&apos; Association under which a preference to United Kingdom goods is accepted as a &quot;fair and desirable principle&quot;;   the Bombay people undertake not to object to a reduction on Lancashire goods from 25 to 20 per cent, when the Government of India can afford it, and at the same time agree to support tariff concessions on British artificial silk goods.     It is apparent that, by reaching an agreement with an important section of the Indian Industry, our industrialists have made it much easier for the Government of India to contemplate reduction of the import duties on United Kingdom cotton and rayon goods.(b ) An expression of willingness by the Government of India to enter into discussions for a new trade agreement relating to British cotton and artificial silk goods as soon as the negotiations now proceeding with the Japanese
Government are concluded.      It will &quot;be recalled that when the United Kingdom-Indian Agreement was concluded at Ottawa in August, 1932, it was not possible to deal in any-precise way with these commodities, because they were then under consideration by the Indian Tariff BoardB That Board subsequently reported, but tfte docximent has not been acted upon or, indeed, published, aud the whole situation has, of course, &quot;been profoundly modified by the development of Japanese competition in the Indian market, leading to the denunciation by the Government of India of the Indo-Japanese Commercial Agreement and to the negotiations for a new agreement now proceeding in India between the two Governments. II.  india- Japan.The Delegation were enabled to furnish the Government of India with information regarding the United Kingdom position in relation to Japanese competition in the Indian markets,     The Lsecretar/   of i^tate for India will I understand report in due course on the outcome of the negotiations with Japan. III. United Kingdom -Japan.There is very little to be said about these discussions except that it became apparent at an early stage that the Japanese industrialists had been sent to India as technical advisers to the official Japanese delegation and, unlike the Japanese delegation now in the United Kingdom, were not empowered to negotiate.     The United Kingdom Delegation regard the discussions, however, as a helpful prelude to the further discussions with the Japanese industrialists who are now in this country.      It is expected that these discussions will be entered upon in the near future, i.e. when the Indo-Japanese governmental discussions have been concludedo-e-
When the United Kingdom Delegation went out to India there was considerable doubt in Lancashire and elsewhere whether It would he ahle to achieve anything&apos; useful, hut I believe that balanced opinion in this country is now disposed to the view that, making allowance for all the difficulties, the work of the Delegation has &quot;been, well worth while and, so far as can he judged at the present time, has gone some way towards justifying the Government in their &quot;belief that the &quot;best approach to the problems of international industrial competition is &quot;by the method of discussion &quot;between industrialistSoBoard of Trade,23rd November, 1933.
