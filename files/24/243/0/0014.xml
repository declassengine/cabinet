COPY NO.      3 fi-CABINET.- RELATIONS WITH PERSIA     BASIDU INCIDENT..Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.1. I fully realise the strength of the objections tostrong action against Persia on the present occasion, but I must emphasise that the Persians have committed a gross insult to the British Flag,  such as would not be tolerated by any other civilised country.    It was carried out by the senior officer of the Persian Navy and can scarcely therefore be called a mistake.      Whether it was originally a mistake or not,  the telegrams we have received from the Persian Gulf leave no doubt about its disastrous effect on Arab opinion*     Bearing this in mind, I think the disavowals spontaneously offered by the Shah and his promised apology are worthless:    I think,    furthermore, that we should insist upon reparation in ceremonial form, for the following reasons.2. We have to secure two things,      The first is our prestige on the Arab shore of the Gulf.    For more than 100 years Great Britain has been the arbiter of the Gulf and it-is mainly our prestige which has brought to an end the constant strife between Persian and Arab, and between conflicting Arab tribes, and which has rendered possible the virtual suppression of gun-running and the slave  trade. This prestige is mainly the result of Naval power; and its outward and visible sign, especially to oriental eyes, is the British Flag which has now been insulted.3, The second, and perhaps more important, object is the rehabilitation of our position in the eyes of Persia. We have, since the war, tried consistently to establish good relations with Persia by a policy of conciliation.    The only
: /results have been an. exaggerated feeling of self-importance on the part of Persia, a steady sapping of our position in the Gulf, and a decline in our prestige -which the Political Resident states is &quot;more marked than I could have conceived possible&quot;. I have no great hopes in the possibilityof obtaining a satisfactory treaty in this way.       The Persian policy is clearly to oust us from our position of arbiter of the Gulf, and I am of the opinion that a tonic is needed to restore our position in Persia and that the present,  when the Persians are clearly in the wrong, would be a good moment for it to be administered. 4. I would point out that the action which i recommend has from the beginning been supported by the two responsible authorities actually on the spot, namely, the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the Political Resident at Bushire.5. I suggest,  therefore, that the Charge d&apos;Affairesbe instructed to ask for a ceremony at Basidu to include the rehoisfcing of the Flag by Persia, in the presence of British -warships.        If this is refused, I would suggest a strongly worded note to Persia pointing o;it the impossibility of Treaty negotiations whilst the insult remains unatoned;      insisting upon our determination- in the meanwhile to maintain the status quo in   the Gulf, including, of course, Henjam;      and emphasizing that for a long period we have maintained an attitude of friendship for Persia, but that the recent  policy of Persia can only be interpreted as an attempt to undermine the British position in the Gulf, and that this makes the continuance of friendly relations impossible.      We might go on to point out that British friendship has been in the past of great value to Persia, as witness our steady refusal hitherto to countenance the
Muscat claim to Henjam, which some might consider better than the Persian, and suggest that the Persian Government should consider well before rejecting our friendship.6. If the Cabinet approve the action I havesuggested above I would propose,  if my colleagues agree, to order a Flotilla of destroyers to the Gulf at once, to impress the Persians with the fact that we are in earnest rn our demand for   reparation.      I would not, of course,  suggest any forcible step, but only a Naval demonstration accompanied by a close watch on all Persian Naval craft.(Initialled) B.E-M.Admiralty, S.W. 1. Sept.   1st,  1933.
