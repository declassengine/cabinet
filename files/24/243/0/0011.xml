Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1933.SECRET. Copy No. 38CP. 211 (33).CABINET.THE  FUTURE  OF   THE  EMPIRE  MARKETING  BOARDPOSTER  FRAMES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE dissolution of the Empire Marketing Board on the 30th September raises one urgent question to which I wish to call the attention of my colleagues. It involves the abolition of the system of some 1,650 special poster frames, distributed on specially selected sites, granted either free or for a nominal rent, over the 475 principal cities and towns of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the dispersion of the small but now highly skilled staff which has been responsible for arranging for the designing, printing, distribution, posting and inspection of the posters to be displayed upon them.These frames, and the valuable sites on which they have been erected, are an asset of high capital value. They originally cost about  50,000 to construct and erect. Their expectation of life varies with the sites on which they are exposed; but they are estimated still to have an average remaining life in good condition of from five to ten years, the period varying according to the degree of care that is spent on their future maintenance. The average rental of the sites on which they stand is  3 per frame a sum which bears no relation to their commercial value. The owners who have made these sites available for public purposes may be roughly classified as follows : Government Departments ... ... 43Local Authorities        ... ... ... 984Railway Companies     ... ... ... 287Private Owners           ... ... ... 3541,668The frames are at present distributed as follows : England and Wales     ... ... ...      1,483Scotland        ... ... ... ...        155Northern Ireland ... ... ... 30The display material, for which they may be used, has been normally described in the contracts covering their use as &quot; a changing series of posters illustrating the production possibilities of the Empire at home and overseas.&quot; They have hitherto been used primarily for posters issued by the Empire Marketing Board for its own purposes and designed to bring the Empire alive to the public. On occasion, however, the frames have been leased out to other Departments, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and the General Post Office. They have also been used for announcing the British Industries Fair. In such cases the posters have been prepared by the Empire Marketing Board staff in consultation with the Department concerned, the Board retaining a veto on the material to be displayed.The Committee of the Cabinet on Trade and Employment asked me on the 20th July to discuss with the Minister of Health the possibility of the use of these frames for posters supporting the Governments Housing policy.   As a[8969]
result a set of posters on that theme is being displayed throughout England and Wales during September, the cost, with Treasury approval, being met out of Ministry of Health funds. Meantime officers of other Government Departments (including the General Post Office, the Ministries of Agriculture, Labour and Transport and the Department of Overseas Trade) have enquired informally of the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s officers about the possibility of the future use of the frames for their special needs.I believe that my colleagues will wish to consider whether the assets represented by these frames and the few expert officers who have managed them should not be preserved for national uses, if only for an experimental period. The frames could clearly be made the medium of a sustained demonstration to the public, by methods which certain other countries are employing to a striking extent, of the steps which this country is taking in various fields to equip itself to meet the changed needs of the time, including the modern facilities which its various Government Departments offer to the public and the points at which the co-operation of the public is required to make them fully efficient. It occurs to me that, if the preservation of the frames for general national purposes were assured, they could also be used to bring home to the public the resources of the Colonial Empire.The use of the frames by the Empire Marketing Board has extended into two secondary uses : (1) They have issued regularly to over 25,000 schools in this country, and to a certain number of oversea schools throughout the Empire, small-size reproductions of selected posters designed for display on the poster frames, and these have been very widely appreciated by teachers, often securing a permanent display in school buildings.(2) They have made copies of certain of their posters available through the local representatives of the Department of Overseas Trade for exhibitions and shopping weeks in the Dominions and Colonies. This use of the Board&apos;s material in the interest of British trade in the Empire has also been much appreciated.The all-in costs of maintaining on an economical basis this system of display (including all staff and other overhead charges, but not allowing for the depreciation of the frames) have proved to be about Poster-frame displays :  25,000-30,000 per annum.School reproductions (at three issues per annum) :  5,000-6,000 per annum.The posters of this type issued for oversea shopping weeks, &amp;c, have mainly been spare copies, and their very small cost cannot be separated.No feature of the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s dissolution has elicited more widespread regret in the press and elsewhere throughout the country than the abolition of its poster displays. They are recognised as having supplied the first example of out-door poster advertising of a quality which safeguarded the amenities of the highways and thus secured an enhanced value for its messages. The suggestion that their abolition at this stage would involve a serious waste of public assets has already been made. The sight of over 1,600 empty poster frames in commanding situations would emphasise this point to the public.Experience shows that, between the acceptance of even a simple letter-press design and its appearance in printed form on the poster frames, at least one month is required for the necessary preparations. For more elaborate designs the experience of the Empire Marketing Board has led them to allow up to six months for designing and printing. In order that time might be allowed for the consideration of the case by the Cabinet on its reassembly after the holidays, without a break in the continuity of the displays, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the approval of the Prime Minister, has already authorised the continued use of the frames during the months of October and November. Arrangements have accordingly been made for their use by the General Post Office during October at the charge of funds at the disposal of the Postmaster-General for publicity purposes. Their use during November is the subject of active discussion. If it were desired to continue the unbroken use of the frames during December, a plan for their use must be complete by the 1st November at latest.It is not, perhaps, within my official province to suggest what arrangements should be made for the future control and management of the frames, if the
Cabinet should decide upon their continuance. It&apos; may, however, assist the Cabinet if I indicate, from my experience of their management by the Empire Marketing Board, certain points which would need consideration and sketch, however tentatively, lines on which a solution seems practicable. In so doing, I should explain that, owing to the holidays, I have not had an opportunity of discussing them with the Chancellor of the Exchequer or any other of my colleagues.It has been a material factor in securing the grant of sites from both public authorities and individuals, that they should be under the control of a body on which all political parties were represented. On this ground alone and, perhaps, for wider and continuing considerations of policy it would seem necessary to preserve this qualification in any new body which might be entrusted with their control. On the other hand, since many Departments would from time to time seem likely to wish to establish their claims to a use of the frames, it would seem undesirable to attempt to make the controlling body representative of the various Government Departments which might in the future desire to use them. The most practicable solution would, perhaps, be a Committee attached to the Treasury, under the Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary and with some such membership as the following : Four members of Parliament representing the four main parties.One representative of the Federation of British Industries  (whethernominated or individually selected). One representative of the Trades Union Congress (whether nominated orindividually selected). Two other non-official representatives, of whom one might suitably beMr. Frank Pick, who sponsored the original introduction of the frames,and the other might be a woman.The actual management of the frames and posters might be entrusted, under the control of the Committee, to whichever Government Department seemed best equipped for the purpose. If the best advantage is to be obtained from the use of the frames, the management arrangements should include provision for suitable liaison with the press at home, and, if possible, overseas. (Experience has shown a remarkable readiness on the part of papers in the Empire overseas to reproduce some of the Empire Marketing Board posters, and the connection is well worth preserving in the interests of our trade and prestige.)As regards finance, certain Departments (for example, the General Post Office and the Ministry of Agriculture) already have special funds for publicity, out of which they might pay for any use of the frames allotted to them. But the present distribution of these funds among the Departments is unlikely to correspond accurately to the national uses which the controlling body judged most advantageous for the frames. It would seem necessary, therefore, to place a special fund at the disposition of that body. It would also be desirable to authorise the controlling body to lease out the frames for approved purposes to bodies other than Government Departments.Finally, I would point out that the existence of a limited number of frames in Northern Ireland may involve a small problem of administration, requiring special adjustment, since some of the subjects suitable for treatment by Govern-ment Departments would there be the concern of a Northern Irish Department.I suggest that the Cabinet might at once take a general decision for or against the policy of continuing the frames, and that, if the decision should be in favour of their continuance, a small Committee should be appointed to report (a) how the poster frames should be controlled, and(b) how they should be financed and managed.J.
