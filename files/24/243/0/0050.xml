Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1933.SECRET Copy No.    45CP. 249 (33)the future of british commercial air transport
Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1933.SECRET.- 311CP. 249 (33).CABINET.THE FUTURE OF BRITISH COMMERCIAL AIR TRANSPORT.MY colleagues will recall that in April last I circulated a memorandum (CP. 110 (33)) by the Board of Imperial Airways (Ltd.) entitled the &quot;Future of Civil Air Communications of the Empire.&quot; Owing to the many major and pressing problems with which we have been confronted this summer, I have hitherto refrained from pursuing further the issues arising out of this memorandum.The time has now come, however, when I must ask the Cabinet to consider the all-important question of the future of British commercial air transport, in order that we may formulate a considered policy for the future. As I suggested at our last meeting before adjourning for the summer recess, I think the most convenient method would be to remit the question to a Cabinet Sub-Committee.2. Broadly speaking, four main issues arise out of Sir Eric Geddes&apos;s memorandum :-(i) When the existing agreements with Imperial Airways run out in 1937 to 1939, are we prepared to continue to subsidise the development of commercial air transport?(ii) If so, what are to be the future relations between the Government and imperial Airways, i.e., do we intend to continue to use the Company as our chosen instrument for the development of Imperial trunk air routes ?(iii) If the answers to (i) and (ii) are in the affirmative, is there to be anyattempt to establish the Company on a broader Imperial basis by endeavouring to evolve a scheme of closer co-operation and mutual partnership between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and Colonies ?(iv) Is it possible by a greatly extended use of aircraft for the carriage of mails to accelerate the development of a system of civil air communica-tions and advance the date by when air transport will become commercially self-supporting ?3. As regards (i) above, whilst it is too early to say on what scale subsidies will be required when the present agreements (a brief outline of which will be found in Appendix I see the map in pocket for the actual routes now in operation or immediate prospect) run out, it is, I think, clear that, great as has been the progress achieved by Imperial Airways since its formation in 1924, some measure of financial assistance from the Government will be required for a considerable period, though the amount of that assistance may be greatly reduced and its duration shortened, if action under (iv) proves feasible, i.e., if a workable scheme for the extended use of air transport for the carriage of mails can be devised. If financial assistance were withdrawn altogether on the expiry of the [9214] bHfcsK-p,-.^..-.................mmmrnammmmm
present agreements, our present Imperial air services would collapse, which is, I assume, unthinkable. Public opinion would certainly not tolerate their disappearance above all when other countries are straining every nerve to develop their own services the world over. The subsidies paid to air transport companies during the past ten years by the U.S.A., France, Germany, Italy and Great Britain are shown in tabular form in Appendix II. Even Italian expenditure over this period has been nearly twice our own. The French have, within the past few months, paid us the compliment of a slavish imitation of our own policy and organisation. They have amalgamated into a single great undertaking the congeries of civil air transport undertakings hitherto existing; in other words, they have been compelled to follow ten years later the model we established in 1923; and they have given the new combine a fifteen-year contract which is to run until 1948, with an annual subsidy of  1,200,000 falling to  1,100,000* for the last eleven years a striking contrast with the modest  550,000 which is all Imperial Airways are receiving to-day from the Empire as a whole ( 400,000 only from the United Kingdom Exchequer and the balance from the Dominions and Colonies) and which is at present scheduled to fall substantially and. progressively until the present contracts expire. I have set out in Appendix III the yearly amounts of the subsidies which are payable to Imperial Airways and Air France respectively up to the year 1939, when our main agreement with the former is at present due to expire.4. As regards (ii), viz., the future relations between the Government and the Company, the Cabinet will clearly first want to know whether Imperial Airways can give a good account of their stewardship over the past ten years. I think any impartial critic must agree that they have acquitted themselves very well in the teeth of great difficulties and, in my judgment, great credit is due to Sir Eric Geddes, the Chairman, Mr. Woods Humphery, the Managing Director, and the Board generally.As indicated in the preceding paragraph, our expenditure on civil aviation in general, and on subsidies in particular, during the past decade has been very small as compared with that of our principal competitors. I have mentioned above that the United Kingdom Exchequer is finding this year only some  400,000. The latest corresponding figure for the U.S.A. is  4,700,000 (at par), or about twelve times the amount; those for France. Germany and Italy respectively  1,465,000,  850,000 and  766,000 (at par). the Cabinet Committee which investigated the future of British Commercial Air Transport in 1927 visualised an annual expenditure on civil aviation as a whole (Vote 8 of Air Estimates) of  500,000 for a ten-year period. Six years of that period have now elapsed; but so resolutely have we pursued the path of economy that our total expenditure, actual and estimated, during these six years at  2,632,000 shows an average saving of over 10 per cent, of that figure. When I consider the immense potential importance of air transport to an Empire like our own a point which there is no need for me to labour I confess to some uneasiness as to whether we have done enough. The U.S.A. are pouring out money both on domestic and foreign air transport services; their external ramifications have now spread far afield, not only into the Continent of South America and the Far East, but even into British Colonial possessions, such as the West Indies and Bermuda. There is no doubt that the U.S. Government are taking a long view, and believe that the development of a network of American air lines the world over will secure for the United States both political and commercial benefits that it will at once bring about an enhancement of their general prestige and an expansion of their foreign trade. They have failed so far, despite an enormous expenditure, to wrest from us our maritime commercial primacy; in the sphere of the air, they are sparing no effort to get ahead of us with this newest form of transport, for which they clearly believe there is a great future, and are apparently prepared to find almost unlimited funds for the purpose. I have to contend with a growing volume of criticism, which holds strongly that the United Kingdom has not to date pursued, and is not to-day pursuing, a sufficiently forward policy; but I have been, and remain, reluctant to sponsor* Approximate figures at par of exchange; at current rate the figures would, of course, be substantially higher.
any proposals for substantial fresh expenditure. The policy pursued by the Air Ministry to date has been to endeavour to make commercial aviation self-supporting as early as possible; and I think we can claim that development, if slow, has at least been on sound lines.I may perhaps here remind my colleagues of the figures illustrative of Imperial Airways&apos; progress towards economic operation which I cited in CP. 110 (33). Thus, in 1924-25, the Company&apos;s first year of operation, subsidy was over 63 per cent, of total revenue on their European services. The latest corresponding figure is estimated at 35 per cent. Over their services as a whole, including the African service, only opened last year, subsidy to-day amounts to approximately 50 per cent, of total revenue; corresponding figures for French, German and U.S.A. Companies of the same standing are 79 per cent., 68 per cent, and 65 per cent.This progress is further illustrated in the comparative diagrams contained in Appendix IV.I should explain that the diagram showing British subsidies includes, in addition to expenditure from the United Kingdom Exchequer, the payments to Imperial Airways by the Dominions and Colonies in respect of the African service. The most significant columns are V and VI, particularly the latter. It will be observed (a) that French subsidies are nearly 3 times and German subsidies some \\ times our own, and (b) that the genuine commercial revenue is very markedly higher in the case of Imperial Airways than in the case of the French and German Companies, not only proportionately but also absolutely. That is the true measure of the extent to which Imperial Airways are in process of fulfilling their mandate to become commercially self-supporting at the earliest possible date. I think my colleagues will agree that the Company make an excellent showing in these diagrams.As Sir E. Geddes states in the opening paragraphs of his memorandum, a point has been reached when common prudence no less than the Board&apos;s duty to its shareholders (who have to date only received an average annual return of 3-17 per cent, on their investment) justify them in asking for an indication of the Governments intentions with regard to the Company&apos;s future when the present agreements expire. Without such an indication, they cannot fairly be expected to dissipate their liquid resources by a large-scale programme of re-equipment; yet the early initiation of such a programme is certainly desirable if the Company and, with it, British commercial air transport, are not to lag hopelessly behind developments abroad.5. As regards (iii), I will say no more at this stage than that there are many arguments both for and against an attempt to make Imperial Airways more genuinely an Empire undertaking. Prima facie the idea is attractive, both politically and commercially, but, whilst there is no need yet for undue pessimism, I fear there are signs of the play of centrifugal forces both in South Africa and Australia; and I do not want to see the Company&apos;s present commercial freedom restricted by the direct association of the Dominions in the control of its policy and day-by-day management of its affairs, unless we are going to get tangible advantages in return.6. As regards (iv), viz., the possibility of a largely increased use of air transport for the carriage of mails, this is primarily a matter for the Postmaster-General, who is circulating a separate memorandum on the subject. It raises a number of very complex issues, and I will only say, firstly, that I believe this is much nearer being an immediate practical proposition than is generally realised, and, secondly, that if a workable scheme can be devised, it seems to me that a bold experiment in the carriage of all first-class mail matter on some selected route, e.g., the African route, would be well worth essaying, and might capture the public imagination as a real constructive achievement. I may mention that Mr. Pirow, the South African Minister of Defence and Posts, when in London in the summer, definitely told me that he was attracted to the idea of such an experiment; and he has since confidentially approached Sir E. Geddes with a request for estimates of cost. There are, of course, difficulties to be overcome in any such scheme, but I am by no means sure, in the light of such meagre data as are at present available, that they are insuperable.[9214] b 2
