Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1933.SECRET. CP. 234 (33).CABINET.PROPOSED RETROCESSION TO PERAK OF THE DINDINGSTERRITORY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. THE Dindings Territory has an area of 180 square miles on the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula and a population of 20,000. It comprises the headwaters, creeks, and inlets of the Dindings River together with some small islands to seaward.2. Territorially it is an integral part of the State of Perak, one of the Federated Malay States, but in 1826 it was ceded to the Honourable .East India Company by the Sultan for the purpose of the suppression of pirates who operated from the river and islands in that area. In the Treaty of Pangkor, 1874, by which the British protectorate was established over Perak and a British Resident appointed to the State, the boundaries of the ceded Territory were more precisely defined.3. Piracy on this coast has long been a thing of the past, and the desirability of restoring the Dindings to Perak has been under consideration since the end of last century when Mr. Joseph Chamberlain was at the Colonial Office.4. The Territory is an enclave in the State of Perak, and the Dindings River is the only good access to the sea which the State possesses. In present circumstances it is administered as part of the Settlement of Penang, which for various reasons has been proved to be an inconvenient and uneconomical arrangement. Topographical considerations render administration of the Dindings from Penang far more inconvenient and expensive than would be administration under the Government of Perak. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Dindings for administrative purposes in the Settlement of Penang has become definitely undesirable since the wide extension of customs tariffs in the Federated Malay States, as it facilitates smuggling from British territory into that of the States. The frontier between the Dindings and the State of Perak is a purely artificial one and renders not only customs restrictions, but also such matters as quarantine and immigration, difficult of supervision.5. The conditions which were present at the time of the cession of the Territory to the East India Company have long ceased to exist, and it is only the practical difficulty of finding time and opportunity to put through Parliament the necessary measure to transfer the sovereignty of this area back to the Sultan of Perak which has prevented a step which would of course give the greatest pleasure to the Sultan and would be a fitting mark of appreciation for the steadfast loyalty to the Crown which he and his predecessors have exhibited since the British Protectorate was established in 1874. Perak is the principal State of the Federation which presented this country with H.M.S. Malaya and more recently with a gift of  2 million towards the cost of the Singapore Base. In the administration of the State the Sultan is required by Treaty to act on the advice of the British Resident on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and custom.[9182]Copy No.    aM$
6. The alternative of leasing the Dindings to the State of Perak has been from time to time considered,, but it has been decided, and I agree, that if a change is to be made the full advantage could best be secured by the retrocession of the Territory.7. I am advised that to give effect to the restoration of the Dindings to Perak it would be necessary for a Bill to be passed through Parliament and an ad hoc Treaty to be signed by the Sultan and by the Governor of the Colony on behalf of His Majesty. The local Legislatures would then pass their own measure to apply the Federal and State laws to the Territory. Those of the present population who are British subjects should not cease to be British subjects by virtue of the transfer, and I contemplate that the necessary provision on that point should appear in the Treaty. The Perak system of land tenure would be established, but it would be ensured that the new titles would impose no conditions or obligations more onerous than the present titles. As regards public property in the Dindings, the Governor of the Straits Settlements estimates the value of all buildings, roads, wharves and other property to be about If million dollars (say,  200,000). He considers that it would be too exacting to require the State to pay such a sum, which is beyond its present financial capacity, and would in any case mean the imposition of a serious burden on the inhabitants of a Territory whose interests we desire to assist and not to cripple. He accordingly suggests that the State should not be called upon to pay more than the value of stores, equipment, apparatus, and certain newly acquired building sites, which would amount to a total of 60,000 dollars (say,  7,000). I see no reason to question his advice on that aspect of the question, since it concerns Colonial funds alone.8. After considering the history and the merits of the proposed retrocession of the Dindings to Perak, I have come to a conclusion similar to that reached by my predecessors in recent years, namely, that the case is made out for the restoration of this area, aiid I see no reason why we should any longer refrain from introducing the necessary measure into Parliament.9.   I accordingly ask my colleagues&apos; approval of: this course;(Initialled) P. C.-L.Downing Street, October 25, 1933.
