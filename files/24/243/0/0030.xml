.....^ . , :.a..;.; 15*LEAGUE OF NATIONS. &apos; October 6, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.[W 11281/40/98] &apos; .. .. No. 1.Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin).(No. 907.)Sir, Foreign Office, October 6, 1933.THE German Charge d&apos;Affaires saw me this morning in order to make what he described as a preliminary statement of Germany&apos;s attitude as to the treatment of armaments in way convention now being negotiated at Geneva. Prince Bismarck said that a /sirdlar communication was being made verbally at Rome. He did not know wihether the French Government was likewise being-informed. The statement wa;s preliminary because Germany would be represented next week at Geneva by Herir Nadony (Herr von Neurath is not returning there at present), and, as I understood, the German representative would make a declaration in the bureau. ;&apos;2, Prince Bismarck skid that the basis of Germany&apos;s point of view was the demand for equality. This demand was acknowledged by the joint declaration of the 11th December last year. Germany has from the beginning accepted the British plan, which provided for a five years&apos; convention. She will raise no objection if it is desired to sub-divide the total period, but Germany cannot accept a period of probation; if there is a first stage of two years, equality would have to be applieci to Germany in those first two years.3. As regards the Reichswehr,&apos; Germany was ready &quot;in a spirit of accommodation&quot; to begin its transformation immediately. She could not, however, furnish particulars as to the equipment of the substituted forces until it has been  made clear what concrete measures of disarmament the convention would provide in respect of war material. When it was known what arms would be abolished and what retained, Germany would be able to be more specific about the equipment her new army would need.I-.&apos; Prince Bismarck went on&apos; to analyse the British draft convention in respect of land armaments by dividing these into three categories and to state Germany&apos;s claim under each category.5. As regards arms which would be prohibited in the future, Germany would regard no prohibition as too drastic provided it was universally applied. Germany would even renounce an; claim to classes of arms which the armed States covenanted to destroy in the course of the duration of the convention and the further use of which was internationally forbidden. But Germany wished to know as soon as possible what these arms were.6. Secondly, came the category of those arms, possession of which would be retained though the total in the hands of any given country would be numerically limited. For example, there was the schedule of suggested numerical limits to the air forces of various European countries in the British draft. Germany wished to know whether other nations agreed to these limits. Germany must be granted in the first period arms falling within this category, though the amount which she would have would remain the subject of further discussion. Prince Bismarck called specific attention to a passage in the British White Paper of the 17th November, 1932 (Cmd. Paper 4189, p. 5, &quot; Tanks &quot;), which is as follows : &apos;&apos; The admission of equal treatment would make it impossible to deny, in principle, to Germany the right to possess a limited number of such weapons, but the question whether this should be so in practice, and, if so, what number would be sufficient, depends upon a consideration of the purposes to be served by each national army. In any case, the point is one for negotiation and not for decision in advance of discussions at Geneva in which Germany would take part.&quot;7. The third category was that of arms which in the convention would neither be prohibited nor numerically limited. Here Germany&apos;s position was that if the possession of such arms by others was without numerical limit, no numerical limit could be applied to Germany.   For example, to provide in connexion with[939 f-1]
the transformation of the Reichswehr that Germany might have double the quantity of arms allowed to her under the Treaty of Versailles, would be to treat Germany differently from others. It would amount to a:&apos;continuance - of the Treaty of Versailles and would not be compatible with the security of Germany.8. Prince Bismarck concluded by saying that Germany was willing to give detailed explanations of her attitude during the forthcoming meetings at Geneva, and he asked whether I had any comments to make on what he had said.9. I replied by saying that as his visit was for the purpose of making the above communication, I should, of course, first wish to study it carefully. But two comments did occur to me at once: Herr von Neurath had constantly mentioned the subject of &quot; samples,&quot; and I had understood from the Italians at Geneva that this mode of treatment had been in the mind of Herr von Neurath quite recently. Certainly, he had hinted to me as long ago as last year that a very limited number of such &apos;&apos; samples &quot; was contemplated. Where was the reference to &quot;samples&quot; in the communication now made to. me? Without expressing any view as to samples, it was clear that there was a vast difference between the conception of limited specimens and the claim which was now being-put forward for the first period. This claim ignored1, altogether the plan of stages. Prince Bismarck said that he agreed with :ne ancl that he could not find any application of the method of samples in the present; German statement any more than I could. Secondly, I said that it was wrong to quote the Declaration of the 11th December as though it simply proclaimed equality; on the contrary, the formula was one which referred to the principle hi equality in a regime of security. What was there in the present German statement which dealt with that ? Prince Bismarck replied, that the prssent communication was in reference to the amount and nature of armament. As regards a system of supervision, he confirmed my understanding that Germany raised no objection to a thorough system as long as it was not specially applied to her. I said that I had always appreciated that the control must be of general application, though the detailed arrangements would necessarily greatly -vary according to the circumstances of the country inspected. He agreed, but added that the inspection must have reference to the provisions of the new agreement and not to go into the past. I said that if what he meant was that; thA inspection Could not be a roving-commission about everything and anything, but would be with reference to what the neAV convention contained, I agreed with him, but that of course if a, country under the new convention was not permitted, to have weapons of a certain kind and supervision showed that she had such weapons, it would be no answer to say that she had acquired them before the convention came into force. To this he agreed.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.
