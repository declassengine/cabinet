OP TRADE - AUGUST. 1955.gummary of Reports submitted Tpy members of the Board, of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented In some oases with information from ether sources)*Ilimployraent - The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain on 21st August was 2,411,137, a decrease of 31,038 compared with 24th July.    The number wholly unemployed, Including casuals, decreased &quot;by 12,768, and the number temporarily stepped &quot;tey 18,270.     The number of Juveniles increased by 11,690 owing to the registration of children leaving school at the end of the summer term.     Changes &quot;between 24th July and 21st August in the total numbers on the registers in the different Divisions wereThe estimated number of insured persons in employment at 21st August was 9,857,000 which was 57,u00 more than a menth befopa and 648,000 more- than a year before.     There was a further improvement in iron and steel manufacture, engineering, shipbuilding and ship-repairing, the woollen, linen, hosiery and lace industries, and in the shipping, hotel and boarding-house services.     Employment also improved in building, coalmining, the iron and steel tube and electrical apparatus industries, and cocoa, chocolate &amp;c. manufacture, while in the cotton and Jute industries the termination of local holidays at certain centred led to a reduction of the registered unemployed.Employment declined in the tailoring, dressmaking and bootLondon-11,741 - 4,8253. ^astern 3.

Passenger traffic showed an increase of 12.78fr ;   merchandise, minerals and livestock an increase of 6, 54;*, and coal, coke and patent fuel a decrease of 3.81^S.     The comparisons are affected by the inclusion in the 1933 figures of the Friday and Saturday before August Bank Holiday.New registrations of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) in July, 1933 were 3,837 (21.3^) more than in July, 1933.     The   increase comprised 3,558 private cars and 279 commercial and other vehicles.     Registrations of motor cycles showed a decrease of 1,627 (26.2$).Coal -   The average weekly output for the thirteen weeks ending August 26th was 3,557,.0:0 which was 2.61j;i less than in the corresponding period of 1932, and 6.48j-s lesEs than in the corresponding period of 1931.     The decrease in output in comparison with 1932 is more than accounted for by the incidence of holidays.The number of persons employed for the week ending August 26th was 752,900, and the average number for the thirteen weeks ending August 26th was 759,200 compared with 792,500 for the corresponding period of 1952.

12&quot;Q      - -jt      isper person was 4.69 tons, which was .08 tons higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year.     Goal exports for August were 0,208,000 tons which is 20,000 tons more than in August, 1932.     Bunker coal amounted to 49,0&apos;)0 tons less at 1,135,000 tons.The export position in Scotland, Durham and South Wales showed no Improvement.     In Northumberland there was a fair amount of forward business and the demand for graded fuel remained good.     The home industrial demand has improved in the last two or three weeks.Iron and Steel - There were 73 furnaces in full blast at the end of August compared with 69 at the end of July. The production of pig iron was 362,700 tons compared with 259,400 tons in August, 1932.      The output of steel ingots and castings was affected by the holidays and amounted to 551,300 tons compared with 567,500 tons in the previous month and 361,500 tons in August, 1932.Imports of Continental pig iron were small, the chief supplier being India.     Continental competition in semi-finished steel was less, and most of the available business went to British producers.In Scotland and on the North East Coast there were signs of increased activity, although the demand from shipyards remained unsatisfactory.     In South Wales there was little change, the best feature being an increased demand for sheet and tinplate bars.     In Sheffield there was an increased demand for stainless and special steels, and greater activity was reported in the shipbuilding and armament departments.     Orders have been placed for a number of large heavy forgings for the first unit of Imperial Chemical Industries&apos; coal hydrogenation plant.Electrical Industry - The output of electricity in August was 928 million unite compared with P16 million units
in August, 1952, an increase of 13.7/*.     For the first eight months of 1935 there was an increase of 7.9^i.The percentage of productive capacity in use in the electrical industry during August was estimated at 55;*. Orders for heavy plant were practically the same as in July and the demand for light apparatus showed that the improvement of the last three months had been maintained.Motor Industry -   The position in the home and foreign markets was satisfactory during August except as regards exports to Gpain.     Following on the revision of the Franco-iipanish Commercial Treaty, French, cars are now granted a Customs rebate of 55^4 compared with British cars and thus have an advantage of about 10,i on the selling price.Machine Tools - Exports of machine tools in August were  76,633 compared with  220,310 in August, 1932.     Exports to countries other than the soviet Union were slightly greater, but exports to the Soviet Union were only  27,129 compared with  178,102.     Imports of machine tools were  81,433 compared with  75,270 in August, 1932, possibly indicating a slight revival of industrial activity.Building - The volume of work was well maintained throughout August and showed a considerable advance on last year.     Local Authorities have taken advantage of the opportunity to build cheaply, but there has been little activity in the public works and contracting side of the industry.      Prices ehowed little change.Oilk and Rayon - In Macclesfield the percentage of looms working in August, 1935, was 46$4 compared with 595* in August, 1932.Chemicals - Home trade in alkali during August was better than in August, 1952.     Uales of heavy acids to rayon manufacturers and galvanisers showed a steady improvement.
Dyestuff output was slightly lower than in July, but compared favourably with the average for earlier months of 1933 and with August, 1932.     Deliveries of sulphate of ammonia were normaloThe output of sulphuric acid in the year ended 30th June, 1935 was 3ji less than in 1931/32, and the number of sulphuric acid works dropped from 110 in 1931 to 104 in 1932. There was an increase of about 10^ in the quantity of acid used in the sulphate of ammonia industry, and in the tinplate industry.Other Industries - The soap trade continued to be satisfactory.     Margarine consumption in August was 1,6$ greater than in July and the rise in &quot;butter prices provided a more- satisfactory outlook.     In the rubber industry the demand for motor tyres has been stimulated by the long summer.     The position of rubber footwear in the home market was satisfactory, although duty-free imports from Singapore increased.     In the export market it was impossible to meet the Japanese competition.Finance and Banking - (a) London.    The Treasury Bill rate reached a new low level of 5s/4.95d on 4th August, &quot;but improved to 7s/l.95d on 1st September.     On the Stock Exchange activity was above the normal.     Gilt-edged rose steadily throughout the month.     The Austrian Loan of which  4-g- millions is guaranteed by the Government and the Canadian Loan of  15 millions were heavily oversubscribed.     During the latter part of the month the dollar weakened in terms of sterling, and the latter in terms of gold.     The price of gold reached the record of 15&apos;Js/8-gd per ounce.(b) France. The stability of the franc is now regarded as less certain, being dependent more upon the future of the country&apos;s finances than upon the size of the gold holding.
The &quot;budget deficit for 1934 is expected to exceed 6,000 million francs.     The guaranteed price for wheat has caused trouble among middlemen and has left a large part of the crop unsold, despite the export bounty.(c) Germany.   Activity on the Stock Exchange contracted owing to the holiday season.     There was some improvementin employment and further improvement is expected as the public works programme develops.     Bankruptcies declined by 4Z,4f* in the first half of 1933 compared with the same period in 1932.     The export surplus for July was only Rllc 25 millions compared with RM.64 millions in July, 1932, and unless there is a recovery it will be difficult for Germany to maintain the service of her   foreign debt even under the present transfer restrictions.(d) U.3.A.    The effect of the National Industrial Recovery Administration on retail sales has so far been disappointingj    in the New York district, while wholesale sales in July were 81ji greater than in July, 1952, chain store sales increased only &apos;o%, and department store sales fell by 2$.     Opposition to the trading &quot;codes&quot; has developed in the oil and motor industries.     The Federal&apos;Reserve Banks have increased their &quot;open-market18 operations, after allegations that the N.I.R.A. programme was being held upby the reluctance of the commercial banks to grant credit.Retail Trade - In July the value of retail sales in Great Britain was 1.2; 4 less than in July, 1952.      Uales of food and perishable goods were 3.6j?v less and of non-food articles 1.4/: greater.The Vest End of London showed an increase in sales of 5.7;* while the decline in the North of Ingland was 3.9 i,  in suburban London 0,9$,  the South of England 2.4;$ and Scotland 0.2^.     The chief increases in sales were in hardware, piece
goods and furniture.     There was a general improvement in departmental store &quot;business in all countries for which information is available.Canadian Trade - The recovery in business operations characteristic of the four preceding months was continued in July.     The index of the physical volume of business was 84.1 compared with 82.2 in June.     The wholesale price index showed a gain of 4% over June.     The index of mineral production fell from 95.0 in June to 78.3.     Exports amounted to $51,866,000 compared with  46,472,000.Australian Trade - Exports in July were  6,291,OuO (Australian currency), an increase of  1,406,000 compared with 1932, while imports were S5,410,000 a decrease of  274,000.     Wool prices at the end of August were 15^ above June prices and 4 5^ above August, 1932.     Exports of wheat to the end of August were slightly greater than last year.
