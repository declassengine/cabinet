Iliilfrrii a T3..... 14I ill Mil Ifi ?f      $ ti&quot;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. ) VERY SECRBT.CP.  205  (55), COPY NO.CABINET.PROPOSAL FOR DEALING WITH THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF NEWFOUNDLAND.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.lo I am sorry to have to trouble my colleaguesduring their holiday, hut a decision is urgently needed on the subject of Newfoundland.      Lord. Amulree proposes to r return to the Island on the 8th September in order to draft his Reports and it is essential that he should he acquainted with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government before he sails.Both the Dominions Secretary and I are satisfied that the scheme outlined &quot;below is the test that can he devised to meet a very awkward situation;    and unless I hear to the contrary within a week from now (i.e. lay August 29th)  I shall assume that my colleagues concur and are willing that I should communicate the Scheme forthwith to Lord Amulree.2, Newfoundland^ financial position is undoubtedly   very serious.        She has teen continuously in deficit ever since the War.       Fort he period 1919 to 1929 her   deficits averaged 01^ million per annum.        Since then the deficits have averaged over 05 million and for the current year &quot;beginning 1st July
last the Royal Commission estimate a deficit of 03^ million.       Her public debt is 0100 million on which the interest alone amounts to jE)4f million, or considerably more than half the estimated total revenue.     Even with a return to pre-slump prices it is doubtful whether the Budget could be made t o balance with the present system cf Government and the present burden of debt.It is clear that there is no immediate prospect of help from Canada, either in cash or by any scheme of federation or for the taking over of a substantial portion of the debt in return for a sale or lease of Labrador.It   .appears therefore that we must choose between some form of default or a taking over of the Island&apos;s liabilities by the United Kingdom Government alone, subject to the re-placement of the present Dominion Government by some form of Crown Colony Government administered from Whitehallo3. Any scheme which involved wholesale andunconcealed, default &quot;by an Empire Government must be ruled out of consideration,,      Ho part of the British Empire has ever hitherto defaulted on its obligations- the Dominions and Colonies are closely associated with this country in the minds of investors;  and as a great creditor country standing for the fulfilment of contracts and. for the reconciliat ion of debtI 2,
burdens with capacity to pay through a rise in price levels and not by a scaling down of obliga-tions9 we could not afford to become involved in the rapidly growing circle of defaulting peoples.      In particular,  default on any stock ranking as a  Trustee security under the Colonial Stock Acts, of which New-foundland has issued approximately  2,000,000 would strike a serious blow at the credit not only of the Dominions but of the Colonial Empire with directly in-jurious effects to our own finance and trade.On the other hand there are obvious difficulties; both Parliamentary and financial, in any arrangement which would impose on the United Kingdom Exchequer the liability to make good in full the interest and principal of the whole of Newfoundlands existing debt,  a large part of which was borrowed in New York at high rates of interest since the &quot;far.    The cost of such a scheme would be heavy, probably not less than . f million for an uncertain period, and the criticism which would be levelled against i c would be serious.For this difficult problem I propose, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,  the following solution.4. The underlying conception of myscheme is that a bankrupt who with the aid of his friends pays 20/- in the   is not    disgraced and that the bondholder of a bankrupt debtor has not much to grumble about if he gets his money backus in full,  although he may lose some benefits which would accrue from the continued fulfilment of his contract.
The initial step on which the rest hangs is that the Government and Legislature of Newfoundland should in substance declare themselves bankrupt and unable to carry on and should ask the British Government to take as it were the position of a Receiver.      They would actually ask the British Government to do two things, viz. establish a Government by Commission,  (the nearest approach to form of Crown Colony Government which we have been led to believe Newfoundland would be willing to accept) for the purpose of carrying on essential internal services, until the Island became self-supporting again, and to make such arrangements as may be practicable and just for dealing with the Island&apos;s loan obligations.      I propose that the British Government should accept this.      For the internal purposes of the Island they would set up a Government by Commission.      As concerns the debt, as the resources of the Island are no longer sufficient to meet it they would arrange for the investor to receive his capital back,  in pounds or paper dollars, the repayment taking the form of the issue,  in exchange for the old bonds, of a new stock of the same amount,  in substance backed by the British Government and actually capable of sale at at least its face value.      To the extent that Newfoundland revenues are inadequate to meet the service of this new stock, the British Government would undertake to provide the balance, and they would assure the due redemption of the stock at its maturity date. It would further be intimated that bondholders who do not exchange into the new issue must ex7pect to wait for any interest or repayment of capital on their old bonds until such time,  if ever,  as Newfoundland may have funds available to meet any judgment in respect of them.5. That this is a scheme involving some element of default is beyond question.      There is no legal title for anyone to
pay off the existing bonds at the present time, and in the New York &quot;bonds there is actually an express provision to the contrary.      The substitution of the new stock for the old bond deprives the bondholders in many instances of the benefit for the future of the higher rates of interest which prevailed at the time of issue, and also in the case of the New York dollar bonds, of any benefit still attaching to the gold clause.      However the immediate effect of the announcement of the scheme would be to bring all Newfound-land bonds from a discount (and in some cases a very substantial discount)  to par or a figure very slightly over par.      In the circumstances it is my considered view that the mass of public opinion here and elsewhere would say that taking one thing with another it was a fair deal, and that in fact all the bonds would be converted.&apos;6.      From the strictly legal point of view it is true that any bondholder who did not convert might be able to set up - some kind of action by way of Petition of Right designed to declare the whole operation invalid, or a bondholder in a foreign country might be able to interest his government to demand an international arbitration with the same object. But seeing that other defaults of a far more serious and drastic kind have taken place in other countries without any such action supervening, it seems reasonable to assume that these legal possibilities can be disregarded.It is also true of course that this scheme would provide a comforting precedent for Australia or the new India of the future if it wished to make a &quot;compulsory conversion&quot;. Although the circumstances would differ in vital particulars the precedent would doubtless be invoked.      I hope however that before this matures Australia will have got far enough on its present course for the temptation to be small and as regards the new India we must rely on the financial safe-guards.
I propose one minor exception to the general plan, namely, that  2 millions of sterling loans which are actually trustee stocks should not he exchanged, hut, owing to their special character,  should he preserved in their existing form.7.    Details of the new issue (which would he given trustee status) will of course have to he settled later in the light of market conditions at the time;    hut assuming that the rate of interest will he 3^% and that the stock will have attached to it a Sinking Fund of not less than 1%3 commencing after 3, or possibly 5, years, I  calculate that the  scheme will involve a grant-in-aid during the next 12 months of not less than  250,000, according to the Royal Commission&apos;s estimate of requirements.      But wh en the United Kingdom Government becomes responsible for the administration we may find ourselves obliged to make somewhat more generous provision for social services in the Island than the very exiguous amount allowed at present, and this would involve an increase in the above estimate-        In three to five years&apos;  time, when provision comes to be made for sinking fund, our total liability might rise to perhaps  500^000;    but any substantial improvement of trade would of course diminish this liability.Legislation will of course be required, both for the setting up of the new form of Government and to authorise the pledging of votes of Parliament to meet the deficiency on the   service of Newfoundland&apos;s debt for an indefinite period ahead.8.    Prom the Parliamentary point of view I believe that this  scheme would mitigate many difficulties.      While this country would have saved the credit of the Empire by an operation of a novel kind in unprecedented circumstances,
the  bondholders would have sacrificed both a high rate of interest and the advantages (if any) of the gold clause (which attaches to about one-third of the existing public debt).      The islanders would have lost independent government and they would no longer be in a position to claim very greatly improved social services - on the ground that the  bondholders had been allowed to go on drawing their high interest rates.The practical possibility of introducing such a scheme depends, of course, upon the willingness of the existing Government to abdicate and of the Island to accept Government by Commission.      Here we must rely on Lord Amulree and his colleagues to persuade Mr. Alderdice, the Prime Minister, that it is in the interests of Hewfoundland to accept the scheme with the least possible delay.      If, as I hope, they succeed in doing so, there is just a possibility that the Scheme may be got through before the next interest payment falls due on December 31st.(Intlld.)
