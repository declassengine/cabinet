SECRET.CP.  213 (53). COPY NO.CABINS T.PROGRAMME! OP NEW CONSTRUCTION,  1955. PRQPOSEP ALTERATIONS.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.In the Navy Estimates which I presented for 1933 was a New Construction Programme which I had already laid before the Cabinet last December and which included 1 Cruiser of the LEANDER Class of 7,250 tons and 3 Cruisers of the ARSTHUSA Class of 5,400 tons. This programme constituted the fourth and final instalment of the New Construction Programme due for completion by the 51st December, 1956 under the terms of the London Naval Treaty.The limit of tonnage of our cruisers was adopted by us in the hope that other. Countries would follow our lead and build their cruisers of a similar size and power.Unfortunately this lead has not been followed and in 1931 Japan laid down two 6&quot; cruisers  of 8,500 tons displacement and armed with 15 6&quot; guns.      We had hoped that these two ships would not be repeated and that agreement would be reached at Geneva on our proposals for the limitation of displacement of 6&quot; cruisers which would preclude the adoption of such ships as a class. This hope also was not realised, for
Japan is laying down two more ships of the same dimensions and the United States have recently announced their intention of &quot;building four 6&quot; cruisers of 109000 tons displacement armed with 15    6&quot; guns and this announcement will doubtless stiffen the Japanese attitude.As a result therefore of a combination of the limitation of total cruiser tonnage imposed upon us by the Treaty and of our own vital need for numbers in that class of vessel? we are placed in the position that,  if the programme already approved were adhered to  our new cruiser types would be definitely inferior to those being developed by Foreign Navies.    The Board of Admiralty view the situation with the greatest anxiety and feel that it is essential that our cruisers should be able to stand up to a severe action and that they should be provided with greater armament to meet the larger and more powerful cruisers now being con-structed by Foreign Powers..    We have discussed the question with the greatest care and have been forced to the conclusion that we must alter the programme approved by the Cabinet and Parliament and get out designs for a new and more powerful cruiser. We are having designs prepared for a cruiser of larger displacements  armed with more 5&quot; guns and capable of withstanding 6&quot; gun fire9 but until these designs have been worked Out by the technical departments we shall not know whether we shall be able to order two or three9   (within the limits of tonnage remaining under the London Naval Treaty) at the end of this financial year.
If the tonnage of the new design proves to he such as to make it impossible for us to have three of the new types we propose to have two of the new type and 1 ARETKUSA.This alteration will   reduce our total number of cruisers to 49 instead of 50 5 the number v/hich was accepted for the period of the London Naval Treaty., but this deficiency could be met by including four ships in the 1934 programme and 4 if necessary , by laying one of thenr down early in the year.I am not yet in a position to give a comparative state-ment of the cost of the new programme proposed for 1933? but I do not anticipate that.it will exceed that of the former programme in the aggregate and it -would be kept within the financial provision for the year.As this question was raised during the recess, I was unable to lay it before the Cabinets but the Prime Minister has already signified his approval, and I take the first opportunity of bringing the matter to the notice of all my colleagues.(Initialled)      B.E-M.ADMIRALTY,    S.W.1.,31st Augusts 1933.
