Printed for the Cabinet,  A ugust 1933;Copy No.    4,cabinet.BY the Prime Ministers direction, I circulate herewith, for consideration by the Cabinet, a memorandum on proposed Anglo-Italian conversations regarding disarmament.ROBERT VANSITTART.August 21, 1933.MEMORANDUM.On the 7th August (Rome telegram No. 215, see Annex) the Italian Govern-ment, in discussing with His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Rome, measures to prevent the sale from abroad of police aeroplanes to Germany, stated, in a written communication, that it was difficult to consider this matter save in relation to the general questions raised by the Five-Power Agreement of the 11th December last. They emphasised the urgency of a &quot;solution in conformity with the German situation and with the nature of the problems in question &apos;&apos;; and they asked for the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on these considerations. Further, in a conversation with Sir R. Graham on the same day, Signer Mussolini, in discussing Franco-Italian relations, said that the first question he intended to discuss with the French was that of disarmament; &quot; for unless we could reach some arrangement by which we all disarmed or by which we allowed a certain measure of rearmament to Germany under control, we should wake up one day to find Germany fully rearmed.&quot; Signor Mussolini said that if he and the new French Ambassador could reach some understanding on the subject he thought that the matter was suitable for a meeting between himself and M. Daladier. Signor Grandi told me on the 10th August that, in making this last suggestion, Signor Mussolini was hoping eventually to use the Four-Power Pact. I said that I thought that in present circumstances a more practicable procedure would be a series of two-Power conversations, namely, ourselves and the French, the Italians and the French, ourselves and the Italians. I quite understood Signor Mussolini&apos;s objection to a three-Power conversation.2. These Italian communications raise in a new form the necessity for a definition of our own views on the disarmament or rearmament question.3. The position as regards the disarmament negotiations is that it was decided by the General Commission on the 29th June that the Commission should adjourn until the 16th October, and that in the meantime the President should personally discuss with various. Governments the important questions at issue with a view to facilitate the work of the General Commission when it reassembles. Mr. Henderson has visited London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, Prague and Munich, and has had short conversations with members of the British, French, German, Italian and Czechoslovak Governments. As a result he thinks that he foresees a settle-ment of the fifteen points at issue with two exceptions, but these exceptions unfortunately are the crux of the whole difficulty. They are (1) the duration of the Convention, and (2) the reduction of war material. 6997   [8936]SECRET.O.P. 204 (33).
4. The Cabinet have decided, in-response to a French invitation, that/as the next move in the disarmament negotiations, Mr. Eden should go to Paris on the 18th September to find out what the French are prepared to do in order to obtain &apos; a Disarmament Convention in present circumstances. The actual limits within which Mr. Eden is to carry out this exploration were&apos; laid down by the Cabinet on the 26th July; What we need to find out is whether the French, in their desire, which we believe still exists, to secure a convention, are prepared to make proposals such as will satisfy Signor Mussolini and our public opinion that the Germans are, in present circumstances, not in the circumstances of last December, being offered reasonable terms of settlement. It is legitimate to suggest that in the light of the Nazi threats and of the evidence which we possess of German rearmament, it is not permissible for Germany to expect as favourable a settlement now as when the agreement of the 11th December, 1932. was signed. For by that agreement &quot; equality of rights&quot; was conditional upon&apos;&quot; security,&quot; and the fulfil-ment of this condition has not been made any easier by the general attitude of the German Government since the advent of the Nazis to power. The form in which the French Government propose in these altered circumstances to express their demand for security is an extension of the probationary period in the convention which shall precede destruction of material and the introduction of a system of permanent automatic control. Nothing which has hitherto been disclosed of the Italian attitude gives ground for supposing any unwillingness on their part to negotiate on this basis, though it is unlikely that this alone will go far enough to satisfy Italy that a fair deal is being offered to Germany.5. What then is to be our answer to the Italian proposal ? In view of the vital need of close Italian support in the general European situation, bearing in mind her well-known susceptibilities when any Anglo-French discussions are afoot, it seems important not to confine Mr. Eden&apos;s exploratory visit to Paris. The need for maintaining contact with the Italians was, indeed, recognised by the Cabinet on the 26th July.  The answer might, therefore, be : (1) That as the Cabinet have decided that Mr. Eden should go to Paris on the 18th September to ask the French what are now their intentions in respect to the Disarmament Conference, he will, after reporting to London, visit Rome to discuss the situation as revealed by the Paris visit;&apos;   (2) That, as we have already stated in Berlin, we cannot agree to any form of unilateral German rearmament in violation of treaties.6. There remains the question of the line that we should take in these Rome conversations.7. Signor Mussolini is probably getting increasingly disgusted with and disquieted by Hitler, but until and unless the latter makes himself more impossible it is I think safe to say that his line is to commit himself to no one.8. Quite recently Italy has made it clear to us that she will not at present co-operate openly to bring pressure to bear on Germany (even in the case of Austria where her interests are directly threatened). To Berlin she made it equally clear by launching the Four-Power Pact that she would not run in double harness even with a Nazi Germany. And lastly she has been in no hurry to establish a Franco-Italian entente by negotiating a mutual settlement of grievances on the basis of the Four-Power Pact (although the blame for present inaction in this respect rests mainly on France). Her immediate object in thus keeping her hands free is very possibly to enable her from the very outset, to -play the part of intermediary and honest broker in the struggle which she foresees is on the eve of developing between Germany and France, first in the domain of disarmament, but ultimately along the whole political front. But she realises that her intervention in this capacity would be much more effective if she could be sure of British support and sympathy.  Hence the present approach.9. If such is the policy of Italy it ought to be discouraged for the following reasons : ; 10. Italy in the guise of honest broker would be generally suspected of ulterior; motives, while as for the special position which Mussolini thinks he enjoys: with Hitler, it-is nearer the truth.to: say that Hitler&apos;s obvious anxiety to work in with His Majesty&apos;s Government gives us a better, claim to this dubious
honour than any Mussolini can advance notwithstanding his and Hitler&apos;s common use of, shirts as an instrument of; Government;; (In the special, ease of disarmament His Majesty&apos;s Government-are in a certain measure already &quot;being -forced;to play the role by the mere reason of. the fact that- they are the authors of the draft convention&apos;on which.the Disarmament Conference is working.)       :        x-oi/11. If there is to be any &quot;honest brokerage&quot; it ought in present cirpum-stances to be limited to the ex-Allied Powers inter se, and not be extended to apply as between Germany and one or other ex-Allied Powers. Mr. Eden&apos;s mission to Paris and Rome, for instance, will definitely not have for its object to mediate between Germany and France in the matter of disarmament, but to find out whether there is in present circumstances a basis of agreement between Great Britain, France and Italy. At present the German Government shows a growing tendency to seize every opportunity and exploit every concession in order to push ahead with a truculent and aggressive Realpolitik. So long as this mood prevails the intervention of an honest broker ceases to act as a lubricant, and may easily become either a dangerous irritant or a general source of confusion and insecurity. In a word there are times when this delicate procedure can easily do more harm than good and the period we are now entering upon would seem to be one of, them. At moments such as these our only chance of preventing a dictator situated like Hitler from committing himself irrevocably to a policy of foreign adventure and provocation is to pull him up sharp before his plans have crystallised, and this sharp pulling up can be best and most painlessly done by joint action of the Great Powers.12. In a word agreement or at least a common policy between Great Britain, France and Italy was never more necessary than at the present juncture, and it is in the sphere of disarmament that such agreement between the three Great Powers is particularly urgent. Whatever may be the chances of a Disarmament Convention to-day it is becoming increasingly obvious that close concert between ourselves, France and Italy will be all-important in these closing stages of the conference and afterwards. Therefore, we ought on every ground to try to secure that concert during the forthcoming conversations, but in that case the loyal collaboration of Italy is an essential prerequisite.13. There is no real reason either of morality or of political- opportunity why, in order to secure this triple collaboration, any concessions by ourselves should be necessary. If we can secure it, we shall be in a position in which we may be able to prevent an unauthorised German rearmament, and to uphold respect for the treaty settlement in Europe, and, perhaps, check the natural tendency to adventure in the foreign policy of the Nazi Government. If we fail to secure this concert Italy and Germany between them will play off one Power against the other. This will produce a general state of impotence and insecurity, which will eventually give Germany the opportunity of manoeuvring herself into a position where she will be able to establish a moral right to tear up the treaty and to rearm as and how she likes. In such circumstances the Nazi ambitions will be encouraged, and a new race for armaments is the least dangerous development that can be expected. It would surely be followed by a forcible overthrow of other clauses of the treaties as soon as Germany was strong enough to effect it, or even -so strong, as Sir H. Rumbold told us recently, that other Powers would be unprepared to challenge her.14.   Therefore I would suggest -(a) At the coming conversations with the Italians we should indicate clearly that in our view their sole object is to find a common basis of agree-ment between Great Britain, France and Italy, and that on general grounds we should greatly regret an individualist policy on the part of Italy, which would, in our opinion, achieve no eventual result and might even prove dangerous to all concerned. We should urge where suitable the arguments in paragraphs 11, 12 and 13. Another of our arguments would be that the primary object of the Four-Power Pact, in our eyes, was to prevent any one of the signatories trying to alter the status quo by unilateral action instead of by co-operation, and airy indication that one of the signatories intends to try to do so calls for co-operative action by the other, three. -   /
(b) We should continue to keep the &quot;Anschluss &quot; problem well to the fore,.because it constitutes the main -if not the only question in which Italy and Germany are in disagreement and Italy and France in -agreement.(c) The French Government might also be reminded of the need for suchgconcord as will enable the three Powers to agree between themselves-on a scheme which they can then offer to Germany as an adequate settlement of her claim to &quot; equality of status &quot; for the time being. In doing so, we should put before the French Government the considerations set forth in paragraphs 12 and 13, while bearing in mind the Cabinet decisions of the 26th July.(d) At the same time we should continue to urge on the French Governmentto leave no stone unturned to establish a detente with Italy all along the line (quite apart from disarmament). Even if it costs France some material concessions, Italian co-operation is worth buying and therefore worth paying for at the present time, not only on account of the good it can effect, but also on account of the harm which can in. present circumstances be done by its absence.ROBERT VANSITTART.Foreign Office, August 21, 1933.ANNEX.Mr. Murray to Sir R. Vansittart. (Received August 8.)(No. 215.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Rome, A ugust 7, 1933.YOUR telegrams No. 179 and No. 211 and my telegram No. 203.Italian Government, in written reply to my two communications, state that they agreed in principle with His Majesty&apos;s Government and are ready to enter into agreements with them and with other manufacturing Governments with a view to restraining respective aeronautical industries.At the same time Italian Government point out how difficult it is to consider German Government^ request solely on its merits and not in relation to general questions raised at Geneva resulting from declaration of equality of rights; and how urgent in their view it is to find &apos;&apos; a solution in conformity with German situation and with nature of problems in question.&quot; Italian Government then asked for views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on these considerations.(Text by post.)o
