jSNTIAL.A.C.275.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATiS OF TRADE - JULY. 1933.Summary of Reports submitted &quot;by members of the Board pf Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with information from other sources).Employment -   The total number of persons on the registers of Employment iSxchariges in Great Britain at 24th July was2,442,175, an increase of 4,067 as compared with 26th June.The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, decreased by33*923, but the number temporarily stepped increased by37,990, of which latter figure about 26,000 was due to localholidays.     Changes between 26th June and 24th July in thenumbers wholly unemployed in the different Divisions were:-London........ - 7,954South Eastern..... * 3&apos;79Seuth &quot;Western..... - 147Midlands....... - 2,453North Eastern.  .... - 4,737North Western.  .... * 6,463Scotland ....... + 10,834Wales......... + 1,662The estimated number of insured persons in employment at 24th July was 9,800,000, which was 8,000 more than a month ago, and 549,000 more than a year ago.    4hile the total employment shows comparatively little change as compared with a month ago, there was a further improvement in iron and steel manufacture, in engineering, shipbuilding and ship repairing, metal goods manufacture, the pottery, glass, brick and tile, woollen and worsted, silk and artificial silk, linen, hosiery, lace and leather industries, and in the transport and hotel and boarding-house services, and on the other hand a further decline in the motor vehicle and clothing industries.     Some decline also occurred in the boot and shoe and carpet industries and in building and public works contracting.
Overseas Trade -   Imports in July, 1933, were  53,706,000 as compared with  51,912,000 in July, 1932 j exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  29,847,000 as compared with  29,294,000;    and exports of imported merchandise were  4,324,000 compared with  3,305,000.The excess of imports over exports of merchandise was  19,535,000 in July, 1933, as compared with  19,314,000 in July, 1932.      Transhipments under bond were  1,845,000 as compared with  1,611,000 in July, 1932.The net imports of bullion and specie amounted to  26,863,000.Rail and Road Traffic -   During the four weeks ended 30th July traffic receipts were  527,000 (4.21&apos;Jg) less than in the corresponding period of 1932.      Passenger traffic showed a decrease of 8.00;$, coal, coke and patent fuel a decrease of 6.26$and merchandise, minerals and live stock an increase of 4.42$.Receipts for the 30 weeks ended 30th July, compared with the corresponding period of 1932, showed a decrease of 5*9*1%, the decrease for passenger train traffic being 2.65^ and for the other items 5.99$ and 4.44%, respectively.Registrations of motor vehicles, (excluding motor cycles) in June, 1933, were 4,880 more than in the corresponding month of 1932, comprising an increase of 3,869 private cars and 1,011 commercial and other vehicles.     New registrations of motor cycles showed a decrease of 980 (19.9$) compared with June,1932,Goal -   The average weekly output for the 13 weeks ending July 22nd was 3,763,000 tons, which was 2.1$ less than in the corresponding period in 1932, and 9.89% less than in the corresponding period in 1931.      The average number of persons employed for the week ending July 22nd was 758j400, and the average for the 13 weeks ending July 22nd was 769,500 as compared with 807,800 for the corresponding period in 1932.      The weekly output per person was 4.89 tons, which was .13 tons higher
than in the corresponding period in the previous year.     Goal exports for July amounted to 3,271,000 tons and were 63,000 tons less than in July, 1932.     The amount of &quot;bunker coal at 1,180,000 was almost exactly the same.The export position on the North ^ast Coast and in Scotland shows some improvement, but no change is reported from South &quot;wales.      In the inland districts the demand for domestic fuel is very low and has &quot;been so throughout the Spring and Summer.A recent memorandum submitted on the question of competition of oil with coal shows that since 1918 the world production of coal has been practically stationary, while the world production of oil has increased by 150%.     Approximately 43J5 of this oil is gas and fuel oil which may be regarded as in competition with coal.      The striking effect of the course of the competition is illustrated by the Shipping Industry.     In 1914 only about Z of the world&apos;s shipping tonnage used oil fuel, in 1932 the proportion had increased to about 40$.     The statistics given of the increased amount of oil imported into the main European countries (other than the U.S.S.R.) since the war suggest that oil has displaced an annual consumption of between four and five million metric tons of coal.It should be added that there has also been in some countries a decrease in consumption of coal owing to increased use of water;-power;   and, generally, more efficient utilisation of fuel and power has tended to reduce demand.Xnon and Steel -   The output of pig iron in July, 1933, was 343,900 tons compared with 292,600 tons in July, 1932;    the output of steel ingots and castings was 567,500 tons compared with 438,400 tons in July, 1932.Conditions generally have been quiet owing to the holidays but business has been fairly well maintained, the seasonal decline being less marked than in previous years.      The demand
for semi-finished material is -gradually increasing and the hulk of the &quot;business available has been obtained by domestic producers, although some sales of Continental material have been made at prices below the normal basis prices fixed by the International 3teel Cartel.     On the North .jaet Coast there is little change as compared with June.      In 3cotland business has been affected by the holidays, but the outlook generally is stated to be more favourable.     Demand from the shipyards is poor and there is little immediate prospect of a substantial increase.      In South  ^ales the improved demand for sheet and tin-plate bars is well maintained.      In Sheffield there has been more active demand for basic and foundry pig iron while the market for forge iron shows signs of revival.     Stainless steels are in heavy demand, and the heavy engineering trades are showing some improvement.Shipping -   The monthly freight index (1913 a 100) for July was 77.65 as compared with 77.35 in the previous month, and 71.28 a year ago.      Increases are recorded for several groups, but the rate for the voyage from the Northern Range of the United states to the United Kingdom is lower by 11.81$ as compared with June, and by 27.9$ as compared with July last year.      This decline reflects the fluctuations of the United States exchange and. the restrictive effect on United States exports.Slectrical Industry -   The output of electricity in July amounted to 913 million units as compared with 807 million units inJalyoflast year, an increase of 13.1$.     For the first seven months of the year there was an increase of 7.2$.^ixact figures of the percentage of productive capacity in use in the electrical industry are not available, but it is thought that it has risen to well over 6Q&amp; in the last month. Orders for heavy plant show some improvement over both the previous month and July of last year and there was a continued slight improvement in orders for light apparatus.
Motor Industry -   Generally speaking, conditions in the home market remain favourable, the volume of orders &quot;being satisfactorily maintained for the season of the year.     As regards the export market, overseas distributors are awaiting announcements of the 1934 British manufacturers&apos; programmes &quot;before fully considering the situation arising out of the reductions in the prices of American cars following upon the abandonment of the gold standard by the United States of America.      There is therefore some uncertainty and anxiety as to the immediate future.Machjne ToolB -   Exports in July, 1933, amounted to  69,244 compared with  323,905 in July, 1932.      Of this  34,171 went to the Soviet Union as compared with  280,969 in 1932.     Imports during July amounted to  53,093 compared with  47,073 for July, 1932.      There is no marked change in the general situation.Building Industry -   The improvement shown in recent months has been maintained.     Prices of materials are definitely on the upward trend, particularly as regards copper, tin, lead, linseed oil and timber.     The demand for building materials has increased with a consequent increase of employment at the works manufacturing such materials.   , The improvement, however, appears to be confined to the smaller building operations.    The situation with regard to the larger constructional and public works remains unsatisfactory.     Returns from local authorities in the principal urban areas show that for the first six months of the year building plans amounting to  34,000,000 were passed, this being  8,000,000 more than the amount passed in the corresponding period of last year.Other Industries -   The improvement in the soap trade continues.     Margarine consumption for July increased approximately 4J&amp; over June, but the June figures were affected by the &quot;whitsun holiday.     For the seven months, 1933 shows a
decrease of 11%.     Trade in edible oils and fats has been normal. In the chemical trade deliveries of alkali products in the United Kingdom in July are slightly down on the June figures, but compare favourably with those for July, 1932.     There has been some improvement in the export market.     Home and export demand for chlorine and industrial nitrogen products have been satisfactory, and deliveries of   sulphuric acid have improved. The dyestuffs trade shows a marked improvement in almost all groups.     Exports of cement during the first six or seven months of the year show a relative decline compared with the corresponding period of last year.     The figures of world exports of cement show that for the first four months of 1933 as compared with the corresponding period of 1932, the British percentage of the total trade has decreased materially, while a number of other countries show substantial increases.     Japan has completely captured the markets in certain Eastern and Par Eastern countries and is selling cement in certain markets, c.i.f at prices below the f.o.b. prices of British and Continental cement makers at their works.Retail Trade -   In June the money value of retail sales in Great Britain was 3.6 % less than in June, 1932, the decrease probably being due to the fact that the working period in 1933 was shorter by between one and two days.     Pood showed a decline of 3.3$ for June, 1933, as compared with June, 1932,and non-food a decline of 3.9$.The Vest -md of London showed a decrease in value of 6.4%, the North of England 4.10?, London Suburban 3.4$, the South of England 1.9a and Scotland 1.8%.     All categories of merchandise showed declines eascept Hardware and Fancy Departments Total stocks showed a reduction of 5.5% as compared with last year.      Figures relating to Departmental Stores showed a general set-back during June in all countries for which information is available.
FINANCE AND BANKING-.(a) London.     Two important issues have recently teen successfully floated by Dominion Governments,     These were the Australian Government conversion of four 6$ State loans, amounting in all to over  17 millions, into a Commonwealth 4$ loan issued at 99, and the Canadian Government issue of a 4$ loan at par, the lists being closed almost immediately after opening, owing to heavy over-subscription.A third item of importance was the Government decision regarding the United Kingdom 5-^$ Dollar Bonds that both interest and ultimate repayment would be on a paper dollar basis, coupled with the offer of conversion of each $1,000 of the bonds into  260 of a new S $S sterling bond*   This decision was announced on the 19th July and had an important effect on the movements of the dollar.     At the beginning of the month the dollar stood at $4.35 and on the 19th had reached a value of 04,86 2/3.   Active buying of the Dollar Bonds for conversion and sale on this side produced a sharp reaction.,    In addition the repeated rumours that the U.S9A. Industrial Recovery programme was to be given a chance before any inflation or currency manipulation was resorted to, helped to maintain the value.   Earlier in the month commercial buyers of dollars both here and abroad had decided, in view of the cheapness of that currency, to cover their autumn requirements now;   and even after the rise,  these purchases are believed to have continued so that it is possible that when autumn comes the usual seasonal pressure in favour of the dollar will be found to have been forestalled.Money has continued to remain very easy during the month, overnight balances having been lent at and in one instance for nothings
IS(b) France,     The strength of the franc appears to have &quot;been largely maintained by recent large sellings of French Treasury Bills in London, which at a yield of from 2?o to 5% were I attractive to the London buyer compared with other rates current on the London market.     The buying of francs, necessitated by the taking up of these overseas bills in London, appears to have been partly offset by the French Treasury&apos;s purchases of sterling required to pay off half of the  50 millions banking credit contracted in April.The lists for the 4^5 10-year French Treasury Loan, mentioned in June, have been closed after about one month, subscriptions for the Frs. 2,000 millions offered amounting to Frs. 5,000 millions.     The high cost of the loan and the length of time the offer was left open suggest doubts as to the soundness of the Governments financial position.     The recently published revenue returns for the first six months of the year when compared with the budget estimates suggest that the expected deficit of Frs. 3,200 millions for the full year will be considerably exceeded,(c) Germany.     It is expected that the work-creating, schemes which are to be launched by the Government will stimulate financial activity which at the moment is very low. Imports of cereals for 1933/34 are being forbidden except where an import is compensated by an equivalent export, thus following out the policy of making Germany self-sufficient in cereals.     The law of 9th June forbidding the transfer abroad of the service of external debts, came into force on July 1st. Payments must be made to the &quot;Conversion Office&quot; but 50% is transferable and on 50th July the &quot;Conversion Office&quot; announced that it was taking all measures to facilitate the transfer and had acquired the necessary foreign exchange.     The transfer moratorium has begun to strengthen the Eetohsbank&apos;s holdings of foreign currencies.
(3) U-3.A.     Strong action is being tajcen to stimulate purchasing power in view of the signs which appeared in June that production was increasing much faster than consumption. Trade indices show a slight decline, though considerably less than the seasonal normal.     The collapse in conmodity and security prices in the middle of the month was a welcome corrective to the excessive speculative enthusiasm and does not appear to have destroyed confidence.As regards the dollar, there is a tendency to believe that the present strength is only temporary.     On the other hand, the very good response to the United States Treasury offer of  500 millions        Eight-Year Bonds and the general belief in the possibility of a more ambitious scheme for refunding the Liberty Loans into bonds having a lower rate of interest suggest that inflation is not expected for the moment.Australian Trade.     For the year ended 30th June, 1933, imports were  72,581,000 compared with  56,967,000 for the previous year.     Exports were  121,158,000 compared with  107,936,000 (Australian currency).Bank clearances for Sydney and Melbourne show increases of approximately  170 million and  31 million, respectively, as compared with the corresponding seven months of the previous year.Canadian Trade.     The index of industrial production was 79.8 in June compared with 72.7 in May.     The index of manufacturing production was 85.7 compared with 77.4.     The index of the physical volume of business was 82.2   in June compared with 76.4 in May.     Wholesale prices showed a smaller gain than for the previous month, the index being 67.6 compared with 66.9.On July 14th stocks of wheat amounted to 201 million bushels compared with 134 million bushels at the same date
in 1931-2.     Taking the crop year as a whole exports of wheat have &quot;been satisfactory.     The exports of wheat and wheat flour during the 11 months ended June 30th, amounted to 246 million &quot;bushels compared with 185 million bushels for the corresponding period in 1931-2.     There are indications that this year&apos;s crop will be considerably below average and that even taking into account the carx&quot;y-over, the total surplUB will not be any larger than during 1932-3.Indian Trade.     Imports during June, 1933, were only 869 lakhs and were the lowest for any month, with one exception, since the war.     Exports at 1301 lakhs were 216 lakhs higher than the previous month and 341 lakhs higher than June 1932; they were the highest since March 1932.     Net exports of gold at 549 lakhs showed an advance on earlier months of the year, the highest previously being 512 lakhs in May.Imports in July at 870 lakhs were slightly better than June, but were 252 less than July, 1932.     Exports at 1242 lakhs were somewhat lower than last month, but 322 lakhs higher than July, 1932.     Exports of gold, 251 lakhs, showed a considerable decline and were the lowest since January, 1932.     The balance of trade figures were not so good as the corresponding figures for June but were still high at 637 lakhs.     The wholesale price index number for July was 91 as compared with 88 for June.The price difference between American middling cotton and No.l Pine Oomra has been steadily increasing and in July was 1.23 pence per lb.     It is just two years since the margin between the two cottons fell below one penny and with the recovery to the pre-war margin of between Id and 1-gd, the prospects of sales of Indian cotton are better than they have been since July 1931.The first forecast of the area sown with cotton for the 1933-34 season gives an estimate of 14,031,000 acres which is considerably larger than the corresponding revised forecast of
IS,418p000 acres fov last year.     Some damage to crops was reported on account of deficient rain-fall in some places and excessive rain in others, &quot;but for India as a whole the agricultural outlook is favourable.South American Trade - Argentina.     The first five months show that the value of exports has fallen by 26.4% while imports increased by 8,2?5, the excess of exports over imports being 48 million gold dollars as compared with 136 million for the same period last year.     In view of this decline and the consequent scarcity of exchange, increasing difficulties might have been anticipated by United Kingdom exporters but for the exchange clause in the Anglo-Argentine Convention.     As it is there has been little delay in payment for current business. The position of the Government politically and financially is not difficult as progressive economies in Administration are taking effect and. debt payments to the United States are being reduced by the fall from gold.     Crops so far promise well, although locusts have appeared in certain districts.Uruguay.     Crop failures and the low price of cattle have created exchange difficulties although everything possible has been done to meet current requirements for imports from the United Kingdom.     The Government has recently decreed that foreign debt interest shall be deposited locally in currency to the credit of holders and without allowance for exchange losses.Brazil.     Arrangements are being made to convert frozen milreis due to the United Kingdom into sterling, the latter are being redeemed over 72 monthly instalments.     For the first four months of the year the surplus of exports amounted to  3.1 million sterling as compared with  6.4 million for the same period in 1932.     On the other hand the collection of revenue exceeded that of last year and slightly exceeded expenditure.
Colombia.The cessation of hostilities has improved, matters.     The production of gold continues to increase and the export of oil is now improving,Chile,     The financial position is bad.     Although there is a balance of exports this does not cover current charges on foreign loans which are in default.     The rise in the price of copper may give some relief, but there seems no likelihood of increased consumption of nitrate.     The Government is encouraging every possible form of industry, and the numbers employed on gold washings and production show a remarkable increase.
