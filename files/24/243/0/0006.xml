Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1933.SECRET. Copy No.    35CP. 206 (33).CABINET.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on the recent incident at Basidu, in the Persian Gulf. It is a matter of some urgency to decide upon the line now to be taken with the Persian Government.&apos; .    J. S.September 2, 1933.A SERlOlTS incident recently occurred at Basidu, a naval &quot;station&quot; in the Persian Gulf where the British flag had been flown without interruption for over a hundred years. The station, a small place on the Persian island of Qishm, is regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a British concession, but notwithstanding the long period of uninterrupted tenure the title of His Majesty&apos;s Government to occupy it is weak. For many years no use has been made of the concession and it has been retained solely as a political pawn for use in treaty negotiations with Persia.2. The facts of the incident are&apos; as follows : On the 31st July four Persian naval officers, amongst them the officer commanding the Persian fleet, landed at Basidu from a gunboat and hauled down the British flag in the presence of several witnesses, including a Frenchman and an Italian. The flag was untended at the time, the caretaker being away.3. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tehran that this outrage was committed without the know-ledge or sanction of the Persian&apos; Government or of the Shah. In reply to the strong semi-official representations which Mr. Mallet has made pending the receipt by him of instructions as to the demands to be putaforward officially, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that his Government sincerely deplore the occurrence of the incident and have now, on the Shah&apos;s instructions, issued categorical orders to the Persian navy to avoid all interference with British naval arrangements, to collaborate in all possible ways with His Majesty&apos;s ships stationed in the Gulf, and in future to report for orders before taking any action &apos;&apos; when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind.&apos;&apos; The Minister for Foreign Affairs has further stated that the officer responsible (who, in spite of his position, is an inexperienced and ignorant young man) has been severely reproved by the Shah. Enquiries have also been received from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs as to the nature of other outstanding-complaints against the Persian navy, the competent official explaining that he had received orders to press forward with the settlement of all such cases.4. Briefly, then, the Persian Government have, without waiting for an official remonstrance from His Majesty&apos;s Government, shown a genuine desire to make amends and to guard effectually against a repetition of such incidents in future.5. The question for decision is how far it is desirable to go in demanding from Persia, and attempting to secure, additional visible reparation at Basidu for the incident.   It has been suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should7019   [8994]
demand a ceremony at which a Persian naval detachment should rehoist the British flag and salute it in the presence of British Avarships. It is contended that such a ceremony is essential in order to restore British prestige in the eves of the Gulf Arabs. &apos; &apos; ,X6. Mr. Mallet, who in conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has hinted that an offer of visible reparation at Basidu should be made by the Persian Government, has received a strong impression that any further demands of such a nature would be regarded as an intolerable humiliation by the Shah, whose ungovernable temper is well known and whose power in his own country is completely despotic. Mr. Mallet&apos;s considered view is that an attempt to enforce compliance with such demands (and he would deprecate making demands without the intention of securing their acceptance) should only be made if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to face the prospect of a serious and prolonged crisis in Anglo-Persian relations. This, in the view of the Foreign Office, would entail the following risks : The steps already taken by the Persian Government (see paragraph 3 above) would in all probability be cancelled; the fabric of reconciliation created by the recent exchange of Royal messages between the King and the Shah after the settlement of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s dispute would be destroyed; the chances of concluding a treaty for the settlement of the many outstanding disputes with Persia would be wrecked (preparations for the resumption of treaty negotiations were recently embarked upon with the concurrence of all the departments concerned); the reciprocal undertaking of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Persian Government to respect the status quo in the Persian Gulf pending the conclusion of the proposed treaty would automatically lapse; a state of acute tension would supervene in the Gulf; and Persia would almost certainly insist on the immediate evacuation of the British naval station on the Persian Island of Hen jam (which exists there on tolerance only, having no sound legal basis).7. In addition to all this, Mr. Mallet considers, and the Foreign Office agree with him, that the Persian Government could not in any circumstances be coerced into compliance with the proposed demand for a public ceremony at Basidu; the means of coercion at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government are extremely limited, and the character of the Shah is as stubborn as it is violent.8. On the other hand, the suggestion has been put forward that the very real necessity for restoring the position in the eyes of the Arabs of the Persian Gulf could be sufficiently met by notifying the principal Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government had tendered their apologies for the incident, had taken disciplinary action against those responsible, had issued stringent instructions designed to preclude all possibility of a recurrence of such incidents in future, and had asked for particulars of other complaints against the Persian navy, expressing their willingness to investigate them and to settle all such outstanding cases (most of which closely concern the Arab sheikhdoms). *9. Mr, Mallet considers that the oral statements already made to him by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs would justify a statement to the Arab rulers to this effect, and considers that, if no additional demands are made, he could obtain from the Persian Government an official apology and a written recapitulation of the various steps which they have taken in the matter.10. It seems to the Foreign Office that the additional advantages to be gained by the attempt to secure a ceremony at Basidu would be incommensurate with the risks incurred. They do not underestimate the seriousness of the affront, and they fully appreciate the need for repairing the damage done to British prestige in the eyes of the Gulf Arabs. They consider, however, that if ocular proof is needed, at Basidu itself, of the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to maintain their position and to defend their rights, such proof has already been provided by the rehoisting of the British flag shortly after the incident and the instating of a British armed guard. It seems likely that an announcement to the Arab Sheikhs on the lines proposed would be sufficient to put a stop to the rumours to which the incident is reported to have given rise, and to show the Arabs that His Majesty&apos;s Government have not allowed the matter to pass unnoticed. Indeed, such action would from the practical point of view appear likely to be more effective than the mere staging of a small ceremony in a remote
and sparsely populated corner of the Gulf; and it must not be forgotten that, having regard to the personality of the Shah, if the demand for a ceremony, as the indications show, is strongly resented, the chance of securing Persian acquiescence, whatever steps are taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, must be regarded as remote.11. Looking at the question from the purely practical point of view of deciding which course is the more likely to result in a generally satisfactory state of affairs in the Persian Gulf, it appears to the Foreign Office that to accept as sufficient the categorical instructions issued to the Persian navy, the severe reproof administered to its commander, the spontaneous regrets of the Persian Government and their offer to examine other complaints (with a satisfactory official note), coupled with the proposed corrective statement to the Arab Sheikhs, holds out far better prospects than what may prove a vain attempt to teach their navy a lesson with the attendant risks already enumerated.
