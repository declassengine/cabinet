Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1933.SECRET.CP. 215 (33).CABINET.MALTA.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 7th July the Cabinet gave their general approval to certain proposals laid before them by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself with the object of checking the Italian cultural propaganda in Malta which has caused His Majesty&apos;s Government considerable anxiety in the course of the past eighteen months (Cabinet Conclusions No&apos;.&apos; 44&apos; (33) of the 7th July). The Cabinet decided in particular that, as a first step, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome should make the most serious representations to Signor Mussolini, but in such a manner as to endeavour to enlist his co-operation in checking activities to which, as the Head of the Government of a friendly State, he could not but disapprove. It was decided at the same time that Sir R. Graham should explain to Signor Mussolini (if possible in reply to an enquiry) what steps His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment expected him to take, and within what time limits. If Signor Mussolini accepted this programme, the question would be settled; if he did not, it would be necessary for the Imperial Government, by means of legislation in Malta under the powers reserved to the Governor, to enforce that programme themselves, and it would then be necessary to inform Signor Mussolini that such enforcement would take place.The representations were duly made to Signor Mussolini on the 25th July, and were on the whole well received. In reply, Signor Mussolini gave the following specific undertakings : (a) No new Italian schools or institutes would be founded in Malta.(b) No British subjects would in future be admitted to membership of Fascistclubs or organisations (e.g., the Balilla), and the British subjects then belonging to those organisations would be expelled forthwith.(c) Membership of the Institute of Italian Culture (the fons et origo of thepropagandist movement) would be confined to Italian subjects  though it would be difficult to prevent non-Italians from attending lectures, conferences, &amp;c.On the negative side Signor Mussolini declined to close the Institute of Italian Culture altogether, and he also affected to consider that there was nothing irregular in the conduct of the Casa Paula School (which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment desired him to close) or in the extension of the Umberto I School (which His Majesty&apos;s Government desired him to restrict to its pre-1932 scope). At the same time it was. intimated to Sir R. Graham that these refusals were to be taken to mean that the Italian Government would prefer His Majesty&apos;s Government to take the necessary action themselves. Sir R. Graham warned His Majesty&apos;s Government, in this connexion, that they must expect serious repercusions on Italian opinion if they closed the Institute of Italian Culture, and that he had the impression that Signor Mussolini could not believe that they seriously intended to do so.As a result of a review of this situation by the Foreign Office and Colonial Office, in consultation with the Governor of Malta, the following course of action was provisionally agreed upon : The Governor should return to Malta in the near future and enact the ordinance for the control of aliens, referred to in paragraph 3 (i) of the Cabinet 7017   [8990]Copy No.38

Copy No.CP. 215 (33).CABINET.MALTA.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 7th July the Cabinet gave their general approval to certain proposals laid before them by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and myself with the object of checking the Italian cultural propaganda in, Malta which has caused His Majesty&apos;s Government considerable anxiety in the course of the past eighteen months (Cabinet Conclusions No. 44 (33) of the 7th July).

Conclusions above mentioned, which would have the practical effect of making all foreign schools and institutes in the island subject to licence. He should, further, deliver a warning to the Maltese Ministers regarding the pro-Italian tendency of their policy. The licensing system would then be applied in such a way as to (1), subject, the continuance of the Institute of Italian Culture to a guarantee that its activities would exclude all propaganda with a political tendency, and that a representative selected by the Governor should be a member; (2) effect the closing and restriction respectively, within a period of nine months, of the Casa Paula and Umberto Schools, but in as considerate a manner as possible in the interest of the pupils who would be displaced; and (3) exclude British subjects from the Balilla and kindred organisations. It was decided that Signor Mussolini should be informed in advance of the proposed action, which would not, however, be discussed with His Excellency.Before proceeding with these measures, however, it was thought well again to consult Sir R. Graham, who is on leave in this country, as to the likelihood of their causing serious exasperation to Signor Mussolini and to Italian public opinion and press. As regards the latter, the Italian Government had under-taken to do their best to restrain the newspapers in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government taking action against Italian institutions in Malta, but they had made no secret of the fact that the process of restraint would be difficult. And in view of the European situation it was felt that matters could not be pushed to a quarrel with Italy without a further reference to the Cabinet.       , ,    sir R. Graham has now replied that the proposed action, if suitably presented to Signor Mussolini, would probably not cause the latter serious annoyance, but that he can give ho guarantee whatever as regards its effect on the Italian press and public opinion and thinks indeed that action against the schools would produce a rather violent reaction, however unreasonable such a reaction might be. An extract from Sir R. Graham&apos;s letter is reproduced as an annex to this memorandum. In these circumstances I have no alternative to inviting my colleagues to consider the situation afresh.As the Cabinet will be aware from the Cabinet Paper No. 212/33, circulated on the 30th August, the campaign which is being directed by Germany against Austrian independence has produced a critical situation which can only be surmounted in safety by close co-operation between the French Government, the Italian Government and ourselves. A breach with Italian public opinion at the present juncture would have serious, if not disastrous, effects, as the handling of Italy over the German problem is proving to be a difficult matter at best, and might become impossible if complicated by an inflammatory press campaign over 2\Ialta. At the same time the Governor of Malta has emphasised his view that, so far as the local situation in Malta is concerned, the need for curtailing Italian propagandist activities still remains urgent. Nevertheless, on balancing the respective risks, I feel bound to suggest, for the consideration of my colleagues, that direct action against Italian institutions in Malta should be suspended temporarily until the international situation is clearer, and that in the meantime the &quot;possibilities of bringing local influence to bear on the Directors of the Institutes, &amp;o, as suggested by Sir R. Graham, should be further explored. I would add that there would be no objection, from the international standpoint, to a warning being delivered to the Maltese Ministers.I should add that while the Secretary of State for the Colonies has agreed to the circulation of this memorandum, it is not to be taken as an expression of our joint views.J. S.September 2, 1933.
&apos;ANNEX. :;     ; ^\&apos;^u braExtract from a Letter to Sir R. Vansittart from Sir R. Graham, August 26, 1938.AS regards the reaction on Italian public opinion, I can, unfortunately, give you no guarantee at all. Italian public feeling on the question of Malta is extremely sensitive owing to the absurd but! ineradicable&quot; conviction that the Island is inhabited by a race of Italian culture and language, if not of origin. I should expect the reaction when the Schools are closed to be rather violent. Suvitch has promised to do what he can to moderate the Press, but he added that it would be no easy task. You will remember that, on a previous occasion, Grandi told me that any attempt on his part to control the Press on the Malta question would mean his being swept from Office. Eacist Governments, like other Govern-ments, desire to retain their prestige and popularity, and the Italian climb down in Malta will mean some loss to Mussolini both in prestige and popularity. Much will depend on (1) the tact with which the closing of the Schools is effected, (2) the line taken by the Maltese Government and opposition Press in the Island, which will be reflected in the Italian Press, and (3) the influence which our Embassy in Rome will be able to exercise at the proper moment. In any case, the risk has to be taken.In this connexion I have a suggestion to make. So far it seems to me that the British Authorities in Malta have allowed the Italians to go to any length, indeed, most undesirable lengths, and have then expected the brake to be put on from Rome. Italians as a rule are very amenable to personal influence. I do not know what the Directors of the Italian Schools and Institutions in Malta are like, but the Consul seems a reasonable man. I would suggest that if the Governor or Vice-Governor could enter into personal touch with these people, explain to them how impossible Italian propaganda has been, and inform them of the exact lengths to which they can in future either go or not go, the results might be more satisfactory and produce less friction than any obtained through representations in Rome.
