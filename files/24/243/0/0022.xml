September 25th,  1933,
VERY SECRET.UNITED STATES WAR DEBT NEGOTIATIONS.(l)      The United States Government have agreed that Sir P. Leith-Ross shall go to Washington at the beginning of October for preliminary discussions.      He sails for New York on the 27th September and it is therefore necessary to consider what instructions are to be given to him by the Government.(2)      His Majesty&apos;s Government have frequently declared that the general cancellation of war debts would, in their view, be the wisest and best course for all the world..     But though opinion in America seems to have made some progress in this direction, there is no prospect that Congress will yet be ready to accept cancellation.(3)      If therefore we are to get a settlement it must be by means of some compromise.      Default might have awkward repercussions on our own position as a creditor and should be avoided if possible.      To avoid it, we must be prepared to pay a certain price;    on the other hand we must not allow our anxiety in this respect to be exploited.      If the United States Government insist on a continuance of payments, they must be prepared to scale down our existing obligations to an amount which will not be a serious burden to us.(4)     When Sir P. Leith-Ross was in Washington with the Prime Minister in May, a scheme for a settlement on these lines v/as outlined to him by American experts and unofficial discus-sions which took place during the Monetary and Economic Con-ference in July suggest that this scheme still holds the field.(5)      The main feature of this scheme was that the British war debt should be reduced to a somewhat smaller capital sum and that Great Britain should accept liability to redeem an equivalent amount of the United States internal debt in 50 years.      The Sinking Fund required for this
purpose would &quot;be reinvested in United States securities and would accumulate over the 50 years, so that the annual payment would not exceed about   1% of the nominal liability. The American experts at first wanted a proportion of the liability to be covered by a gold deposit but did not press this proposal, which would, of course, be totally unacceptable to us.    The American experts also agreed that the Sinking Fund payments should not begin for 3 years.(6) Apart from the question of the gold deposit the chief drawback to this scheme is that it is too ingenious.    Suppose for example, that it was agreed to reduce the British War Debt to $2,250 million, the United States Government would represent to their public that  .Great Britain was in fact paying $2,250 million, whereas we should have  to explain to our public that we had in fact undertaken to pay, after a moratorium of 3 years, a 47 year annuity of approximately $IQg:. million of which the present value on the tables amounts only to about ,3400million.    If a settlement on these lines is r reached in November, it will inevitably be a matter of comment and controversy in both countries until it comes before Congress in the following January and it is bound to be embarrassing if each side has to give a different version of the settlement in the course of this controversy.      If, however,  the United States Government remain convinced that a settlement in this obscure and complicated form is more likely to be acceptable than a frank and clear cut solution, we shall have to consider it on its merits.(7)    If we are to accept this system the main question for decision is of course what annual payment we are prepared to offer.    At one time at any rate President Roosevelt, moved by the biblical denunciations of usury,was willing to waive any claims for interest and on this
&quot;basis we could produce figures to show that the outstanding British War Debt is approximately 2,259 million dollars. Under the system discussed at Washington the Sinking Fund required to redeem this amount of debt after 50 years, on the assumption that it will accumulate at 3^%, would be about^ Sl9-i: million (some&apos; 4Jr.million at 4.50) a year from 1935/37 onwards.      The question for decision is whether H.M. Government would be prepared to close with such a settlement if the United States Government are willing to offer it.(8) Our aim has been on the one hand to preserve the Lausanne  Settlement and on the other not to commit ourselves to larger payments to America than we are likely to receive from War Debts and Reparations due to us by Europe.    It is not possible to make any exact comparison owing to the different nature of the Lausanne Settlement with Germany and the proposed War Debt settlement with the United States, but broadly speaking one can say that a settlement on the lines suggested would not be far off the Lausanne terms0 An attempt to compare such a settlement with Lausanne is made in the Appendix.(9)    The comparison with tb.3 Lausanne Settlement is, of course, somewhat theoretical as Germany has never ratified Lausanne and seems unlikely to be willing to pay any more reparations.    We should have the right to claim payment from France, Italy and our other debtors and we should certainly claim that they should not treat us worse than they treat the United States of America.    There is some reason to think that the French Government would not refuse to consider payment on a reduced scale, and I have no doubt that some further payments would be forthcoming from the Dominions but it would be unwise to count on the possibility of collecting the full amount required.    If we conclude a settlement, therefore, we should be prepared,  if necessary
to make payment,  in part or in whole,  out of our own pockets.(10) As regards France, the Americans would probably be prepared to offer to France a similar settlement to that which they might make with us (subject to France paying up the instalment due on 15th December last and also a token payment in respect of the instalment due on 15th June last). It seems likely that the French would be willing to accept such a settlement and to take the risk of collecting the sums paid from Germany.(U) I feel that if the United States Government are prepared to accept a settlement costing not more than 020 millions a year - however unsatisfactory to us the form may be - it would be wise to close with it rather than leave the much heavier burden of the existing agreement hanging over our heads.      If the President would agree to submit such a settlement to Congress in January we need not greatly concern ourselves about any decision which Congress might reach.      We should have shown to our public opinion and to the world as a whole that in our genuine anxiety to avoid default we had offered a composition which was considered reasonable by the Head of the creditor State and no one would expect us to go beyond that offer.(12)1 do not anticipate that we should have any difficulty in obtaining a 3 years moratorium and this would mean that under the terms of the settlement we should have nothing to pay on the 15th December next.      Clearly we should be  justified in suspending payment altogether pending the consideration of the new settlement by Congress.(.13) There is one other stipulation which I regard as essential..      If we are again to be the first to negotiate a new settlement with America, we must be protected against the possibility that other debtor countries subsequently
get more favourable treatment, either as the result of an agreement with the U.s.A.  Government or simply by withholding payments.      I should propose to guard against this possibility by inserting two provisions:    first,  that after a period of say five or seven years the agreement should be reviewed in the light of the payments actually made by other debtors, and, second, that if. at any time more favourable terms are granted by the United States Government to any other debtor they shall be automatically extended to us.(I4)lf a permanent settlement, proves impracticable there are two further alternatives (assuming that we are not prepared to join with the French in a complete suspension of payments) which might be tried:-(a) a temporary settlement for five or seven years,  costing not more than 020 millions a year.(d)    a further token payment of 010 millions on 15th December and at each succeeding instalment date, till American public opinion accustomed itself to this scale of payment. These alternatives will be discussed if necessary, but both of them are subject to the disadvantage of leaving the future uncertain and a final and permanent settlement is much to be preferred.
1e    The Lausanne settlement with Germany.After July, 1935, if German credit is restored to a 5-gfb basis (or, after 1937 by a B.I.S. decision in practice involving German assent) Germany is to issue 5% Bonds for 3 milliard gold reichsmarks (&quot;of the present standard of weight and fineness&quot;) s $715 million gold, nominal value.    If the net price of issue is 90%, the cash proceeds ^ $644 million gold.Fifteen years after the Lausanne Agreement, the Bonds which the Bank for International Settlements has not been able to negotiate are to be cancelled.The Annuity payable    by Germany to the bondholders would be 180 million reichsmarks s $43 million gold for 36 years.It will be seen that no precise figure can be given for the receipts of the Creditor Powers under the Lausanne Agreement, since it is impossible to foretell when the Bonds will be issued, or at what price, or whether they will be issued at all.    The simplest assumption is that a cash sum of  135 million gold will be received in 1935.The distribution of this sum between the Creditors was left unsettled.    It will presumably be distributed among them in proportion to their War Debt payments and our share (direct or through France etc.) may, as a hypothesis, be put at 40% i.e,  54 millions gold or, say  72 million sterling.Comparison of the &quot;Warburg Plan&quot; for settling the British Debt to the United. States of America with Lausanne terms.
2.      Our payments to United States of America.The settlement which we contemplate with America would involve 47 annuities from 1956 of about $19^ million. On the 3i$ Tables this is equivalent to a capital payment in 1936 of $440 million, which equals  90 millions sterling if the pound is worth $4.86.    On this basis, which includes various optimistic assumptions, we should be covered by Lausanne to the extent of 8Q? .
