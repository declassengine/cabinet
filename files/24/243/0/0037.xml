The Export Credits Scheme derives statutory authority from the Overseas Trade Acts, 1980-30, which empower the Board    I of Trade with the consent of the Treasury and after consultationj with an Advisory Coamittee of bankers, industrialists, etc., appointed for the purpose, to give guarantees in connection with the export of goods wholly or partly produced or manufactured in the United Kingdom, other than munitions of war. This authority has been frequently renewed, and under the last Act the power to give fresh guarantees was extended for a period of five years which,will expire on the 31st March, 1935.    I now propose that the Acts should be renewed for a further period of five years from that date.     I should add that the question of-&apos; extending the Export Credits Scheme to munitions of war is now &quot;before the Cabinet Committee on Private Armament Industry.2. On the occasion of each previous renewal it has been recognised that adequate notice must be given to traders and others of Government1s intention.     Much of the business facilitated by the Export Credits Guarantee Department is the subject of prolonged negotiations.     Many of its contracts cover shipments for a year ahead and are renewable for further periods.     In the engineering industries especially it is necessary for firms to know many months in advance of the actual signature of the contract whether they will be able to look to the Department for assistance.     It is important therefore that an early decision should be taken and if the
decision be in favour of continuance, I would urge that the necessary legislation be introduced at an early date and passed through all its stages before next Easter,Part II,,\3, The Scheme in its present form dates from the 1st July, 1926, and since then has facilitated over  45,000,000 of exports without any cost to the taxpayer-. Indeed it has contributed to date a substantial sum to the Exchequer.4. The value of contracts which the Department has assisted exporters to secure is best shown by the following table. -I, Short term credits for consumablegoods and raw materials..............  22,250,000II. Medium term credits up to five years  -or so for engineering transactions ...     5,000,000III. Russian business...................... 19,000,000 46, 3b0.,000rt Term 5. The exports facilitated by the Department in thislits.field show a steady increase year by year which is the more remarkable when the fall of prices and the general reduction of British exports is taken into account.     The Department&apos;s Advisory Committee have pursued in this as in other fields, the policy of proceeding slowly so as to retain a thorough aastery of the position and they look forward to a continuous and perhaps a considerable expansion.    They have continually devised new methods of making the facilities more useful to exporters and recent experience in this respect is very encouraging.     The wide spread uncertainty about the international position makes these facilities of particular value to traders and the Department&apos;s activity is tangible evidence of Government&apos;s readiness to help export trade within reasonable limits.
um Term        6. The need of manufacturers for some form of w.assistance in the granting of credits up to five years was emphasised by the Mac I Lilian Committee who pointocl out that the machinery for financing such business is more highly developed abroad than in. this country. Public contracts can now in most cases be obtained only if the contractor is willing to accord credit terms extending over a period of years.The City which was at first rather sceptical has shown in recent years a growing appreciation of the services which the Department can render in this field and tho demands on the Department for sound business have considerably increased. A number of important contracts have beon secured for this country through co-operation between the manufacturer, his banker and the Department, which would otherwise almost certainly have gone abroad, e.g.Installation of automatic telephone system in Poland  300,000 Installation of motor omnibuses In Cairo  156,000Electrification of Warsaw Suburban railways,  1,430,000Locust fencing for the Argentine Government.  400,000&quot;Whilst contracts for Electrification of the Central Railway of Brazil      1,600,000 andInstallation of automatic telephones in Lithuania        170,000 are in the final stage of negotiation, sian 7. The Scheme was extended to include trade with russian August 1929.    The total amount of credits to Russia guaranteed by the Department since that date is  19,000,000. Of this over  11,000,000 has become due up to date and has been punctually paid.
At present the volume of Russian business being transactedjby the Department is quite small.   Its future extent probably depends largely upon the outcome of the present commercial negotiations with the U..S-S.R.On the other hand the business with the rest of the world (excluding Russia), after some contraction in 1931, has in the lest two years shown a progressive and continuous tendency to increase as the above examples indicate, al 8. It has been the policy of the Department&apos;s AdvisoryCommittee to assist exporters to expand trade on sound lines rather than to encourage highly speculative business which without Government guarantees, might not have been undertaken. It is to this policy that the Department owes its present satisfactory financial position.The Department charges a premium for each guarantee and uses this soucce of income to meet its liabilities.    Owing to the careful selection of its business by the Advisory Gommittee most of the guarantees run off without any call being made on the Department.    The net amount paid by the Department on its guarantees under the Present Scheme (i.e. in the seven years ending 30th September, 1933) is some  250,000.    After making these payments and defraying all its expenses of administration the Department has a ccumulated a surplus amounting to nearly  1,500,000.The Departments liability on any transaction is limited to a proportion of the value of the goods exported and the total liability outstanding at any time fluctuates considerably as old obligations run off and new commitments are undertaken.    On the 30th September last the total outstanding liability had fallen below  7,000,000, which is considerably lower than it had been in the recent past or is likely to be in the near future when contracts now under
negotiation are completed.    The Advisory Committee are of opinion that no undue anxiety need be felt about the liabilities now outstanding.It seems reasonable therefore to expect that if the Departments affairs continue to be a dministered with the same care as in the past the Scheme should not involve any net charge, upon the JSxchequer for a considerable time, if at all.W. R.Board of Trade,13th October, 1933.\
