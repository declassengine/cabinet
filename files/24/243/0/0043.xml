(R).-o -o -o -o-o-o -o-o-I MEDIATE.My telegram No.210 (of 17th October:     Disarmament)0 The question whether the Disarmament Conference can continue quite unaffected by the absence of Germany re-quires full considerations     The British Cabinet is examin-ing this matter in all its apsects and would urge that no premature declaration should be made one way or the other in Paris,     We feel that by avoiding premature announce-ment we shall avoid the risk of disrupting the firm attitude of disapproval of Germany&apos;s withdrawal which is, at present, shown by practically every government of the world.2o Questions such as the following present them-selves and must be considered and answered before a de-cision and announcement are made:(a) Is France prepared, in completing the Conven-tion in Germany&apos;s absence, to state publicly and in de-tail the disarmament she would undertake, if Germany accepts the convention, as fully and in the same terms as she has stated this privately to us and others in recent conversations?(b) What is the risk of the ultimate form of Con-vention arrived at in Germany&apos;s absence falling short of what will be regarded by much world opinion as an adequate contribution towards disarmament?(c) If a Convention is negotiated on bases alreadyrejected....
Ci   j? (V V W2crejected publicly by Germany, would not the presentation to her of such a Convention have the effect of forcing her into an obstinate defence of her present attitude and thus perpetuating- the present state of tension?(d)     What is the risk of announcing oar intention to reach an agreed Convention in Germany1s absence and then finding that the points of difference bebween other members of the Disarmament Conference are so numerous and so great that agreement cannot be reached?     In this con-tingenoy Germany will at once declare that disagreement proved that there was no real intention on the part of others to agree with hero3c     You will understand that the British Government has not reached conclusions on any of these matters and I formulate them for M. Daladier&apos;s consideration because .it seems essential that answers on these and other points should be reached&apos; in co-operation before the Bureau and General Commission meet.40     Please see M* Daladier, put these considerations to him and inform me of the result as soon as possible0Repealed to Rome No.353.. .    . &apos;.&apos;v&apos;-&apos;&apos;.&apos;.&apos;v&apos; ; :-  . .^      \:&apos;b.- -v.v :////is
FOREIGN OFFICE,  3.W.I. Att20 19th October, 1933.My Lord,I saw the French Ambassador this afternoon and repeated to him the, reflections and questions which we had. asked Your Excellency to put before the French Government (see my telegram No. 211).I then asked his Excellency whether he had. had any intimation from his Government of their view as to the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference resuming as soon as Wednesday of next week.    I knew that both M, Paul-Boncour and M. Bonesh had taken the view in Geneva that this date allowed of an insufficient interval.   If this were still M. Paul-Boncour&apos;s view, and he wished for a longer postponement, I should be happy to know it.   We were asking a similar question of the Italian Government, end, if it was found to be the general view that a longer adjournment was desired, it would clearly bo preferable that this should be intimated to i-/ir. lienderson within the next day or two rather than that we should all meet at Geneva and find then that we were not ready to go ahead. The Ambassador undertook to consult his Government and inform me shortly of the result.I am, with groat truth and respect, My Lord.Your Excellency&apos;s obedient Servant, (Signed)   JOHN SIMON.Excellency The Lord Tyrrell, G.C .11.G., K .C .L .,
A. o 0Telegram (en clalr) from Lord Tyrrell (Paris),D.   20th October, 1933.R.   21st October, 1935. No, 246. SAVING,URGENT..Owing to the Parliamentary crisis I was only able to see il. Paul-Boncour this evening.     He promised to give the crucial questions raised in your telegram No . 211 of yesterday I his immediate attention.2.    In the meantime it would, help him considerably if you could let him know whether in your opinion it would be advisable for the Bureau to decide next Wednesday that the discussion which was to take place next Thursday by the . Commission had better be adjourned until Immediately after, the German elections.3.   He expressed as his personal opinion entire agreement with your view that a failure to reach agreement at Geneva would considerably strengthen the German opposition to the Disarmament Conference and -thereby almost justify her retreat from It.   It seemed therefore essential to him that before we tjxife^ge in a discussion at Geneva for the elaboration of a convention there should be perfect agreement between England -  and Prance on the essentials of such a convention. To obtain such agreement he personally favoured the publication of the concessions Prance was prepared to make and to which her Ministers had agreed in their conversations with you on September 22nd.   This again will require time for the question to be considered by. his Cabinet.   He would be grateful to you if you could let him have as soon as possible an answer to his question; if you favoured an adjournment to be decided by the Bureau on Wednesday it did not seem to him necessary for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs to attend tho meeting.
A, 4.To_____PBAJiCCode telegram to Lord Tyrrell (Paris),Foreign Office.   21st Octoberj 1933, No. 213,      (R).10.00 p&amp;m,Your telegram No, 243(Saving) /of October 20th./.1,     French Ambassador called this morning to report telephone conversation he had just had with French Minister for Foreign Affairs,.   . Since he spoke to you it had occurred to PI, Paul-Boncour that the General Commission could only be adjourned by itself,     As to this we and the Italians agree as you win see from my telegram Nou 337 to Rome which also furnishes you with material for reply to other question raised in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference,2,     We should be very grateful if II, P..-ul-Boncour would at once invite Dr, Benes to propose adjournment,3,     At this stage I am unable to express any views regarding attendance of Ministers on Thursday,Repeated to Rome No. 333, Berlin No. 197 and Washington No. 445,
FOKuIGIT OFFICE.October 19th, 1955.Sir,This afternoon I asked Signer Vitetti to ascertain the views of the Italian Government as to the expediency of postponing the meeting of the Bureau of the-Disarmament Conference, now arranged for next ?/ednesday5 and that of the General Commission the following day,     I made it clear to him that I was not at present dealing with the larger question of the future course of the Disarmament Conference, but merely with the immediate time-table.     If the Italian Government took the view that next 7/wednesday was too soon, it would be helpful to know this at once rather than wait until we all got to Geneva.     The Counsellor of the Italian Embassy asked what our own view was and I said that we were studying the larger question in all its aspects and this would take some time, but that if the Italian Government felt that the meetings next week were in any case too soon, and if this were the general view, we should prefer that l.jr. Henderson should be so informed at once.I am, with great truth and respect, . : -&apos;. &apos; &apos;   Sir,   , ;:Your Excellency&quot;s obedient Servant, (Signed)   JOHN SILON.excellency the Right HonourableSir Ronald Graham, G.C.B. , G. C.L.G. ,
FOREIGN OFFICE,&apos; S0WQ1. 20th October, 1933.B32,Sir;-The Italian Charge&quot; d1 Affaires called this evening to give the reply of his Government to the enquiry put to him by the Secretary of State yesterday,,Signor Vitetti said that he had received a tele-gram from his Government stating chat they were entirely in accord with the view that a meeting of the General Commission on October 26th would be useless and they suggest that it ought to be postponed until after Christmas and meet probably at some date during the first ten days of January0The Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs have, however, drawn attention to a question of procedure as follows:-They point. out that only the General Commission has the power to decide upon a postponement of its own meeting or to fix another date than that already decided upon by itself.   The Italian Foreign Office suggest, therefore, that we may anticipate that Mr,Henderson will almost certainly require the approval of the majority of the governments represented on the General Commission before he could alter the arrangement approved at the last meeting of the General Commission.   Signor Vitetti&apos;s instructions also referred to the procedure which was followed this summer when it was decided, after consulting.coo..Excellency The Right HonourableSir R0 Graham, G6CoB0, G,C0M0G., GoCf,Vo06p etc-,,     etc.,     etc.
9 7 92,consulting the different governments by telegraph, to postpone the meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations,   The procedure in the General Commission is based upon that cf the organs of the League of Nations, and the procedure followed by the Assembly on that occasion could be invoked by Mr0 Henderson as a precedent0   But the time is now so short that any step in this direction would have to be taken at ohce0I am, with great truth and respect, bir,Your Excellency&apos;s obedient Servant, (Signed)   JOHN SIMON,
. B0 3o.Code telegram to Sir R, Graham , (Rome).Foreign Office.   21st October, 1933.    10,0 p9mB No, 337 .      (Fc),Your telegram No. 303 (of October 21st).1,     In reply to his questions Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires was today informed, that His Ha jesty&apos;s Government agreed with the Italian Government in thinking that the General Commission could only be adjourned by itself and that, if the Chairman were to try by telegraphing to all Governments represented on the Commission to secure their agreement to adjournments confusion and possibly misrepresentation might result.20     But it seems very unlikely that so early a meeting could undertake further work at once,     We are therefore willing to concur In an adjournment for at least three weeks,3.     This proposal might we think be least likely to be misrepresented if made by Dr. 3en.es, the rapporteur, though we did not say so to Italian Charge&apos; d! Affaires, and as you will see from my telegram No. 213 to Paris we are asking ii, Paul-Boncour to invite Dr. Benes to act accordingly,Repeated to Paris No, 212, Berlin No. 196 and Washington No, 445,
