League of Nations.83Protection of Minorities in Iraq: Petitions from Mar Shimun, Catholic Patriarch of the Assyrians, regarding the Position of the Assyrians in Iraq.Note by the Secretary-General. (Received in Foreign Office, September 8.)(Doc. C. 479. 1933. I.) Geneva, September 4, 1933.THE Secretary-General has the honour to inform the Council that, at the request of the representatives of the Irish Free State, Mexico and Norway on the Council, the question forming the subject of the above-mentioned petitions has been placed on the agenda of the Council&apos;s next ordinary session. A copy of the-letter from these three members of the Council conveying their request will be found below.Sir, Paris, August 31, 1933.A Minorities Committee, composed of the representative of Mexico (the chairman) and the representatives of the Irish Free State and Norway, has considered, in accordance with the terms of the Council&apos;s resolution of the 25th October, 1920, the petitions from Mar Shimun, Catholic Patriarch of the Assyrians, regarding the position of the Assyrians in Iraq (document C. 479.  1933.  I).This document was communicated on the 19th August to the representative of the Iraqi Government accredited to the League of Nations, for any observa-tions his Government might wish to make. No such observations, however, have yet reached the League Secretariat.None the less, the representatives of Mexico, the Irish Free State and Norway considered, at&apos;a meeting held on the 31st August, that it was their duty to request you, in accordance with article 10, paragraph 2, of the Declaration of the Kingdom of Iraq made at Bagdad on the 30th May, 1932, to take steps forthwith to have the question to which those petitions relate placed on the agenda of the next Council session, and to inform the Iraqi Government accordingly.They hope that this will allow the Iraqi Government sufficient time&apos; to formulate its observations, so that the Council may be able to examine the question on the basis of documentation which will be as full as possible, and of such a nature as to allay public feeling.We have, &amp;c.F.
