-1-OOPY NO. 248(33).Q A B I N E T.FRENCH DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES AGAINST BRITISH TRADE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. For some time past the French Government have been indulging In two 3erious measures of discrimination against our trade, and have failed to remove them in spite of urgent and repeated representations, and indeed In violation of a promise they gave us to remove them.2. The first measure of discrimination is the charging upon United Kingdom goods (as well as upon those of the principal Dominions and several Colonies) of a surtax of 15 per cent, ad valorem, supposed to be in compensation for the depreciation of our currency.    This has been going on since November 1031.    The extra duty affects something like half our exports of United Kingdom domestic produce to France,  the most important exempted article from our point of view   being coal, which accounts for some 40 per cent, of the total exports of United Kingdom produce.    Even coal was originally subject to the surtax, but early last year when the Import Duties Act was before   Parliament,  the French became alarmed at Section 12, which enables us to impose extra duties to meet foreign discrimination, and exempted coal in the hope of appeasing us, while leaving other things still subject to the surtax.    The surtax also applies to aome foreign countries with depreciated currencies,   \bufc not to all; In particular, the French have not so far ventured to apply it to the U.S.A..    A few countries have secured exemption from the surtax by giving France trade concessions, while some have secured its removal by counter-discrimination.
S. We have no treaty right to most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of customs duties in Franoe, but for some fifty years past each country has in fact given the other 1 most-favoured-nation, treatment in practice.    In particular we imposed no depreciated currency duty on French goods in 1925 and 1926, when their ourrency was vastly more depreciated than ours is now.4. The second form or discrimination is that on certain classes of our goods (semi- and fully-manufactured) the&apos; French charge an &quot;import turnover tax&quot; twice or three times as high as that which they charge on similar Belgian and Italian goods.    The original object of the duty was tq counter-balance, in the case of imported goods, a &quot;turnover tax&quot; on similar French goods, anu formerly the rate was a uniform 2 per cent, both for imported and French goods.    In 1932 the rates upon imported semi- and fully-manufactured goods were raised to 4 and 6 per cent, respectively, while the internal tax remained at 2 per cent,    Belgium and Italy retaliated by taking similar action against E^rench goods, and have thus succeeded in constraining the Frenqh to reduce the tax on their i goods to its original 2 per cent, level.    Meanwhile we are still paying the   -higher rates.    Thus the French have established a second discrimination against us, in favour of Belgium and Italy.    The turnover tax may appear a small thing In itself, but in fact, as it is charged on the value of our goods plus the ordinary duty and the 15 per cent, discriminatory surtax it works out as a considerable increase.5. The result of the two discriminatory duties is to add about 20 per cent, to the duties on nearly half the goods we send to France (mainly our manufactures), and in many cases this addition means the doubling, or more than doubling, of the normal duty.    It need hardly be .aaid that
this is a most serious handicap to us in competition with other countries, and, in conjunction with the French quotas, it h:;s heavily cut down our exports.     Complaints from traders in a great variety of industries have been widespread and insistent, and I continue to receive resolutions from such bodies as the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries demanding drastic action to secure the removal of the discriminations.6,    There is at present a very definite risk of the spread of discrimination against us in other countries; Italy has taken powers to impose depreciated currency surtaxes (though we are given to understand that at present she is not proposing to apply them to us);     the &apos;gold-bloc&apos; countries show signs of conoorting similar measures amongst themselves and there are tendenoies of the same character in certain other countries.     There is little doubt that the long impunity which the French have enjoyed has encouraged these tendencies.     Discrimination is one of the gravest and most insidious dangers to our foreign trade - more dangerous probably even than high tariffs and quotas - and the whole object of the most-favoured-nation treaties wo have concluded with most countrl in the past has been to guard against it.     There are nowadays many attacks on the most-favoured-nation principle, and if we do not show ourselves prepared, where necessary, to take action in defence of our rights to equal treatment, we shall run great danger of losing them.
7.    French Ministers gave the Chancellor of the Exchequer a promise lest April, when the London hanks&apos; loan to the Trench Treasury was going through, that they would remove tooth the two forms of discrimination without any counter-concession from us.     While the two questions wero not connected diplomatically,  the French Government knew that tout for their promise, Treasury sanction for the loan would not have been given.The text of the letter written on &quot;behalf of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 25th April and of the reply received on toehalf of the French Minister of Finance on 12th May after the loan had gone through is given in the Annex.     Having secured their loan,  the French went toaok on their promise.     During the world Conference the matter was discussed personally with the French Minister of Finance, tooth toy the Chancellor of the Exchequer and toy myself.     M. Bonnet admitted that the French Government were pledged to suppress the 15?i surtax, tout said that they had no legal power to do so except as part of a commercial agreement with us.     ThiB agreement would contain concessions toy us and to us and would toe the occasion (and in fact the price) of the removal of the surtax.      It does not seem clear from the text of the French Laws whether this is really the legal position, tout,  of course, if the French Government require further powers-to carry out their promise they are under an otoligation to ototaln such powers from their Parliament,      The French Government have also not removed the discriminatory turnover-tax, though they promised in any case to legislate for this purpose.     My Department in conjunction with the other Departments concerned has carefully studied the possitoilities of a commercial agreement,  such as the French desire, tout have been forsed to the conclusion that no possible toasis exists.      One demand which the French would insist on in such an Agreement would toe
a relaxation of our plant restrictions designed to prevent this country being invaded by the Colorado beetle.     This cannot be granted.     The fixing, or &quot;consolidation&quot;, of our duties on vines and &amp;ilks cannot be contemplated either, and in any case would not be likely to satisfy the French. Moreover it would be a bad precedent to give concessions to secure the removal of a discrimination.     In these circumstances I am forced to the conclusion that the only way of securing the removal of the discriminations is to take retaliatory counter-action, as nearly as possible equivalent in scope and effect to the French discriminations, by imposing increased dutieo on selected classes of French goods under Oection 12 of the Import Duties Act (this can be done &quot;by administrative order, though a positive resolution of the House of Commons will be needed If the duties have to he maintained over an appreciable period).     When I interviewed French Ministers as to their broken promise during the world Conference, the interview gave me the impression that their difficulty was politicalj    they feared defeat in their Parliament on the question unless they could represent either that they were getting counter-concessions from us or that removal of the discriminations was necessary to avoid counter-discrimination.8.    The very numerous trade complaints   and Parliamentary questions on the subject have regularly been answered to the effect that we will pursue the matter till the discriminations are removed, and in our last Note to the French Ambassador (of 7th L/september) we concluded with a definite threat that, failing satisfaction, we would impose a counter-duty.     If we do not now act, this threat will be shown up as mere bluff.9.    I therefore desire a decision in principle that, if a final warning does not bring about the complete removal of the 15 per cent, surtax and the discriminatory tumover-tax,
we will apply a counter-duty on selected Frenoh goods under Section IS of the Import Duties Act.    If driven to do this, we should make it quite clear that our sole object is to get rid of the French discriminations.    I do not think we need fear embroilment of our political relations with France in conse-quence.    Continental countries are familiar with manoeuvres of this kind in the field of oommeroial policy, and do not take them seriously to heart (an example of this is furnished &quot;by the methods by which the Belgians secured freedom from the turnover-tax discrimination; see paragraph 4 above).10.    If a decision 1b taken in this sense (and I think it necessary), it remains to consider the consequences in relation to (i) the Tariff Truce and (ii) the Anglo-French Declaration made at the close of the Lausanne Conference.    As regards (i), action such as I suggest In paragraph 9 would appear inconsistent with our continued unreserved adherence to the Truce.    It would not be necessary for us to withdraw altogether from the Tariff Truce at this stage if such a course were considered un-advisable; it would he sufficient to give one month1s notice to the Bureau of the Monetary and Economic Conference of a reservation in respect of measures which we may find it necessary to take to counteract discriminations practiced or contemplated by other countries against our trade.    Such a reservation falls far short of that recently made by the French Government, which in effect amounts to a complete withdrawal from all the obligations of the Truce.11.    The Anglo-French Declaration of Lausanne was to theeffect that pending the negotiation of a commercial treaty thetwo countries would &quot;avoid any action of the nature of discrimination&quot; against each other.    In fact,&apos; the French were already discriminating by means of the 15 per cent, surtax,but at the time we had to overlook this.    Their differentiationby means of the turnover-tax was however introducedsubsequently and we have invoked the Declaration against it.On this point the French have avoided answering us.    We have-6-
since told them that we should have to take the discriminations into acoount when considering our attitude towards the Declaration.    There is a possibility that they might decide to withdraw the turnover-tax alone and then invoke the Declaration against any action ty is to secure the removal of the 15 per cent, surtax. I therefore suggest that, at the same time that we Send to Geneva the declaration proposed in the previous paragraph regarding the Tariff Truce, we should inform the French Government that we cannot regard ourselves as bound any longer by the Lausanne Declaration so far as concerns action necessary to counteract both the forms of discrimination they are at present practising against us.IS.    To sasuffS) I ask my colleagues to agree:(a) that if, after a final warning, the French do not completely remove the two discriminatory taxes, we should impose a duty, as nearly as possible equivalent, on a selected range of French goods -making the limited nature of our object clear from the start;(bj that we should at once give the Bureau of the Monetary and Economic Conference a month&apos;s notice of the reservation to the Tariff Truce proposed in paragraph 10; and(o) that at the same time we should send a notification to the French Government regarding the Lausanne Declaration on the lines proposed in paragraph 11.W.R.Board of Trade,30th October, 1933.
ABNFX. I.ii^ii6-^! from Sir Frederick Phillips ,to .the French Financial Attach6.TREASURY CHAMBERS, 26th April, 1933.Dear Monsieur Rueff,In confirmation of our telephone conversation, the Chancellor of the exchequer will be grateful if you will inform the French Minister of Finance that Mr. Chamberlain has learned with pleasure that it is the intention of the French Government to suppress the 15.-: Compensatory Tax in its application to British goods by an arrSte ministerial which will be issued within the next 10 days or fortnight, and that when the Chamber re-assembles on May 16th, the French Government intend to secure the passage of the projet de loi in regard to the 6F Chiffre d&apos;Affaires Tax now uefore the Chamber and will immediately thereafter withdraw this tax so far as British goods are concerned.   Mr. Chamberlain is confident that these decisions will cement the friendly ties between Trance and this country.iir. Chamberlain will be glad if you will confirm to Monsieur Georges Bonnet his decision that, despite the strict embargo which we feel it necessary to impose on the issue of foreign loans in this market, he will raise no objection, so far as he is concerned, to the proposed issue of French Treasury Bills in London in accordance with the proposed arrangements which you have outlined to us.Mr. Chamberlain trusts that this decision may contribute towards maintaining the financial position of France, which is so important to the whole world at the present time.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) P. PHILLIPS.
ANNEX ( continued) 11*Reply from the French Financial Attache to Sir Frederick Phillips.AMBASSADE BE FRANCE, A LCNDRES,1, HYDE PARK GATE,LONDRESj, le 18 Mai 1933.Mon cher Sir Frederick,En reponse a votre lettre du 25 Avril dernier, je m&apos;eiapresse de vous faire connaitre que j&apos;ai communique celle-ci a mon gouvernement.   M. Georges Bonnet m&apos;a indique, qu&apos;apres le conversations du 18 Mars dernier a Londres, ou M. Runciman lui r rappele les accords de Lausanne et lui a signale qu&apos;il jugealt comme mesures discrlminatoires la surtaxe de change et la taxe compensatoire du chiffre d&apos;affaires, il a immediatement expose ces vues au Gouvernement francaise et en particulier a Mo le President du Conseil et aux autres Ministres competents. Le Gouvernement franpais a eu ainsi l1occasion d&apos;examiner le point de vue du Gouvernement hritannique.II a depose devant les Champres, des le 13 Avril un texte de lol qui 1&apos;autorise a supprimer par decret la taxe compensatoire du chiffre draffaires pour certain pays.   Lorsque la Chambre sera rentree, le Gouvernement demandera la discussion devant le Parlement.        &apos;En ce qui concerne la taxe compensatoire de change, Li. Georges Bonnet m&apos;a prie de vous indiquer, apres avoir consulte ses collegues interesses, qu&apos;il est bien dans 1*intention du Gouvernement franpais de la supprimer.   Mais cette suppression etant, en vertu de notre legislation, suhordinee a certaines conditions, souleve des difflcultes techniques tres seriuses.    Le president du Conseil est d&apos;accord avec le Plnistre des Finances pour vouloir les resoudre le
le plus tot possible,   K. Georges Bonnet m&apos;e charge de les exposer a 11* Keville Chamberlain et il ne doute pas qu&apos;il soit possible d&apos;arriver dans un court delai a une solution satisfaisante.Vous savez - comme M. Chamberlain a pu le constater a Lausanne - combien le Ministre des Finances a personnellement le desir de faciliter la cooperation entre la Grande Bretagne et la Prance, qu&apos;il considere comme essentielle pour la reprise economique mondiale.Croyez-moi toujours, mon cher Sir Frederick, Votre tres cordialement devoue, (Sgd.) JACQUES RUEFF.
