Conf. D./Bureau/P,V.48.LEAGUE OF NATIONS. CONFERENCE FOR THE REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OFARMAMENTS. BUREAU OF THE CONFERENCE. Provisional Minutes. FORTH-EIGHTH MEETING. held at Geneva on Saturday. October 14th. 1935 at 10,30 a.m. Chairman, The Right Honourable Arthur HEKDERS01T.The CHAIRIvIAN reminded the Bureau that at a meeting on Monday, October 9th, he had made a statement with regard to the conversations and negotiations which he had been authorised to carry through by a. decision of the General Commission on June 29th.   He had intimated that in spite of all the efforts that had been made, one or two points had not yielded&apos;to negotiation. It had been thought that, further conversations might be necessary, and he understood that those conversations had been carried on since the last meeting of the Bureau.   The Bureau would, he felt sure, be most anxious to hea.r the result, and he could not do better than ask Sir John Simon, as being responsible for the draft Convention submitted by the Prime Minister of Great Britain in March, to make a. sts.teme.nt as to the present position.Before doing so, however, he desired to inform the Bureau the/b Monsieur Motta had expressed regret at being unable to attend the meeting.Sir
W y?Sir John SII-TON made the following statement^. 2.Mr. Henderson has invited me to give some account of the conversations to which I have been a party from time to time during recent weeks, both at Geneve, and elsewhere, and. in which the participants have attempted to ascertain by means of a. friendly exchange of views what are the prospects of reaching agreement on various vital matters.   I will do the best I can to comply with the President&apos;s requests.   I feel that 1 should spea.k plainly a;--.-d frankly, for the time has gone by for glossing over difficulties by vague optimistic phrases.   Asystem of agreed disarmament promptly entered into and loyally jIcarried out would, I believe, be of the greatest value to the   IIworld;   but I am equally clear that nothing is gained by interminable discussions which do not face essential matters on which differences may still exist.The account which I have to render is as follows So far as the United Kingdom representatives are concerned, we have taken part in meetings, at different times, [* with the French, German, Italian and ^American representatives [-as well as in a number of talks with the representatives of some other Powers.   These conversations have led me to take the view that the Draft Convention which the United Kingdom Government put before the General Commission over six months ago and which has been unanimously adopted as the general framework for the proposed agreement, will require to be in some respects recast.   The Draft Convention is at present drafted to cover a period of five years:   the discussions which I am summarising indicate on the part of some Powers a wish that the period should be extended to perhaps eight years and, so far as I recall, no serious objection to this extension
3.extension has been raised.It was further proposed that this total period of eight years should he occupied by the fulfilment of e. continuous programme, designed to secure at the end of the period two essential conditions:   (a) a substantial measure of disarmament actually realised end completed on the part of the heavily armed Powers,and   (b)   the achievement of the principle of equality in a regime of security which, ever since December of last year, has been the declared objective not only of the Powers who signed the Declaration of December 11th, but of the Disarmament Conference itself.   But, in order to attain this, it is necessary to proceed by steps.   Indeed, the method of stages has from a very early da.te been adopted as the necessary method by the general vote of the Conference.   And when I speak of a programme which would gradually unfold in action so as to secure at the end of the period these two essential conditions, 1 recall the language of Mr. Henderson, ir. his report to the Bureau on October 9th, last, when he declared;    &quot;On some of the mo^e important questions, the approach is manifestly influenced by the present unsettled state of Europe and the ensuing distrust, fears and alarms&quot;. The present unsettled state of Europe is a fact, and statesmen, in drawing up their plans, have to face facts, he need, therefore, for modifying the Draft Convention so as o accomplish this purpose by a process of evolution is clearly established.The scheme, therefore, which emerged for consideration, &quot;s the result of a number of these interviews, was one in hich the proposed period of eight years would begin with thet r an s f ormat i on
transformation of continental armies on the lines set out in the British draft, together with the setting up, through the medium of the Permament Disarmament Commission, of en adequate system of supervision, so that the sense of security, which the due observance of the Convention will afford, should provide the groundwork for the practical attainment of the twin ideas of disarmament and equality.   Mr. Henderson has suggested that the Permament Disarmament Commission might be set up as soon as the Convention is signed without waiting for ratification.   If this suggestion is found feasible it ought to be welcomed for it aims at shortening the period when actual disarmament and attained equality would be effectively reached.   It is understood on all hands that the supervision contemplated would be of general application.   Its purpose would be to ensure that the undertakings contained in the Convention were being loyally observed.   It is a matter for close consideration to determine how much of the eight years would be needed for the initial steps, to which I have referred.   Transformation of armies involves technical questions which will govern the time-table, and in the meantime a. real feeling of confidence should develop, when it is seen that the whole plan is agreed to and is in due process of execution.   I must report that the period of four years was mentioned by several governments, though others have raised the question whether it could not be somewhat shortened.Whatever the length of this first stage may be, it is essential to ma!re clear that the Convention itself would have to  contain at the time of its signature, the detailed scheme
0 of disarmament provided for as the final result to be attained by the time its full period of, say, eight years comes to an end.   I have described that dis-armamrnt as &quot;substantial&quot; and th2 extent of it has been the- subject of detailed discussion.   Since general phrases will not advance matters I add that by &quot;substantial&quot; disarmament is meant either the dis-armament provided for in the United Kingdom Draft Convention or s)me comparable variation of it.   I say quite definitely that the whole scheme would not be satisfactory to my Government and we could not lend our own support to it unless the degree of disarmament by the heavily armed Powers is both fully defined in the Convention and really adequate.   Put there is another feature in the second stage of the plan which is equally definite - it is this;   the result of the abolition of various kinds of armament and of pro-hibition against their further use, will be to constitute a common list of permitted anas, which would become the same for all countries and thus the differential position of the Powers whose armaments were limited by the Peace Treaties would finally ceas;.   Quantities, and other detailed regulations, would of course be in each case the subject of negotiation and agreement.The Bureau will therefore see that the plan I have outlined is one which, if it were adopted and loyally observed, would bring into practical operation the principle of equality of status by the method of substantial disarmament on the one hand, and the application to all countries of a common list ofprohibited.,.
prohibited arms on the other.But this programme involves a feature which appears to me to be essential.   I must state it with complete frankness to the Bureau.   The scheme involves the principle that the Powers now under restriction of the Peace Treaties should not begin to increase their armaments forthwith, but should express their willing-liess to conform to a time-table such as I have indicated. The-Government of the United Kingdom take the view that agreement could not be reached on the basis of a Con-vention which would provide for any immediate rearmament. In speaking of &quot;no re-armament&quot; I do not mean to dispute the reasonableness, as the Reichswehr is transformed into a more nu.lerous short-service array, of a proportional numerical increase in its armament. And there should be from the beginning of the Con-vention an agreement that no Government will manufacture or acquire any further weapons of any of the types to be eventually abolished.In our view, therefore, for the reasons indicated by 1&apos;,&apos;r. Henderson in the passage I have quoted, the attainment of the object which we all have in view at the Disarmament Conference must be in accordance with a regular programme,   le earnestly desire to establish, by international agreement, the attainment of equality of status and we point out that it is attained in a most complete and effective way by providing for disarmament through the adoption and loyal fulfilment of such a programme as I have indicated.   By accepting theprinciple.,,
principle or no immediate re-armament and co-operating with the rest of us in framing a Convention which is best calculated to restore the sense of Confidence which has recently been so rudely shaken, the necessary conditions of success can be established.The statement I have been asked to make has necessarily involved some plain speaking and a perfectly clear declaration of our own point of view,   I feel that if the General Commission, which meets on Monday, is now to do useful work, it is most desirable to ascertain what is the view of other countries on these essential points, and I sincerely trust that we may thus find a way of removing the obstacleswhich at present stand in the way of an agreed Convention,Mr. Norman Davis (United States of ^America) pointed out that Sir John Simon&apos;s statement contained an account of conversations in many of which he himself had participated.   It also contained a very definite indication of the modifications Sir John Simon felt should be introduced into the United Kingdom draft Convention tbomake it more generally acceptable. Mr* Norman Davis was glad to be able to confirm Sir John Simon&apos;s account of the conversations and to endorse and support the position he had taken up on the important questions of substance before the Bureau for immediate decision.   He was the better able to give his support to the statement just made, because as a result of the frequent and exhaustive conversations he had had during the past few days with Sir John Simon, they had come to the common conclusions so clearly and forcibly expressed in that statement.
It was not difficult for Mr. Norman Davis to state his position in that frank and unequivocal manner.   The report that had been laid before the bureau, both in its broad outlines and in many of the points of detail, was in agree-ment with the position of the American Government, as set forth in the communication which President Roosevelt had addressed to the Heads of Government represented at the Conference in May last, and with the statement which he himself had made in the General Commission a few days later. In those statement, his Government had taken the position that a Disarmament Convention could not properly be made an instrument for re-armament and that qualitative equality in armaments should primarily be sought through the reduction of the armaments of the heavily armed Powers and not through action on the part of others to attempt to build up.   Under present conditions, steps were necessary in attaining that equality.   It could not be achieved at one stroke.He would not attempt to restate on that or on other points the position which had been so adequately presented to the Bureau.   He only wished to emphasise one point to help reassure those who were impatient or sceptical because of the long delay;   from the conversations in which many of the members of the Bureau had recently participated he was more than ever convinced of the sincere purpose of the more heavily armed countries to make effective measures of disarmament a reality.   He would add that no treaty would be satisfactory, asJ&amp;r as his Government was concerned or would justify its participation in a system of supervision designed to ensure its faitMul observance unless that treaty contained precise provisions &quot; for such measure of disarmament.M, di Soragna...
9cM. d4 SORAGNA (Italy) made the follofwlng-declaration.The Italian delegation thanks Sir John Simon for his very clear full statement on the present position of the very serious question with which we are dealing.     .,&apos;e also thank him for the programme of work he has indicated and which we deduce from his :.rom&amp;rks.We shall he very glad once more to join our efforts to those of all the other delegations on the lines he has laid down.      We are hopeful and confident that the world may find in this programme, as we do, a positive basis  for the subsequent work which has still to he done in achieving the aim to which we all look forward in the same spirit of conciliation and peace,Ivi. PaUL-BDWGOUR (France) thought it would he insulting to Sir John Simon and Mr. Norman Davis to thank them for the frankness of their statements.     Sir John Simon had given an account of the conversations he had had with the representatives of various Powers, He had observed - and M, Paul Boncour also desired to emphasise this that the conversations had taken place at the specific invitation of the Bureau and the Chairman.     The delegate of France was quite convinced that the questions to which the conversations had related affected all the Powers represented on the Bureau.     It was therefore impossible to settle them in restricted conversations.     It was for the Conference itself to take decisions.     However, it had. been oon-considered essential to diminish certain difficulties by preliminary xchanges of view.Sir John Simon&apos;s statement j Mr. Norman Davis&apos;s confirmation nd M, di Soragna&apos;s support showed that the results achieved were efficiently consistent to permit of the most ample hopes.Sir John Simon was well qualified to explain those results, n view, on the one hand, of the present situation, and, on the ther, of the procedure approved by the General Commission.$ Indeed
10.Indeed, a United Kingdom plan reproducing certain fundamental provisions of an earlier French plan had &quot;been adopted as the basis of the General Commission&apos;s work.     The plan had been given a first reading.     It had then been ascertained that if a second reading were to he fruitful it was essential to take account of the reservations made by various delegations, in particular by the French delegation and also of certain political events which the Disarmament Conference could not overlook.       Sir John Simon had definitely stated that the original United Kingdom plan must be amended and revised.     In his statement he had indicated the main points to which revision should be directed.      M. Paul-Boneour desired in the Bureau of the Conference to give the French Government&apos; support to some of the principles specifically mentioned by Sir John SimoniSir John Simon had pointed out that it was impossible to contemplate satisfactory progress and a successful final outcome of the work of the Conference, that was to say, the conclusion of a Convention, without taking account of the present political situation in Europe.     Indeed, in spite of the technical character of certain of the General Commission&apos;s discussions, there was no doubt that the whole discussion was dominated by political considerations.   Considerations of that kind had always occupied the attention of the 1-rench delegation, which at the beginning of the Conference had proposed and brought about the constitution of a Political Commission,,M. Paul-Boncour believed that one of the fundamental ideas of Sir John Simon&apos;.s statement was t&apos;e division of the period for the execution of the Convention into two stages.     The intention, during the first of those stages, would be to acquire experience of the system of supervision.     That first stage was governed not only by the political considerations to which Sir John Simon had referred
11.referred, &quot;but also by the necessity of testing both the value and results of supervision..     Supervision was, indeed, the central idea of the plan towards which the Conference was at present turning its attention.     That idea was connected with the idea of security, which inthe opinion of certain delegations, among them the French delegation was inseparable from the pursuit of the equality of rights.      But supervision was a valuable and efficacious means of achieving that object, especially if it was accompanied by respect for undertakings entered into in the Convention and was bound up with the idea of security0     As it was necessary to create an atmosphere of confidence, it was essential in the first place to ascertain by observation the value and results of supervision.     That principle involved one inevitable consequence.     If it was adopted, there must be no re-armament during its application for if there were, the very object of all the efforts that were made would be nullified.     It was necessary, on the contrary, immediately to enter into definite undertakings so that at the end of the period laid down in the Convention a substantial reduction of armaments would he registered and equality would be brought about by the general reduction of armaments.     Although the time had not yet come to give figures, M. Paul-Boncour desired to indicate at once that the period of four years to which Sir John Simon had referred had not been ^selected arbitrarily.     It was based on a number of considerations to which the French delegation attached very great importance0M. Paul-Boncour would refrain from expressing hopes for that success for which all his colleagues desired.     He would confine himself to saying that in his opinion, it was essential to ascertain whether the General Commission was really in agreement with the bases just indicated, which would hold good only if they were accepted by most of the Powers represented there.Baron
12,Baron von RHEINBABEN (Germany) said that in the absence of k. Nadolny, he desired to limit his observations to the following declaration:&quot;I take it for granted that the Bureau is aware that the view of the German Government on disarmament is marked by two claims or elements:    (a) Real and substantial disarmament, of the highly armed Powers;   and (b) the immediate practical application of equality of status, the question of quantity being open for negotiation.     In this sense, I have taken note of the very important statement of Sir John Simon and shall report it at once to my Government.&quot;M, BGURQUIN (Belgium) said that the Belgian dele-gation unreservedly concurred in the ideas expressed by Sir John Simon and supported by those who had spoken after him.     It seemed to him absolutely essential that the efforts of the Conference should not end in rearmament, koreover, he was convinced that a first stage such as that contemplated was absolutely indispensable in the present state of affairs as it would give experience in the working of the Convention.     It would be useless to build on nothing.     The realities must be faced.   But undoubtedly there was at present such a feeling of anxiety as might paralyze any attempt at disarmament unless guarantees calculated to allay it were obtained,M. Bourquin noted that once again a problem of security had arisen but that it appeared in a new and more clearly defined aspect.     The question was one of security in dis-armament, of security closely comected with measures of disarmament.It/
1 ?It was obvious that the fundamental condition of that form of security was to be found in the organisation of real, practical and efficacious supervision,:with regard to the length of the first stage, I!a Bourquin supported l-h Paul-Boncour&apos; s observations.   When the period had been fixed the technical conditions of super-vision would have to be taken into account in order to judge of its efficacity,Li. BENES (Czechoslovakia), speaking as both Rapporteur and representative of Czechoslovakia, desire to make two observations with regard to Sir John Simon - s statement0The first was an observation of form.    In his opinion the second reading of the United Kingdom draft could only usefully be embarked upon if certain questions of principle were settled firsto   Among these questions he mentioned: (a)   the duration of the Convention and the establishment of a graduated plan divided into two stages; (b) effective permanent and general supervision; and (c) prohibited or permitted arms and no re-armament.The second observation related to the substance of the problem,   lh Benes unreservedly concurred in the ideas expressed by Sir John Simon with regard to the three points he had just mentioned.   He specially desired to emphasise his agreement in that connexion as he was convinced that if those questions were not settled the General Commission would be unable to continued &amp;ts work0I.I.POLITI3 (Greece) replied on behalf of his Govern-ment to the question Sir John Simon had asked at the end of his statementHo v/as in complete agreement with Sir John Simon as to the two fundamental principles to which
the latter had referred.   With regard to the principle of no re^armament, that was a question which settled it-self.   It had been repeated on many occasions since the beginning of the Conference that it would be disastrous to the Conference and to its standing in public opinion if its efforts led to rearmament.   The second question was the establishment of a first experimental period.   In M, Polit is1 opinion it was absolutely essential for the purpose of creating a feeling of security, the need for which had often been indicated during the Conference^ discussions.MoPolitis hoped that agreement would speedily be reached on that point;   otherwise the General Commission would be unable to continued with its work.   Once agreement had been achieved it would be necessary to work quicklye proceeding to adapt the United Kingdom&apos;s plan on the two bases just mentioned.The CiiAURMAN reminded the Bureau that Sir John Simon had concluded his statement with the following words:&quot;It is most desirable to ascertain what is the view of other countries on these essential points......&quot;It appeared to the Chairman that after the expressions of opinion the Bureau had just heard, it ought to decide to transmit Sir John Simon&apos;s report to the General Commission, not only for information but also as a subject for discussion.If there were no objection to that procedure, a full report of the morning&apos;s proceedings would be sent to the General Commission as early as possible in order that the latter might open its discussion on Sir John Simon&apos;s report at its next meeting on the following Monday,.The procedure proposed by the Chairman was adopted. The meeting rose.

It is also clear that this failure of the Conference is due solely to the unwillingness on the part, of the highly armed States to carry out their contractual obligation to disarm.      This renders impossible the satisfaction of Germany&apos;s recognised claim to equality of rights, and the condition on which the German Government agreed at the beginning of this year again to take part in the work of the Conference thus no longer exists.&quot;The German Government is accordingly compelled to leave the Disarmament Conference.&quot;Baron von Neurath(Reply by the President)&quot;Have the honour acknowledge receipt    your telegram of October 14th which I am communicating to the General Commission of Conference for.Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.&quot;Henderson,President.

This programme, to be completed within a limited period,  provided for the realisation progressively, In accordance with Resolutions of the Conference in which Germany herself concurred, of reductions of armaments comparable to those contemplated in the Draft Convention submitted to the General Commission.This programme provided also, with corresponding measures of security, for the realisation of Equality of Rights which the German Government have always placed in the forefront of their demands.I regret therefore that this grave decision should have been taken by your Government for reasons which I am unable to accept as valid.HendersonPresident of the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments.Conf.
