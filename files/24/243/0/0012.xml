MOST SECRET.Copy No.35CP. 212 (33).CABINET.70A MEMORANDUM ON THE PRESENT AND FUTURE POSITIONIN EUROPE.I RETURNED from abroad last night and at once circulate to my colleagues the annexed important paper written by the Permanent Under-Secretary. I would urge that it should be studied before the Cabinet meets next week.August 30, 1933.IN submitting the following considerations to His Majesty&apos;s Government, I would say that I am of course speaking for no one but myself. But the critical point that we have now reached perhaps justifies me in expressing my apprehensions.2. It seems possible even probable that His Majesty&apos;s Government must be within the next few weeks, if, indeed, they are not already, confronted with a European crisis of the first magnitude-a problem not only of the utmost importance in itself, but one involving also the whole future of the continent. It would be dangerous in the extreme for His Majesty&apos;s Government to be caught unprepared by the impending development of this crisis; and this danger is my excuse for the stark-perhaps even crude presentation of existing and impending facts.3. The two immediate questions are Austria and re-armament. This paper deals only with the first; but thereon issues hang quite as wide as those dependent on re-armament. It will be well if I begin by describing them very briefly, before considering the course to be followed from the point at which they arise.4. A glance at Hitler&apos;s past, will suffice to show that Austria is for him the psychological obsession of the renegade. But it is more than that: it is his first trial of strength with the forces of a,detested stability, and on the success or failure of this will to domination the success or failure of his regime may in large measure hinge. It is, moreover, a question of prestige, which may enable him to survive, without too much discredit, the inevitable economic adversities of this winter. His recent behaviour in regard to Austria need therefore occasion no surprise. He has given a soft answer to Italy, a rough one to France and this country, endeavouring to play off the first Power against the other two Powers  with some success. It will be seen from my interview with Signor Grandi (Appendix A), and telegram No. 256 to Rome (Appendix B) that the Italians failed fully to co-operate in the first instance, and have been living on illusions for the past fortnight. Hitler may vary his methods, but he will not abandon  save under compulsion his firm intention of destroying Austrian independence and creating a de facto &quot;Anschluss.&quot;5. All Europe would be affected by this event, but Italy more than anyone else. We have no official knowledge how she would meet it; but there is a distinct possibility that she would meet any irruption from Germany by an irruption from Italy however ill this would square with League principles. Indeed, we are told that she has assembled sufficient troops on the Brenner, and that she hasJ. S.7005   [8956]bPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1933.
told Hitler that she has done so. (We have already put in a caveat on thus meeting &quot; Putsch &quot; with &quot; Putsch &quot; see Appendix C and it will be wiser at this stage not to argue further with Signor Mussolini on the hypothesis of a raid that he still officially discounts.) What the Little Entente would say to such a &quot; Putsch &quot; is certain; what they would wish to do is equally certain, but whether they would be materially prepared to do it is another matter. In any case, it might lead to a partition of Austria, which would leave Italy little better off than if Germany took the whole (our informants already speak of Mussolini making the best of a bad job with Hitler, by keeping the Tyrol and Southern Carinthia (so as to encircle Yugoslavia), while abandoning the rest of Austria to Germany). The buffer state would thus be gone, and Italy would have a common frontier with her stronger neighbour.6. I do not doubt that Italy is most truly and heartily at one with us in our desire to preserve Austrian independence. At present let us make no mistake about it we are all backing a losing horse in Austria. That is no reason for not pursuing to the best of our ability a vital policy, the more so when we ask ourselves what if and when the horse has lost ? . Italy still clings to the vanishing asset of her &quot; special position.&quot; She has not yet the vision or the courage to face the facts, which are quite clearly that Germany is playing with her and. us and openly, cynically, daily disregarding the promises made to the Italian Ambassador at Berlin, when he stole a march on us to avoid a step with us. If then the Germans were suddenly and in practice on the Brenner, while Italy was still lulled, and while the blind tergiversation and political miserliness of France had left Italy still unconverted to Franco-Italian rapprochement, I should fear the worst. And the worst would be that, confronted with so great a German success, and a powerful neighbour on his threshold, Signor Mussolini might be tempted to turn his back on any idea of collaboration with France and also with His Majesty&apos;s Government  sand to use his &quot; special position &quot; to treat with his swollen adversary whiles he was in the way with him.7. That we have been alive to the dangers of delay on the part of France is witnessed by the repeated promptings, both private and official, which we have made to the French, both through our Embassy in Paris and through the French Ambassador here, during the past few months apart from all the efforts we have made through the years preceding the downfall of democracy in Germany to bring France and Italy together. (I do not attach these as appendices in order not to swell this paper beyond digestion.) All has been in vain so far. France, whom in 1919 providence had put in a very strong position, has made a great mess of it. But recrimination is useless. We have to look at facts as they are.8. For let us consider first the further consequences of failure. First, then, we may have an Italy that has wavered into the wrong turning. But even were she to wake tardily and eliminate this fear, there would be little but evil to come, if Austria is &apos;&apos; gleichgeschaltet&apos;&apos; as she will be if the three Powers fail between them to prevent the calamity. A &apos;&apos; Gleichschaltung &apos;&apos; with Nazi Germany would be far more serious than an &quot; Anschluss &quot; with the Germany of Dr. Briining.9. From the very outset of the new regime in Germany, I have felt, with all deference to those who with more sweet reasonableness were disposed for at least a little to wait and see, that there was no doubt whatsoever about the ultimate intentions of the Nazis. The same words now appear in our last intelligence report, and our sources are particularly good. It is an open secret that anything peaceful said by Hitler is merely for foreign consumption and designed to gain time; and it is a significant fact that no utterance of Hitler may now be published without special sanction. Hitler&apos;s disarmament speech was a unique event, a solitary exception not only in his own history, but in that of his party, in which he would have lost ground but for the fact that no German has taken it seriously. We should be no more deceived than the Germans. On the other hand, the intention to strike when ready is constantly proclaimed. Never was writing larger on the wall. True, Germany is not yet ready to strike at Poland (her armaments do not suffice at present), but to Hitler the great attraction about Austria is the hope that he may achieve a resounding success without having to
strike a blow, and therefore without having to wait for his weapons to be forged; hence the temptation to go ahead with the Austrian adventure in spite of Italy&apos;s disapproval.10. If this estimate of Hitlerism is correct, nothing but a change of heart can avert another catastrophe; and that change of the German heart is unlikely to come from within, for the true German nature has never changed. Its effectual semblance can only be induced from without. The means of such inducement will be dealt with later. Austria has only been chosen for the first break through of the renewed will to power because it is the easiest and weakest point. The next move will be upon the Polish Corridor; and the Germans, elated by the success of their first trial of strength, and encouraged by the Japanese demonstration that the League will only talk, will only delay the move until her armaments are sufficient to enable her to cope with Poland. Practically no German doubts that the Corridor must and will be regained. &quot;There is no doubt whatsoever about the ultimate intentions of the Nazis.&quot; The Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs has recently used almost these words. But Poland is in no yielding mood. The Corridor is, and has been for nigh 2,000 years, ethnologically almost pure Polish. Those who have swallowed the persistent German propaganda on the subject have followed, consciously or subconsciously, the normal human instinct to get rid of a bone of contention between a weaker and a stronger Power by a settlement in favour of the latter  the same instinct as is now prompting Soviet Russia to get rid of the Chinese Eastern Railway spontaneously. But the position is now that the Poles will cede nothing, while the Germans demand everything. The moment for compromise thus seems to have passed barring that change of heart, which, politically, so rarefy comes from within. Poland will fight; but a few years hence will 30 million human beings be able to hold 60 ? Of course not alone. But if Poland is destroyed and if Italy is out of the picture, as she may well be on the assumption of preceding paragraphs in this memorandum, Germany will, a few years later, be able to do the very thing that she could never hope to do in 1914 -to fight on one front, for, by herself, Czechoslovakia would hardly count on the second front.11. The will to fight is being daily advertised in Germany, and the whole of the younger generation there is falling rapidly into the hands of the war-masters. Young Germany will very soon have heard but one false tale-like all the rising and risen generation of Russia. We should not soothe ourselves by parallels drawn with &quot; the wild and whirling words &quot; of early Fascism. In Italy neither the capacity nor the spirit were really there. In Germany they are there in fuller plenty than at any other time in her past. The Latin says much that he does not mean, and has a sense of humour, in which the Teuton is conspicuously lacking. Three years ago Signor Mussolini made three very bellicose speeches. Italians began to fear that something really might happen. He was wise enough to see that such speeches did not pay. I have only seen one objectionable one since. In Germany, on the contrary, such stuff is ceaseless and ubiquitous and the people like it. By every form of tuition and propaganda the youth of Germany is being fed on false history, hate and pugnacity; is, in effect, again being told to prepare for the day.12. Unless, therefore, these prognostications are falsified by a change of the German heart, which the action of other Powers alone can induce, we must begin to take early account of the possibility that a rearmed Germany and Germany intends without any doubt to rearm, we can only retard or accelerate the tempo by the results of Geneva will, within the next decade, be in a position to attack either France and the United Kingdom together, or, if we find means to escape from our obligations under the Locarno treaty as in the present temper of our people we may be tempted to do France alone. (And here it may be remarked that nothing is more certain to produce the eventual cataclysm than the policy of implied, let alone proclaimed, isolation advocated by such people as Lord Beaverbrook.) On either hypothesis, and on the form of 1914, Germany would win; a fortiori on the form of 1933, when we certainly, and France probably, are weaker. This eviily-reborn Germany, on the other hand, will be stronger in a decade, if the present regime lasts. There is already in Germany a wider war-spirit, and a more complete lack of effective opposition, than in 1914.
13. The duration of the present system may, however, still be doubtful. Internally, there is nothing to choose between it and the Soviet system. Both involve the complete suppression of liberty, both are based on terror, both are high-handed tyrannies. Indeed, a large portion of the followers of Hitler are at heart nearer akin to Moscow than to Rome. The only thing that might bring down Hitler is economic adversity. But it has not brought down Stalin; it has only meant that more people are shot, and the Teuton will be as thorough as the Slav, while both races are easily dragooned. Economic adversity can, however, keep Germany quiescent. See what has happened to Soviet Russia in the realisation of her weakness. I have mentioned her desire to get rid of the Chinese Eastern Railway; I would add a reference to her recent network of pacts, and to the significant fact that Russia, vowing she would never consent, consented to recognise, covertly but explicitly, Roumanian possession of Bessarabia. I would suggest, therefore, that in the general interest Germany should be kept underweight. It will be expensive, and in some quarters unwelcome, but it may be remembered that German imports, like Russian, will, in any case, be severely restricted. There are, however, cases where skin is more important than pocket. We can ill afford to let Hitlerite German prosper. The Trades Union Congress is also of this opinion, though for different motives, seeing their recently announced boycott of German goods. If the foregoing views are sound, it is, however, a not unwelcome announcement. Ought we not to wish strongly enough to see Hitler ism fail, to be prepared at least to risk the consequences, which could hardly be more dangerous to European peace ? German communism has never seemed a menace to any observer who knows the German character, and is not gulled by German propaganda as to the fictitious &quot;dangers&quot; from which Hitlerism saved a Germany that required no saving. The collapse of Hitlerism should leave Germany too weak and disordered for external aggression. That is the essential point. We are now at a pass where &apos;&apos; peace in our time 1&apos; (and even in Eastern Europe) must be the first consideration. The future of Europe, to my mind-and I venture to say again that, of course, I do not presume to speak for anyone else turns largely on the fashion of our facing the German challenge over Austria, in which we are at present like to lose. The seriousness of the challenge can only be realised if it is seen not as an isolated case, in which this country has no direct interest, but as the first of a series of challenges, each one of which will carry with it a nearer threat to this country, culminating in the demand for a navy and a colonial empire. If Hitler wins this first round he will be hard to hold; he will, with increased confidence and enthusiasm, press on with rearmament so as to lose no time in following up his political success in Austria with, next time, a military success against Poland. If we wish to avoid the Adcious concatenation described above, it is all-important to counter the first triumphant and &quot; ruthless &quot; a very favourite German word excursion of Hitlerism. But the first counter-step may well be a costly one.14. That is my excuse for the length of this introduction. I now pass to the specific case of Austria, to the various manners in which the danger may arise and materialise, and to the specific means to which we may have recourse for countering this challenge.15. In taking stock of the situation two final observations suggest themselves. ^ Events are going to move fast, if we are not resolute, too fast for the newly-united Little Entente to grow up, too fast for politically illiterate America to be educated. It is unfortunate that events will not wait upon the capacities of man; but I do not think that the Little Entente, with the exception of Yugoslavia, could ever be of much military value. The Czechoslovak army is too dangerously mixed, the Roumanian too ill-officered. As for the United States, she is tending to go native again. In regard to our position vis-a-vis of that country we are, however, in a position very different from that of 1914. To this point further reference will be made.
16. Now for the various methods by which Germany may destroy Austria, and those by which we may thwart her.17. There are five different ways in which Germany can persevere in her policy of destroying Austria by causing the present Government to fall and a Nazi regime to be set up in its place. The time-factor is an important one, for Dr. Dollfuss calculates that, if he can survive the winter, that season will also discredit the Nazis in Germany, where trade will fall and unemployment rise. In that calculation we should assist him, as indicated below. But can he last the winter 1 It is more than doubtful, and Hitler will intensify his efforts to destroy the Austrian Chancellor before unredeemed promises come home to roost and economic adversity begins to tell against Nazi prestige. Hence the urgency of the situation with which His Majesty&apos;s Government may soon be confronted.(i) Germany may simply persevere in her subversive efforts, mainly through broadcasting she appears temporarily to have discontinued the dropping of seditious leaflets from aeroplanes despite the assurances given to the Italian Government, not to us. This is, indeed, just what she is doing now. The Italian Foreign Office have held optimistically to the idea that each broadcast may be the German swan-song in this respect. Our views on this theory are shown in Appendix B. The noises sound more like the eagle. At least, it is a swan-song with repeated encores; and an end must come to this soon, unless we are all to be openly flouted, and unless we all, and particularly the Italians, are prepared to take the flout lying down.(ii) Germany may, in deference to Italy, vary her technique, and find other methods, which would equally involve her responsibility, of doing in effect the same thing. The Italians might be still inclined to blink this for a while, or to endeavour again to deal with it by their &quot; special position.&quot;(iii) Germany may organise a &quot; Putsch &quot; across the Austrian border. Such an intention has been freely rumoured of late from many sources, and is probably not without some foundation. The Italian Government still profess to disbelieve in such a possibility, and threaten isolated action if it materialises. Austrian Nazis are, however, certainly being assembled, drilled, armed in Bavaria. The game would probably be to stiffen them with German S.A. men in a degree that might escape attention a typically German calculation and to loose the whole across the frontier before Austria has had time to consolidate her defences (see Appendix D). These defences are, in effect, still very weak, and the loyal Austrians are ill-armed. Hence the rumours of an early effort by the Germans, and the need for the early consideration of this possibility by His Majesty&apos;s Government. I do not call it more than a possibility, for such rumours cannot well be accurately gauged; but it is at least a possibility that cannot well be left out of account.(iv) Germany may drop other measures and concentrate only on economic pressure. She has already announced that she will in no circumstances abandon this; and she is exercising it in a drastic manner, both by the tax on German tourists and by her refusal to take Austrian exports, particularly timber. Economic pressure is her most efficacious weapon, and Dr. Dollfuss is particularly afraid of it. The new-found and partial Austrian patriotism may easily wilt under the pinch and let Dr. Dollfuss down.(v) The fifth course is to foment sedition and sabotage in Austria. It will&apos; be difficult to get sufficiently direct evidence to put the German Government in the dock on this charge; but such evidence as we have might strengthen the case against Germany if she was arraigned on any of the first three counts. The Austrians have already got some damning testimony, which they have published. For the moment, however, we had better concentrate on the consideration of the other four courses.18. Now the fourth course differs materially from the first three, and we may therefore examine it apart and first. The difference is that it would be almost impossible to bring Germany to book over it. She would argue, if she argued at all, that she is entitled to charge her own tourists what she likes for a visa.&apos; She would argue that she is entitled to take what imports she likes and can afford; that none of these things concern foreigners, and that anything they might say
was a gross interference with her internal liberty.   She might even retort that we had put an embargo on Russian produce.19. On all these grounds she would escape; if, indeed, we had any safe ground for reproaching her. I do not think that we have. This must be handled, not by exposing ourselves to rebuffs from Germany, but by helping Austria. Sir E. Phipps has always argued that, but for the slump of 1929, Austria might have been self-supporting and even prosperous. This may be arguable. But whatever the facts of the case as regards Austria, there can be little doubt that Dr. Dollfuss, on whom Austrian independence now hangs, cannot survive the attacks of his opponents, within and without, nor check the demoralisation pro-duced by the threats and intrigues of German agents in Austria, unless he can point to some economic improvement as the outward and visible sign of the support of his foreign sympathisers. Appendix E shows the line that we have been taking on this head. The Danubian Conference, which met in London on the 6th-8th April, 1932, failed because of the differences of France, Italy and Germany. At present Germany cannot complain if she is dropped out of the problem, anyhow until she shows a more commercial and less venomously political disposition. This simplifies the problem to some extent. Signor Mussolini wishes to discuss with France the economic situation of Austria. We have been encouraging the Latin sisters to go ahead without further loss of time. The stumbling-block as usual is mutual suspicion.-The Italian suspect the French of wishing to use the Austrian danger as a pretext for forcing Austria and Hungary into a Danubian economic federation, dominated politically by the Little Entente, and, therefore, by France. The French suspect the Italians of wishing to form an Austro-Hungarian economic bloc, backed by Italy and Germany in direct political opposition to the Little Entente. The trouble is that there is a certain foundation for both these suspicions. It is no use for anyone else to talk much until these two mutual suspects, under pressure of a common danger, have composed their views and programmes-an essential preliminary. Once the embryo of an agreement exists, we must of course be consulted. But we shall only lose more precious days and weeks, if we attempt to transform these intimate first attempts at Franco-Italian collaboration into a formal conference, which will at once rouse the excitable Little Entente to suspicion or obstruction. In this respect, therefore,, we are already doing all that we can do for the moment. It may be added that a committee has, since the early days of the German menace, existed in London to promote Anglo-Austrian trade.20. We may now pass to the consideration of the other methods open to Germany. They have this in common, that they all undisguisably involve Germany&apos;s responsibility, and that on all of them she can be further arraigned, if we consider it politic to do so. Indeed, the third the &quot; Putsch &quot; -might actually force us all to do so.21. To take first the case of the &quot; Putsch,&quot; when the crime would be most glaring and the League&apos;s duty most obvious. What form could this further action take ? Joint representations with France are apt to lead nowhere and land us with the odium. That odium and that responsibility should be spread over the Europe where they properly belong. I think the next step, if we decide to take one, can only be a reference to the League under paragraph 2 of article 11 of the Covenant. Italy is not yet in favour of such a reference, and Germany is defying us to make it. Nevertheless, if Ave have to choose one of two evils, I should have thought that, in the event of a &quot; Putsch,&apos;&apos; the lesser is to call the German bluff to try to bell the cat,; in fact, while she can still be belled. Worse may eventually befall the world if the belling is not attempted, or if it fails. But there is no denying the fact that the dangers and difficulties of this course are also immense, and it could not be contemplated or adopted without the fullest consideration.22. For it is hard to conceive that reference to the League would be of any use  it would even be damaging and short-sighted unless Ave are prepared to see the matter through every stage up to the use in our turn of economic pressure upon Germany. The great difficulties in the way of this course are shown in Appendix G, to which I venture particularly to call attention. They may well cause a recoil. Such measures Avould greatly incom^enience us and all concerned. If. hoAvever, they could be made effective^a large assumption, but not large
enough to put them out of court they might be fatal to Hitler. Were he to remain defiant, we might kill two birds with one stone. Did he capitulate,- his prestige would be greatly impaired, and his party might begin to break up to universal relief.23. The first great danger is that, rather than enter the dock, Germany might leave the League, and so deal it a fatal blow. It is, however, open to argument whether the League would not anyhow suffer final discredit it has already suffered many things through Manchukuo if it condoned such an outrage as a &apos;&apos; Putsch &apos;&apos; so close home. The League had some cover in its Manchurian failure; it might be, indeed was, argued that the League was not designed to grapple with such distant events, that it could only hope to be really effective if confined to Europe. None of tbese excuses could be applied to the case now under consideration. Whether reference were made to the League or not, it would be widely taken to be a final confession of bankruptcy and impotence, if Europe stood by with folded arms, and watched the violent disruption of a little Power by a great one. The confession would only be a little more overt if the reference were made under article 11, and the results were as negligible as in the case of Manchukuo.24. It is, of course, impossible to foretell what form a &quot; Putsch &quot; might take. It might be carried out with or without ostensible German support; it might be successful or it might fail; it might succeed immediately or only after a civil war; it might produce armed intervention by Italy and Czechoslovakia or it might not. In every case it would be the object of the German Government so to order things as to show that there was no &quot; circumstance,&quot; to quote article 11 of the Covenant, &apos;&apos; affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.&quot; All the same, it is almost inconceivable that technical arguments could in the end prevent the matter from being brought before the League under article 11 if other Governments really wanted to do so. The most difficult case would, of course, be if the &apos;&apos; Putsch &apos;&apos; had been immediately successful, if neither Italy nor Czechoslovakia had intervened militarily, and if the new Nazi Government in Austria proceeded to maintain a strictly correct attitude, doing absolutely nothing to bring about or even to further the &quot; Anschluss.&quot; In that event it might perhaps be difficult to formulate a case for the League (for the new Austrian Government would have no complaint against the German Government, while we and our friends would have no complaint against the new Austrian Government). But this stalemate could be only temporary, for the German Government or the new Austrian Government would, by force of public opinion, be almost bound sooner or later to do something that would undermine or violate article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles or article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. This would bring us by another road to the situation which is dealt with in the following paragraph. In Appendix F will be found, for convenience of reference, the text of paragraph 2 of article 11 of the Covenant of the League, as well as article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles and article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.25. All this, as I have said, would apply in the case of a &quot; Putsch &quot;; to a lesser degree it would also apply if the continued undermining of Austrian moral by courses 1, 2, or 5, were to lead to a more or less peaceful collapse of the Dollfuss Government and its replacement by a Nazi Government, who would proceed to establish some sort of de facto &quot; Anschluss.&quot; This, no doubt, is the way in which Hitler visualises the future. In such an event, it would be difficult (even for Italy) to avoid an appeal to the League and The Hague Court on the legal question, just as in 1931, when the Austro-German Customs Union was judged and condemned by The Hague Court on the Council^ initiative. On that occasion Germany submitted. But could Hitler do so in the present altered circumstances ? It is hardly conceivable. But if he did not submit, the League would soon find itself in the deepest of waters, and we should then be faced with the dilemmas described in paragraphs 22 and 23.26. But what if we are faced merely with a persistence of the present situation, i.e., the flouting of the Powers by the continued application of a selection or combination of courses 1, 2 and 5 ? In such circumstances I think a reference to .the League under article 11 on these heads would be foredoomed to futility because,.
as remarked above, Italy is not yet in line. If reference were to be made on these heads, it would have to be Italy who changed her view and took the lead, seeing that the destruction of Austria was imminent despite the half-hearted and isolated efforts which she has hitherto made. Indeed, it is at present quite clear that Italy would actually oppose reference to the League on any of the counts now under discussion. There is therefore a strong element of doubt in regard to ^courses one, two and five, while there seems little question in regard to course three, not because one and five do not equally fall under article 11, but because Italy would certainly again fail us and so ensure the downfall of the League. Short of accord and unanimity between France, Italy and this country, we should be making the final test of the League an unfair one; and we do not want to crash the League, a result which would be rendered probable were Italy to refuse or to render ineffective the subsequent steps, which we- must clearly contemplate before we embark on any such action at all. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, however, remember that the French Govern-ment or even possibly, though not probably, Dr. Dollfuss himself may force our hand. At present the French press of the Right has been demanding further action at Berlin on the score of Germany&apos;s disregard of her promises to Italy. This might produce a quarrel of great gravity in view of the German reception of our initial step. The French press of the Left is, on the other hand, urging as the wiser policy that reference should now be made to Geneva. This view has been gaining ground, and we could not answer that article 11 does not apply.27. If Austria were to approach us directly I think there could be no doubt as to our reply. We could hardly refuse in spite of all difficulties and incon-conveniences. to go to the League. But an Austrian request is less likely than a French one; and with the latter we are better able to deal.28. If then the French make such a proposal to us, the answer would rather seem to be to explain to them in the first instance the foregoing difficulties in regard to Italy and the consequent effect upon the League. But all will depend on how this is done. Pending the conversion of Italy to co-operation, for which some patience will be necessary, it would seem wisest in France&apos;s own interests, and certainly in those of the League, which is avowedly the main plank in the foreign policy of France, to endeavour to meet the danger while continuing to attempt that conversion, the absence of which is mainly due to the inaction of France, by the practical measures already, or about to be, taken in aid of Austria. The former consist of the loan and the facilities for the increase of her defence forces; the latter, of the economic assistance now at last, we hope, in train. The Austrian Government should thus succeed in demonstrating its ability to exist in spite of Germany. If that demonstration can be made sufficient for the coming winter, Germany may yet lose the game. In other words, in view of the economic situation of Germany it may be that, if Austria is saved for a year, she may be saved indefinitely. If the French are not convinced by this argument and the time-factor may warrant haste-the balance of disadvantage would be a delicate one. His Majesty&apos;s Government would wish, no doubt, to reconsider it. But if reference to the League is decided upon by France, we should again have to ask whether we are both ready, once at Geneva, to see the matter through.29. Now reference to the League could, and presumably would, lead at least to the application of economic pressure. How far then is such economic pressure on Germany likely to be effective&apos;? (see Appendix G). Italy would be joined in her recalcitrance by Russia, with whom the Italian Government is on paradoxically good terms. The German and Russian Governments are also on paradoxical, though not strictly analogous, terms. In spite of the Russian Communists&apos; resentment at the Nazi treatment of their comrades, the Soviet Government would of course be indisposed to co-operate in economic pressure on Germany; moreover, article 3 of the Russo-German Treaty of 1926 categorically forbids the contracting parties to join an economic or financial boycott against either of them.30. This is an obstacle, but not a prohibitive objection. Some intertrading between two bankrupts would not long mask the defeat of Hitler. Not so, of course, the United States.   If any such policy of pressure is contemplated,.
even in the case of a &quot; Putsch,&quot; it would be necessary to sound the United States of America at a very early stage. We should do so with at least more prospect of success than we should have enjoyed in 1914. Recent authoritative American pronouncements on the subject show some advance in the right direction. President Roosevelt, who is playing with the idea of recognising the Soviet Government, might, however, be loath to sacrifice any prospect of trade in airy direction; but this is a dwindling consideration, since German, like Russian, imports are already much restricted and will shrink further. This would have also to be our consolation and, judging by the Trades Union Congress, there is a considerable disposition in this country to be consoled though it would not console us for the expense of the great wartime machinery of restriction, which we should have to re-erect, neither is it to be supposed that the economic pressure on Germany would be fairly and adequately carried out by all members of the^ League.31. One last consideration. Signor Mussolini, disliking the invidious, position which Italy would occupy at Geneva if appeal were made to the League, may try and close this avenue by convening a meeting of the signatories of the Four-Power Pact to co-operate in solving the Austrian problem. This would raise embarrassing questions for both us and the French. The French would argue that the co-operation provided for by the Pact does not cover the Austrian problem, because it is not a &quot; question which appertains &quot; to the signatories. (vide article 1 of the Pact). In the French view it appertains to the Little-Entente! But quite apart from this fundamental quibble, are we ready to meet Germany round a table and discuss Austria with her so long as she continues-her present policy of sabotage 1 It is a moot point. Elements in the consideration of this point are that the French argument would be technically strong; while from the practical point of view, if Hitler after some delay-becomes animated by any spirit of conciliation at all, he would probably find it easier to retreat by this avenue than from the dock at Geneva.32. All these and many other considerations can be cogently urged, and should, I submit, be carefully weighed. But we find ourselves always back at the point where we have to consider, in the face of every consideration, whether this grave matter ought to be kept from the League; whether the League can afford another failure; whether we can afford a world in which the League would have been practically destroyed by a triumphant Hitler, whose real doctrines are all. incompatible with the League; what would be the fate within a decade of a world so situated, and of this country in particular? We are on the eve of decisions which will imply the beginning of an answer to these questions. That is why I have made bold to put forward so unpalatable a paper. A final question arises : if we are bound for Geneva and the consequences, how shall this affect our disarmament policy 1 If we are to have trouble, shall we confine the objective-of our economic pressure to the Austrian question alone, or should we tackle Germany&apos;s already existing though secret rearmament concurrently? Meanwhile as to our immediate policy in the present phase of the Austrian question, I would venture to suggest that we should at least be on safe ground if we continue to combine the narrower policy of holding Italy to her self-imposed task of keeping Hitler under control (cf. Appendices A and B), with the wider policy of promoting Franco-Italian conciliation in all spheres as a preliminary to that Anglo-French-Italian co-operation which is likely to be the only real bulwark of peace until Germany, ceasing to challenge the existing political status quo in Europe, enables the methods of the Four-Power Pact to be applied in practice.ROBERT VANSITTART.August 28, 1933.
Interview between Sir R. Vansittari and the Italian Ambassador,August 23, 1933.SIGNOR GRANDI referred to the Austrian question, and I told him of the instructions recently sent to Mr. Murray to consult with Signor Suvich (Appendix B). Signor Grandi replied that he also had been instructed from Rome to ascertain our views. I said, in reply, that Signor Mussolini had not only rather taken the lead in this matter, but had acted separately at Berlin. It was to the Italian Government that the unfulfilled promises had been given, and it was because of the responsibility, which it seemed to me thus fell upon the Italian Government, that Mr. Murray had been asked to find out how the Italian Government now viewed the situation, and what they thought the next step should be. We had no wish to hurry the Italian Government, but time was passing and the subversive propaganda from Germany against Austria continued undiminished. This was steadily shaking the position of Dr. Dollfuss, and I did not think that it could continue for much longer without serious danger to his Government.We did not wish merely to pass the question back to the Italian Government, but it had seemed right to make of them the first enquiry as to further action. Signor Grandi would remember what I had already told him at a previous inter-view, when his Government had replied to our suggestion for representations at Berlin that they had already acted. I had told Sir R. Graham, purely as an expression of personal opinion, that I hoped this would be fruitful, but that I could not help feeling that better results might have been attained if we had taken analogous and more or less simultaneous action. From this as I had told Signor Grandi-Signor Suvich had strongly dissented. I felt some diffidence therefore in repeating that view, but I was bound to remark that events had some-what justified it.We were still waiting for the results of Mr. Murray&apos;s conversation with Signor Suvich, and, if Signor Grandi could assist in eliciting the views of his Government, we should be most grateful. For I was becoming personally rather anxious; and since he asked me for my personal views, I would have no hesitation in giving them to him. I fully understood and appreciated the view on which the Italian Government had hitherto been acting, i.e., that they had a special position which it was in the common interest to exploit. It would seem, however, that it was on the contrary the Germans who were exploiting that conception. They were overtly playing off the Italian Government against the French and British Governments; and while they had returned a rough answer to us and a smooth answer to the Italians, they were entirely failing to carry out their promises to the latter. To put it quite plainly, there seemed to be a tendency in Italy at present to blind herself to the facts, and we were all being made in different ways to look rather foolish; Germany meanwhile continued uninterrupted upon her way, and this was bound to weaken opposition, never too solid, in Austria, where people would be bound to think that Germany would end by carrying her point, and that the three Powers were powerless to protect the Government of Dr. Dollfuss. I should be glad if the Italian Government could let me know how long they thought this position could be allowed to continue. It did not seem to me that it could well be for long; otherwise the Dollfuss Government would collapse and Germany would have won the game with disastrous results for the future. They would then be inaccessible to any advice or restraining influence, even that of Italy. In other words, I considered (and I believed that the Ambassador really agreed with me) that the special position of Italy was a dwindling asset, and I was personally afraid that if she endeavoured to hold on to it for too long she would lose the substance for the shadow. She might, in fact, retain the semblance of a special position, but she would have lost Austria, and the Germans would be at her doors. I had told him my personal views frankly because he had asked for them, although, as I said, I felt that the next expression of view should come from the Italian Government; but I had been ready to answer because I felt that this was a moment when all those concerned should be
completely frank with each other. We were convinced that there was complete unity of purpose amongst us, but hitherto there had not been unity of method or of action. On the first occasion when Germany had broken her promise to Italy, Signor Suvich had expressed the opinion that this was a German swan-song. I had hoped that he might be right, though I hardly expected it. In any case we had been in no hurry and had recognised that Germany must have full opportunity for receding slowly and saving her face. She had had the opportunity and had remained exactly where she was. The broadcasts had continued unabated, and there was practically no change in their tone, certainly none in their intention or effect. What then should the next step be? That was a question which might have to be faced at short notice.I told Signor Grandi of the information we had received in regard to the imminence of a &quot; Putsch &quot; from Germany. These rumours might or might not be founded. At any rate, they could not be left out of account; an early date had even been assigned for them. His Government so far discounted these rumours. -Were they still of the same opinion? I felt that some reports on the subject must have reached them.In any case he would have noticed the recent attitude of the French press. There was a growing demand there, in view of Germany &apos;s failure to fulfil her promise, that the matter should be referred to the League under paragraph 2 of article 11 of the Covenant. The Italian press, so far as I could see, appeared to be equally indisposed towards such a position. Nothing, of course, would give the Germans greater courage or obstinacy in persevering in their policy than any overt lack of harmony between the other interested parties. The British press as a whole had so far taken up no definite position in the matter.In these difficult circumstances I repeated that I did not think it was possible for us to be too frank with each other, and I hoped his Government would be as. frank in their reply as I had been in my exposition.APPENDIX B.Telegram from Sir R. Vansittart to Mr. Murray (Rome).(No. 256.) Foreign Office, August 21, 1933.YOUR telegram No. 231 of 19th August: Austro-German relations.The attitude of Germany is still so disquieting, indeed increasingly so, that the moment seems opportune for you to review the whole situation with the Italian Government, more especially in view of Dollfuss&apos;s recent meeting with Signor Mussolini. Having regard to the serious stakes at issue and considering the attitude taken up by the three Great Powers, and not least by the Italian Government, it is difficult for any of them to view with indifference the present development, or rather deterioration, of the German-Austrian position. You should therefore consult the Italian Government in order to ascertain their views of the problem under the following heads : 1. The continuance of broadcasting. On 5th August the German Govern-ment informed the Italian Ambassador in Berlin that they would &quot;do their best&quot; to check radio propaganda by tightening up censorship. Nevertheless, offensive talks on Austria have been broadcast from German stations on 9th August (Habicht), on 11th August (Honig), on 13th August (Wegener), on 16th August (Habicht), and again on 19th August (apparently Habicht). These broadcasts (of the contents of which the Italian Government is presumably fully aware), may vary in tone and method of exposition from the earlier broadcasts,, but represent none the less an unrelenting attempt to undermine the present Austrian Government and bring about a de facto &quot;Anschluss.&quot; You should enquire what is Italian reaction to continuance of radio propaganda, and state that we feel that to take any other view than that the assurances given to the Italian Government in this respect are being so far openly and cynically disregarded is to blind ourselves to facts.   (As stated in your telegram under
reference, Hitler&apos;s confirmation to Italian Ambassador of his original assurances does not appear to have any practical value.) It has been policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to be in no hurry to estimate facts, but to give the Germans every opportunity to damp down slowly and without too much loss of face. We also had some faint hope, though less than Signor Suvich, that Habicht&apos;s broadcast of 9th August was, in fact, a swan-song, and we wished to give this theory every chance. But it is evident that his hopes and our policy of patience are being visibly and almost daily disappointed. You should therefore enquire Italian appreciation of present situation, and whether they have any fresh views as to how to deal with it.2. The Reichspost revelations. (The best account appears in the Times of the 15th August.)You should enquire what is Italian Governments view of the situation thus revealed. Point you should make with Signor Suvich is that there is every reason to suppose that the campaign of intrigue and sabotage revealed by Reichspost is still continuing, and ask whether the Italian Government consider-possible any action in that respect, seeing that this kind of campaign is not yet oovered by any assurances obtained from the German Government.3. The reports of the enrolment of an Austrian Legion in Germany with a view to a &quot; Putsch &quot; in the Tyrol in September. I observe from your telegram No. 226 of 18th August that the Italian Embassy here had been instructed to inform us that as a result of enquiries Italian Government are satisfied that there is little likelihood of the German &apos;&apos; Putsch&apos;&apos; materialising. This communication has not yet been made. In any case the fact that it may be impending need not prevent you from raising the question with Signor Suvich. You should take the line that while we are of course relieved to know that the Italian Government are confident in this matter (see your telegram No. 230), we ourselves would be far more reassured in view of the prevalence and persistence of disquieting reports if we were in possession of a declaration by the German Government that they would in no circumstances allow such a &apos;&apos; Putsch &apos;&apos; to take place, or at least some such expression of disapproval as they have issued in regard to terrorism. It is clear (see your telegram No. 226) that an.Austrian Legion is being organised in Germany, though its purpose is at present described as a relief measure. As regards statement mentioned in your telegram No. 223 to effect that Signor Mussolini would take &quot; corresponding measures,&quot; I presume that by this is meant an occupation of Austrian territory as foreshadowed in Sir R. Graham&apos;s telegram No. 177. As to this, you are already aware of my view (see my telegram No. 171).4. The intrigues in Austria itself against Dollfuss Government owing to the growing fear that the Nazi revolution in Austria is inevitable owing to the weakness of the Great Powers. You should lay stress on the increasing danger of these so long as Austria is subjected to the present economic and political pressure from Germany.In this connexion you should make use of paragraphs 4 and 6 of Vienna telegram No. 96 of 17th August, repeated to you.5. The urgent need for improving Austria&apos;s export trade so as to stabilise her economic position.You should urge the desirability of the early initiation of discussions with the French Government (see my telegram No. 238 of 15th August).Although.I do not wish you at this stage to point the obvious moral, you will bear in mind during your discussions with the Italian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government still hold, as they always have held since Nazi aggressiveness began to be an international danger, that the only efficacious means of making the German Government see reason in foreign affairs is joint action by and close collaboration between the three Great Powers on whom, under the League, and as permanent members of the Council, must fall a great part of the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the peace of Europe so long as Germany persists in courses clearly out of harmony with the spirit of the Four-Power Pact.(Repeated to Paris, No. 146, Saving (en clair); Berlin, No. 30, Saving (in cypher); and Vienna, No. 13, Saving (in cypher).)
Telegram from Sir R. Vansittart to Sir R. Graham (Rome).(No. 171:) Foreign Office, July 12, 1933:SITUATION as revealed in your telegram No. 177 of 11th July (Austro-German relations) seems to show more than ever the desirability of agreement as to joint action at Geneva in case of necessity, though admittedly the likelihood of such necessity is dwindling. Signor Suvich&apos;s proposed remedy, amounting to a general race by troops to the Austrian frontier, is particularly dangerous, is just what we want to avoid, and is precisely what the League exists to prevent.Please represent the foregoing to Signor Suvich and urge him to agree to joint action in case of necessity. You may add that we have reason to think that the French Government are agreeable.APPENDIX D.Telegram from Sir R. Vansittart to Lord Tyrrell, Paris (No. 179), andMr. Murray, Rome (No. 248).(Secret.) Foreign Office, August 18, 1933.MY telegrams Nos. 141 and 177 (Nos. 237 and 243) of 17th August: Increase in Austrian army.Fresh confirmation has reached me from various independent sources of planning for September of &apos;&apos; Putsch &apos;&apos; on the Tyrol to be carried out across the Bavarian frontier by legion of Austrian Nazis now being organised and trained in Germany and possibly stiffened by S.A.If this information is correct, it is important that no time should be lost in enrolment of new Austrian auxiliary force.(J) Even so, enrolment of new force may possibly come too late, but, in order that stigma may not rest on ex-Allied Powers for this perhaps fatal delay, the question now arises whether, seeing that an agreement between ex-Allied Powers and Austrian Government already exists in principle, the latter should not be privately authorised to anticipate formal signature of written agreement and to commence process of enrolment at once.Please approach Government to which you are accredited with urgent enquiry in this sense.(Addressed to Paris and Rome.  Repeated to Vienna, No. 104.)APPENDIX E.Telegram from Sir R. Vansittart to Lord Tyrrell, Paris (No. 142, Saving); andMr. Murray, Rome (No. 238).Foreign Office, August 15, 1933. MY despatch No. 1328 (My despatch No. 674) : Economic position of Austria.I have in the last few days urged both the French and Italian Ambassadors, to press their respective Governments to take up discussions without delay in regard to the economic situation of Austria. I alluded to Sir W. Selby&apos;s remarks in his despatch No. 257 regarding the situation which might arise in the autumn if no economic assistance were forthcoming, and pointed out to both Ambassadors that we were now in mid-August, and that there was no time to be lost in getting to business. The first step was necessarily the discussion foreshadowed by Signor Mussolini (Rome telegram No. 213) (your telegram No. 213); without Franco-Italian agreement nothing could be accomplished. We should, of course, have to be consulted when there was anything sufficiently concrete to bring to our notice.(Addressed to Paris. No. 142, Saving, and Rome, No. 238. Repeated to Vienna, No. 97.)(!) The Austrian Government asked for permission to enrol a special auxiliary force for the duration of the present crisis, notwithstanding the provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain.
Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.-A* *7V* *7t&quot; &quot;7v&quot; *7v *A*IT is also declared to be the friendly right of each member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.A rticle 80 : Treaty of Versailles.Germany acknowledges and will respect strictly the independence of Austria, within the frontiers which may be fixed in a treaty between that State and the Principal Allied and Associated Powers; she agrees that this independence shall be inalienable, except with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations.Article 88 :  Treaty of Saint-Germain.The independence of Austria is inalienable otherwise than with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations. Consequently Austria undertakes in the absence of the consent of the said Council to abstain from any act which might directly or indirectly or by any means whatever compromise her independence, particularly, and until her admission to membership of the League of Nations, by participation in the affairs of another Power.APPENDIX G.Legal and Practical Difficulties in the way of Imposing Economic Sanctionson Germany.THE difficulties in the way of taking coercive action against Germany to check her subversive activities in Austria are first of a legal, (2) and secondly of a practical nature. Before any such measures are permissible, the procedure for the pacific settlement of international disputes embodied in the Covenant of the League of Nations and other instruments must be followed to its conclusion, and the same would hold good in the event of an infraction by Germany of her disarmament obligations. A dispute between Germany and Austria, or between Germany and another party to the Treaty of Versailles on account of Austria (e.g., under article 80), though it might in the first place come before the League under article 11 of the Covenant, would in all probability end by falling to be dealt with under articles 12-15, i.e., either by arbitration or judicial settlement under article 13, if it were of a legal nature, or by proceedings before the Council under article 15 if it were not. It may be recalled that in the case of the Sino-Japanese conflict the above procedure lasted from September 1931 (when the dispute was referred to the League under article 11 of the Covenant), to February 1933 (when the Assembly issued its report under article 15, paragraph 4).The possible upshot of this procedure, assuming that it failed to lead to a settlement, would be as follows  &apos;(a) The members of the League could proceed to an&quot; occupation or invasion of German territory if, but only if (i) Germany refused to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement, or to comply with an arbitral or judicial decision and if the Council unanimously, the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted, decided to propose such an invasion or occupation.(2) In the case of a non-legal dispute before the Council, if the latter unanimously (the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted) agreed to a report recommending such an invasion or occupation.(*) The legal procedure which would have to be followed is set forth in detail in F.O. Memo, of May 30, J933 (U 4924/245/18).
(b) The members of the League could (whether or not the Council had made a unanimous recommendation to that effect) take measures such as economic pressure not involving the use of force, assuming that the procedure prescribed for the settlement of the dispute had been adopted. The only legal obstacle to such action would then be such instruments as commercial treaties with Germany.The possibility of action against Germany under (b) above, by means of a pacific blockade of German imports, exports and shipping (with consequent reactions on German finance) are being considered in detail by a sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The conclusions of the sub-committee, as embodied in a recent draft report, were that, although such an operation might theoretically be successful and would have a considerable moral and psychological effect, it would probably in practice fail of its object, or only succeed, after a prolonged struggle, either at the cost of considerable damage to the blockading Powers (and to the United Kingdom in particular) or through ceasing to be &quot; pacific.&quot; The essentials for the success of such an operation were the loyal collaboration of all the blockading Powers and the absence of loopholes for evasion. But such loyal collaboration would not be easy to secure. The lesser limitrophic States, such as Denmark and Holland, would be nervous of taking action; and to secure their co-operation it might be necessary to guarantee them against German aggression. Although a benevolent attitude on the part of the United States might be hoped for, the attitude of the other States non-members of the League, and also of the Argentine, would be doubtful, and if they were unwilling to collaborate the loopholes for evasion would be numerous. If the United States, in addition to the other non-League Powers, refused their co-operation, the blockade would definitely fail at the outset; at best its success would be problematical without the use of naval forces. On this aspect of the question the sub-committee&apos;s draft reads as follows : &quot; On the assumption that the United States of America would adopt a benevolent attitude towards the application of sanctions, and that, with the possible exception of the Argentine, members of the League of Nations would be active participants, .... any action at sea .... would have to be taken in respect of German ships, Russian ships, ships of other countries not taking part in the boycott, and ships of all nationalities that might attemptto evade it.....Presumably, members of the League and the UnitedStates of America would not object to the arrest and detention of their merchant ships, but both Germany and Russia and other countries not participating in the sanctions might be expected to resist what would at least in the case of Russia and the latter be of doubtful legality when nostate of war existed.....    Unless the difficulty could be overcome bydiplomatic pressure, the only means then open to the naval forces of theLeague Powers to enforce the economic boycott would be to.attack.....This would .... probably result in war with Russia and other countries, and might enable Germany to claim that we had resorted to war contrary to . the decision of the League.&quot;In this connexion the sub-committee were careful to recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not shoulder the major responsibility for any naval operations, since any resort to force on the part of the Royal Navy might, in that event, result in this country being represented as the primary aggressor.It follows from the findings of the sub-committee&apos;s draft report quoted above that it might be necessary to apply diplomatic pressure to ensure the co-operation, or at least the neutrality, of (1) the United States, (2) Russia, (3) the other non-member States and the waverers amongst the members. In the case of the United States, it should be easy to secure their collaboration by diplomatic action in the event of the blockade being imposed by a unanimous vote of the Council. It would be less easy, but not impossible, in the absence of such a vote. Lastly, it is unlikely that Soviet Russia and the other non-participants would be anxious to precipitate hostilities in the circumstances, so that diplomatic pressure in their case would have at least a fair prospect of success. As for the fears of the lesser neighbours of Germany, the probable demand for guarantees is a serious objection, but if the nettle should have to be grasped it is more easily done now than hereafter, for Germany is not yet in a position to attack even her weaker neighbours.
The effects on the United Kingdom of a blockade of Germany, as estimated by the sub-committtee, would be briefly as follows. The sub-committee also made it clear that these effects would reach the Dominions and Colonies as well Imports.-^In general, German imports to the United Kingdom could be replaced from other sources, though temporary difficulties would arise.Exports. -Loss would ensue to (1) the fishing industry, (2) the fine spinning section of the cotton industry; but gains would result, on balance, to (1) the machine industry and (2) the woollen and worsted industry. The coal industry would reap an immediate benefit, but this might be followed, after the withdrawal of the blockade, by a permanent loss. Germany is, further, our main market for raw wool, waste and noils.The effect on British shipping would be favourable rather than otherwise.Finance. The sub-committee advised that the inevitable termination of the Standstill Agreement would &apos;&apos; entail a financial crisis of the first magnitude unless special steps were taken to assist the bankers &apos;&apos;; that other short-term debts would become irrecoverable; that possibly  80 million of German long-term bonds are held in this country; and that United Kingdom finance is interested to a substantial degree in manufacture and distribution within Germany.The scheme of blockade examined above foresaw the general stoppage of German imports and exports. But the sub-committee, in their review, suggested an alternative scheme. Since Germany&apos;s chief markets, with the exception of Soviet Russia, are in countries which, it is assumed, would be co-operating in the attempt to bring pressure to bear on her, very considerable damage could be inflicted on Germany by a decision of the countries in question to exclude German goods i.e., the course followed recently by the United Kingdom in the case of Soviet Russia. This scheme would avoid many of the risks and difficulties inherent in the imposition of a complete blockade, and the sub-committee advised that Germany would be unable to find alternative markets of sufficient magnitude for the displaced products. She would doubtless retaliate as did Soviet Russia with consequent damage to the export industries of the United Kingdom, but German imports from this country are in any event a diminishing quantity, an observation which equally applies to the potential losses from a complete boycott. At the same time, the sub-committee considered that this modified scheme would involve the same consequences to British finance as the broader project.To resume : (1) No coercive measures are permissible until the resources for the pacific settlement of the dispute, provided by the League Covenant, have been exhausted.(2) An occupation or invasion of Germany is then permissible only if the Council unanimously passes a resolution to that effect, the votes of the parties to the dispute not being counted.(3) Measures of economic pressure not involving the use of force can, however, be taken in the absence of a unanimous recommendation by the Council, provided that the procedure for pacific settlement has been exhausted.(4) A pacific blockade of Germany would have a considerable moral and psychological effect, but extensive diplomatic preparation would be necessary in order to ensure that sufficient countries would co-operate in it to ensure its success and in-order to prevent its degenerating into an act of force. .(5) A pacific blockade would have serious repercussions on certain branches of United Kingdom and Empire trade, and a specially serious repercussion on United Kingdom finance.(6) An embargo on German goods imposed by the countries constituting Germany&apos;s most important markets would be easier to render effective than a complete blockade and would put substantial pressure on Germany. It would, however, entail the same consequences to United Kingdom finance as a general blockade.o
