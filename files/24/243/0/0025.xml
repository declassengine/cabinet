LEAGUE OF NATIONS.September 28, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[W 10997/40/98]No. 1.United Kingdom Delegate, Geneva, to Foreign Office. (Received September 28.) (No. 185.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between the Secretary of State and Herr von Neurath respecting disarmament.Geneva, September 27, 1933.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State and Herr von Neurath at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Geneva, September 23, 1933.I WENT to see Herr von Neurath at the Carlton Pare Hotel here this evening.   Mr. Eden accompanied me.After some preliminary conversation I suggested that we might try to ascertain what was the common ground between us as to the nature of any Disarmament Convention which might now be possible, and then we should see where the main differences lay. Herr von Neurath agreed and began by saying that the supervision over armaments which the convention would provide must not be applied exclusively to Germany, but must be of general application. I agreed. He went on to say that though this principle was agreed, he found some difficulty in seeing how it would work out in practice. What would there be in the case of, say, France for the Permanent Disarmament Commission to supervise when the treaty was signed ? France was not proposing to reduce her armaments at the first stage, but only undertook not to increase them. Then would it not be necessary to have a list of the quantities of each kind which France had now by means of which a check could be kept to prevent any increase ? I said that there would be matters to check in the first period when the system of effectives was being modified and, of course, there would be much to supervise later on. But I agreed that the details of the machinery of supervision needed to be carefully thought out and, in the meantime, confirmed that the principle of supervision must be applied generally. He said that the French seemed to regard supervision as directed to searching for any possible infractions of the Treaty of Versailles. I replied that in my conception supervision in the new convention would be for the purpose of establishing that undertakings in the new convention were only observed, e.g., if Germany was not to have guns above a certain calibre, the supervision would ascertain that she had not any.I then mentioned the proposal that the new convention should provide for two stages, say, of four years each, in the second of which the substantial disarmament provided for would take place, and enquired whether Herr von Neurath accepted this suggestion in principle. He said that he did, but added that in his view it was absolutely necessary that the provisions for disarmament in the second stage should be contained in the convention itself so as to be binding from the start. I entirely agreed and said that we fully realised that Germany would not be satisfied with a convention which provided only for the first stage and then left what was to be done later on to be discussed and arranged when the first stage was over. This, therefore, was a second point on which we were at one.We then discussed the question of &quot; samples.&quot; Herr von Neurath said that what Germany wanted was a limited number of samples of the weapons which were now prohibited to her under the Treaty of Versailles, but which would be retained by those who at present possessed them (the intermediateEnclosure in No. 1.[911 ee-1]
category pf the three) in the first period; when the second period arrived Germany would expect to have these weapons in adequate measure. I replied that the suggestion that Germany should be allowed any measure of rearmament in the first period was one which we could not accept. British opinion, I was satisfied, would not tolerate it. This view was not peculiar to the present British Govern-ment, but was shared by British opinion generally. He must realise how profound a change had come over British feeling in regard to Germany&apos;s claims in recent, months. Herr von Neurath said that he fully realised this, and, indeed, spoke as one who ha.d this, change of attitude very much in his mind, and who had pressed it upon his colleagues. Several times in the conversation he acknowledged the truth of what I had said on this point. Incidentally, he told us that, he had insisted that Dr. Goebbels, who has not previously made contact with opinion outside Germany, should come to Geneva and be here with him-. Herr von Neurath&apos;s expression was that it would be very difficult for hini to aocept the position that Germany was to enjoy during the first period no greater latitude in armaments when other nations during that period were not going to disarm at all. I repeated that the only possible mode of treatment was to proceed-in stages, and that in the first period rearmament of any sort by Germany was not practical politics. It would be difficult enough to persuade British opinion to tolerate the idea of allowing Germany samples of new weapons in the second period. Herr von Neurath at first replied that when three years were over it would be much easier to do so, On this we pointed out that since the second period was to be provided for in the convention itself, what was necessary was to get public opinion to support the proposals for the second period now.Having made our objection to Herr von Neurath&apos;s proposition quite definite, I then enquired whether he had considered the proposed division of the period of the convention into two equal halves of four years each. A first period of four years was the Trench proposal made to us in Paris yesterday, and we understood that the Italians had also adopted this figure. We had, therefore, not differed from it, but it might be a matter for consideration whether the first period could be shortened to, say, three years and the second extended to five or more. This wouid mean that Germany would reach the point when she got some samples sooner, and at the same time the disarmament of other States would be advanced. Herr von Neurath indicated that he had not considered the length of the period very closely, but we felt that he was impressed by the suggestion, and that along this road there might be a way of compromise which would avoid his demand for immediate rearmament,Before leaving we made two suggestions : First, we enquired what sort of numbers Herr von Neurath had in mind when he spoke of &quot; samples.&quot; I reminded him that in a conversation on the subject a year ago he had given me quite small figures. He said that he had not any figures worked out, but that he would ascertain what were the figures which Germany would ask for on the assumption that Germany waited till the first period was over. Secondly, we all agreed that we must make the most rapid progress possible, and I suggested that we might see whether we could not draft the outline of certain amending clauses to our draft convention which would carry out the ideas which we had been discussing together.I observed in the course of the interview that in Paris yesterday Mr. Eden and I had been struck by the indications that the French were prepared to go a considerable way in the direction of disarmament. Herr von Neurath smilingly suggested that the explanation might be that, a week ago, Herr Hitler, in a long and important talk with the French Ambassador in Berlin, had said that it would be the proudest monument he could wish for in his public life if he was able to bring about Franco-German reconciliation. Herr von Neurath was present at this conversation and evidently attached a good deal of importance to it. While admitting that recent events and policies in Germany had naturally aroused new concern both in Britain and France, he said that things were not really as bad as some outside critics supposed, and spoke as one who was confident that Germany was going to present herself in better guise to the world when what he called the revolution was over. He mentioned his intention of having a talk with M. Daladier when he arrived in Geneva, and I suggested that it would be a good thing if an opportunity occurred for M. Daladier, Herr von Neurath, Mr. Norman Davis, Baron Alojsi and myself to meet Mr. Henderson informally on the invitation of the last named.   Herr von Neurath agreed, as long as the occasion
was something like a tea-party, which was less likely to provoke protests from other Powers. He said that he had received a message from Signor Mussolini suggesting a four-Power meeting to promote a disarmament settlement at Stresa in the early days of October. I said we had news of this suggestion indirectly, but I doubted whether such a meeting was advisable unless and until the substance of an agreement was in sight. Herr von Neurath said that he entirely agreed, and that he had alreadv sent a reply in this sense to Rome.J. S.
