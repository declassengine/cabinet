THE Bureau of the Disarmament Conference is due to meet next Monday and Mr. Henderson does not contemplate a postponement of the date. The General Commission is to resume a week later and it will then be ascertained whether any real progress towards agreement has been made since its last adjpurnment in June. After nineteen months of effort in the Disarmament Conference without concrete result, it would seem both impossible and undesirable to continue vague and hesitating discussions which lead to no actual decision. The Conference must either advance to concrete and agreed conclusions or acknowledge that it cannot attain practical results.2. The United Kingdom gave a definite lead by producing the Draft Disarmament Convention last March and it has kept that lead ever since. The Draft Convention has not only been adopted by the whole Conference as a basis for discussion, but as the scheme into which any necessary amendments should be fitted. The other members of the Conference now look to us for guidance more than ever. America is absorbed in her domestic problems and the impulse that was afforded by the Hoover proposals is entirely forgotten. We have kept in close touch with Mr. Norman Davis and may fairly hope to have his concurrence and a declaration of American co-operation in what we are trying to do. Neither France nor Germany, in the nature of things, can give a general acceptable lead. Italy is busily seeking to be of use as an intermediary and we have kept in close communication with her, but, though Signor Mussolini can be most helpful in measuring and assuaging German demands, Italy cannot lead the Conference as a whole. She will, on the other hand, be anxious if possible to work along lines of Anglo-Italian concord. It follows, therefore, that if anybody is to give a further definite lead, it must be ourselves.3. When the Bureau meets, Mr. Henderson will make a report of his pilgrimage to various European capitals and describe the amount of agreement he has been able to register or induce. He has a table of fifteen matters; on twelve of these he claims that much progress towards agreement has been made. It will be found, I think, that as yet this agreement is somewhat illusory, and in any case matters which are admittedly not agreed involve the most important elements, e.g., reconciliation of French and German views about materiel.

This would be only too likely to bring us up against the difficulties. I have just mentioned at once.4. Mr. Eden and I have, therefore, been thinking out an alternative proce-dure, which would be as follows : Mr. Henderson, in the Bureau, will certainly ask me to report on the progress which has been made as the result of recent conversations beginning with Mr. Eden&apos;s interview in Paris and ending with the series of interviews we have been having in Paris and at Geneva during the last ten days.    I should propose to reply by saying that these conversations have[9095]SECRET.CP. 228 (33).
not, indeed, resulted in agreement on all points, some of them, very important points, but they have brought the parties closer together than they were before and&apos;have led us to form a clear judgment as to the line of compromise which must be generally adopted if there is going to be any agreement at all. This line of compromise would be embodied in a paper (see Annex) and we should express our desire that this Compromise should be brought before the General Commission as soon as it meets (instead of our then entering upon the endless task of discussing seriatim an accumulation of amendments and reserves from all kinds of quarters) with a demand that, after discussion, a vote should be taken on the proposal that the Compromise should be approved by the General Commission, and referred to the draftsman in order that he might produce a revised Draft Convention embodying these modifications. I should make it clear that the Compromise is not what we ourselves prefer to our own original Draft, but is an honest effort by the party to the Conference which is in the best position to do it, to mark out the necessary middle course if there is ever going to be a Convention at all.5. Now, what would happen? Assuming that our Compromise is aptly framed, great advantages might ensue. The majority of States at Geneva would recognise that we were making a final effort to save the Conference from ship-wreck. The United States would, I should hope, warmly approve; my own con-versations with Mr. Norman Davis certainly allow me to expect so. I saw Mr. Henderson to-day and he indicated his own approval, and, from the point of view of domestic politics, this is not unimportant. We should bring out into the open the differences between France and Germany and exert the maximum pressure on both sides for concessions. If, as seems the more likely result, our demarche shows that no agreement can be reached, this, at any rate, will not be for want of trying on our part, and we shall know what the final difficulty is and from what quarter it comes. We may be sure that the French would strain every nerve to come into line with us against German intransigence. It would probably happen that, if our effort fails, ways will be found at Geneva of keeping disarmament discussions alive by all sorts of time-wasting and face-saving devices, but we, at any rate, could not be saddled with responsibility for this unsatisfactory course, since we shall have made a more definite effort.6. The procedure would need very careful timing, and I should have to claim a good deal of discretion in this regard. It would not be prudent to communicate the terms of our Compromise to other parties too soon. If it was sent to Paris, the French newspapers would at once begin a campaign against it and any Government that did not protest against it. An even more difficult case is that of Italy, for we should have to chose the right moment to inform Signor Mussolini and get his backing, or, at any rate, his benevolence. He may not be unwilling that we should make the effort, reflecting that if and when the effort fails, the opportunity of getting in With a variation of his own via the Four-Power Pact will be improved. We must expect some black looks when we disclose our scheme in various quarters, but the general relief at a prospect of possible agreement will soon override sectional grumblings.7. Now what is the alternative? The alternative is to sit tight and see nothing turn up. I cannot think that it is good for the peace of Europe to let. time pass with nothing decided as to whether a Disarmament Convention is possible or not. Time is on the side of the forces in Germany which may be secretly preparing for a reversal of the verdict of the last war. If, after all this talk, no Disarmament Convention is reached, Germany will, in law, continue to be bound by the Treaty of Versailles, but I do not see how she is going to be made to observe it. She will claim to be free to rearm without airy-conditions, and, once that the new regime in Germany settles down and becomes more respectable, there will be many people who will say that there is a good deal in the German claim that she has waited fourteen years for equality and cannot be expected to wait any longer. While, therefore, I do not myself believe that a Disarmament Convention, and the supervision which it would provide, would prevent the growth of German aggressiveness, it would, at any rate, provide some check, and (most important of all) if Germany flagrantly disregarded her signature, would unite the moral condemnation of the world against her. France cannot too clearly understand that the only alternative to a Disarmament Convention, some of the terms of which she may not at all like, is no Disarmament Convention and unrestricted rearmament of Germany.
: 8. If, therefore; the annexed Compromise is one which I can be authorised to put forward as being, in our judgment, the middle course between conflicting views, I should like to follow the procedure outlined above. It would, of course, be made entirely clear that we were not offering to any party the right to,;pick and choose and that the Compromise must be taken or rejected as a whole.;Q,,-Foreign Office, October 3, 1933.1 ^ ^Annex.THE COMPEOMISE.(1) The Convention should be prefaced by a declaration that one of its guiding principles is to provide for &apos;&apos; equality of rights in a system which would provide security for all nations.&quot; The Draft Convention should remain the approved basis, but should be modified as follows : (2) The Convention, though signed as one document and binding as one document, should provide for two periods of four years each.As regards Regulation of Armaments. &apos;(3) During the first period (a) Continental armies would be transformed, as provided in the DraftConvention.(b) The signatories would undertake not to increase the amount of theirmateriel of the classes which will be renounced in the second period.(c) Germany would be limited to the armaments she is now entitled to possess, with the exception that, as Germany would, in accordance with the Draft Convention, increase the average daily effectives of her land forces during the first period to the figure of 200,000, sheiwould be entitled to have, in proportion to the increased numbers, additional quantities of the material now allotted to her existing Reichswehr effectives. Corresponding provisions would apply to Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.(4) During the second period, signatories will be bound to reduce war material in their possession, by certain specified stages, so that by the end of the period of the convention, :-(a) No signatory shall possess mobile land guns exceeding 155 mm. in calibre. 7&quot; ,(6) No signatory shall possess t-^se^eedin^SptoD       J 1 a total tonnage ol tanks.110 signatory may possess a number of tanks exceeding the figureshown for them in a table to be annexed to the Convention. (c) As regards the air, existing provisions such as Article 35 would be maintained, but the Table referred to in Article 40 would be revised. Thus no signatory shall possess aeroplanes exceeding 3 tons unladen weight, and no signatory may possess a number of aeroplanes exceeding the figure shown for them in a table to be annexed to the Convention. .        ;    ,[p.t.o.
(5) During the second period those States which are at present forbidden to possess certain types of weapons, will have the right to acquire such weapons within the limits imposed by the preceding paragraph.As regards Security for the due Observance of the Convention.(6) It would be declared in the Convention that its loyal execution is a matter of common interest to the High Contracting Parties, who, by signing the Convention, undertake to do their utmost to ensure its observance. Provision would accordingly be made for consultation between them in the manner indicated in Part I, &quot; Security,&quot; of the Draft Convention, in the event of the Permanent Disarmament Commission reporting the existence of facts which show that any High Contracting Party has failed to execute the Convention loyally. The object of such consultation would be to exchange views for the purpose of restoring the situation and of maintaining in due operation the provisions of the Convention.(7) The sense of security which the Convention will aim at promoting will only be fully established if confidence in the working of the Convention is assured by an adequate system of supervision. As soon as possible, therefore, after the signature of the Convention, the Permanent Disarmament Commission should be set up with instructions to arrange for a periodic investigation in each State, for the purpose of ascertaining that the undertakings contained in the Convention are complied with.

unacceptable to the Service Departments at the present time;,    Reference was made to Sir Horace Rumbold&apos; s Despatch of April 25,  19 33, in which he had warned the Government that Hitler and his Government had taken steps, by crushing their adversaries by force, to establish their Government for a term of years; that they were establishing everywhere in Germany the doctrine of force;    that they were not likely to hesitate, to follow Admiral Tirpitz&apos; example of deceiving other Powers as to what they were doing;    and that their ultimate aim was to create a new army and get rid of the Treaty of Versailles.   Meanwhile,  it was pointed out,  a menacing situation had grown up throughout the Par East rendering it -essential to complete the Base at Singapore.    It was further recalled that, owing to the assumption of ten years of peace,  on which the Service Estimates for the last ten years had been based, our Imperial Defence resources were deficient in very many respects.    It was suggested that after Sir Horace Rumboldfs warning, and with the menacing situation in Europe and the Par East that existed today, it would be out of the question to enter into any agreement to acquire no new material of war except for replacement of what already exists .After some discussion the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggested to amend Paragraph (3)(b) to read as follows&quot;The signatories would undertake not to increase the amount of their material of the classes which will be abandoned on the second period&apos;&apos; .This was accepted. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he would try and see representatives of the War Office and the Air Ministry on the subject that after-noon .
PARAGRAPH (5)..A good deal of discussion took place on the questionof whether- &quot;samples&quot; should he allowed to Germany.SIR MAURICE HAWKEY stated that, from documents ofthe Sub-Committee on Industrial Mobilisation in ForeignCountries, he gathered that Germany desired samplesof the prohibited weapons in order to enable her tocomplete her arrangements for industrial mobilisationand rapid production of armaments.    Industrial mobilisa-tion involves the issue to manufacturing firms of greatnumbers of detailed specifications, blue-prints, andso forth,  in the production of which we ourselves areencountering great difficulty owing to the large numbers required.    In order to complete these to the point where they.could be handed over to firms unaccustomedto make them in time of peace, it was important to theGermans to have actual experience in the manufactureof the weapons,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe had discussed the matter with Sir Austen Chamberlain,who had told him that if ssimple weapons were given toGermany the whole influence of the League of NationsUnion would be against the Government.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL doubted if theHouse       Commons would support it.PARAGRAPH  (4).    SUPERVISION.Hrnhe sense of security which the draft Convention will aim at promoting will only be fully established if confidence in the working of the Convention is assured by an adequate system of super-vision.   As soon as possible, therefore, after the signature of the Convention a Permanent Disarmament Commission will be set up with instructions to arrange for a regular inspection involving an investigation in each State at least once every year for the purpose of ascertaining that the undertakings contained in the Convention are complied with&quot;.
It was pointed out that this paragraph did not comply with the Cabinet * s decisions, since, without waiting until agreement had. been reached on the remainder of the Convention, we should be offering some system of supervision.A great deal of discussion took place on this point,  and eventually THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS made a proposal to put the paragraph last in the Annex, and to re-draft it so as to render it less open to objection by the War Office.The Secretary of State made the following detailed proposals:-In line 5, to leave out the words &quot;inspection involving an&quot; before the word &quot;investigation&quot;, and in the following line to leave out the words  &quot;at. lea&apos; t, once every year&quot; .THE PRIME MINISTER asked a question as to whatPower? would have to sign the Convention before thePermanent Disarmament Commission was set up.   Was the signature of Japan anticipated or regarded as necessary?PROCEDURE .Some discussion then took place on the subject, of procedure.   As the Prime Minister had another engagement it was decided to postpone this question until 3 p,m. on the same day.After the withdrawal of the Prime Minister the Lord President of the Council discussed with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs the allusions to Foreign Policy which he proposed to make in a speech to the National Conservative Union which was meet ins; at Birmingham.    In the course o^ this speech he proposed to explain where this country stood in European pc.icy.    Disarmament was not popular with the Conservative Party, which did not understand the
danger of the failure of the Conference.    He proposed to tell them that the Government wanted a Convention. He would recall that. tT-a.de is improving but that for a substantial advance an improvement in the international situation was necessary.   At the present time fear was holding up the world.    If the Conference failed every country would take stock of the situation,  and every nation would, want re-armament .   That would be the end of reductions in expenditure.    He would ask if Germany started re-arming what Furope was going to do, and would raise the question whether,  if it broke down, we expected. Germany to observe the Treaty?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs doubted if it was vrse to go as far as that,    He thought it would have a very serious  effect on the French, who were already suspect ing us of being lukewarm owing to our refusal to discuss with them their dossiers as to German breaches of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles.mhe Lord President said, he was also anxious to recall that this country never went back on its s ignature.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought the way to put this matter was somewhat as follows There are a number of hotheads  in this country who want us to enter into more international obligations.    The reason we would not do that is that we take very seriously any obligations into which, we do enter, and we are not in the habit of going back on our signature, as  France and Belgium had good cause to know.The Lord President asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to turn the question of his statement over in his mind during the next day or two.
ON RESUMPTION,AT 3 P.M.PARAGRAPH (6). 1 51THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that in respect of some weapons there would, under this Article, he a limitation of numbers, for example, in the case of aeroplanes or tanks.      But in the case of other weapons, for example, 6&quot; guns, there would be no such limitation.      Under the Article as drafted Germany like other nations would have the liberty to provide herself with unlimited numbers.THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY,  FOREIGN OFFICE, pointed out that this raised the question of whether the tables could be revised and, if so, whether Germany should be accorded a lower figure than France and ourselves. We and France, for example, would probably be given 800 aeroplanes apiece in the table.   .  Should Germany also have 800 or only say 400?THE PRIME MINISTER said that the overwhelming feature of this Article was that after four years Germany would be in a position to rearm.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that this was qualified to the extent that Germany would have to have observed the first part of the Treaty and would not get any big guns for the reeison that no one else would have them.      Up to now we had backed France in according no samples to Germany during the first period of the Treaty, but we had indicated that we could not support her in opposing Germany having weapons allowed to other nations even though forbidden to her under the Treaty of Versailles in the second part of the Treaty.PARAGRAPH (3)(c).The discussion then reverted to Paragraph (5)(c) which THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS proposed to redraft so as to begin as follows:-.
&quot;Germany will be limited to the armaments she is now allowed to possess with the exception that in accordance with the provisions of  the United Kingdom draft Germany would increase the average daily effectives of her land forces, etc.  as before.&quot;THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SEGRETARYs  FOREIGN OFFICE, again raised the question of tables.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought it would be better not to insert tables at the present, stage.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that it would be better first to try the compromise without tables.      They would, however, have to be produced very soon and should, therefore, be prepared.THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY,  FOREIGN OFFICE, asked if it would be right for him to see the representatives of the Service Departments, for example, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he was to see Lord Hailsham on Friday.It was agreed that Mr. Eden should see the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff.The question was then discussed of a Cabinet meeting to consider the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Annex as redrafted as the result of this meeting.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS explained that he and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Foreign Office, ought to be present at Geneva en Monday when a meeting of the Bureau was to be held, more particularly as he himself had been opposed to any post-ponement and had said so publicly.      At that meeting Mr. Arthur Henderson would open by describing his visit to certain European capitals and would claim that on twelve out of fifteen outstanding points agreement ought to be obtainable.      The three outstanding points were rather embarrassing to us.      Consequently, when he,
Sir John Simon, was called he would evade these three points by suggesting that following his conversations with representatives of other nations during the last week or two, he intended to offer a compromise proposal. It would, howevers be embarrassing if he had to say that his proposal was not yet ready.      From that point of view he asked if the Cabinet could meet on Saturday, any earlier date being impossible owing to the Conservative Association&apos;s meeting at Birmingham.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL rather deprecated a Saturday meeting which would be very inconvenient to many members of the Cabinet.      He thought a better result would be obtained by a meeting on Monday afternoon when members would have had time to study the document.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that in that event he would have to arrange for mr. Eden to gain time at Geneva so as to enable himto speak on Wednesday instead of on Monday.THE PRIME MINISTER instructed Sir Maurice Hankey to summon a meeting of the Cabinet at 2,30 pam.  on Monday, 9th October, 1933.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Foreign Office, should at the Cabinet meeting raise the question as to whether Germany in the tables was to be given equal numbers with, the other countries *PARAGRAPH  (7),Paragraph (7) of the compromise was then discussed briefly but no alteration was suggested.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I., 4th October,  1933.
