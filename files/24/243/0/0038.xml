Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1933.Copy No.     4fjCABINET.-    v 223GERMANY AND THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.BARON von NETJRATH addressed the foreign press in Berlin on Monday evening and made a deliberate and personal attack upon me and my probity. (It is amusing to observe that, according to Reuter&apos;s telegram from Berlin, the German newspapers have received an official warning not to indulge in violent attacks on Great Britain, but to confine any necessary hostile comments to individual British Ministers.   Herr von Neurath complains of the view that the latest demands put forward by Germany go far beyond what was previously the subject of discussion between us.   I have not, in fact, made this statement publicly, but the statement is quite correct, and I told the German Charge dAffaires that this was my view when he presented to me Germany&apos;s latest demands,  and repeated the statement after the  Cabinet to the  German Ambassador.  Moreover, the Americans know it is so and told Herr von Neurath.This, of course, is worked up into a tremendous newspaper &quot;story&quot; in London, e.g.: &quot; Germany accuses Britain &quot;; &quot; German attack on Sir John Simon &quot; ; &quot; Germany accuses Sir John Simon of distorting facts &quot; ; &quot;. . . . declaring that the written demands exceeded those outlined in their private discussion.&quot;I circulate the relevant papers. They are interesting, and if my colleagues will read them through they will see how completely justified the view is that Germany has heightened her demands. Some of these telegrams could not be published, but the question is whether we should not at once issue a White Paper containing some of them.J. S.SECRET.CP. 237 (33)October 17, 1933.[9155]b
[W 10997/40/98] No. 1.United Kingdom Delegate, Geneva, to Foreign Office. (Received September 28.) (No. 185.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between the Secretary of State and Herr von Neurath respecting disarmament.Geneva, September 27, 1933.Enclosure in No. 1.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State and Herr von Neurath at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Geneva, September 23, 1933.I WENT to see Herr von Neurath at the Carlton Pare Hotel here this evening.   Mr. Eden accompanied me.After some preliminary conversation I suggested that we might try to ascertain what was the common ground between us as to the nature of any Disarmament Convention which might now be possible, and then we should see where the main differences lay. Herr von Neurath agreed and began by saying that the supervision over armaments which the convention would provide must not be applied exclusively to Germany, but must be of general application. I agreed. He went on to say that though this principle was agreed, he found some difficulty in seeing how it would work out in practice. What would there be in the case of, say, France for the Permanent Disarmament Commission to supervise when the treaty was signed % France was not proposing to reduce her armaments at the first stage, but only undertook not to increase them. Then would it not be necessary to have a list of the quantities of each kind which France had now by means of which a check could be kept to prevent any increase ? I said that there would be matters to check in the first period when the system of effectives was being modified and, of course, there would be much to supervise later on. But I agreed that the details of the machinery of supervision heeded to be carefully thought out and, in the meantime, confirmed that the principle of supervision must be applied generally. He said that the French seemed to regard supervision as directed to searching for any possible infractions of the Ti?treaty of Versailles. I replied that in my conception supervision in the new convention would be for the purpose of establishing that undertakings in the new convention were only observed, e.g., if Germany was not to have guns above a certain calibre, the supervision would ascertain that she had not any.I then mentioned the proposal that the new convention should provide for two stages, say, of four years each, in the second of which the substantial disarmament provided for would take place, and enquired whether Herr von Neurath accepted this suggestion in principle. He said that he did, but added that in his view it was absolutely necessary that the provisions for disarmament in the second stage should be contained in the convention itself so as to be binding from the start. I entirely agreed and said that we fully realised that Germany would not be satisfied with a convention which provided only for the first stage and then left what was to be done later on to be discussed and arranged when the first stage was over. This, therefore, was a second point on which we were at one.We then discussed the question of &quot; samples.&quot; Herr von Neurath said that what Germany wanted was a limited number of samples of the weapons which were now prohibited to her under the Treaty of Versailles, but which would be retained by those who at present possessed them (the intermediate category of the three) in the first period; when the second period arrived Germany would expect to have these weapons in adequate measure.    I replied that the
suggestion that Germany should be allowed any measure of rearmament in the first period was one which we could not accept. British opinion, I was satisfied, would not tolerate it. This view was not peculiar to the present British Govern-ment, but was shared by British opinion generally. He must realise how profound a change had come over British feeling in regard to Germany.&apos;s claims in recent months. . Herr von Neurath said that he fully realised this, and, indeed, spoke as one who had this change of attitude very much in his mind, and who had pressed it upon his colleagues. Several times in the conversation he acknowledged the truth of what I had said on this point. Incidentally, he told us that he had insisted that Dr. Goebbels, who has not previously made contact with opinion outside Germany, should come to Geneva and be here with him. Herr von Neurath&apos;s expression was that it would be very difficult for him to accept the position that Germany was to enjoy during the first period no greater latitude^ in armaments when other nations during that period were not going to disarm, at all. I repeated that the only possible mode of treatment was to proceed in stages, and that in the first period rearmament of any sort by Germany was not practical politics. It would be difficult enough to persuade British opinion to-tolerate the idea of allowing Germany samples of new weapons in the second period. Herr von Neurath at first replied that when three years were over it would be much easier to do so. On this we pointed out that since the second period was to be provided for in the convention itself, what was necessary was to get public opinion to support the proposals for the second period now.Having made our objection to Herr von Neurath&apos;s proposition quite definite, I then enquired whether he had considered the proposed division of the period of the convention into two equal halves of four years each. A first period of four years was the French proposal made to us in Paris yesterday, and we understood that the Italians had also adopted this figure. We had, therefore, not differed from it, but it might be a matter for consideration whether the first period could be shortened to, say, three years and the second extended to five or more. This would mean that Germany would reach the point when she got some samples sooner, and at the same time the disarmament of other States would be advanced. Herr von Neurath indicated that he had not considered the length of the period very closely, but we felt that he was impressed by the suggestion, and that along this road there might be a way of compromise which would avoid his demand for immediate rearmament.Before leaving we made two suggestions : First, we enquired what sort of numbers Herr von Neurath had in mind when he spoke of &quot;samples.&quot; I reminded him that in a conversation on the subject a year ago he had given me quite small figures. He said that he had not any figures worked out, but that he would ascertain what were the figures which Germany would ask for on the assumption that Germany waited till the first period was over. Secondly, we all agreed that we must make the most rapid progress possible, and I suggested that we might see whether we could not draft the outline of certain amending clauses to our draft convention which would carry out the ideas which we had been discussing together.I observed in the course of the interview that in Paris yesterday Mr. Eden and I had been struck by the indications that the French were prepared to go a considerable way in the direction of disarmament. Herr von Neurath smilingly suggested that the explanation might be that, a week ago, Herr Hitler, in a long and important talk with the French Ambassador in Berlin, had said that it would be the proudest monument he could wish for in his public life if he was able to bring about Franco-German reconciliation. Herr von Neurath was present at this conversation and evidently attached a good deal of importance to it. While admitting that recent events and policies in Germany had naturally aroused new concern both in Britain and France, he said that things were not really as bad as some outside critics supposed, and spoke as one who was confident that Germany-was going to present herself in better guise to the world when what he called the revolution was over. He mentioned his intention of having a talk with M. Daladier when he arrived in Geneva, and I suggested that it would be a good thing if an opportunity occurred for M. Daladier, Herr von Neurath, Mr. Norman Davis, Baron Aloisi and myself to meet Mr. Henderson informally on the invitation of the last named. Herr von Neurath agreed, as long as the occasion was something like a tea-party, which was less likely to provoke protests from other Powers. He said that he had received a message from Signor Mussolini [9155] b 2
suggesting a four-Power meeting to promote a disarmament settlement atStresa in the early days of October. I said we had news of this suggestion indirectly, hut I doubted whether such a meeting was advisable unless and until the substance of an agreement was in sight. Herr von Neurath said that he entirely agreed, and that he had already sent a reply in this sense to Rome.[W 10998/40/98] No. 2.United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office. (Received September 28.) (No. 186.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between the Secretary of State, Signor Suvich and Baron Aloisi respecting disarmament. A copy has been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 27, 1933.Enclosure in No. 2.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State, Signor Suvich and Baron Aloisi at the Hotel Beau Rivage, September 25, 1933.SIGNOR SUVICH and Baron Aloisi came to see me this evening. Mr. Eden was also present.I asked Signor Suvieh whether he was yet in a position to give any reply from the head of the Italian Government to the question which we had addressed to Baron Aloisi on Saturday as to whether the Italian Government were in agreement with us in the view that there could be no rearmament of Germany in the first period of the convention.Signor Suvich said that it was necessary to put oneself in the position of the German Government in order to appreciate the position justly. They had been promised by the agreement of last December equality within a system of security. It could be argued that since supervision was to supply the form of security asked for by the French, the equality should begin to be realised at the same period. Admittedly, during this first period of four years Germany would only be given some few token weapons. Since the armed Powers had decided that they could not begin their reductions for another four years, he thought it would be very difficult to ask Germany to wait as a consequence for the whole of that period without receiving any satisfaction of her claim.I pointed out that the security of supervision would only be real after it had proved itself in operation, and this must take time. Both Mr. Eden.and I were convinced that public opinion in England would never consent to any qualitative rearmament of Germany in the first period. It would, indeed, be a sorry outcome of a Disarmament Conference if the only consequence of its first period was the rearmament of Germany. I impressed upon Signor Suvich the strength of British opinion on this subject, and begged him to do his utmost to make clear to Baron von Neurath, whom he is to see to-morrow morning, the impossibility of any modification of our attitude on this point, as to which we were in full agreement with the French Government.. Since, however, it was clearly impossible to give the German Government any satisfaction as to rearmament in the first period of the convention, we might be able to facilitate agreement in some other way. I asked Signor Suvich whether he had considered the possibility of a shorter first period than four years. If that period were reduced to three years, it would be a considerable concession to germany, since it would bring nearer both the disarmament of the armed Powers and the enjoyment of samples by Germany. This seemed to me the utmost concession that could be made to Germany in this direction.
Signor Suvich seemed to agree that this might offer to Germany some consolation, though he added the suggestion that two years should be long enough. I replied that such a period would be too short to assess fairly the value of supervision.I then asked Signor Suvich whether the French Government had asked his view on the subject of sanctions and what that view had been.Signor Suvich said that the Italian Government had no liking for sanctions, but that, if this question were to prove the obstacle to a convention, they could perhaps modify their attitude to the extent of agreeing to sanctions if these were not of too formidable a character. In any event, they could not accept sanctions that were not also accepted by all the signatories of the convention. They could accept no sanctions confined to the continent of Europe alone.I explained to Signor Suvich that His Majesty&apos;s Government could in no circumstances agree to accept any new commitment on the continent of Europe. Our present commitments stood; we could not add to them. On this point, as on that of the rearmament of Germany in the first period of the convention, British opinion was adamant, and I hoped that we should have Italian support in our attitude.I then detailed to Signor Suvich the proposal which I had previously explained to Baron Aloisi that it might be possible, by transferring the articles now in Part I of the convention, imposing an obligation to consult in the event of a breach of the Kellogg Pact, to Part V of the convention, which dealt with the Permanent Disarmament Commission, to state that any breach of that convention would be a matter of concern to the signatories and would involve the procedure of consultation now envisaged in Part I.Signor Suvich said that he would carefully consider this proposal, which the French had also mentioned to him. They had commented favourably upon it as likely to prove acceptable to the United States.J. S.No. 3.Consul, Geneva, to Sir John Simon. (Received September 29.) (No. 321.   L.N.)(Telegraphic.) Geneva, September 29, 1933.FOLLOWING for Prime Minister from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs : &quot; Following appears to be the situation regarding disarmament as it emerges from recent conversations : &quot; Germans do not reject the French idea of a trial period, though they maintain that four years is too long; they declare they are ready to accept French system of supervision, provided it is applied equally to all alike. Central point of difficulty between French and Germans is that latter demand &apos; samples &apos; during trial period and this the former resolutely refuse. I do not pretend that there would not be a host of difficulties in regard to working out details of all other provisions, but if negotiations were to break down at this stage it is on this point of &apos; samples &apos; in the first period that the break would ostensibly occur.&quot; German attitude on the point is not very reasonable; to refuse a convention which would concede them what they ask in 1938 simply because they cannot obtain it in 1934 might fail to win them a favourable opinion in disinterested quarters. It is really a question of timing. Agreement of December last promised Germany equality of rights in a system of security; feeling of insecurity has undeniably been increased by recent events in Germany, and time is required to efface the impression which has been created. It is impossible to know how resolutely Germans will maintain their position in regard to this question. Herr von Neurath is emphatic in his refusal to reconsider the matter. But doubtless he enjoys little latitude in negotiations.
&quot; As is often the way in these discussions, it is. very, difficult to. obtain clear definitions of what is meant by particular demands, and.I confess. I am unable to give you an exact idea of what Germans, mean by &apos; samples.&apos; Italians give me to understand that it would mean a few army co-operation; aeroplanes, or even only a small number for &apos; police purposes.&apos;&apos;&apos; Italians would be ready to make concessions to Germany. Americans are with us in backing French resistance.&quot; These exchanges of views have brought matters to a head, and the real crisis of Disarmament Conference cannot be long delayed, for it would be unthinkable that conference could sit down to a second reading of British draft in the knowledge of this open difference on a vital point, and Bureau on 9th October and General Commission a week later would, if present position persists, have to confess failure.&quot;[W 11035/40/98] No. 4.United Kingdom Delegate, Geneva, to Foreign Office. [Received September 30.) (No. 191.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between Sir John Simon, Signor Suvich and Baron Aloisi respecting disarmament.A copy has been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.Geneva, September 29, 1933.Enclosure in No. 4.Record of a Conversation between Signor Suvich,  Baron Aloisi  and  the Secretary of State at Hotel Beau Rivage, Geneva, on September 29, 1933.SIGNOR SUVICH and Baron Aloisi came to see me this morning to report the results of the various conversations which they had had on the subject of disarmament.Mr. Eden was also present.Signor Suvich observed that the main outstanding point of difficulty was presented by the question whether the Germans should be allowed to have &quot; samples &quot; during the first period of the convention. With the Germans this was really a matter of prestige; their could not continue for a further period of years under the discrimination which the Treaty of Versailles had established against them.I said that from the original Italian proposals, I had understood that during the first period it was intended to increase the material now allowed to the Reichswehr in proportion to the increase which would be brought about under the convention in the numbers of German effectives, and this appeared to me to be not unreasonable. Was I, however, now to understand that the Germans would claim in the first period to equip their army with samples of all types of weapons which the convention might ultimately allow other signatories to possess ?Signor Suvich said that in theory that was the German demand though, so far as he could understand, they would be content with a number of fighter aeroplanes. They attached particular importance to this because though on land and at sea they had means of defence against attack, in the air they were practically defenceless, being deprived of military aviation and even anti-aircraft guns.I asked if Signor Suvich knew what was the German intention as to what should happen in the second period. If they were to be allowed samples in the first period, did they expect complete numerical equality by the end of the second period?Signor Suvich replied that as he understood it the Germans would require only very few samples in the first period, and though they would require larger-
numbers of each type of weapon in the second period, still those numbers would not be proportionate to those possessed by the other principal Powers.This conversation clarified to some extent the main point of difficulty, but Signor Suvich was unable to suggest any particular solution.I enquired of him whether Signor Mussolini still attached importance to the idea of a meeting of representatives of the Four Powers somewhere outside Geneva, and he told me that he thought that Signor Mussolini would not in any -case press this proposal until a basis of-agreement had been found.Signor Suvich is leaving Geneva to-morrow, and Baron Aloisi will remain here. They promised to call on me again at 6 o&apos;clock this evening after a further interview with the German delegation.J. S.[W 11036/40/98] No. 5.United Kingdom Delegate, Geneva, to Foreign Office.

(No. 192.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between Sir John Simon and Baron von Neurath respecting disarmament.A copy has been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.Geneva, September 29, 1933.Enclosure in No. 5.Record of a Conversation between Baron von Neurath and the Secretary of State at the Hotel Beau Rivage on September 29, 1933..: HERR von NEURATH came to see me this morning. Mr. Eden was also present.Herr von Neurath began by saying that he had come to take leave of me. I at once said that I understood he was returning to Berlin to make contact with his Government, and I expressed the hope that he would very shortly return to Geneva.Herr von Neurath said that that was his intention. He expected to see Herr Hitler on Sunday, but the latter would be leaving that day on a visit to the President in East Prussia and might not be back until Tuesday. Herr von Neurath would communicate with me from Berlin as soon as he could make any definite plans.I suggested to Herr von Neurath, who had told me that he was going to see the press this evening, that he might make it clear to them that his departure from Geneva arose from the necessity of consulting his Government, and did not by any means indicate that a breakdown or a deadlock had been reached in the conversations here, and he promised to explain this to the press.We then discussed the present stage of the conversations. I observed that the great outstanding difficulty was the demand of Germany to be allowed &quot; samples &quot; during the first period of the convention. I explained that, in my view, it would be impossible to induce English public opinion to accept this proposition. We gladly recognised the German claim to equality of rights, but what public opinion in England concerned itself with first and foremost was disarmament, and would not accept the idea that equality of rights should be sought by raising the level of armaments.Herr von Neurath said that it was asking too much of Germany to invite her acceptance of a convention which provided for a trial period during which she would not be allowed even &quot;samples,&quot; whilst at the same time she was offered practically no disarmament by others. I gathered from what he said that he was under the impression that the other Governments would only promise to consider at the end of the first period what reductions they might be prepared to
No. 6.Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin). (No. 183.   Very Confidential.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 4, 1933.AT my last interview with Herr von Neurath in Geneva on 29th September he promised that he would, if possible, communicate with me from Berlin, informing me of what he had ascertained as to the views of his Government on the matters we had been discussing, and he mentioned Tuesday (yesterday) as the day when he thought he could do this; in particular, he was going to inform me (as promised at our earlier interview on 23rd September) what sort of numbers were intended by his reference to &apos;( samples.&quot;Would you make enquiries and let me know when I may hope to hear from the German Government on these points ? (For your own information.)We shall have a Cabinet on Monday to decide with more precision our own attitude, and in consequence I shall not be able to reach Geneva personally until Wednesday morning. In any conversation you have with Herr von Neurath you will bear in mind the extreme importance of securing that he returns to Geneva and is present at the meeting of the Bureau, if not on the first day (Monday) at any rate as soon as I arrive.make, and I made it clear to him that this was not at all our conception. In our view, the convention to be signed would include a definite undertaking to proceed during the second period, and by specified stages, to a really substantial reduction of armaments.Herr von Neurath indicated that he had heard reductions spoken of, but he had not been able to ascertain accurately what was contemplated in this matter.I did not feel at liberty to indicate to him in detail the reductions of which French Ministers had spoken to us, but I recapitulated to him the position as follows : -The convention would be divided into two periods, but that the provisions relating to both periods would be covered by one act of signature. During the first period the Reichswehr and the other continental armies would be trans-formed, as provided in the British draft. At the same time Germany would be able to increase the material now allowed to the Reichswehr proportionately with the increase of German effectives indicated in the draft convention. Immediately the convention came into force a Permanent Disarmament Commission would be set up with the mission of assuring itself that all signatories of the convention observed all the engagements which they undertook in the convention itself.I drew his attention to this point, making it clear to him that there was no idea in our minds of any differential treatment of Germany in the matter of supervision. During the first period, moreover, there might be an undertaking on the part of all signatories not to increase their material, and this also would have to be checked by the Permanent Disarmament Commission.In the second period all signatories would undertake to abolish heavy material, but Germany would be allowed to acquire any types retained by others. I did not feel at liberty to give Herr von Neurath the details of what the French Ministers had told us they were prepared to do in this respect, and I gathered from him that he had received no communication on the subject direct from the French delegation.I begged Herr von Neurath to believe that it would be extremely difficult to secure acceptance in England of the idea that Germany could obtain samples in the first period, and to reflect on the advantages which Germany might secure after a comparatively short period of waiting by accepting a convention on the lines which I indicated.J.

Sir E. Phipps to Sir John Simon. (Received&apos;October 5.)[By Telephone.](No. 207.)(Telegraphic.)   En clair. Berlin, October 5, 1933.BARON von NEURATH is still in Wiirtemberg, but I sounded Herr von Bulow at our first meeting to-day.German Government have sent information regarding their views to Prince Bismarck, who will convey it to Foreign Office to-day. Same information has been telegraphed to the German Minister at Berne, now at Geneva, who will be able to give any further explanations required.[W 11281/40/98] No. 8.Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin).(No. 907.)Sir, Foreign Office, October 6, 1933.THE German Charge d&apos;Affaires saw me this morning in order to make what he described as a preliminary statement of Germany&apos;s attitude as to the treatment of armaments in any convention now being negotiated at Geneva. Prince Bismarck said that a similar communication was being made verbally at Rome. He did not know whether the French Government was likewise being informed. The statement was preliminary because Germany would be represented next week at Geneva by Herr Nadolny (Herr von Neurath is not returning there at present), and, as I understood, the German representative would make a declaration in the bureau.  .2. Prince Bismarck said that the basis of Germany&apos;s point of view was the demand for equality. This demand was acknowledged by the joint declaration of the 11th December last year. Germany has from the beginning accepted the British plan, which provided for a five years&apos; convention. She will raise no objection if it is desired to sub-divide the total period, but Germany cannot accept a period of probation; if there is a first stage of two years, equality would have to be applied to Germany in those first two years.3. As regards the Reichswehr, Germany was ready &quot;in a spirit of accommodation&quot; to begin its transformation immediately. She could not, however, furnish particulars as to the equipment of the substituted forces until it has been made clear what concrete measures of disarmament the convention would provide in respect of war material. When it was known what arms would be abolished and what retained, Germany would be able to be more specific about the equipment her new army would need.4. Prince Bismarck went on to analyse the British draff convention in respect of land armaments by dividing these into three categories and to state Germany&apos;s claim under each category.5. As regards arms which would be prohibited in the future, Germany would regard no prohibition as too drastic provided it was universally applied. Germany would even renounce any claim to classes of arms which the armed States covenanted to destroy in the course of the duration of the convention and the further use of which was internationally forbidden. But Germany wished to know as soon as possible what these arms were.6. Secondly, came the category of those arms, possession of which would be retained though the total in the hands of any given country would be numerically limited. For example, there was the schedule of suggested numerical limits to the air forces of various European countries in the British draft. Germany wished to know whether other nations agreed to these limits. Germany must be granted in the first period arms falling within this category, though the amount which she would have would remain the subject of further discussion. Prince Bismarck called specific attention to a passage in the British White Paper of the 17th November, 1932 (Cmd. Paper 4189, p. 5, &quot; Tanks &quot;), which is as follows r &quot; The admission of equal treatment would make it impossible to deny, in[9155] c
No. 9.Sir John Simon to Sir E. Phipps (Berlin). (Nos. 185 and .186.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 6, 1933.(R.) GERMAN Charge d&apos;Affaires saw me this morning to make what he described as a preliminary statement of Germany&apos;s attitude as to treatment of armaments in convention being negotiated at Geneva. Prince Bismarck said Rome was being informed verbally. He did not know whether French Govern-ment were likewise being informed. Statement was preliminary because Germany would be represented next week at Geneya by Herr Nadolny in the bureau of the Conference at Geneva.  Herr von Neurath is not returning there at present.principle, to Germany the right to possess a limited number of such weapons, but the question whether this should be so in practice, andj if so, what number would be sufficient, depends upon a consideration of the purposes. to be served by each national army. In any case, the point is one for negotiation and not for decision in advance of discussions at Geneva in which Germany would take part.&quot;7. The third category was that of arms which in the convention would neither be prohibited nor numerically limited. Here Germany&apos;s position was that if the possession of such arms by others was without numerical limit, no numerical limit could be applied to Germany. For example, to provide in connexion with the transformation of the Reichswehr that Germany might have double the quantity of arms allowed to her under the Treaty of Versailles, would be to treat Germany differently from others. It would amount to a continuance of the Treaty of Versailles and would not be compatible with the security of Germany.8. Prince Bismarck concluded by saying that Germany was willing to give detailed explanations of her attitude during the forthcoming meetings at Geneva, and he asked whether I had any comments to make on what he had said.9. I replied by saying that as his visit was for the purpose of making the above communication, I should, of course, first wish to study it carefully. But two comments did occur to me at once: Herr von Neurath had constantly mentioned the subject of &quot; samples,&quot; and I had understood from the Italians at Geneva that this mode of treatment had been in the mind of Herr von Neurath quite recently. Certainly, he had hinted to me as long ago as last year that a very limited number of such &quot;samples&quot; was contemplated. Where was the reference to &quot;samples&quot; in the communication now made to me? Without expressing any view as to samples, it was clear that there was a vast difference between the conception of limited specimens and the claim which was now being put forward for the first period. This claim ignored altogether the plan of stages. Prince Bismarck said that he agreed with me and that he could not find any application of the method of samples in the present German statement any more than I could. Secondly, I said that it was wrong to quote the Declaration of the 11th December as though it simply proclaimed equality; on the contrary, the formula was one which referred to the principle of equality in a regime of security. What was there in the present German statement which dealt with that ? Prince Bismarck replied that the present communication was in reference to the amount and nature of armament. As regards a system of. supervision, he confirmed my understanding that Germany raised no objection to a thorough system as long as it was not specially applied to her. I said that I had always appreciated that the control must be of general application, though the detailed arrangements would necessarily greatly vary according to the circumstances of the country inspected. He agreed, but added that the inspection must have reference to the provisions of the new agreement and not to go into the past. I said that if what he meant was that the inspection could not be a roving commission about everything and anything, but would be with reference to what the new convention contained, I agreed with him, but that of course if a country under the new convention was not permitted to have weapons of a certain kind and supervision showed that she had such weapons, it would be no answer to say that she had acquired them before the convention came into force. To this he agreed.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.
:!i .2282. Prince Bismarck said that basis of Germany&apos;s point of view was the demand for equality&apos;. This demand was acknowledged by the joint declaration of&apos; 11th December last. Germany has from the beginning accepted British plan; which provided for five years&apos; convention. She will raise no objection if it is desired to subdivide the total period, but she cannot accept a period of probation; if there is a first stage of two years, equality would have to be applied to her in those first two years.3. As regards the Reichswehr, Prince Bismarck said Germany was ready &quot; in a spirit of accommodation &quot; to begin its transformation immediately. She could not, however, furnish particulars as to equipment of the substituted forces until it has been made clear what concrete measures of disarmament the convention would provide in respect of war material. When it was known what arms would be abolished and what retained, Germany would be able to be more specific about the equipment her new army would need.4. Prince Bismarck went on to analyse British draft convention in respect of land armaments by dividing these into three categories and to state Germany&apos;s claim under each category.5. As regards arms which would be prohibited in the future, Germany would regard no prohibition as too drastic provided it was universally applied. Germany would even renounce any claim to classes of arms which armed States covenanted to destroy in the course of the duration of convention and the further use of which was internationally forbidden. But Germany wished to know as soon as possible what these arms were.6. Secondly came the category of those arms possession of which would be retained though total in the hands of any given country would be numerically limited. For example, there was the schedule of suggested numerical limits to the air forces of various European countries in British draft. Germany wished to know whether other nations agreed to these limits. Germany must be granted in first period arms falling within this category, though amount which she would have would remain the subject of further discussion. Prince Bismarck called specific attention to a passage in British White Paper of 17th November, 1932 (see Cmd. Paper 4189, page 5, &quot; Tanks &quot;) which is as follows : &quot; The admission of equal treatment .... Germany would, take part.&quot;7. The third category was that of arms which in convention would neither be prohibited nor numerically limited. Here Germany&apos;s position was that if the possession of such arms by others was without numerical limit no numerical limit could be applied to Germany. For example, to provide in connexion with transformation of Reichswehr that Germany might have double the quantity of arms allowed to her under Treaty of Versailles would be to treat Germany differently from others. It would amount to a continuance of Treaty of Versailles and would not be compatible with the security of Germany.8. Prince Bismarck concluded by saying that Germany was willing to give detailed explanations of her attitude during forthcoming meetings at Geneva, and he asked whether I had any comments to make on what he had said. (End of R.)9. I answered that, as his visit was for purpose of making above communi-cation, I should of course first wish to study it carefully. But two comments did occur to me at once; Herr von Neurath had constantly mentioned the subject of &quot; samples,&quot; and I had understood from the Italians at Geneva that this mode of treatment had been in the mind of Herr von Neurath quite recently. Certainly, he had hinted to me as long ago as last year that a very limited number of such &quot; samples &quot; was contemplated. Where was the reference to &quot; samples &quot; in the communication now made to me ? Without expressing any view as to samples, it was clear that there was a vast difference between the conception of limited specimens and the claim which was now being put forward for the first period. This claim ignores altogether the plan of stages. Prince Bismarck said that he agreed with me and that he could not find any application of method of samples in present German statement any more than I could. Secondly, I said that it was wrong to quote the declaration of 11th December as though it simply proclaimed equality; on the contrary, the formula was one which referred to the principle of equality in a regime of security. What was there in present German statement which dealt with that ? Prince Bismarck replied that present communication was in reference to the amount and nature of armament. As regards a system of supervision, he confirmed my understanding that Germany[9155] c 2
raised no objection to a thorough system as long as it was not specially applied to her. I said that I had always appreciated that the control must be of general application, though the detailed arrangements would necessarily greatly vary according to circumstances of the country inspected. He agreed, but added that inspection must have reference to the provisions of the new agreement and not go into the past. I said that if what he meant was that the inspection could not be a roving commission about everything and anything, but would be with reference to what the new convention contained, I agreed with him, but that of course if a country under new convention was not permitted to have weapons of a certain kind and supervision showed that she had such weapons, it would be no answer to say that she had acquired them before the convention came into force.

(Received October 7.)(No. 291.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, October 7, 1933.YOUR telegram No. 322 and 323.Similar communication was made by the German Ambassador here to Signor Suvich as Signor Mussolini was away in the country and has only just returned. Signor Suvich, as you did, asked for time to make careful study of com-munication, but told Herr von Hassell that it seemed to him at first sight to be &quot;a remarkable step backward.&quot; The last Italian-German conversations on the subject with Herr von Neurath at Geneva.had turned on &quot;samples &quot; during first period, and Italians had been willing to offer a certain measure of help in this direction, but present German proposal was of a totally different character. Signor Suvich could not imagine France or Great Britain, or, indeed, Italy, entertaining anything of the kind. He asked German Ambassador to tell him frankly whether it meant that Germans desired to break off negotiations altogether, for if this was the case they had better say so outright. Herr von Hassell warmly disclaimed any such intention, and said that Germans were most anxious to come to an agreement.Signor Suvich told me he thought Signor Mussolini&apos;s reaction to the German proposal was similar to his own, although they had as yet scarcely had time to consider it. They were to discuss it this evening. Signor Suvich would propose to Signor Mussolini that Italian answer should be that new proposal offered no basis for discussion, and that if Germans really desired an agreement they must think of something better. Signor Suvich said that Italian action at Berlin in the case of Austria had attained a certain measure of success, but that in present instance he did not consider any fresh Italian action could usefully be taken. According to Italian Ambassador at Berlin present German proposal emanated directly from the Chancellor. Signor Suvich&apos;s explanation was that Hitler soared in the clouds, and that he had descended to make this proposal with a most imperfect knowledge of the subject and of what had happened in the negotiations at Geneva. Chancellor suffered from a righteous indignation over the fact that Germany remained disarmed while surrounded by armed nations and could only regard question from this angle.In accordance with your telegram No. 324 I again impressed on Signor Suvich depth of British feeling and found, from a telegram which he read to me, that Signor Cerutti had already made desired communication at Berlin on the subject (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 282). I also made a very discreet use of the last paragraph of your telegram No. 324, but this was scarcely necessary as I am well satisfied with Italian reaction up to date.I hope to see Signor Mussolini on Monday and will report further.German proposal was communicated by Baron Aloisi to M. Boncour.
13229.Consul, Geneva, to Sir John Simon.(Received October 8.)(No. 340. L.N.) ((Telegraphic.)Geneva, October 8, 1933.FOLLOWING from Mr. Eden :-&quot; Signor Soragna asked to see me on my arrival this morning and expressed concern at possible outcome of bureau to-morrow. He admitted German reply was not altogether satisfactory and said that Baron Aloisi had returned to Rome to consult with Signor Mussolini on situation. He hoped none the less that it might be possible to avoid any exacerbation of opposition at the bureau. Could it not be said that conversations were continuing and that bureau would be called together later in the week when they had progressed further? To this I said difficulty in such a procedure must be that German Governments latest proposals, so far as I understood them, appeared to offer no basis for believing that conversations would in fact make progress. None the less if there were any chance of a serious modifica-tion of German attitude we should certainly not wish to do anything to prevent it. Signor Soragna said that he would see Herr Nadolny this evening on his arrival and would report to me upon the outcome.&apos;11 have since had a long interview with Mr. Davis. He regards the last statement of German case as particularly unsatisfactory in its presentation. He made point that it appeared to go back on Baron von Neurath&apos;s acceptance of idea of two periods. None the less from conversations which he had had with German representatives here he thought Germans would probably agree to two periods in effect, though they rejected the idea in manner. Possibly if French Government could offer to get rid of its heaviest material, say 14-inch guns, which he believed were, in fact useless at an earlier date, for instance, at the end of two years, this might meet German standpoint. I replied that I thought French had already offered as much as could reasonably be asked of them, and that in light of German response I felt it impossible to suggest to them that they should offer more. Mr. Davis a,greed.&quot;He then stated his chief anxiety was due to information which he had received which he believed to be reliable that certain elements in German Government were now actively working against realisation of a convention. These were members of the Eight wing of present German Administration, who believed Hitler&apos;s position to be weakening and who hoped that breakdown of conference might finally bring him down.&quot; Mr. Davis proceeded to urge that two-Power talks had exhausted their usefulness. He still himself appeared to prefer that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and United States should now seek to proceed by five-Power conversations. I asked him whether he had any reason to suppose French had modified their attitude of refusing to attend such conversations. He said he thought they might do so if they could be assured we should not Use the occasion to ask them for more concessions. In any case he believed some such meeting was right procedure now.&apos;&apos; I am to see M. Boncour this evening and will telegraph result of that interview.&quot;(Repeated to Berlin, Rome and Paris.)OFFICIAL National Socialist organ publishes to-day message from its Geneva correspondent violently protesting against &apos;&apos; savage creation of anti-No. 12.Sir E.

If Germany is to^ have an army of 200,000, that army must have a different quality of armament to what it now possesses.

L.N.)(Telegraphic.) Geneva, October 8, 1933.FOLLOWING from Mr. Eden :-&quot; I saw M. Boncour this evening. He began by expressing warm appre-ciation of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s speech at Birmingham, for which French Government were sincerely grateful. It had greatly reassured their public opinion and he hoped that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be gratified at the speech which M. Daladier was making at Vichy this afternoon, of which he showed me a copy. M. Boncour went on to discuss the German reply. He said that this was clearly a retrograde step. Germans were, as usual, asking for more. This did not surprise him since he was himself convinced German Government did not want a convention and that they would pursue these tactics to the end. Baron Aloisi had been to see him before leaving for Rome and had asked him whether French Government could not make some further concession to ease the situation. M. Boncour had said that this was quite impossible. France could never agree to German rearmament in first period, and he begged Baron Aloisi to impress that on Signor Mussolini.&quot; We then discussed procedure of to-morrow. M. Boncour thought it would be very difficult to avoid giving some account of conversations that had taken place, but he was quite prepared to maintain discussion on general terms which I said I should prefer pending your arrival. M. Boncour asked whether His Majesty&apos;s Government had considered what was to be the procedure when general commission met. Possibly best procedure would be to record measure of agreement which he believed had now been reached between French, British, American and perhaps Italian Governments and to ask conference to endorse it. He was convinced that such a statement would meet with overwhelming support from the conference and it might then be that Germans would at length be compelled to [group omitted] a more reasonable attitude.&quot; M. Boncour argued that French Government had gone very far in their concessions which virtually gave Germany equality in second period. Had Italian Government stood firm against German rearmament in the first period as His Majesty&apos;s Government, United States and French Governments, German Government&apos;s reply would have been different.&quot;M. Boncour was clearly anxious as to the future and I am informed that French delegation here is nervous. Their main concern is clearly to keep in close contact with us so that we may act together. It is, perhaps, significant that word &apos; sanctions &apos; was not mentioned at any moment in our interview.&quot;Herr Nadolny has asked to see me late this evening.&quot; (Repeated to Paris, Rome and Berlin.)
[W 11434/40/98] No. 15.Conference for the Reduction and Limitation oe Armaments.Statement by the President at the Meeting of the Bureau held on Monday, October 9, 1933, at 4-15 p.m. (Received October 11.)ACTING on the decision of the General Commission taken at its meeting on the 29th June, 1 made visits to Paris, Rome, Berlin, Munich and London and had conversations with the heads and other representatives of the respective Governments with a view to securing a greater measure of agreement on a number of points which had not yielded to negotiation during the first reading of the British Draft Convention.Useful conversations have been held between Mr. Norman Davis and myself on several occasions, and when in Paris in July I took the opportunity of having a conversation with our vice-president, M. Politis. I also made a visit to Prague and discussed the situation and the future work of the conference with Dr. Benes, our rapporteur. During these visits I was accompanied by Mr. Aghnides, head of the Disarmament Section, and two of his assistants.Believing that the General Commission was desirous of taking decisions on the second reading of the British draft only after every effort had been made to secure the greatest measure of common agreement, I left London on the 18th September and returned to Geneva, and during my journey I had separate conversations with Mr. Norman Davis, Mr. Eden, and, on the morning of the 19th, with M. Paul-Boncour in Paris.In view of the published statements to the effect that my tour of the capitals failed in its object, it is necessary for me to say that the visits accomplished useful work and made it clear that on most of the points outstanding no serious difficulty stood in the way of agreement. I freely take this opportunity of expressing to all the Governments concerned, in the name of the conference, my sincere gratitude for the frank manner with which they discussed all the points and for receiving the mission with more than ordinary courtesy. The negotiations, on the whole, have shown a marked disposition in favour of securing a first-stage convention and on the majority of the points listed by the General Commission agreement could, I think, be reached without our encountering any insuperable difficulty. But on some of the more important questions the approach was manifestlyConsul, Geneva, to Sir John Simon. (Received October 9.) ((No. 343.   L.N.)(Telegraphic.) Geneva, October 8, 1933.FOLLOWING from Mr. Eden :-&quot;Herr Nadolny came to see me this evening and began by stating emphatically that the German Government could not agree to two periods. When I pointed out Herr von Neurath had already agreed to this, he qualified his statement by saying position might be met by a rearrangement of dates in convention without any explicit mention of two periods. He contended that opinion in Germany had been much irritated by this suggestion of first period, which seemed to throw doubt upon Germany&apos;s good faith. No country could be expected to endure such reflection. I explained that however period was expressed, essential was to know whether Germany still insisted on types in the first, since His Maj esty&apos;s Government could not agree to this. First he maintained that equality of rights must begin at once. Later he seemed to imply that some slight modification in detail of German attitude might be possible, though I could not obtain any precise explanation of what they might, have been prepared to do.&quot;(Repeated to Paris, Eome and Berlin.)
influenced by the-present unsettled state of Europe and the ensuing distrust, fears and alarms. &apos; &apos;(,&apos;-&apos;..&apos; ,      -  &apos; .Nevertheless, when my visit to the capitals was concluded, the situation was clarified to a considerable extent in that I was made more aware of where the real difficulties lay and how some of them might be overcome.It may be helpful if I divide the outstanding questions into two categories  those on which agreement appeared to be relatively easy, and those which had shown themselves not so easy of&apos; adjustment. In the first category could be placed :  1. Non-recourse to force on a universal basis. 2. Definition of aggressor. 3. Control and supervision.4. Standardisation of European continental armies (a) Trained reserves.(b) Effectives.(c) Colonial forces.5. Control of budgetary publicity. 6. Bombing from the air.7. The early setting up of the Permanent Disarmament Commission. 8. Naval questions.The second list of more difficult, though less numerous, questions includes : 1. The period of the duration of a first-stage convention. 2. Size of tanks and artillery.3. Reduction of land war material, either by destruction or otherwise.4: Manufacture of and trade in arms.5. Military and naval aviation.6. Penalties against the violation of the convention.Two opinions prevail on the question of the duration of the convention.Some countries have shown a decided preference for a five-year convention during which the destruction of the forbidden material and the equality of rights might be realised by stages.&apos; Other countries have suggested an eight-year convention divided into two periods of four years, the first of which for the sake of convenience might be called a period of experience or of adaptation. The Permanent Disarmament Corn-mission would be charged with the responsibility of deciding whether the machinery of control and supervision had been effective; in which case the reductions embodied in the convention would be effected during the second period in the manner described in the convention.The Bureau are, of course, aware that my negotiations were, so to speak, a first step towards securing a larger measure of agreement likely to help us in the preparation of the second reading texts. Those conversations were, as you know, continued between various heads of delegations and occasionally with myself, in London, Paris and Geneva.Two points have been found to be particularly difficult:  1. The system of penalties  for the violation of the provisions of theconvention in order to give a greater sense of security. 2. The application of the principle of equality.I have already referred to the early setting up of the Permanent Disarmament Commission. During my visits to the capitals I made a suggestion on this subject which was well received at the time by all the statesmen with whom I discussed this point.The draft convention now under consideration lays it down in article 84 that the Permanent Commission shall meet for the first time on being summoned by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations within three months from the entry into force of the convention to elect its provisional officers and to. draw up its rules of procedure. That means that this work could not be undertaken till after ratification, which involves a great loss of time.
. In my opiuion it is unnecessary,to wait for. the ratification of the convention and still less for a further three months, as certain Governments may require time for ratification. -I, therefore, venture to suggest that the commission should meet immediately on the signature of the convention by, say, twenty States.This might be provided for either by a resolution of the conference or by means of transitory provisions embodied in the convention.In this manner the commission would be enabled, to perform between the times of signature and ratification of the convention all those provisional duties mentioned in the convention, and such other temporary tasks as the conference may consider desirable to entrust to it.The moment the convention comes into force, the machinery set up by the commission in what may be called the pre-ratification stage will come into operation.If this proposal is accepted the commission will be ready to assume its permanent functions the moment the convention enters into force.I have already pointed out to you that the extent of common agreement so far secured does not cover all the outstanding contentious points. In the circum-stances, I feel sure that the Bureau will agree with me that it is essential that the conversations should be actively pursued for another two or three days in order that a satisfactory solution may be found to the differences of opinion still existing, particularly as regards the question of the defensive weapons claimed by the disarmed countries during the period of experience and the question of penalties.I feel equally sure that the Bureau will agree with me that in view of all the preparatory work that has been done there should be no delay in the meeting of the General Commission. The conversations in the next few days should be conducted with the object of clarifying still further the situation, and narrowing the issues in time for the meeting of the General Commission on the 16th October. There is no longer need for technical discussions. What is required now are political decisions.This would enable the General Commission, when it resumes its work on Monday, to embark upon the second reading of the United Kingdom draft.In preparation for the General Commission, the draft convention has, at my request, been communicated to you in a tabulated form, so that the Bureau should be put in possession not only of the text of the United Kingdom draft as modified in the course of the first reading, but also of the amendments presented so far.But, in view of the negotiations and conversations carried out both by your president and by most of the delegates present here, and which are continuing, it is obvious that some of the articles wiil have to be amended in the light of any agreements reached. Someone will, therefore, have to be appointed at some stage to assume the responsibility of presenting new texts. The United Kingdom delegation, who have already provided us with the original draft, which we have adopted as the basis of the future convention, are likely to carry out this work with greater ease than any other. If they are good enough to assume this further responsibility, I am confident that the Bureau and the General Commission would be grateful to them.In conclusion may I say that I am not satisfied that sufficient progress has been made during the conversations as to justify the hope that an immediate public discussion, on one or two points, would serve any useful purpose. On the other hand, I am profoundly convinced that further postponement of the General Commission would arouse suspicion and give credence to the suggestion already freely circulated, that the conference no longer intends to formulate a genuine convention providing for the reduction and limitation of armaments. This is not my opinion by any means, for, as I have already stated, the negotiations have shown a marked disposition in favour of securing a first-stage convention, and it is difficult to see how it could be otherwise, in view of the important decisions to which the General Commission is already committed; especially when it resolved that a substantial reduction of world armaments shall be effected to be applied alike to land, naval and air armaments.If the delegations are determined to apply the general principles contained in the resolutions which the General Commission has already adopted, then success is assured, but I am convinced that it is of the highest importance that we should press on without delay and without intermission.[9155] d
The conclusion I have reached, therefore, is that everything must be done, by a continuance, of the private conversations and negotiations, to remove-existing divergencies of opinion and to find a method of procedure which would enable-us to do the remainder of our work with reasonable expedition and without increasing the risk of failure. To this end I suggest that the Bureau at the close of this meeting should stand adjourned until Thursday afternoon next at 3-30.[W 11431/40/98] No. 16.Sir John Simon to Sir E.

I told him that when Prince Bismarck communicated to me last Friday the views of the German Government on various disarmament questions discussed between the representatives of various Powers at Geneva during recent weeks (see my despatch of the 6th October), I felt that the claims put forward from Berlin were of so grave a nature and were so clearly calculated not to promote agreement at Geneva, but, on the contrary, to make it almost impossible, that I had told the Charge d&apos;Affaires that his communication would be carefully studied and limited myself for the moment to one or two obvious comments. The German communication had now been considered in all its bearings by the Cabinet, and I wished to inform the Ambassador of our views. We were sorry to find that the communication does not indicate any approach towards the views of others, but on the contrary, definitely widens the breach.2. I took two examples. In my recent conversations at Geneva with Herr von Neurath, the conception was developed of a convention which would provide in the first period for the transformation of the Reichswehr and the modification of other continental armies on the lines of the British draft, together with the putting into operation of a general system of supervision, followed by a second period in which substantial disarmament by the heavily-armed Powers would take place. We now gathered from Friday&apos;s communication that Germany wishes to reject this conception of two periods altogether. Prince Bismarck had said that Germany &quot; cannot accept a period of probation.&quot; That was a phrase I had myself never used, but a preliminary period was necessary if the object is to apply to principles of equality in a regime of security. Germany should face the undoubted fact that substantial disarmament would be most rapidly and surely obtained by establishing the sense of security which the first period was designed to accord. The rejection of this system of stages was not calculated, in our opinion, to promote this sense of security, such rejection would greatly aggravate international suspicion and European tension, and the British Government could not agree with the German Government on this point.3. A second example of what appeared to us to be a widening difference of view was the attitude of Germany as disclosed last Friday on the subject of &quot; samples.&quot; Germany&apos;s latest communication was, in substance, a claim for immediate and substantial rearmament. Herr von Neurath at Geneva had referred to token weapons indeed, I believed he was the first person to make this suggestion as long ago as last year -and in response to my request he told me that he would ascertain more precisely from Berlin what was the real content of the German demand. It now appeared that the demand was not for &quot;samples &quot; at all, but for immediate and substantial quantities, in some cases unrestricted as to amount. The British Cabinet found it very difficult to think that this demand proceeded from a desire to contribute to an agreement at Geneva, and we were bound to let the German Government know that in our judgment it would prove wholly unacceptable.4. I added that I was now going to Geneva and understood that Herr Nadolny would, in a day or two, be making a public statement of the German attitude. (His Excellency seemed doubtful whether this would be the case; he questioned whether the German representative would be making an immediate formal declaration.)

I added that I was now going to Geneva and understood that Herr Nadolny would, in a day or two, be making a public statement of the German attitude. (His Excellency seemed doubtful whether this would be the case; he questioned whether the German representative would be making an immediate formal declaration.) I said that it was plain that any agreement must be an agreement to which all Powers were willing parties. I would do my best to contribute by resuming conversations with representatives assembled at Geneva
whom I,could bring into, consultation, but before the end of the week I anticipated that Mr. Henderson would ask for some account to be publicly given of the com-munications which had passed and of the prospects of a nearer approach to agree-ment. This meant,that various parties would have to make statements, and naturally the views of the German Government, as communicated to me and others, would be part of this material. The Ambassador did not dissent. I, there-fore, hoped very much that Herr Nadolny might have instructions which would be more helpful to an agreement. My immediate duty was to inform the German Government of our own views and to make clear that we should have to lay before the conference a frank and full statement of the position as we understood it.5. In asking the Ambassador to report what I had said to his Government, I invited him to reflect on the part which Britain had played in promoting good relations in Europe after the war. Britain had led the way in urging the due recognition of Germany&apos;s status, in setting an example by the reduction of armaments, and in promoting the peace structure of Europe. We had played our full part in connexion with the evacuation of the Ruhr and withdrawal from the Rhineland. The history of reparations from the Dawes Plan to Lausanne furnished another illustration. The Prime Minister himself came to Geneva to conduct and carry through the Five-Power Agreement. That agreement, while accepting the principle of equality, &quot;in a system which would provide security for all nations,&quot; also bound the signatories in the European field not to attempt to resolve their difficulties by resort to force. Unfortunately, some recent events and declarations in Germany had not contributed to the general sense of European security, and the only way to improve matters was to give time for a better spirit of neighbourliness to develop and for suspicions to be dissipated. If the German Government wished a Disarmament Convention to be reached, we must ask them to refrain from adopting an attitude which is bound to destroy all immediate prospect of agreement. The Cabinet would much regret to be obliged to treat Germany&apos;s last communication as their deliberate and final declaration, for we were satisfied that it could only injure the policy of conciliation and weaken the peace structure of Europe.6. The Ambassador, who had listened with close attention without making any comments, premised to report what I had said; at the end he observed that Germany felt that concessions which she had made in earlier disarmament discussions were now being used to recast the draft agreement to her disadvantage. In the earlier part of the year Germany had been persuaded, after much hesitation and under great pressure, to agree to give up the Reichswehr and to accept a severe system of supervision. But these concessions were in return for disarma-ment, and now the concessions were being embodied in proposals for a first period followed by the &quot;hope&quot; of disarmament at a later stage. I challenged the Ambassador&apos;s description and pointed out that it was the essence of the plan now under discussion that substantial disarmament in the second stage should be provided for in the convention at the time when it was first signed. His Excellency attributed the modifications to the unfavourable view taken by this and other countries of recent internal developments in Germany, and gave me an account of his own favourable impressions. I said that, without discussing how far the unfavourable view entertained by outside opinion was justified, it was necessary to face facts, and it was a fact that the sense of security, without which world-wide disarmament could not be obtained, was shaken and for this reason the British Government urged Germany not to take up an attitude which would only confirm existing anxieties. We were confident that our feelings in the matter were widely shared by other countries who were anxious to promote and secure, by the best means possible, a Disarmament Convention.7. I ought to add that the Ambassador offered an explanation why Germany would not be content with the doubling of the arms permitted by the Treaty of Versailles in connexion with the transformation of the Reichswehr into a short-service force of 200,000 men. He said that a short-service army provided reserves and that if the reserves were to be of any use there must be rifles for them as well as for the 200,000 who were actually in training.I am, &amp;c.JOHN SIMON.
No. 17.Consul, Geneva, to Sir John Simoh..-(Received October 11.) (No. 350.   L.N.)(Telegraphic.) Geneva, October 11, 1933.I SAW M. Paul-Boncour this morning, when, in the course of long discussion, we agreed upon two points as to which we were in accord that no concessions were possible :--(1) That there must be preliminary period.(2) That during that period there should be no rearmament of Germany.We examined possibility of determining Germany&apos;s attitude upon these points by moving a resolution in General Commission indicating that British draft must be made to conform to these principles and to take vote upon it.I then saw Norman Davis. Norman Davis professed himself to be in agree-ment with us on these two points, but he also believes that Germany will ultimately accept them. He therefore seeks to obtain votes of Germany upon a resolution of this kind before the Bureau meets. I have arranged joint meeting between Davis and M. Paul-Boncour and myself for this afternoon.No. 18.Consul, Geneva, to Sir V. Wellesley. (Received October 13.) (No. 358.   L.N.)(Telegraphic.) Geneva, October 12, 1933.FOLLOWING from Secretary of State :-&quot; 1. At 7 o&apos;clock this evening Herr Nadolny told me and Mr. Davis that he was summoned back to Berlin to see Chancellor. He was leaving by motor and aeroplane, and was doubtful whether he could return for Bureau on Saturday. Indeed, he hinted at possibility that he might not return at all. He asked whether I was able to modify attitude which I had communicated to German Ambassador after Monday&apos;s Cabinet and which I had repeated to Herr Nadolny yesterday. I told him I could hold out no prospect of modification on the two essential points, viz., we could not countenance immediate German rearmament, and we felt, in present condition of Europe, a programme of stages was necessary which would lead after an interval to substantial disarmament by heavily armed Powers and equality for Germany in list of permitted weapons. Nadolny stated that our attitude in this respect was unacceptable to Germany. We told him not only was the view I had expressed the view of British and American Governments, but we were confident that it would be endorsed by the great majority of the Powers represented in conference.&quot; 2. I have since seen Mr. Henderson, who agrees that meeting of Bureau on Saturday ought not to be postponed and that General Commission should meet as proposed on Monday. My present intention is to give to the Bureau an objective account of discussions of the last few weeks, stating that in our view above two points are essential, but not stating Germany has rejected them. This seems best way to secure that Germany will be brought into the open while at the same time leaving every opportunity for her to moderate her attitude.&quot; 3. We have just heard rumour from Berlin that President Hindenburg is meeting German Cabinet to-morrow to decide whether Germany shall leave Disarmament Conference. It therefore seems possible that Germany will anticipate matters by declaring her position before Bureau meets.&apos;&apos; 4. Mr. Henderson told me to-night that if Germany withdrew he would be in favour of going on with negotiation of a convention without Germany in order to present her with a complete offer. This seems to me to be a very difficult project, which is likely to be both dangerous and useless. I have not said so especially, as it would seem likely that French would altogether object and their objection would bring project to nought.&quot; 5. Mr. Davis was present throughout my conversation with Herr Nadolny to-night and gave full support of his Government. He assured me that he entirely agrees with our point of view. I will see Italians to-morrow morning.&quot;(Repeated to Paris, Berlin and Rome.)o
