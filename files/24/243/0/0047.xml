(THIS -DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO. *SECRET.CP.  246 (33)CABINET.INDIA,Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government  of India,  dated 24th October, 1933Circulated for the  information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 24th October 1933 Issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.During the last month there has been little marked development in the political situation.     The attempts to revive civil disobedience by individual efforts, which led to some increase in the number of convictions for these offences during August and the first half of September, especially in United Provinces and in Behar and Orissa, have gradually died down, and it may be said that , for the time being at least, civil disobedience has almost come to an end.       In Bombay Presidency, Congress have endeavoured to keep  themselves in the public eye by Swadeshi and untouchability propaganda in connection with the celebration of Mr. Gandhi rs 65th birthday, but in neither case did they succeed in rousing much public interest.      Similar attempts appear to be made in Madras, but Harijan Day is said to have passed almost unnoticed in the districts.Interest now chiefly centres in the activities of Jawahar Lai Nehru who, since his return from Poona, has been engaged, in discussions with Congress leaders in the United Provinces.    His programme, the salient points of which were briefly mentioned in the last appreciation, is on the lines of Resolution passed at Karachi Congress in March 1931, and involves, in the political sphere, complete independence, and in the economic sphere, the end of the exploitation of the masses by breaking down vested interests of the British Government, the Indian Princes and land-holding clashes.   He has alluded in particular to.the close connection between the problem of Indian freedom and the vital international problem of the world and has explained that in India, as
elsewhere, there must be a conflict between the forces of progress and betterment of the masses and the farces of reaction and vested interests.       He has also made it clear that individual civil disobedience can develop into mass civil disobedience and that there is no objection to any organisation, which feels sufficiently strong, under-talcing a mass movement,,On this latter point, he states that he has the approval of Mr. Gandhi .     More recent reports show that he has received considerable support from Congress men in United Provinces for his policy of continuing civil disobedience, and of developing it on economic lines.     A recent informal conference of 80 leading Congress men at Allahabad appears to have endorsed this programme.     Though the resolution renders lip service to official Congress programme of individual  civil disobedience, there is little doubt that Pandit Jawahar lalls main object is to inoculate the mass with the virus of communism.     The danger of propaganda on communistic lines, especially among rural population of United Provinces, requires to be taken very seriously into account.Whether Jawahar Lai will endeavour to link up also the industrial forces to these agrarian efforts has yet to be seen, for no open steps have yet been taken in support of his programme.     Recent reports suggest that the Pandit, though at one time strongly opposed to the demands put forward for some time past by the right wing of Congress that a meeting of All-India Congress Committee should be called with a view to discussing the future policy, and, in particular, the abandonment of civil disobedience, is now in favour of such.a meeting, and from this, the inference may be drawn that he hopes to be able to persuade the Committee to accept
fv J uhis policy.     He appears already to have obtained support from Congress workers in his own province.He would probably also obtain support from Bihar, where there are some signs of attempts to start Agrarian agitation, and from Bengal, where discontent with Gandhi&apos;s leadership is acute, owing to his sacrificing of interests of caste Hindus by the Poona pact, and where there is close connection between Left Wing ox Congress and terrorist influence, which shows clear signs of inclining towards communism.     In other provinces, notably in Madras arrl Bombay, the Right Wing of Congress appears stronger.      In the former province, even the Left Wing are said not to favour Nehru1s economic programme, while the Right Wing have formed a party to contest elections and to embark on a programme of nation-building activities.     This party may merge in a wider Nationalist Party to form an opposition to the Justice Party, now in power.In Bombay also there appears to be a revolt against the leadership both of Mr. Gandhi and of the Pandit, as is shown by the formation of a new democratic Swaraj party, the organisers of which are said to regard civil disobedience, whether mass or individual, as out of the question.     With this diversity of opinion in Congress circles their future policy is uncertain,, but two facts should not be lost sight of;    that the Right Wing which is in favour of abandorJuexA of civil disobedience and of council entry, has no leadei with the same influence as Mr. San&apos;5&apos;&quot;&apos;! or as Pandit Jawahar Lai Nehru, and that previous expr. ience. goes to show that important Congress 1  aders are able to impose their policy or. Congress, ana that Right Wing minorities have little chance of influencing decisions.There are signs of distinct differences of opinion
between the Pandit Jawahar and Gandhi over many points,-and it is significant that the Allahabad Conference,  to which reference is made above, is said to hold that neither&apos;-.--:v&quot;V-&apos;&apos;-  .      . ^   &apos;Harijan work nor Swadeshi propaganda should be carried on in the name of Congress, which seems to indicate a definite departure from Gandhirs programme.     During the last month,    Gandhi, has. been recouping his health in seclusion at Wardha in Central Provinces, but it is reported that he will shortly start on a tour in connection with Harijan work.       That he will meet with considerable opposition is certain.There have been no further serious terrorist outrages in Bengal.       The Government of Bengal after having considered the results of investigations into circumstances connected with murder of Mr, Burge have decided on certain special measures.     These are, an increase in armed police force in town of Midnapore at the expense of the inhabitants, an increase in intelligence staff employed and application of rules which have proved successful in Chittagong to control the movements of suspects.
