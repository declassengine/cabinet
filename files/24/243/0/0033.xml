Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I circulate herewith a draft of the Unemployment Bill for amending the Unemployment&apos;Insurance Scheme and setting up an Unemployment Assistance Scheme.      The proposals are summarised in the accompanying memorandum.(Intld.)    Ho B. 3rd October,  1935.
MEMORANDUM. U N- S M 5? L 0 Y M E N T      BILL.PART I._Unemployment Insurance.1.      General,^     It is proposed in the main to continue the existing scheme of Unemployment Insurance at the level of contributions and benefit fixed by the Order in Council of 1931, but to make fresh provisions for maintaining solvency.    There are also certain amendments to be made, the chief of which are mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs.2*      Juveniles under age 18,, The proposals are briefly:-(a) A statutory obligation is to be placed, on Local Education Authorities to provide, with the assistance of an Exchequer grant, courses of instruction for unemployed juveniles, under age 18, wherever the need exists (01.  14).      Attendance at. the Centres is to be compulsory in the case of all unemployed juveniles of these ages,  (whether insured or not), unless,  in particular cases, there is good reason for non-attendance    (ci.15).Under the existing arrangements the provisions of such courses by Education Authorities is voluntary, and only juveniles drawing benefit can be required to attend.(b) Unemployment insurance contributions at a low rate (2d.) are to be paid by boys and girls below age 16 (but above the school leaving age &apos;)  if employed in an insured trade, and by their employers (Cl. 1).    Unemployment benefit is not to be paid to boys and girls under age 16, but the dependants&apos; allowance payable.to persons on benefit is to be extended so as to cover boys and girls up to age 16 attending centres or unemployed for reasons outside their control.  (C1.9).3* Duration of Benefit^ It is proposed to modify the present rule according to which while 26 weeks benefit may be drawn in a year by a person with the minimum contribution qualification, no more may be drawn by a person with a better insurance record.
The minimum of 86 weeks (expressed as 156 days)  is to be retained, but in the case of those who have been insured for five years, additional benefit will be payable according to a scale based on the contribution and benefit record over the previous five years (Cl.3).4.      Inability to obtain suitable work..     When the *genuinely seeking work&quot; rule was abolished In 1930, the condition which required a claimant to show that he was unable to obtain suitable work was greatly relaxed in other respects also and reduced practically to cases where it could be shown that a specific job had been offered and refused.    It is proposed to restore the conditions which, applied prior to 1930, apart from the &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; rule, which is not to be included (01.6).It is also proposed that in bad cases of repeated refusal of suitable employment or repeated loss of work through misconduct or voluntarily leaving work without just cause, a disqualification for benefit may be imposed up to a maximum of six months instead of the present six weeks (C1.8).5.     Anomalies,      The provisions of the Anomalies Act (which at present expire on 30th June, 1934) are to be continued as a permanent part of the Insurance Scheme (01.12).    One small amend-ment is made (C1.12 (3)) and the new Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee (see below) will take the place of the Advisory Committee set up under the Anomalies Act (Cl. 12 (4)). 6.      Determination of Claims.      Originally, claims were dealt with in the first instance by an Insurance Officer who could either allow or disallow them,  if he disallowed there was an appeal to the Court of Referees, and, in certain circumstances,  to the Umpire.      In 1930 the power of disallowing a claim was taken away from the Insurance Officer, except in trade dispute cases.    It is
now proposed to restore to the Insurance Officer the power of matters of fact rather than matters of opinion.    (01.13). There will, of course, be a right of appeal from such disallowances to Courts of Referees and in certain cases the Umpire.    The present option of the Insurance Officer to refer cases to the Court of Referees for a decision in the first instance is unaffected.7.      Instruction, Training and Occupation.,      Power is taken (Cl. 14) to establish &quot;authorised courses5 of instruction,  training or occupation which will be either    ^/(a) courses for juveniles under 18, administered by Local Education Authorities with the assistance of an Exchequer grant. In certain cases, as explained above, the provision of such centres will be obligatory on the Authorities:    in others it will be voluntary.(b) courses for persons aged 18 or over provided direct by the Minister.Attendance at ^authorised courses&quot; may be made a condition for the receipt of benefit.  (Cl.7).Apart from &quot;authorised courses&quot; the Minister is to have authority to arrange with bodies other than Local Education Authorities for the provision of similar courses, e. g. as is now done through the National Council of Social Service and the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment;    but in these cases attendance is not to be made a condition for the receipt of benefit .(Cl*14 (5)).The powers referred to above as regards providing or arranging for these courses are for the most part exercised already by the Minister but without specific statutory authority in the case of persons over 18:    the Public Accounts Committee has recommended that such authority should be obtained.disallowing claims on any of the grounds which are essentially
168   .8. Finance *     With the object of ensuring the future solvency of the Unemployment Fund on a self supporting basis, a body to be known as the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee is to be set up with the duty of keeping watch on the financial condition of the fund, reporting on its solvency and recommending any changes necessary for balancing income and expenditure .(Cl. 18) .The Minister- will have wide powers to change rates and conditions of benefits and rates of contributions if the Statutory Committee report that the Fund does not balance (or alternatively that there is a disposable surplus) and will be bound to make such changes as are necessary.(Cl.18(4)).The procedure proposed for making such changes, is by Order of the Minister to be approved, affirmatively by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. (01.18(5)).The existing debt of  135,000,000 is to be funded and paid off in 40 years..     The annual charge on the Unemployment Fund for interest (at 3-1?$) and sinking fund will, it is estimated, be something over  5,500,000 - rather moi^e than is now being paid for interest alone. (C1.19(2)) .While under the machinery of the Statutory Committee the general financial solvency of the Fund will be maintained from year to year, prevision is made for temporary borrowings from the Exchequer. It is, however, provided that any advances made for temporary purposes shall be repaid according to the nature of the advance within either six months or twelve months or two years.  (C1.19(3) to (6)).9. Agriculture.      The Statutory Committee is to be required to enquire and report within a specified period as to the nature of an unemployment insurance scheme suitable for agriculture.     The Minister will be required within a further specified period to lay a draft of a scheme before Parliament, which when confirmed by resolution of both Houses will become effective.  (01.30).
10.      Regulet tions .All regulations which the Minister proposes to make under the   Acts will he submitted to the Statutory Committee which will consider the draft and report on it to the Minister.     He will not make the regulations until he has considered the report. (Cl . 2111 r     Short-service Police Constables,   &quot;fSi.In accordance with the undertaking given in connection with the scheme for the engagement of short-service constables, provision is made for dealing with their unemployment after leaving the Police Force in the same way as with that of men discharged from the Fighting Services.      (Cl.   26). 12 .      Port Labour Registration Schemes.Statutory authority,  as recommended by the Public Accounts Committee, is to be obtained (Cl. 28)       for the part which is taken by the&quot;Ministry in the administration of Port Labour Registration Schemes,  including the arrangements at the Liverpool Docks for the centralised payment of wages. Power is taken also to assist in making payments of additional unemployment benefits or compensation for loss of employment (otherwise than at the cost of the Exchequer) as to which there are certain proposals which have been suggested, though none as yet in actual operation.
PART.....II.________U ?mpl.o^]aentm As sijstance. 17013,    Sstapllshment, of&apos;a central.Board - General.The Bill provides for the establishment of an independent Board appointed by His Majesty by warrant under the Sign Manual. (C1.1).      The Board will be provided with its own staff and will take over from Local Authorities the administrative responsibility for all outdoor relief to the able-bodied unemployed and for assistance to the industrial unemployed now in receipt of transi-tional payments (01.2),      Subject to a small contribution from Local Authorities,  the cost of the scheme will be borne by the Exchequer.  (Gl.ll).In order that the Board can make use of the long experience of voluntary workers and of individual members of Public Assistance Committees who have been engaged in the administration of public assistance, the Board will have power to set up in any area voluntary advisory committees to help the Board.      These Committees will not have power to interfere with the assessments, etc. Clol(3). 14-    Functions of the Board.The Board will have two main functions.      First,  to provide facilities for the training and reconditioning of unemployed persons with a view to re-establishing them in ordinary employment;    in carrying out these functions it will co-operate with the Ministry of Labour and other public Departments and Authorities-,,    Secondly, the administration of assistance to persons within the scope of the scheme.   (Cl.l(2))and (C1.3). 15.    Scope of the Hew Scheme*The scheme will apply to all persons between the ages of 16 and 65 whose normal occupation is within the scope of the Widows, Orphans&apos; and Old A:e Contributory Pensions scheme,  and who are capable of work and available for it.      It will also apply to persons who have not been normally engaged in any remunerative occupation since attaining the age of 16, if they might reasonably have expected that, aut for the industrial circumstances of the district in which they reside, their normal occupation would have been within the scope of
the scheme.     This will enable the Board to deal with the young men in the depressed areas who have not had a chance of regular work, persons who have lost their employment owing to a trade dispute will, however, be excluded if the circumstances are such that they would have been disqualified for insurance benefit had they been claimants for it,(C1.2).This scope excludeS some hawkers and newsvendors, persons such as shopkeepers who have worked on their own, and non-manual workers above the salary limit ( 250) of the Contributory Pensions Act0     An objective scope which can be determined by reference to ascertained facts is necessary for a satisfactory frontier between the Board and the Local Authorities a     This is the widest scope in any of the various Insurance Acts016.    Circumstances in which assistance may be ^granted.The Bill provides that assistance may be granted according to their needs to all persons within the scope of the scheme who are registered for employment and who have no work or only such part-time or intermittent work as not to enable them to earn sufficient for their needs.     The needs of any applicant will be deemed to include the needs of members of his household who normally look to him for support.    (C1.4).The&apos; Board will thus be responsible for all assistance given where an able-bodied person within the scope of the scheme is unemployed including any supplementation of insurance benefit that may be required.     Needs arising in any household requiring specific medical or surgical assistance or institutional treatment will remain the responsibility of the Local Authorities, who will also remain responsible for assistance to persons outside the scope of the scheme, including persons who are not capable of or available for work owing to sickness or any other cause.     Provision wills however, be made to keep within the scope of the Board the man who suffers odd days of sickness during s spell of unemployment.  (C1.2(2)).Detailed provisions of the Bill will make it clear that the Board will not be trespassing upon the functions of Local Authorities that may be broadly described as Public Health functions.
17.    Assessment of Need, 1 i &amp;The Board will he required to embody in Regulations the basis upon which they will assess need.   (C1.9),    The Bill provides that regard shall he had in the Regulations to the household principle - that is to say,  that all the resources of the household of which the applicant is a member are to be brought into account.  (01.4(3)).     At the same time there is an explicit direction to the Board that provision must be made to meet the reasonable personal requirements of those members of a household - e.g. a. working father or son - who contribute the resources. This is intended to secure that part of the earnings of any member of a household shall be at his own disposal, as is the practice in good public assistance administration, and that allowance may properly be made for the requirements of earning members whose occupation puts them to special expenses, eag. fw the provision of tools, etc.      The regulations must also incorporate the provisions of the Determination of Need Act,  1932, relating to the treatment of disability pensions, Workpen&apos;s Compensation and money and investments.  (01.3(3).As regards the Regulations, two alternatives are submitted for decision.      In one, the Board will make the Regulations which will be confirmed by the Minister or sent hack for re-consideration.     This procedure requires agreement between the Board and the Minister.    There is no provision for a deadlock;, for it is not necessary to contemplate such a position.The alternative gives the Minister power, after discussion with the Board, to Piter the draft Regulations;    in this procedure the Regulations are made by the Minister.By either procedure the Minister, on behalf of the Government, retains effective responsibility for the standards and general policy of the Board,  the administrative application of those standards to individual cases being a matter for the Board.   Under either procedure an affirmative Resolution by Parliament to the Regulations is required,, (C1.9).18.   Applications for assistance and determination of questions, etc.It is contemplated in the Bill that applications forassistance will normally be taken and payments of assistance madeat the Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour, where all8,
applicants will continue to register for employment.   (Cl. 4.)Need will be determined in the first instance by local officers of the Board,  after investigation of the circumstances of the applicant through the Board&apos;s local staff.      The applicant will have a right of appeal against the decision of the Board&apos;s officer to an Appeal Tribunal consisting of an independent Chairman appointed by the Minister of Labour, a member representing the Board and a member representing workpeople.      This Tribunal will have complete discretion to  deal with cases and its decision will be final (Cl,  5 and Second Schedule).In order to prevent unnecessary and frivolous appeals, the leave of the Chairman of the Appeal Tribunal must be obtained before an appeal can come before the Tribunal, and the Chairman is given directions as to  the circumstances in which he  should give leave.Power is given to officers of the Board and to the Tribunals when giving a determination,  to make provision for the attendance of the applicant at a training course.     Y/hile it would be contrary to the considered policy of the Government to allow men in receipt of this assistance from public funds to be employed by Local Authorities at wages while still drawing their assistance, a clause provides that the Board may make arrangements with Local Authorities for the training of men to be completed by giving them an opportunity of working under commercial conditions, for a limited period.     By linking up such arrangements with the training&apos;, it will be possible to introduce administrative safeguards against abuse.  (Cl, 3(b)).Provision is also made for determining questions arising as to whether an applicant is within the scope of the scheme, and for giving Local Authorities, who will remain responsible for assistance to all persons outside the scheme,  the right of hearing when these questions are being decided. 19. Cases of special difficulty.The Bill contemplates that in the generality of cases assistance will be provided by way of cash payments combined in appropriate cases with provision for training and reconditioning.     For the purpose of dealing with unsatisfactory applicants, e.g. persons
who have refused suitable employment, persons who have refused to attend a training course or.have misconducted themselves at a course -provision is made that the officers of the Board may attach conditions to the grant of assistance  subject to the applicant&apos;&apos; s unrestricted right of appeal to  the-Appeal Tribunal.      Such conditions are that the assistance may be  issued in kind or to another member of the applicant&apos;s family - e.g. the wife when the husband is of unsatisfact-ory character - or  that the applicant shall attend a special work centre or shall, by arrangement with the Local Authority, be given an order for admission to an institution.   (Cl.  6 and proviso).      It is provided that such conditions shall not be attached solely by reason of the fact that an applicant has not accepted an offer of employment which would not have been suitable employment for the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.This declaratory provision is inserted to make it clear that the Board cannot coerce applicants to accept a &quot;blackleg job&quot; under threat of having deterrent conditions attached to his assistance. The industrial organisations attach very great importance to this principle.20. Mod ifications of the Poor Law and exclusion from scheme of assistance  stance.It is provided that if an applicant has wilfully and persistently refused or neglected to take proper steps to maintain himself or his family by working, or has wilfully and persistently contravened the conditions attached to the grant of assistance,  it will be open to the Board to apply to the Appeal Tribunal to have the applicant removed from the  scope of the scheme for a specified period.      Such persons cannot be regarded as among the ordinary industrial unemployed for whom the new scheme is designed.  (Cl. 7). 21.      Local Authorities will be prohibited from giving outdoor relief to persons whose needs have been met by the Board.      The duts^ of giving relief in cases of sudden or urgent necessity will still remain upon the Relieving Officers of the Local Authorities,  subject to reimbursement by the Board in appropriate cases.  (Third Schedule)B
22. Finance.Payments of assistance and administrative costs will be met from a fund to be called &quot;The Unemployment Assistance Fund&quot;, under the control and management of the Board,The fund will be provided by (a) contributions from Local Authorities based upon an estimate of the expenditure of which they will be relieved under the Bill;    and (b) contributions provided by Parliament upon annual estimates of its requirements made by the Board,      The Exchequer contributions to the fund will be determined by the Minister of Labour with the consent of the Treasury, and the annual estimates of the Board will be presented to Parliament by the Minister of Labour,  (Cl.  10 and 11).19th October,  1955.
