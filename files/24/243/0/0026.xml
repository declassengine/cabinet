i At&quot;)LEAGUE OF NATIONS. . I ** * September 28, 1933CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2.[W 10998/40/98] No. 1.United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office. (Received September 28.) (No. 186.)THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit a record of a conversation between the Secretary of State, Signor Suvich and Baron Aloisi respecting disarmament. A copy has been sent to-His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 27, 1933.Enclosure in No. 1.Record of a Conversation between the Secretary of State, Signor Suvich and Baron Aloisi at the Hotel Beau Rivage, September 25, 1933.SIGNOB, SUVICH and Baron Aloisi came to see me this evening. Mr. Eden was also present.I asked Signor Suvich whether he was yet in a position to give any reply from the head of the Italian Government to the question which we had addressed to Baron Aloisi on Saturday as to whether the Italian Government were in agreement with us in the view that there could be no rearmament of Germany in the first period of the convention.Signor Suvich said that it was necessary to put oneself in the position of the German Government in order to appreciate the position justly. They had been promised by the agreement of last December equality within a system of security. It could be argued that since supervision was to supply the form of security asked for by the French, the equality should begin to be realised at the same period. Admittedly, during this first period of four years Germany would only be given some few token weapons. Since the armed Powers had decided that they could not begin their reductions for another four years, he thought it would be very difficult to ask Germany to wait as a consequence for the whole of that period without receiving any satisfaction of her claim.I pointed out that the security of supervision would only be real after it had proved itself in operation, and this must take time. Both Mr. Eden and I were convinced that public opinion in England would never consent to any qualitative rearmament of Germany in the first period. It would, indeed, be a sorry outcome of a Disarmament Conference if the only consequence of its first period was the rearmament of Germany. I impressed upon Signor Suvich the strength of British opinion on this subject, and begged him to do his utmost to make clear to Baron von Neurath, whom he is to see to-morrow morning, the impossibility of any modification of our attitude on this point, as to which we were in full agreement with the French Government.Since, however, it was clearly impossible to give the German Government any satisfaction as to rearmament in the first period of the convention, we might be able to facilitate agreement in some other way. I asked Signor Suvich whether he had considered the possibility of a shorter first period than four years. If that period were reduced to three years, it would be a considerable concession to (Germany, since it would bring nearer both the disarmament of the armed Powers and the enjoyment of samples by Germany. This seemed to me the utmost concession that could be made to Germany in this direction.Signor Suvich seemed to agree that this might offer to Germany some consolation, though he added the suggestion that two years should be long enough. I replied that such a period would be too short to assess fairly the value of supervision.[911 ee-2]
I then asked Signor Suvich whether the French Government had asked his view on the subject of sanctions and what that view had been.Signor Suvich said that the Italian Government had no liking for sanctions, but that, if this question were to prove the obstacle to a convention, they could perhaps modify their attitude to the extent of agreeing to sanctions if these were not of too formidable a character. In any event, they could not accept sanctions that were not also accepted by all the signatories of the convention. They could accept no sanctions confined to the continent of Europe alone.I explained to Signor Suvich that His Majesty&apos;s Government could in no circumstances agree to accept any new commitment on the continent of Europe. Our present commitments stood; we could not add to them. On this point, as on that of the rearmament of Germany in the first period of the convention, British opinion was adamant, and I hoped that we should have Italian support in our attitude.I then detailed to Signor Suvich the proposal which I had previously explained to Baron Aloisi that it might be possible, by transferring the articles now in Part I of the convention, imposing an obligation to consult in the event of a breach of the Kellogg Pact, to Part V of the convention, which dealt with the Permanent Disarmament Commission, to state that any breach of that convention would be a matter of concern to the signatories and would involve the procedure of consultation now envisaged in Part I.Signor Suvich said that he would carefully consider this proposal, which the French had also mentioned to him. They had commented favourably upon it as likely to prove acceptable to the United States.J. S.
