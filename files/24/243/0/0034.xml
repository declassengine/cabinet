Copy No.CABINET.Programme of New Construction, 1933. 2 0 7Proposed Alterations,Memorandum by the x&apos;irst Lord ox the Admiralty.In my Memorandum 01 the 31st August 1933 -CP. 13 (33) - I informed my colleagues that owing to theincreased size of 6&quot; Cruisers now projected by certain other powers, the Board of Admiralty considered it nocessary tomake an alteration in the New Construction Programme includedin the Navy Estimates for 1933,rnis jerogramme included -1 Cruiser of the LiiANDER Class of 7,250 tons. 3 Cruisers of the AlMDHUSA Class of 5*400 tons.Under the alteration proposed we should have -either (a)    3 Cruisers of a new typeor (b)   2 Cruisers of the new type and1 Cruiser of the AHETHtlSA Class.The Cabinet (5D (33) Conclusion 7) agreed:-.(a) that a decision on the questions raised in the memorandum by the iPirst Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 13  (33)) should be postponed for the moment,  but that the subject should be taken within the first two meetings of the Cabinet when it resumed regular meetings,.(b) that, in the meanwhile, the Admiralty should place themselves in oommunication with the Treasury.(c) that the Admiralty  ( ear Admiral 11.M. Bellair s ) and the foreign office  (Mr,R.L.Craigie) should, as soon as possible, make a close study of tire American action in placing orders for 10,000 ton cruisers armed with 15 6n guns, in the light of the proceedings and records of conversations of the London Naval Conference, 1930, and other relevant circumstances, with a view to representations being made by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs to the United States Secretary of State, if the circumstances justified it.As regards (o), representations were duly made tothe United States of America (vide ^.0. telegram No.388 (R)to Mr.Osborne of the 11th September, 1933) in the sensedirected....To 33(33 ).
directed and the reply to this telegram (vide Mr^Osbome1 s telegram No.510 (E) of the E3rd September 1933) mado it plain that there is no chance oi any suspension of the laying down Of the 4 U.S. Cruisers which formed the subject thereof.Copies   of these telegrams were circulated to the members of the Ministerial Committee bh the Disarmament Conference in D.C.(m)  (32) 58.As regards (bl, the Admiralty have placed thern-selves in communication with the treasury in regard to the financial effect of their proposals, which are now in a more complete shape, and the Treasury see no objection to these proposals.The now design is for a Cruiser of 8,900 tons dis-placement, and the Admiralty propose that the 1933 Programmeshall be revised so as to include *-Z Cruisers of this new type, and 1 ARBTHUSA type Cruiserinstead of1 LliAWDER type and 3 ARETHUSA type Cruisers as previously approved.The two Cruisers of the new type and one ARBTHUSA typo Cruiser will use up practically the whole of the tonnage ( 3,450 tons) available under the London Naval Treaty for the construction of 6-inoh gun Cruisers in the 1933 Programme.The estimated cost of the new type of Cruiser is 2,100,000.   Hence the financial effect of&quot; the revision isas follows:-Estimated cost of original programme  LBANDJSR type Cruiser................. 1,600,0003 ARBTHUSA type Cruisers...............4 , ZOO, 000 5,800,000Estimated total cost of revised programme :-Z new type Cruisers.................... 4,SCO,0001 ARETHUSA type Cruiser................ 1.400,000 5,600,000AG * * * a
As, moreover, the date of ordering the Cruisers of the new type will necessarily he about three months later than that at which the four Cruisers of the original programme were to have been ordered, the expenditure up to the end of 1935 will be substantially less.   The comparison is as follows:-1933	1934	1935	1936	1937	Total 	 	 	 	 	 850	1,550,000	2,600,000	1,450,000	199,150	5,800,000, &apos;m	1,300,000	a.484,000	1,550,000	 66,000	5,600,000-850	-250,000	-116,000	*100,000	-1-66,850	-200,000My colleagues will remember that one of the four Cruisers in the original programme was to replace H.M.A.S. BRISBANE but that the questions whether, when and in what form the Commonwealth Government would be able to undertake the cost of replacement were left over for further negotiation with them!As the number of Cruisers in the revised programme is reduced from 4 to 3. there is no provision in it for the replacement of the BRISBANE, which must therefore stand over until a later programme.    I have, however, already ascertained Iff&apos;    M jfrom Mr.Bruoe that the Commonwealth Government are in a state of complete indecision as to the course of future Naval expenditure.   Subject to this, I am still discussing with lir.Bruce the question of further Commonwealth Naval Construction and shall keep the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed of any developments.(Intld). B. B, M.ADMIRALTY.24th October, 1933.
