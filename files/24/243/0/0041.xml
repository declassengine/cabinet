October 1933.SECRET. . 250CP. 240 (33).CABINET.MATERIAL FOR DECIDING BRITISH POLICY IN VIEW OF GERMANY&apos;S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.THE following paper is divided into four parts : Part I is a summary of recent events in connection with the Disarmament Conference so far as such a summary is necessary to bring out the need for considering what appears in the later parts of the paper.Part II is a formulation of the questions of policy and action now immediately arising, with an indication of certain alternative courses.Part III is a note on the Treaty of Locarno and our obligations under it.Part IV contains some tentative conclusions.I.Events leading up to the Withdrawal of Germany from the DisarmamentConference.1. RECENT events in Europe have restated in a new and incisive form the fundamental problem of European politics which has confronted us at every stage since the war. The French demand for security and the German demand for equality have proved as irreconcilable in the Disarmament Conference as they had done in the years that preceded its assembly. In order to present existing difficulties in their true perspective, it is first necessary briefly to recapitulate events since the opening of the conference.2. The first year of the Disarmament Conference witnessed the production of two French plans, both of them especially the second, the Herriot plan  proposing a measure of disarmament, but making it dependent upon certain guarantees for ensuring France&apos;s security by international agreement. At the end of July 1932 the German Government withdrew from the Disarmament Conference as a protest against the resolution of the 23rd of that month which, in their judgment, failed to accord them that equality of rights which they claimed. After prolonged negotiations, on the 11th December last year, His Maj esty&apos;s Government obtained the agreement of the five Great Powers to the principle that equality of rights for Germany should be recognised in the convention to be concluded, &quot;in a system which would provide security for all nations.&quot; Though it was not explicitly stated, it was understood by all that the attainment of this equality of rights should be realised, as is implied in a disarmament convention, by way of the disarmament of the more heavily armed, and not by the rearmament of the less heavily armed Powers.3. Finally, on the basis of these principles, His Majesty&apos;s Government put forward, on the 16th March last, a draft convention setting forth in detail how these objects could be attained. Provision was made in that draft convention for extending as far as possible existing guarantees for French security and for realising by stages the attainment by Germany of equality of rights.7074   [9165] b
4. Unfortunately, just at the time when the production of the British draft convention might have created new hope for the achievement of a disarmament agreement, events in Germany began to unsettle world&quot; opinion. From the moment that Herr Hitler established himself in full control of the Reich in the month of February, fears and suspicions were stimulated by the words and deeds of the German leaders. Not only did the German Government pursue an active policy of training the whole youth of the nation under strict dicf;:piine, which in fact, if not in law, was military discipline, but the doctrine preached by the Nazi party was one which seemed to regard preparation for war as in itself a noble ideal pervading every aspect of national life. Hence, when conversations were held in June of this year in Paris, the French Government informed us for the first time that they could not accept the idea of a convention providing from the very start for the realisation of equality in material, but must insist that the convention should be divided into two periods. On the 18th September the French Government further elaborated their proposal; they made it clear that, in the first period, the only measure of actual disarmament should be the conversion of continental armies to short-term service, and the reduction of effectives as laid down in the draft convention, together with the institution of an automatic and periodic supervision of armaments. Only at the end of the first four years should the States whose arms were unrestricted by treaty begin the reductions as the outcome of. which qualitative equality would be reached by the end of a further four years, making eight in all.5. When Anglo-French conversations were continued on the 22nd September last, the French Government were informed by the British representatives that His Majesty&apos;s Government were quite prepared to see the British plan modified so as to provide for two periods. The general outcome of these conversations was communicated to Baron von Neurath on the 23rd and 29th September. It was not possible for the British representatives to tell him in detail exactly what steps in disarmament were contemplated for the second period, since the French Government had hitherto been unwilling to commit themselves in public as to these details. They have, however, done so in private to the principal delegations, including the German. The disarmament (though not the same as in the British plan) was quite substantial.6. The German Government did not at first reject the idea of a preliminary period. Indeed, in both the conversations referred to above Baron von Neurath appeared to accept it. But whether for reasons purely, as it is alleged, of national prestige, or for reasons of a more sinister nature, namely, to cover their illicit activities in constructing forbidden weapons, the Germans for some time past had been pressing for the grant to them of &quot; sample &quot; weapons of the types at present forbidden. When this principle came to be applied to a convention consisting of two periods, the discussion centred round the question of whether weapons hitherto prohibited should be allowed to Germany during the first period.7. After full consideration, the Cabinet on the 9th October &apos;&apos; felt that, apart from the strong objections that would be raised in this country, France could never grant samples. As the French well knew, the samples were required as part of the plans for mass production and the rearmament of Germany, and would facilitate evasion of the convention.&quot;8. In the meanwhile, however, on the 6th October, the German Charge d&apos;Affaires delivered a communication from his Government, which, without even mentioning &quot; samples,&quot; proceeded (1) to reject the idea of a preliminary period altogether, and (2) to demand the immediate grant to Germany of all types of weapons to be ultimately retained by other. Powers. This, therefore, frustrated the hope of reaching a solution along the lines which had been followed in the conversations.9. Then followed the final discussions and the meeting of the Bureau on the 14th October, recorded in the new White Paper.
10.   This being the actual situation, what is our course now to-be?11. Our overriding purpose is to promote peace in Europe; to improve relations between France and Germany, upon which the prospect of continued peace mainly depends;. to allay the ruffled feelings of Germany towards ourselves, and to bring her back into the circle; and to prevent, by every possible means, a new race in armaments.12. The question, therefore, that arises and demands very prompt considera-tion is-will this overriding purpose be best served by pursuing a Disarmament Convention in the absence of Germany, or not ? Alternatively, is there a middle course, which will keep disarmament negotiations going without either declaring that we mean to produce a complete Convention to throw at Germany&apos;s head, or declaring that Germany&apos;s withdrawal has brought disarmament to a standstill? To put the issue in more general terms, are we to continue to seek an agreement of all the nations of the world for the regulation of armaments, or a more modest agreement between some of them, and, if so, can we best achieve this result by pursuing a Disarmament Conference or by some other and what method?13.   Some conceivable courses must be examined in more detail.Course (1) : Continuation of the Conference in Germany&apos;s absence.14. Mr. Henderson, in adjourning the General Commission last Monday, emphasised that he was opposed to adjournment. &quot; He had hoped that the Conference would have completed its work about Christmas time. He therefore hoped that on Wednesday, October 25, the Bureau would be in a position to take a decision on the course of the work to be followed by the General Commission.&quot; Mr. Henderson clings to the view that, notwithstanding Germany&apos;s absence, the Report made to the Bureau on the 14th October (now contained in the new White Paper) should be discussed at once in the General Commission and approved, with the idea of then referring to some drafting body the work of incorporating its suggestions into the British Draft. Mr. Henderson would say that he hopes this can be done in a few weeks and a clean convention then brought up for second reading. The truth is, apart from any question of policy, that the vague language of the recent Report to the Bureau does not provide sufficient material for draftsmen to get to work. Moreover, Mr. Henderson has at the back of his mind that the next stage might introduce into what he calls &apos;&apos; the clean draft &quot; amendments in respect of matters not mentioned in the recent Report, e:g., universality of the No Recourse to Force declaration, definition of the aggressor, complete abolition of bombing, &amp;c. Mr. Henderson has, in the face of increased difficulties and manifest disagreements, persisted in the optimistic attitude that we were getting quite near to an agreement. This is best illustrated by an extract from his statement to the Bureau on Monday, the 9th October, last.Extract from a Statement by Mr. Henderson at the Meeting of the Bureau,held on Monday, October 9, 1933.&quot; It may be helpful if I divide the outstanding questions into two categories  those on which agreement appeared to be relatively easy, and those which had shown themselves not so easy of adjustment. In the first category could be placed : 1. Non-recourse to force on a universal basis. &apos;2. Definition of aggressor. 3. Control and supervision.4. Standardisation of European continental armies (a) Trained reserves.(b) Effectives. &quot;(c) Colonial forces.5. Control of budgetary publicity. 6. Bombing from the air.7. The early setting up of the Permanent Disarmament Commission. 8. Naval questions.[9165] b 2
&quot;The second list of more difficult, though less numerous, questions includes:- r1. The period of the duration of a first-stage convention. 2. Size of tanks and artillery.3. Reduction of land war material,  either by destruction orotherwise. 4. Manufacture of and trade in arms. 5. Military and naval aviation.6. Penalties against the violation of the convention.&quot; Two opinions prevail on the question of the duration of the convention.&quot; Some countries have shown a decided preference for a five-year convention, during which the destruction of the forbidden material and the equality of rights might be realised by stages.&quot; Other countries have suggested an eight-year convention divided into two periods of four years, the first of which for the sake of convenience might be called a period of experience or of adaptation. The Permanent . Disarmament Commission would be charged with the responsibility of deciding whether the machinery of control and supervision had been effective, in which case the reductions embodied in the convention would be effected during the second period in the manner described, in the convention.&quot; The Bureau are, of course, aware that my negotiations were, so to speak, a first step towards securing a larger measure of agreement likely to help us in the preparation of the second reading texts. Those conversations were, as you know, continued between various heads of delegations, and occasionally with myself, in London, Paris and Geneva.&quot; Two points have been found to be particularly difficult: 1. The system of penalties for the violation of the provisions of theconvention in order to give a greater sense of security. 2. The application of the principle of equality.&quot;15. It is really impossible to regard agreement as as good as achieved on such points as numbers of continental effectives, numbers of military aircraft allowed to various countries, the size of tanks, the Franco-Italian naval articles, the right to retaliate in chemical warfare, the-details of supervision. Items in the second list are more difficult still.- 16: If, therefore, the decision is to go on with the Convention as though nothing material had happened, by the withdrawal of Germany, the risk is very great indeed that the conclusion of an agreed Convention would not be achieved.17. Moreover, the absence of Germany will not make agreement easier. Uncertain as the prospects were in any case, the uncertainty ,is positively aggravated by her absence. For it is to be feared that some countries will hesitate to formulate publicly their full concessions for insertion in the Offer, both because Germany&apos;s repudiation of the Conference increases the anxiety of their public and their desire to keep their existing armaments intact, and because they will feel that the projected Convention, when produced as an offer, may only be the first stage in a process of bargaining.18. There is a further objection which is the gravest of all. If it is decided to go on. in Germany&apos;s absence, Germany would desire nothing better than that the effort should fail, and that such unity as now exists between other Powers should be broken up in future discussion. At present the moral case against Germany is strong. If, hereafter, Germany can point out that the efforts to frame an acceptable Convention have completely broken down, she will naturally declare that this is proof positive that other nations never meant either to disarm or to do her justice. Moreover, in the improbable event of a cut-and-dried offer being formulated and universally agreed, there is the risk that Germany would affect to regard it (1) as an ultimatum, (2) as derisory. With the best will in the world, it will be very difficult for Mr. Henderson and the Conference to produce- proposals for so much disarmament as will satisfy that public opinion which feels that Germany has been kept waiting too long.
19. To put the same point in another way, we are faced with this dilemma. In order to make the offer of a Convention, which is worth making, everybody must play his last card and insert his maximum sacrifices. But, when it is all done, and no one feels able to offer any more, Germany may be expected to reject the proposal as inadequate, and yet there will be nothing more to give.Course (2) : Treating continuance of the Conference as impossible in the absence of Germany.20. It may be useful to remind ourselves of what took place in 1932 when Germany left the Disarmament Conference.21. Following the Resolution adopted by the Disarmament Conference on the 22nd July, 1932, Germany raised the question of equality of rights and stated that unless this equality was recognised she could not co-operate further in the Conference. From the first the Foreign Office took the view that, &quot;the Disarmament Conference cannot succeed and indeed cannot make effective progress of any sort until Germany resumes her place and takes part in its deliberations&quot; (CP. 323 (32)).22. The Cabinet on the 30th September decided that the principle of equality of rights should be approved. &quot; The method to be pursued should be that such equality should be expressed in the form of a programme and subjected to regulation and agreement during the term of the Disarmament Treaty. At the end of that period there should be no distinction in status between the ex-enemyPowers and other Powers.....&quot;   At the same time, the Cabinet decided thatBritish policy should be directed towards securing the return of Germany to the Disarmament Conference, for which purpose resort should be had to the Lausanne Declaration regarding future European co-operation of the 13th July, 1932 (Cmd. 4131) (Cabinet 49 (32)).23. In pursuance of the policy approved by the Cabinet, efforts were first made to arrange a meeting in London between representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany to exchange views. The United States of America were invited to associate themselves with this process. Difficulties were at once encountered. Germany was lukewarm about the meeting until she found that France was not very keen, after wdiich she became enthusiastic. The French wanted the meeting at Geneva. It was found also that it would be much easier for Mr. Norman Davis to be present at a meeting at Geneva in so much as his mission to Europe was connected in the minds of the American people with the Disarmament Conference. The main difficulty about the meeting at Geneva was that Germany having withdrawn from the Disarmament Conference was unwilling to give any impression that she was associated with its work. Eventually, however, after Anglo-French conversations in London on the 13th October and a series of negotiations, these difficulties were surmounted by using for disarmament discussion the occasion of a visit by Baron von Neurath to Geneva to attend a special League meeting on Manchuria.24. During the above negotiations the French viewr was that it was possible to proceed with disarmament discussions, notwithstanding the absence of Germany, and Dr. Benes took the same view. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, however, held strongly to the Cabinet&apos;s-view that, unless Germany could be induced to sign the Disarmament Convention, the latter would be of no value, and eventually, on the 4th December, M. Flerriot came round to that opinion.25. The Cabinet will remember that the British view on the subject was expressed in a declaration in the same connexion as Germany&apos;s claim to equality of rights (Cmd. 4189, dated the 17th November), and that on the 11th December the text.of a declaration wasagreed to at Geneva bringing the Germans back to the Conference. , ,26. The circumstances to-day differ in some important; respects from those of the autumn of 1932 summarised above. It is, of course, more difficult to bring a nation back which has left the Conference for the second time, not less SO&apos; because the pretext on which they are leaving the Conferenceiis the same as before, namely, &quot; Gleichberechtigung.&quot;   On the present occasion it will not be. easier-[9165] b 3
than it was a year ago, for Mr. Norman Davis to attend a meeting in Lpndon, since the tendency in the United States as the result of recent events is rather to withdraw from European affairs. Moreover, after . the withdrawal of Germany from the League of Nations,, it is difficult to conceive that any German representative could attend a. meeting at Geneva, and Germany has publicly declared that she will not go back.27. If, however, we were to take up the unqualified attitude that Germany&apos;s withdrawal has put an end to the practical utility of the Disarmament Conference, we must expect very strong opposition. The response to Germany&apos;s withdrawal on the part of many of the keenest supporters of disarmament is : &quot; Very well, then, we must draw up a Convention without her.&quot; Lord Cecil, in his speech at Geneva on the day following Germany&apos;s withdrawal, while condemning the German action as being taken &apos;&apos; for reasons no one outside Germany will accept,.&apos;&apos; and justifying the view that equality in armaments could only be reached by steps, added, &quot; but the defection of one Power cannot paralyse the action of all the others. The Conference must continue. Let it draft a Treaty fair to everyone, and let it be presented to the German Government for their acceptance or rejection.   Why should this not be done? &quot;28. This view will make a very wide appeal, and is, indeed, natural and proper, if we could be reasonably sure that it could be carried through without the consequences indicated above. And any unwillingness to take this apparently simple and logical course provokes the double retort first: &apos;&apos; Then you are using Germany&apos;s withdrawal as an excuse to cover unwillingness to disarm&quot;; and second:.&apos;&quot; Then the only alternative is an immediate increase in British armaments and a new race in preparations for war, which will end in a cataclysm.&quot;29. In addition, there will be strong opposition to this course among the representatives of many foreign countries at Geneva. It would be unduly cynical to say that the vast Geneva machine has an interest in the continuance of the Disarmament Conference, but it is natural that, after all this effort and preparation, people should feel strongly that we ought to go on. Up to the present M. Daladier has declared that the French representative will be at Geneva on the 26th October (see, however, the recent Foreign Office telegram No. 211 to Lord Tyrrell of the 19th October), and we know that the French Government favour the opinion that the work of drafting a final Convention should be energetically pursued in order to confront Germany with a perfected plan. Support for a similar course is alleged to be forthcoming from Poland. Many of the smaller States will want to go on and, indeed, it seems likely that a majority in the Conference could easily be obtained for this course.Course (3) : Is it possible to find an alternative line of action between Course (1) and Course (2) ? 30.   Various suggestions may be summarised.31, (a) From several quarters, particularly in Italy, comes the suggestion that the right course is now to use the Four-Power Pact. No one has jet made this suggestion officially. The objections to such a course are that (a) the Four-Power Pact is based on adherence to the League of Nations and at least three of its articles are tied up with the Covenant which Germany has now declared her intention of disregarding; (b) we know that France, in her present mood, would be opposed to any such course; (c) till a proper basis has been found, Four-Power talks, whether under the Four-Power Pact or otherwise, may turn out to be both fruitless and dangerous. If Signor Mussolini were to propose this course, it would be necessary in the first instance to approach the French Government with the proposal.(b) Franco-German Conversations. . .,., 32..&apos; Not only Herr Hitler in, his broadcast, speech of Saturday, but Baron von Neurath in conversation with Sir Eric Phipps, expressed the desire of Germany for better relations with. France. The Germans, prof ess to be anxious for direct conversations with Paris. On the other hand, there is no; indication (but rather the contrary) that the French, at present, would welcome any such
talks, which they fear might lead to a weakening of the appearance of Anglo-French solidarity. It is a matter for consideration whether we should not impress on the French the importance of not further widening the gulf with Germany by refusing conversations if. the Germans suggest them. Herr Hitler, in private conversation with the French, might be able to offer to be more conciliatory than in any larger gathering. Are we not prepared to assure the French that, if they could see their way to accept an invitation to converse with Germany, we should assume that they would keep us informed, and would regard any effort at Franco-German reconciliation as no weakening of Anglo-French relations ?(c) Anglo-French Co-operation.33. Nothing is more likely to lead the German Government into still more reckless pronouncements than the thought that there is a split between Britain and France. Anglo-French co-operation, based on a common desire to treat Germany fairly and to abide by our obligations to her, would be a valuable complement to the Franco-German conversations indicated above. But has the time come to stipulate that the French, in return for our support, which has meant so much to them, should definitely assure us that they will be willing to make public the very considerable offer of disarmament which France privately indicated to us in Paris on the 22nd September and repeated, as we understand, privately to the Germans at Geneva? France&apos;s refusal to permit any publication of her promises in this respect is very embarrassing to us, since it prevents us from showing our own public that there really was a substantial offer of disarmament made to Germany.34. On the other hand, too great a readiness to have intimate conversations with France will certainly bring up again the French demand that we should examine the evidence of German rearmament. France may now press that this question should be brought before the Council of the League, and, if Germany shows herself persistently obstinate and intransigent, it will be difficult to object to such a course much longer.(d) Anglo-American Co-operation.35. A great deal of time and energy has been spent, not wholly unsuccess-fully, here and especially at Geneva, in keeping Mr. Davis in line with us. (See, for example, his speech in the White Paper.) But there are clear indications that we are not likely to get the United States to go further just now. In fact, the impression is that from now on she will draw back rather than increase the support she has given. If we press the United States too hard, the result may easily be to produce a more definite declaration of the attitude of isolation and the disclaiming of all responsibility for producing a disarmament settlement in Europe. Mr. Davis seems to have had instructions during the last day or two. to attribute the present impasse to political conditions in Europe with which his fellow-countrymen feel they have nothing to do.(e) Anglo-Italian Co-operation.36. This offers certain attractions, but experience shows that they are . somewhat illusory. Signor Mussolini&apos;s preoccupation throughout has been to steer a course which enables him to consult both sides in confidence. He is probably now cogitating some policy which he thinks would satisfy the Germans. This is all very useful and if it led to a concrete plan would satisfy Italy&apos;s amour-propre. But it does not give us any very secure ground on which to stand. Our policy must presumably be to keep in touch, to listen, and to show that we are ready to help. And the really good relations we have with Italy ought to make this easy. But we shall not get by this road anything very concrete. It is noteworthy that the Italian Government, in reply to a Foreign Office enquiry yesterday, have indicated that they are not very enamoured of the idea that the Conference should resume this week.Course (4) : &quot; Splendid Isolation.&quot;37. We cannot wholly criticise the Americans if they are in an isolationist mood. No doubt many people in this country, with some natural justification, are feeling that the more we keep out of these interminable European squabbles the better.   This is very tempting.   But what does it mean?   Experience shows
that when Great Britain plays no part in European affairs, European Powers are tempted to try adventures at the expense of their neighbours, and we have to come in at the end. Nothing would incite the Germans more than the idea that, perhaps with Italian support, they could confront the Erench eventually, in Great Britain&apos;s absence from Europe, with superior force. The French would have the foresight to see the danger and might take preventive action. Whichever course were followed, Great Britain would be involved in serious dangers, both military and economic. War in Europe would be a very serious thing for our trade, but more serious than that, it would leave us confronted with a triumphant Power, able to deal with us as it wished in our isolation. The development of air power has made geographical isolation a thing of the past, and the last few days&apos; explosion of German feelings shows that the doctrine of hatred of us is very quickly revived there. Moreover, unless we are now to leave the League and denounce the Treaties of Locarno, we have definite commitments towards our fellow members which we could not dishonour (see Note attached in Part III). To pursue a policy of so-called isolation is therefore not possible unless we take a number of definite (but quite impossible) steps in regard to Locarno and the League of Nations steps which will provoke alarm in Europe, and will do nothing to restrain a policy of adventure among various countries.III.Note on the Treaty of Locarno.38. In view of Germany&apos;s having given notice of her intention to withdraw from the League, the following points in connexion with the Treaty of Locarno are material: (a) The obligations of the United Kingdom under the treaty may be summarised as follows  (1) If the Council of the League finds that a violation of the undertaking not to go to war against each other, contained in Article 2, has been committed by Germany, France or Belgium, we are bound immediately to come to the assistance of the Power against whom the act complained of was directed. In that case, as we are a permanent member of the Council, our assent is necessary to any finding.(2) If the Council finds that a breach of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (relating to the demilitarisation of the Rhineland zone) has been committed, we are bound to come immediately to the assistance of France and/or Belgium.   In this case again our assent is necessary to the finding of the Council.(3) In the event of a flagrant violation of one or other of the above under-takings, we are bound immediately to come to the help of the injured party, if we are satisfied that the violation constitutes an unprovoked act of aggression, and that immediate action is necessary. In this case we are the sole judge as to whether our obligation is applicable.(4) If either France, Belgium or Germany refuses to submit a dispute to peaceful settlement or to comply with an arbitral or judicial decision, we are bound to comply with any proposals which the Council may make as to the steps to be taken.   In this case our assent is necessary to the Councils decision.(5) There is no provision in the treaty which defines precisely what, amount of action constitutes &quot; coming to the assistance&quot; of the aggrieved Power. There can, however, be no doubt that the employment of armed force in some form is meant.(b) The Treaty of Locarno contains no provision under which any of the parties can withdraw from it. It remains in force (under Article 8) until a year after the Council, acting on the request of one of the parties, has decided by at least a two-thirds majority that the League of Nations ensures sufficient protection to the parties to the treaty. There is no provision for termination by notice because insecurity has increased. -(c) It has been suggested that Germany&apos;s withdrawal from the League would have the effect of terminating the Treaty of Locarno. There is no provision to this.effect in the treaty; the only provision for its termination being
^60jW 4* &quot;IV.39. What is Germany really aiming at? Does she want a Disarmament Convention at all ? Or has her course at Geneva been determined by the resolve of her present rulers to keep things going as long as possible while she was starting to rearm ?40. These questions have a very material bearing on what is the proper course now, and there is a good deal in the course of events at Geneva to support the conclusion that the policy of the German Government, especially of late, did not permit of the framing of a Disarmament Convention which she could sign.41. Last year Herr von Neurath was content to hint that Germany would only want a few units of other weapons as a token of. her equal status. This, year there has been much talk, especially with the Italians, of samples or prototypes. The latest demand is for substantial quantities. Is this merely a case of the Sybilline Books, or does it indicate that, as time goes on, Germany must get authority for an increasing amount of armament already acquired ? Dr. Benes expressed the opinion privately at Geneva a fortnight ago that Germany could not face effective supervision if the Convention allowed her nothat referred to under (&amp;) above. On the other hand, the treaty did not come into force, under Article 10, until Germany had become a member of the League, and there can be little doubt that the treaty was concluded on the assumption that Germany would, during its continuance, be a member of the League, and that France, at any rate, considered, before the conclusion of the treaty, that Germany&apos;s membership of the League was an essential condition, and there are some provisions of the treaty which assume Germany&apos;s membership of the League and might be difficult to.operate if she were not a member.In these circumstances it might be argued that Germany&apos;s withdrawal from the League, if it ever actually occurs, would cause such an essential change in the circumstances contemplated by the framers of the Treaty of Locarno as, if not automatically to terminate the Treaty, at any rate to entitle any party to give notice that it would no longer consider it as applicable. The question whether, and if so in what circumstances, such a change of conditions justifies such action in relation to a Treaty which is in force and cannot be terminated by unilateral action, is much disputed, but even assuming such a principle to exist, it seems very doubtful whether the change of conditions resulting from Germany&apos;s withdrawal from the League would bring this case within the principle. The main provisions in Article 1, under which the maintenance of the inviolability of the Franco-German and Franco-Belgian frontiers is provided for, and in Article 2, whereby Germany and Belgium and Germany and France undertake not to go to war with each other except in certain specified circumstances, are unaffected. The provisions of Article 4, under which the Council of the League is to determine whether a casus fcederis has arisen, can be worked, even though Germany is not a member of the League. The provisions which it might be difficult to work are (i) those relating to the exceptions to the undertaking not to go to war, some of which assume that the Covenant procedure for the settlement of disputes is applied, and (ii) some of the provisions dealing with the settlement of disputes between Germany and Belgium and/or France, which involve action by the Council of the League. It does not seem, howrever, that these difficulties need be insuperable, especially in view of Article 17 of the Covenant, under which Germany, though not a member, could be invited to accept the obligations of membership of the League for the purposes of a particular dispute. The provisions in question could certainly be worked if Germany were prepared to let the League machinery operate as provided in the Treaty.(d) But there is a distinction between Germany&apos;s withdrawal and Germany&apos;s notice that she intends to withdraw. Under Article 1, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, Germany&apos;s notice to withdraw from the League does not take effect till two years after the notice is given, and then only provided that all her international obligations and all her obligations under the Covenant have then been fulfilled.
rearmament. Then why did she accept the proposal 1 Perhaps in the belief that the United States and ourselves would oppose it, and now she realises that there is a prospect that the Convention might really contain it! Our military adviser at Geneva had a conversation recently with the Hungarian representative, from which it appeared that Hungary practically admits to the possession of types of arms not permitted to her.42. All this makes it very necessary to weigh fully and carefully the real evidence as to German rearmament. Though even then, the awkward question remains unanswered how is it to be stopped?43. As for our immediate policy, the problem can be narrowed if we provisionally accept certain conclusions : (1) The policy of isolation is not practicable.(2) Our policy is still to seek by international co-operation the limitation and reduction of world armaments, as our obligation under the Covenant and as the only means to prevent a race in armaments.(3) It is dangerous to seek this by continuing the Conference in its present form without Germany.(4) It is important to maintain contact with Germany both because her assent is essential to a Convention and as the best means of securing that she does not commit herself to rearmament in isolation or to a denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles.(5) This contact must be maintained in conjunction with France, with whom we should continue to work in close collaboration while keeping Italy fully informed.(6) If the decision of the 9th October to refuse samples to Germany in a first period is rigidly maintained, it will probably prove impossible to carry out the policy laid down in (4) above.(7) If this decision is not to be maintained, we should exchange views with the French Government to discover what modification, if any, can be agreed between us as the basis of an approach to Germany.(8) If such a basis could be found, it should not be put forward as an abandonment of principle by either side or as a departure from the general lines of the British draft, but should take the form of a practical adjustment, which might provide a way out of the present impasse.J.
