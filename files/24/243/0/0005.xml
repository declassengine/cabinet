Printed for the Cabinet:&apos; A uaust 1933.23SECRET. &apos; .&apos;&apos; Copy No.     48G.P. 205 (33).CABINET.BY the Prime Ministers direction, the following memorandum on proposed Anglo-French conversations regarding disarmament is circulated for consideration by the Cabinet.August 21, 1933.PROPOSED  PARIS  CONVERSATIONS  ON  DISARMAMENT.THE annexed memorandum from Lord Tyrrell is more encouraging than that submitted by the French Government to Mr. Henderson on the 11th July last (C.P. 185^ (33)). This may be due to the fact that it appears to represent the views of M. Daladier rather than those of M. Paul-Boncour. However this may be, the attitude which it reveals is, from the French point of view, wholly reasonable, and the conclusion in paragraph 16 admirably states the present dilemma.Whatever our views as to the chances of success for the Disarmament Conference when it reassembles in the autumn, there can be no question of the vital importance, if and when the breakdown comes, of Great Britain, France, Italy and the United States finding themselves on one side of the fence and Germany upon the other. How is this to be achieved? The difficulties are considerable, because Germany is now at the Conference itself technically in a strong position. She has accepted what has been asked of her in respect of the transformation of the Reichswehr, and she has no heavy war material. In consequence, she is to this extent an onlooker.Let us now visualise the probable course of events when the Conference meets unless the position is previously improved by private conversations. Mr. Henderson will no doubt open the proceedings by announcing the measure of success which he has achieved, as the outcome of his tour, on all but the essentials of the problem. These but very minor triumphs will no doubt not lose for lack of presentation, and to certain countries (France is one of them) they have a greater significance than in our judgment their substance warrants, e.g., definition of the aggressor. When Mr. Henderson announces these &quot; successes,&quot; which nearly all the delegations will be ready to approve, it will no doubt be necessary for us at some time to explain that, while we are interested to hear what is proposed for the frills, we ourselves cannot consider them until the substance has been agreed. Now the major portion of the substance is the problem of land war material. It will then be the turn of France, who may reply that in any circumstances she cannot even discuss what she may be able to do under this head until she knows that all countries are willing to accept the amount of supervision proposed in her amendments.In any event, whatever the tactics employed, I fear that if a breakdown wer-to occur in the autumn without any previous conversations, then it is difficult to see how the blame for this could be placed on Germany, and there is a distinct danger that the breakdown might be due to Anglo-French differences over such subjects as supervision, definition of the aggressor, &amp;c. Further, it must be understood that although, if the Conference were to break down, Germany would still be legally tied by the Treaty of Versailles; she would, in fact, claim to rearm, basing&quot; the demand upon article 8 of the Covenant. Moreover, if the Conference had not apparently broken down through any fault of Germany, she6999   [8944]
could pretend to some moral justification&apos; in extenuation of her claim. In any event, she would rearm, and could in all probability only be stopped by drastic measures, such as economic sanctions. . Can we really hope that following a breakdown of the Conference in such conditions these measures would be agreed to by Italy and the United States? And without their help they can be of no avail. &apos; ...-H. symdy-, b&apos;iidx\qz-j i-A   ,yAll of which emphasises the capital importance of the Conference breaking down, if it must break down, on the refusal by Germany of that &apos;&apos; fair offer &apos;&apos; to which Lord Tyrrell refers in the last paragraph of his memorandum. .The most that we can hope for is that what now appears to be M. Daladier&apos;s view will prevail; that during the Paris conversations the French Government may be able to make an offer which can be regarded as fair and is likely to commend itself as such to the Italian and United States Governments no less than to ourselves. The hopes of such a happening may be slight, but I can see none other.A. E.Foreign Office, A ugust 17, 1933.ANNEX.Memokandum on French Disarmament Policy.1. The French Governments position as regards disarmament may be defined as follows : (i) A genuine desire to disarm prompted by (a) real anxiety for a peaceful Europe based on League of Nations principles this is especially the case with the present Left majority in Parliament returned at the 1932 elections, and (6) financial exigencies the Government, are finding increasing difficulty in finding further sources of economy, (ii) Inherent fear and mistrust of Germany resulting from (a) the latter&apos;s numerical superiority over France (this is an obsession which is at the back of every French mind, even of Socialists), and (b) the apparent German preference for autocratic methods of Government (this point again applies especially to the present Radical and Socialist majority). The jDOst-war democratic system in Germany, for instance, was over-thrown at the very moment when the Stresemann policy had delivered the goods.2. These are the two factors of both of which French disarmament policy must take account.3. Accordingly, the French Government have put forward a series of disarmament plans with the object of organising security so that the weaker nations will not be in danger from sudden onslaught by the greater. The system requires that all nations will recognise their interest in the maintenance of peace and bind themselves to join immediately and automatically by all means in the defence of an attacked nation. Such a scheme, if adopted, it is claimed, would be almost absolutely deterrent or, . failing that, would make it practically impossible for an aggressor State to win a war!4. To make the scheme successful, however, it is necessary in French opinion for its provisions to be as tight as possible so as (a) to afford a potential aggressor State no doubts as to the immediate consequences of aggression, and (b) to give the members as a whole the necessary confidence to enable them to reduce their armaments.5. If a sufficiently close and defined system of security, as above, can be agreed, France is fully prepared to come down to the German level of equipment. She is, however, very suspicious of loopholes in the system. The reason why the Locarno treaty has not been more successful in inducing French disarmament is because its terms as regards British intervention are not sufficiently precise and because whilst France does not doubt that Great Britain would ultimately come to her aid, she fears that there would be several weeks during which she Would
be left alone: to defend her soil.. A France disarmed to the German level of equipment would be overwhelmed by the more numerous Germans.6. France has how accepted the British disarmament plan as a basis and is prepared to accept it altogether subject to certain amendments. r\7. As explained above, France is obsessed with the fear of being over-whelmed by a sudden German onslaught before the League machinery comes into operation. She therefore, has hitherto insisted on a definition of the aggressor in the most precise and circumstantial terms possible being embodied in any disarmament plan. This, it is thought, would have the double effect of speeding up the machinery of intervention against an aggressor and making the prospects of successful aggression the more remote, thus increasing both the deterrent and the practical effect of the plan. Although she still attaches importance to this and welcomes the action of the Soviets and the smaller European States in agreeing to adopt the Politis formula, she now realises that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept this for themselves. France is quite prepared that this acceptance of the definition should be confined to the continental States.8. But what is now far more important in French opinion is supervision. The fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept definition of the aggressor, has thrown France back on supervision as the only other means of forestalling the sudden German onslaught which is so much feared. Supervision, moreover, has a distinct advantage over definition of the aggressor. With modern weapons, it is contended, Germany might, without any previous warning, suddenly lay Paris in ruins before the world had woken up. In such a case even the operation of the precise machinery of definition would be too late. But if supervision could be established, it would not be possible for Germany to collect the material necessary for such a coup de main. Therefore France has put all her hopes on supervision.9. Such supervision, to be effective in French eyes, must be automatic and permanent, and not intermittent and ad hoc. The French also believe that permanent supervision, to which they and the other nations would be subject no less than the Germans, would be much less odious in operation than the ad hoc method. France would probably not mind Great Britain herself not being subject to strict supervision, and if His Majesty&apos;s Government find it impossible to agree, they would no doubt accept some formula by which the special position of Great Britain was recognised, and provision made only for some looser supervision. But it is absolutely essential, from the French point of view, that Germany should accept the permanent and automatic form of supervision.10. Further, and this is directly the result of the Hitler regime in Germany, France insists on a probationary period, while the system of supervision is tried out. This period, it is suggested, should be divided into two stages of three to four years each, during which Germany would be allowed to convert the Beichswehr into a conscript army of the same strength and length of service as France, and she would have to suppress para-military instruction, and continue to observe the treaty limitations on material. At the same time, during the first stage of the period, France and the other States not limited by treaty would undertake to build no artillery or tanks over a certain limit to be fixed, to lay up under League of Nations control the most powerful material, and only to undertake annual replacement of authorised material under international control. During this first stage of three to four years there would therefore be a standstill so far as the non-limited countries were concerned, whilst Germany would, by converting the Reichswehr, be taking the first steps towards practical equality. During the second stage of three to four years, France and the other unlimited States would proceed to actual and substantial reductions.11. At the close of the probationary period, the duration of which is open to discussion, and provided, the supervision has proved efficient and the conduct of Germany has been correct, France is ready to place at the disposal of the League of Nations (for destruction, if thought fit) the remaining equipment which she possesses over the convention limits. At this point, therefore, she would come down to the German level. . M. Daladier has said that he is prepared to commit himself now to what France will do then, provided the supervision is -satisfactory.
12. The question whether the probationary period is to be divided into two-stages as proposed in the memorandum handed to Mr. Henderson, and the exact reductions to be made at the end of the first stage are&quot; matters of comparative-detail, and are open to discussion. Whether, however, there is only one stage or two, the French Government will be unable to agree to any reductions of material during the first two years or three years. The French Government--will,-also, probably seek to insist on definite provision being made for a further disarmament conference at the expiry of the period of the first convention. They would certainly prefer the length of the first Convention to be eight years rather than five.13. It cannot be over-emphasised that supervision and the probationary period are both equally and absolutely essential for French public opinion. With Hitler in power.in Germany no French Government could carry an immediate reduction of equipment. It must be remembered that France has already reduced her military service since the war from three years to one year, and that numerically her forces are now inferior to Germany&apos;s. Superiority of equipment is the Only advantage left to France. It would be useless to press M. Daladier to make reductions now; the most he can do is to agree not to increase or replace existing equipment which is eventually to be debarred by the Convention. But he will agree to say now what he will do when the probationary period is over.14. As regards the figures for tanks, military aircraft and the question of bombing from the air, it may be said in general that France will raise no objection to what His Majesty&apos;s Government desire, provided it does not react on German claims. France has her eyes on Germany alone. She is very strongly opposed to any form of rearmament by Germany, and she would feel obliged to resist any British proposals which seemed to open the door for Germany.15. As regards methods, the French Government welcome the proposed Anglo-French conversations in September. They are quite ready to open similar-conversations with Signor Mussolini through the new French Ambassador.16. In conclusion it may be said that M. Daladier, a Radical without the-least tinge of militarism, whose outlook is extremely calm and reasonable, is much disturbed at events in Germany. His country requires him either to produce a stormproof disarmament convention or to take steps to maintain French superiority in arms. For French opinion there is no via media between these two courses. M. Daladier is fully alive to the fundamental community of interest of France and Great Britain in the maintenance of peace. He appreciates the enormous importance attaching to making Germany a fair offer now, which, if accepted, would start a new era, and which, if refused, would place British and American opinion on the French side. But he is bound by the whole force of French parliamentary and public opinion to guard against the danger of France (having been disarmed to the German level) being exposed to a sudden staggering blow. Hence the basic importance to the French of automatic permanent super-vision and a probationary period. If these are accepted and proved, the French Government will be able to face public opinion and proceed to reduction to the German level.British Embassy,Paris, August 12, 1933.o
