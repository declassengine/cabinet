j] C R E T. ,?.  859 (33).COPY NO,CABINCOMMITTEE ON IMPERIAL - ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION.REPORTonEmpire Marketing Board Poster Frames and Marketing Committee.1.        On September 5th last (Cabinet 50 (33) Conclusion 8 (b)) we were requested &quot;by the Cabinet to consider and report upon the question whether the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s poster frames should continue to be maintained, and, in that case, how they should be controlled, financed and managed. 3.       We have also been requested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider the question of the four Trade Sub-Committees attached to the Empire Marketing Board to which reference was made in (c) of the above named Cabinet Conclusion.Poster Frames.3.        The facts with regard to these frames are fully set out in the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.  211 (33))  already circulated to the Cabinet.      The frames number 1668 of which 1483 are in England and Wales, 155 in Scotland and 30 in Northern Ireland.4.        Since the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s user ceased, at the end of August last, the frames have, with Cabinet authority (Cabinet 50 (33) Conclusion 8 (a)), been used ad interim for the pixrposes of other Government Departments.    During September they
(*) Of JLwere at the disposal of the Minister of Health for the display, at the charge of his Department, of posters concerned with housing and slum clearance policy.     During the present month they are &quot;being used by the postmaster General for publicity purposes, at the charge of Post Office funds.      During November they will similarly be at the disposal of the Minister of Labour. No arrangements have been made for the use of the frames after November 30th.5.        It is necessary to bear in mind, that the Empire Marketing Board were able to secure the various sites on which the frames stand on very favourable rental and other conditions, and that it is very prohable that the owners of the sites will insist on much more onerous terms if the frames are used for quite different purposes to those orgininally contemplated.      Some complaints and criticisms to this effect have already been received. 6.       We are informed by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that whatever decision may be reached in regard to the frames in Great Britain those situated in Northern Ireland should he discontinued at the end of the present month, 7.       As regards the frames situated in Great Britain we are advised that no useful purpose would be served by their continuance after November next unless arrangements could be made for a continuous programme,  of at least 18 months duration, dealing with some subject or connected group of subjects.      A succession of miscellaneous disconnected topics could not possibly make the same appeal as the Empire Marketing Board posters have made in the past, and would be likely to excite considerable criticism.
8.        We do not think that it would in fact be possible to plan in advance any long-term programme of the kind we have indicated.     At most the frames could be used by the State for short periods in the year, by Departments such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health, and for purposes such as the advertising of the British Industries Fair.9.        It has been suggested that these poster frames constitute an important capital asset, the value of which will be entirely lost if they are now discontinued. We think, however, that it would be false economy to continue to spend money on maintaining the frames if they cannot be put to some use which can be fully justified.      Moreover the effect on the Estimates Committee of continuing remanets of the Empire Marketing Board must not be overlooked.      If it were decided to continue the poster frames and also the Trade Sub-Committees referred to below, the effect would be that instead of securing a saving there would be an actual increase in the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s estimates next year of from  4,000 to  30,000.10.        For these reasons we have reached the conclusion that the permanent maintenance of the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s poster frames in Great Britain cannot he justified) and we recommend the Cabinet to authorise their discontinuance as from the end of November next.
The Four Trade Sup-0ommittees.2.1.        The second question which we have examined is concerned with the Marketing Branch of the Empire Marketing Board, viz. the Marketing Committee, together with the Food Products Committee, the Retail Grocers&apos; Advisory Sub-Committee, the Retail Fruiterers&apos; Advisory Sub-Committee and the Retail Bakers and Confectioners&apos; Advisory Sub-Committee.     Continuance of their work would imply the retention of the staff of the Branch, including the Marketing Officers.    The total cost of the service has been estimated at from  9,000 to  12,000 a year. 12. The work in question falls mainly under two heads :-(a) advising the Empire Producer on the suitability of his products for the home market:(b) inducing retailers, hotels, local authorities, railways, etc., at home to place orders for Empire products.13.        Hitherto the marketing activities of the MarketingCommittee and its four Trade Sub-Committees have been concernedwith Home. Dominion and Colonial produce, in the proportions ofapproximately 46%,44% and 10% resrectiv,ely.it will be rememberedthat the representatives of the Dominions on the SkeltonCommittee made it clear that they were not prepared to contri-bute towards the continuance of these services, so far as theDominions were concerned, and they were accordingly omitted fromthe services, the continuance of which was recommended in theCommittee&apos;s Report.     This Report has been accepted by theGovernments of all the Dominions, and accordingly no question arises of further Dominion interest in the Trade Sub-Committeesand in the marketing work, if these are continued.14.        We are satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by inviting the Dominion Governments to reconsider their decision, nor do we think that it would be practicable toarrange for the Marketing Branch to push Dominion produce on thehome market acting on an agency basis on behalf of individualDominion producers.
15.       As regards the Marketing Branch&apos;s activities in respect of home produce, we are advised by the Minister. -of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland that the various branches of the agricultural industry ought to deal with the marketing problem for them-selves, through the new Agricultural Marketing Boards which should bear the cost.    To maintain the Marketing Committee and its sub-Committees would lead to duplication and over-lapping with the functions of the Marketing Boards. Moreover, we see grave objection to the Government constituencies-uting itself the selling organisation for home products in the home market e16. The Secretary of State for the Colonies hasrepresented to us the great value of the services rendered by the Marketing Branch in extending the sales of colonial produce on the home market;    if it was decided to continue the services, he would try to get some contributions from the Colonial Governments, but these would not anything like cover the cost.17. We think that the Marketing Branch is too largean entity to be continued for the very limited purpose of pushing sales at home of colonial produce.      The Secretary of State for the Colonies has accepted this view, but he asks that a decision to bring it to an end should be subject to the continuance of the existing work at the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Prince&apos;s Risborough, and the retention of the minimum cadre of officers necessary to continue the introduction of Empire timber to the home market.
18. We submit the following recommendations to theCabinet on the two questions discussed in this Report :-Poster Frames.(a) that the use of the Empire Marketing Board&apos;s poster frames in Northern Ireland be discontinued after October 31st, 1933, and those in Great Britain after November 30th, 1933.Marketring Branch and Sub-Committees.(b) that&apos; the work of the Marketing Branch of the Empire Marketing Board, including that of the four Trade Sub-Committees, be determined forthwith; this decision to be without prejudice to the continuance of the work now carried, on at the Forest Products Research Laboratory at Prince&apos;s Risboroughi including the retention of the minimum cadre of officers necessary to continue the introduction of Empire timber to the home market,Signed on behalf of the Committee.NEVILLE CHAMBERLAINCHAIRMAN.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 24th  October, 1933.
