The number wholly unemployed, including casuals, increased &quot;by 15,505, while the number temporarily stopped decreased by 89,915,     Changes &quot;between 31st August and 25th  September in the numbers on the registero of the different Divisions of Great Britain were&apos;:-London - 780South Eastern * 5,038South Western * 3,278Midlands - 33,316North Eastern - 30,163North Western - 14 &quot;,125Scotland * 1,465Wales - 5,807The estimated number of Insured persons in employment at 25th September was 9,943,000o      This was 86,000 more than a month &quot;before and 792,000 more than a year before, or about 660,000 more than a year &quot;before when allowance Is made for the persons then directly Involved in the trade dispute in the cotton trade.     ^hese figures are subject to revision/.The improvement was most marked in coalmining, iron and steel and tinplate manufacture,  engineering, vehicle &quot;building, metal goods manufacture,  the pottery,  textile and leather industries, &quot;boot and shoe, furniture,  cocoa and chocolate manufacture, and in the dress industries except tailoring.-1-/
On the other hand there was a decline from seasonal causes in building, public works contracting, hotel and boarding house   service, in the tailoring and distributive trades, and in certain of the food manufacturing industries aud transport services.Overseas Trade.     Imports in September, 1933, wore 358 millions, compared with  54 millions in September, 1932, Exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  38 millions, compared with  26 millions, while exports of imported merchandise amounted to  3.4 millions, compared with  2.9 millions.     The excess of imports over exports of merchandise was  22 millions, compared with  25 millions. Transhipments under bond remained unchanged at  2 millions.Road and Rail Traffic.     During the five weeks ended 1st October, 1953, rail traffic receipts were  723,000 more than in the corresponding period of 1932.     Passenger traffic increased by 4084/6, merchandise, minerals and live stock by 8.26$, and coal, coke and patent fuel by 0.71JS.New registrations of motor vehicles, excluding motorcycles, in August, 1933 were 2,963 (2503$) more than in August, 1932.     The increase comprised 1,650 private cars, and 1,313 commercial and other vehicles.     Registrations of motorcycles decreased by 595 (l7,6vo)oCoal.     The average weekly output for the 13 weeks ending 23rd September was 3,671, WO tons, which was 2.4^ higher than in the corresponding period in 1932.The average number of persons employed for the week ending 23rd ueptembor was 755,0&apos;&apos;*0, and the average for the 13 weeks ending 23rd September was 755,600 as compared with 781,600 for the corresponding period in 1932.     The weekly output per person was 4086 tons, which was .28 tons higher
than In the corresponding period in 1932.Coal exports for September amounted to 5,418,000 tons and were 594 , 0&apos;X) tons more than in September, 1932.     The amount of bunker coal at 1,100,000 tons was slightly greater. Exports to b we den, Norway, Denmark, France and Germany show quite substantial increases as compared with September, 1932, as also do those to Italy and the Irish Free litate.In Scotland business is more promising than a month ago,,     In the North East Coast also the position is promising, especially in Northumberland,     faouth Wales shows a slight improvement, principally for dry coals and washed small coals,  and shipments to Canada have been on a higher scale.     In the inland districts there is a small improvement on the industrial demand, but the house coal trade remains abnormally low.Iron, and ttteej.     The Improvement of the last few months has been maintained during September.     The production of pig iron in September was 359,700 tons compared with 860,400 tone in the previous September.     The oxitput of steel ingots and castings was 669,Ot;o tons compared with 430,300 tons.In Scotland the black sheet makers Yfero well provided with orders, but In other sections activity remained low. On the North East coast business was better in most sections owing to improved home demand.     Orders for constructional steel provided more work for the steel industry.     In South Wales the demand for sheet and tin plate bars remained good and prices were advanced by 5/-d. per ton.    The outlook in Sheffield was more encouraging than for some time past.    The demand for foundry pig iron, hot and cold rolled strips, stainless and othor special steels increased.Ohi-p-ping and uhipbui&amp;Mfig.     The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction at the end of ocptember was 303,762, an increase of 16,260 tons on the previous quarter, and of 65,329 tons on the September quarter of 1932.     New tonnage started during the September quarter amounted to
39f670 tons;   this was larger than in any Quarter, with one exception, in 1931 and 1932.The index number of freight rates (1913 s 100) for September was 70.73 compared with 81.45 a year ago.     This is the lowest figure yet reached.Machine tools.   Exports during September were  88,000 compared with  193,000 in the previous year;   exports to the Soviet Union were  42,000 oompared with  135,000.      Imports of machine tools were  69,000 oompared with  54,000 in the previous year.Electrical Industry.     The output of electricity amounted to 1,023 million units, as compared with 922 million units in September 1932.     In the first nine months of the year there was an increase of 8.2%.A further all-round improvement in most branches of manufacture of electrical apparatus has occurred so that the existing productive capacity in use is probably now over 55%. The oxport market continues to improve, but there has been a slight falling off in the home market except as regards the lighter branches of the industry which continue to improve.Motor Industry.    Business in the home market was quiet, pending the results of tho Olympia Show.     Several British makers exhibited at tho Paris Salon, but found business practically impossible owing to the 70% tariff.     In Spain, Switzerland, Poland and Persia sales of British oars have become very difficult   on aocount of increased duties, quotas, and other restrictions.Building Industry.     The September unemployment figures showed an improvement of 1,2% on August and 7.8^ on September, 1932.     The improvement is taking place both in
speculative building and in work for local authorities. Prices of raw materials are steady and the demand for bricks remains good.Cotton. -   Conditions showed little change in September compared with previous months and, apart from some increased activity in the American Spinning Section, there has been little indication of higher production.   Deliveries of raw cotton to spinners increased from 22.8 million pounds in August to 23.6 million pounds in September.    In the Egyptian Section of the industry, production declined in September to 88 per cent, of capacity, compared with 86 per cent, in August. Prices of yarn and cloth have fallen as a result of the drop in raw cotton prices which followed the increase in the United States Government estimate of this season&apos;s crop.    The export trade in cotton yarn has shown a slight recovery during the last two months, and exports of cotton piece goods increased in September to 163 million square yards compared with 149 million in August and 155 million in July.    ?3XDorts to India have recovered a little, but most of the improvement in September was due to a seasonal increase in shipments to West Africa, Canada and New Zealand.    Japanese competition is still the industry&apos;s most serious problem.Chemicals. **   Sales of alkali during September were better than in the previous year.   Home deliveries of chlorine products were better owing to demand from the rayon industry. Deliveries of sulphuric acid and industrial nitrogen products were satisfactory.    The dyestuff industry showed an improvement on the previous month.   The fertiliser market remained quiet,  and the demand for pharmaceutical products was small.Other Industries. -   Soap consumption was maintained during September at a rather higher, level than in 193?..    The
improved consumption of margarine noted in August was continueu.    The home demand for motor and cycle tyres continued to toe good and United Kingdom manufacturers still obtained a fair share of export markets.    Large quantities or&quot; rubber footwear from Singapore have been contracted for. Competition from this source and from Hong  Xong has created uncertainty in the market.    Production of boots and shoes for the second quarter of 1933 showed an increase of 23.45* over the previous year.    Exports of Portland cement have declined owing to competition from Denmark, Italy, Japan and the U.S.A., and the home demand remains low owing to lack of public works.Retail Trade. -   The value of retail sales in Great Britain in August was 0.2% greater than in August 1932.    This is the first increase, compared with the previous year, since January 1931.    Sales of food and perishable goods were 2yo less, and of non-food articles 2.9,j greater, the principal increases being in men&apos;s and boy1 s wear, hardware and furniture.    Stocks were 3.6% les3 than a year ago. Total sales increased by 2.3$ in the West End of London, 1.4?o in suburban London, and 0.8% in Southern England, but decreased by 1.1;-j in Scotland and the North of England. In all areas there was an increase in non-food sales, and a decrease in food and perishables.Departmental Store sales showed an improvement of 1.1%.Finance and Banking. -   (a) London.    The outstanding event of the month wan the issue of the 2-gfo Conversion Loan on 28th September.    Other notable issues w-.-re the New Zealand and Australian Government Loans which were largely over-sub scribed.    On the other hand two Corporation issues -Sheffield and Harrogate - were less well received.
Discount rates increased sharply towards the end of the month, the average rate on 29th September rising to 12s./4.61d. per cent.Foreign Exchanges have shown great activity and violent fluctuations.,   The dollar developed great weakness after the middle of the month owing to the growing difficulties of the Recovery Plan and renewed agitation in favour of inflation, so that the dollar fell to 4.865- at one stage.    The pound followed the dollar&apos;s course, and on 3rd October the exchange in relation to the franc fell to the record low level of 78^ francs to the pound.    There is evidence that this fall has been overdone, and that the usual seasonal weakness of sterling will soon disappear. Accompanying the fall in the exchange rates of the pound and the dollar was an increase in the price of gold which on 20th September reached the very high price of 133/9d. per fine ounce.C13) Prance.    Notwithstanding fears of the Government&apos;s ability to balance the forthcoming budget and the uncertainty of the whole question of public finances, the market in Rentes improved during September.    The improvement is probably due partly to a purchase of Rentes by foreigners whose capital is seeking shelter in Prance.    The internal situation causes some alarm, the tax returns showing that the yield is well below the budget estimates.    The course of foreign trade continues adverse, and it is suggested that if either Great Britain or the U.8.A. decided to stabilise their currencies there might be a drift to the pound and the dollar and a flight from the franc whose sole claim to security is its stability in terms of gold.(0) Germany.    The financial markets were more hopeful during September partly owing to (l) the alteration in the
Law governing the Reichsbank authorising it to carry out open-market operations, and (2) the Communal Debts Conversion Law of 21st September.     Under the latter the Communal Debt Conversion Association was formed whereby towns and communes in financial difficulties may convert indebtedness falling due up to 31st March, 1935.     Berlin is the first city to join this Association and holders of 6% Treasury Bonds are offered &amp;% Bonds of the Communal Deht Conversion Association. It is estimated that when the towns and communes have taken advantage of tho scheme the saving may ultimately be something like RM. 80,000,000 per annum.New regulations have been introduced governing the uses to which blocked marks may he put.     Foreign holders of &quot;registered marks&quot; or &quot;credit mark&quot; balances must transfer them to the Konversionskasse who will either issue scrip against them or creato a credit balance in its books. Exporters will thon he able to acquire such scrip or credit balances towards the settlement of &quot;additional exports&quot;.(&amp;) U*S*A*     The course of the dollar exchange reflected the change of opinion, probably foreign more than American, from the fear of currency inflation to the expectation of stabilisation.     The immediate cause of the suddon weakening of the dollar referred to under (a) was the demand for inflation by the primary producers of the South and West, and the slowness of the revival of the heavy industries.     A statement made by the Secretary for Agriculture later in the month corrected this tendency and led to an improvement.     The position of tho President in regard to stabilisation is difficult as on the one hand the effect of the announcement of a plan for stabilising the dollar might be to cause a fall in commodity and
security prices which might have serious far-reaching &amp;g.qconsequences.     On the other hand, the absence of any assurance as to future stability makes it difficult to obtain the co-operation of the banks or a revival in the new issue market.     The latter is essential to prosperity in the capital goods Industrie s.The recent fall in the&quot;value of the dollar on the foreign exchanges hf^s not been accompanied by the boom conditions in commodity and security markets which have &quot;been the complement of all previous falls in the dollar rate.South African Tr?de.    Indications point to a continuance of the improvement in business noted during the pnst few months.     Rain fell over wide areas during August, though in many parts the drought still continues.     Produce prices, however, continued tc strengthen, and this should be of material assist?Jice to the farming community.     Mining activity continues.     Exports for the month of August totalled  5,489,000 against  5,139,000 for August last year.     Gold and specie at the standard price accounted for just under  4 million of the former figure, but if the average price computed by the Chamber of Mines is taken, gold exports represented a value of just over 455,800,000 which would raise the value of the total exports to     ,319,000.     For the first 8 months of the current year exports totalled S46,808,000 against ^45,540,000 for the corresponding period of last year.     The former figure, however, does not include the gold premium and if this is taken into account the total would be increased by  13,376,000.Imports for August amounted to  4,334,000 against  2,688,000 for August of last year.     For the first 8 months the figures were  30,125,000 against ^21,594,00c for the corresponding period of the previous year.Exchequer receipts for the month of August showed a material improvement over those for August, 1932.     Railway .
revenue also continues well in Advance of the earnings for the corresponding periods of last ye^r.At the first wool sales of the season prices realised are estimated at from 100% to 120?&apos;- above those obtained in the opening sales of last season when the Union&apos;s currency was still linked to gold.Canadian Trade.    The recovery in business operations characteristic of the second quarter of 1935 was continued in August, the index of the physical volume of business being 89.8 compared with 84.1 in July.     Wholesale prices were higher, except in the case of crop products and non-ferrous metals.     The total yield of grain crops was estimated to be much below the average of recent years owing to the dry summe r.Australian Trade.     Exports for August 1933 amounted to  5,691,000, an increase of  1,877,000 on the previous year, while imports were 26,084,000 a decrease of  696,000 (Australian currency).     Exports of flour, eggs and canned fruit increased, and wool prices rose from  11. 4. 8d. per bale in July to  16. 6. 7d. in August.The Sydney bank clearings for the first 9 months of 1933 were  647 million compared with  484 in 1932.     Customs revenue for the September quarter increased by  8.5 million.Indian Trade.      Imports of merchandise in August 1933 were 988 lakhs of rupees,  compared with 1,113 lakhs in August 1932.     Exports were 1,434 lakhs, compared with 1,025 lakhs.     The favourable balance of trade was 892 lakhs, compared with 354 lakhs.     The wholesale price index for August was 89, compared with 89 and 91 in June and July.South American Trade.       The recent agreement with the Argentine has put United Kingdom traders in a better position by lowering tariffs and improving the sterling payment facilities.     The political situation remains steady-lnrX.
and.crops are expected to be normal.     In Uruguay the Government is providing current exchange demands for imports and is meeting the limited promises to the Eritish-owned railways.     Continuation of this attitude depends on United Kingdom purchases of meat, wool, etc.The quarrel between Bolivia and Paraguay is draining the latter of its resources, and cattle owners are gradually losing their flocks by requisition for the troops.     Chile is exporting nitrates despite the lack of demand, but there is very little exchange available for importers, and none for other creditors.     Brazilian coffee exports have recently increased, but the favourable trade balance is diminishing and exchange is very scarce.     It is suggested that the exchange control may be abandoned and the milreis may be allowed to find its own level.     Colombian finances have been completely disorganised by the cost of armaments in the dispute with Peru.
