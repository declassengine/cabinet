Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   42CP. 220 (33).CABINET. 9 9Circulated for Information, by Direction of the Prime Minister.PARIS CONVERSATIONS ON DISARMAMENT.DURING luncheon at the Quai oVOrsay yesterday I had the opportunity of a conversation with M. Daladier. He told me that he had recently been on a tour of the French eastern frontier for the express purpose of reassuring the local population. Their anxieties were very real. The German attitude had resulted in a series of petty provocations, and he had been anxious lest one of these should have caused reactions culminating in a graver incident. He was confident that his visit had calmed apprehensions on the French side of the frontier.None the less, M. Daladier emphasised that French public opinion was inevitably gravely perturbed. There were in truth three courses open to France, any one of which might enable her to meet the new situation which the attitude of the present German Government was creating. The first was a preventive war. This he ruled out, since no democratic country could indulge in one. The second was to say, as a great body of French public opinion desired him to say, that in the light of recent events in Germany it was impossible for France to continue to offer co-operation in the work of the Disarmament Conference, and that she would now go ahead with the construction of armaments in the determination to maintain the lead in material which she now enjoyed. M. Daladier fully appreciated that to adopt such a course would be to condemn Europe to a race in armaments, and he was himself extremely reluctant to do so. It had, however, to be appreciated that the temper of France to-day was similar to that of 1913, which was a temper of exasperation. It was neither revenge nor Alsace-Lorraine that moved the French people in 1914, but a determination to put an end to the period of provocation they had suffered.For his part, he much preferred the third course, which was to- seek in conjunction with Great Britain, and, if possible, also with Italy, to arrive at some common accord which might save the Disarmament Conference, though he had himself little doubt of Germany&apos;s determination to rearm.Foreign Office, September 19, 1933.A. E.Record of Conversations at the Quai d&apos;Orsay beginning at 11 a.m. onSeptember 18, 1933.Present:M. Paul-Boncour. Mr. Eden.M. Massigli. Lord Tyrrell.M. Jean Paul-Boncour. Mr. Cadogan.M. Daladier (in the afternoon). Mr. Harvey.Mr. Hankey.M. PAUL-BONCOUR opened the conversation by observing that the present situation was grave. It was clear that Germany was actually in process of rearming, and this fact made it extremely difficult to discuss calmly the question, of disarmament.7034   [9040] z
LORD TYRRELL agreed that the situation might be grave, but he drew from that fact&apos;the inference that the first necessity was for the French and British Governments to&apos;agree on the manner of facing the situation.Mr. EDEN observed that he had understood from the conversation of the 7th June that the French Government wished to institute a stricter system of supervision and wished to have a trial period during which the efficacity of that system could be tested. Subject to that, they had expressed their readiness to indicate what was the utmost that they could do in the matter of disarmament. He enquired whether the French Government were in a position to give us this information. -M. PAUL-BONCOUR said that since June much had happened and it was essential for France to know the extent of German rearmament. The French Government did not intend to go back on what they had said in June, but it must be recognised that the situation had changed since that date, and that it was no longer possible for the German Government to reiterate that they had already disarmed..M. MASSIGLI interjected that if at Geneva the German delegate were once more to take this line, it would be impossible for the French delegate not to make a protest.Mr. EDEN, referring to M. Massigli&apos;s remark about Geneva, observed that it was very important to consider what would be the position when the Conference resumed in Geneva. The Germans there would be technically in a good position and it was therefore important to know the view of the French Government as to procedure and for him to be able to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government..M. PAUL-BQNCOUR said that nothing in the attitude of the French Government was changed. What was required was not only an agreement between France and the United Kingdom, and possibly Italy and the United States, but an agreement that Germany could be induced to accept. In the event that Germany should maintain that it was unfair to her, it would be necessary to justify the French proposal for a trial period.Mr. EDEN agreed that if the French Government were to make definite proposals and if the German Government were again to complain that they had disarmed fully and were only waiting for the other Governments to fulfil their promises of disarmament, the French Government would then have stronger justification for referring to the reports of German rearmament.Mr. Eden explained that he was unable to say anything on behalf of his Government with regard to the French proposals for supervision; all he was authorised to do was to ask the French Government how far they proposed to go in the matter of disarmament. He was unable to say whether the United Kingdom Government could accept the French amendments regarding supervision, but he would like to be able to report what specified measures of reduction of armaments the French would propose and in regard to this he would like to have the fullest possible details.M, PAUL-BONCOUR replied that on the 7th June certain facts and figures had been mentioned and that an aide-memoire had been given recently to Mr. Henderson indicating what the French Government would be ready to do. As these facts and figures related for the most part to land war material, he would like to leave, detailed discussion until the afternoon, when M. Daladier would be present.He then referred to the recent Italian proposals, and called upon M. Massigli to read out the reply which the French Government had sent thereto. (See CP. No. 221 (33).) ,.fiM. PAUL-BONCOUR observed that&apos; it was not quite clear what Signor Mussolini meant by &quot; defensive weapons &quot;; he understood that he was probably thinking of the weapons now allowed to Germany under the Treaty of Versailles, plus, perhaps, light tanks. &apos;   &apos;     -;   : :  :    ;       &apos; &apos;        *
. ! W-   ;. 3After hearing the French reply, Mr. EDEN suggested that, the meeting might adjourn for half an hour so that the British representatives might examine more at their leisure the text of the French reply, copies of which had been supplied to them.Oh the resumption of the discussion, Mr. EDEN observed that the Italian proposals had created a new situation, which might perhaps have favourable developments.M. PAUL-BONCOUR agreed that the situation was changed in that these Italian proposals indicated an approximation of views between the Italian and French Governments. He hoped that this might be regarded as one of the first fruits of the Four-Power Pact. He hoped that the discussions with the Italian Government would continue; he would know more of the prospects to-morrow, when a reply was expected from the Italian Government.Mr. EDEN said that he Was sure that his Government would welcome the continuance of these Franco-Italian discussions. His immediate task was to report to His Majesty&apos;s Government the details of the French Governments attitude, and he assumed that this report should take the following form. The French Government would wish to see their proposals for supervision accepted as well as their proposal for a trial period of, say, four years. There would, in the first instance, be no arraignment of Germany on the score of re-armament; that should be held in reserve as a retort to Germany if and when she were to protest that the proposals for disarmament were unfair to her. In making this report to His Majesty&apos;s Government he would like to be able to indicate that, given the above conditions, the French Government would undertake measures of disarmament as nearly as possible on the lines of the British draft convention.Mr. EDEN thought that it was understood by the French Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have great difficulty in regard to their proposals for supervision, and this was why they desired the fullest information concerning French intentions before they took a decision in the matter.; M. PAUL-BONCOUR asked whether, in the opinion of the United Kingdom Government, the measures of reduction which France would ultimately be ready to undertake should actually be indicated in the convention.Mr. EDEN said that it seemed desirable that a fair offer should be made to Germany, and, in order that the world might judge that the offer was a fair one, it would be necessary to incorporate it in the convention itself. He wished to make it clear that in the present state of Europe His Majesty&apos;s Government had no desire to press immediate reductions on the French Government.M. PAUL-BONCOUR said that, if there were any chance of the United Kingdom Government accepting the French principle of supervision, it would be very desirable to endeavour to find an agreed text before the matter came up at the Conference. That would be much better than that there should be a French text.to which the United Kingdom Government would move amendments.There was an important point which he desired to raise, namely, had the United Kingdom Government considered what would be the situation if the investigations made by the Permanent Disarmament Commission should reveal that Germany had, in fact, rearmed to a greater or lesser extent? Our reply would probably be that in that event the signatories would regain their liberty of action. But he wished to suggest that that in itself was not sufficient. If, while: France was reducing her margin of superiority, Germany were to rearm in violation of her undertakings, that would produce a very serious situation, and he would like to know what would be the attitude of the other signatory Govern-ments and what they would be prepared to do,Mr. EDEN said that he was quite unable to answer this question, but that he would submit it to. his Government.The meeting then adjourned at 1 o&apos;clock and was resumed in the afternoon, when M. Daladier also attended.In reply to a question, M. DALADIER said that the French Government (if their other conditions were fulfilled) would be prepared to dispose of all guns, exceeding 155 mm. in calibre.   Or rather, as he explained, the French Govern-[9040] b 2
ment would put such material at the disposal of the League; this would mean that the French Government were quite prepared to see the League order its destruction, but they preferred this method as it would be almost impossible, in view of French public opinion, for the French Government itself to destroy the material. On the other hand, he gave the above undertaking on the understanding that if investigation by the Permanent Disarmament Commission showed that Germany was really rearming it would be necessary to reconsider the position.His information showed that when the Germans declared that they were disarmed they were not speaking the truth, and his intention had been to make this clear at the resumption of the deliberations of the Conference. As had been suggested, however, he might be ready to defer such action until the Germans protested that the proposals of the other Governments were unfair, on the score that Germany alone had disarmed whilst the other Governments had not carried out their obligations.Mr. EDEN said that he presumed he would be right in reporting to his Government that the French Government desired an agreement between the French, United Kingdom and, if possible, Italian and United States Governments before the Conference met on the 16th October; that, in the French view, such an agreement would visualise a trial period of, say four years, and that it should include a contingent agreement on measures of disarmament to be taken after the trial period; that such an agreement should be presented in the form of an offer to the German Government; if the latter were to protest against the inadequacy of the offer, the French Government would then propose to raise the question of German rearmament.M. DALADIER again enquired what would be the situation if the Permanent Disarmament Commission were to establish, during the first or second period, that Germany had violated her obligations.LORD TYRRELL suggested that in that event the other Governments would be free from their obligation to reduce their armaments.M. DALADIER said that something more would be required, and he would like to know the degree of support on which he could in that event rely. He observed that certain of the German preparations, of which he had information, affected the Rhineland, and to that extent affected the Treaty of Locarno. He could quite understand that public opinion in England might hold that Germany could not be held for ever to the terms of a Treaty of Peace, which had been imposed upon her, but he thought that English public opinion would be prepared to agree that if Germany violated a convention freely entered into by her there would be an occasion for definite action. It was being said in France that the present German activities were a violation of the Treaty of Locarno, but that nothing was being done about these violations, and how could France therefore be assured that any more serious notice would be taken of eventual German violations of the Disarmament Convention itself ?Mr. EDEN said that he would report M. Daladier&apos;s remarks to his Govern-ment, and would emphasise that what the French Government sought was some formula wherewith M. Daladier might be able to reassure French opinion in regard to the attitude of the United Kingdom in the conditions which he had outlined.M. DALADIER, reverting to the details of the reductions which the French Government would be prepared to undertake, observed that it would be difficult for them to accept the actual stages prescribed in the British draft convention, but he agreed that, for instance as regards guns, the disappearance of all guns of more than 155 mm. would be complete by the end of the second period.As regards tanks, M. Daladier observed that he was aware that the figure -of 16 tons inserted in the British draft convention was one that suited the British Army. On the other hand, the French had been unable to make a success of any Tnodel of that size and had found the most effective types to be those of about 70 tons and 30 tons. The French Government would find it difficult to accept any figure lower than 30 tons. He explained that the fortifications on the French frontier were not continuous, but that there were various gaps in them and it was because the manning of these gaps would be extremely difficult with the reduced numbers
of the French Army, that it had been decided to construct these tanks of 30 tons which carried each four machine-guns as well as a gun of 75 mm. capable of firing thirty rounds a minute. Such a weapon represented in the matter of weight of fire a considerable body of troops. ;M. MASSIGLI reminded M. Daladier that in June it had been suggested that there might be a limit of global tonnage of tanks, and M. Daladier agreed that this might offer a solution.   /    &apos; r;;  .As regards aircraft, Mv. Massigli observed that the same figure was allotted by the British draft convention to France, with her Colonies, to Italy, with her Colonies, and to the United Kingdom, without her Dominions. The fixation of this figure, moreover, involved a very much larger percentage of reduction by France than by Italy or the United Kingdom. The whole plan was rather too rigid, and it would be difficult for France to accept. It was for that reason that the French Government had proposed in June last an alhround reduction of 50 per cent, by the Principal Air Powers. - -      i: /Mr. EDEN pointed out that an all-round reduction of 50 per cent, would be unduly hard on the United Kingdom, which had already made much larger reductions than the other Principal Air Powers. British public opinion felt very strongly about the question of air defence, and, he thought, rightly.M. DALADIER said that he appreciated this and that it should be possible to provide that special cases such as ours be given special consideration, or, again, that it might be possible to say that the 50 per cent, reduction should be operated not on present figures, but on the figures existing at some earlier date.As regards effectives, M. Daladier said that the reduction in the period of service of all conscript armies would have to be effected during the first period simultaneously with the transformation of the German Reichswehr. He drew attention further to the fact that during the trial period all the signatories would be bound by the undertaking not to construct any new material of the forbidden categories.
