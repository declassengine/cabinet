STAMP, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, July 26, 1933.
EIGHTH REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, July 1933.IN our seventh report (Council paper E.A.C. (S.C.) 7) we discussed at length the position resulting from the departure of the United States from the gold standard, and sketched out a monetary policy which we suggested should be pursued at the World Economic Conference. Subsequent developments have ruled out for some time to come any possibility of an arrangement for the stabilization of exchanges, while the abortive attempts to secure an arrangement upon this question have served to precipitate a further heavy fall of the dollar. We are now faced with a situation in which a high degree of uncertainty attaches to the probable course of the foreign exchanges over the next few months. In the meantime, the American policy of internal expansion has undergone noteworthy developments. An examination of the drift of tendency in the United States is indeed a necessary preliminary to an examination of the economic situation as a whole.The American situation.2.   In our seventh report, we wrote &quot; There is accordingly, in our judgment, considerable force in the view that the world stands to gain from any development which is calculated to bring about a large improvement in the United States, even though its direct effects may be prejudicial to the interests of other countries. But the proviso that the improvement in the United States must be a large one is crucial to the argument.&quot;We added that it was as yet impossible to gauge the probable extent of the American recovery. The evidence that has accumulated in the ensuing two months makes it clear that the recovery has so far been rapid and substantial. The Federal Reserve Board index of production shows a rise from the low level of 60 in March to 67 in April and 76 in May, a very remarkable rate of increase, and other index figures suggest that the improvement has continued subsequently at an equally rapid rate. The improvement appears to be fairly general among all the industries engaged in the manufacture of consumable goods and industrial materials, though it is most marked in automobiles, steel and textiles.3. The question at once arises as to whether this industrial recovery can be regarded as soundly based and likely to continue, or whether it must be distrusted as an ephemeral product of an essentially speculative movement. This is not a question to which it is easy to give a confident or clear-cut answer, since it is not easy, in the light of the information so far available, to estimate the relative importance of the various factors which have contributed to recovery. The following considerations are, however, relevant to the problem.4. Production had been reduced to so low an ebb in the United States as to provide a natural basis for a considerable recovery as soon as some degree of confidence in the future outlook was restored. In the case of many manufactured and semi-manufactured goods, it seems probable that current production had been reduced materially below consumption, the demand being met by a running-down of stocks to abnormally low levels. (In this respect the position as regards industrial goods differs radically from that of many primary products, large stocks of which still overhang the market.) The increase which has now come about in industrial activity represents in considerable measure a &quot; re-stocking &quot; movement on the part of traders and manufacturers. This is a normal feature of the beginnings of recovery from a severe depression. Some improvement of the same kind is apparent in Great Britain at the present time; but there is, of course, much less scope in this country for this particular element of recovery, since British business men had not previously depleted their stocks in anything like the same degree.5. In so far as the increase in industrial activity in the United States is of this character, the fact that the initial impulse was supplied by an expectation that prices were likely to rise is not a valid reason for distrusting its soundness
and durability. It is true that the expectation of high prices has been associated with a big bull speculative movement in the stock markets and commodity markets, and this movement is liable to undergo reactions such as that which has recently occurred, which may possibly prove severe. It seems highly improbable, however, that such speculative reactions, though they will doubtless exercise an adverse industrial influence, will serve in themselves to set industrial activity back very seriously. However severe the speculative reaction, it is virtually certain, if only because of the heavy depreciation of the dollar, that prices will not revert to the low level of a few months ago. Accordingly, business men, who in the meantime have built up their stocks of materials to a normal level, are not likely to have serious reason to regret their decision or to reverse their policy. In the meantime, the increased industrial activity is already setting in motion forces tending to make the recovery cumulative, which are analogous to the vicious circles engendered by depression. The volume of retail sales is increasing, if much more slowly as yet than industrial production, and is likely to continue to increase as the aggregate purchasing power of the public is augmented by the increased employment. This growth of retail purchases supplies a solid basis for the re-stocking movement. The railway companies, which have suffered heavy losses during the depression, are beginning to earn revenues which show a margin of profit: and it seems not unlikely that they will be induced in these circum-stances to begin to overtake the large arrears of work which have accumulated in the repair of their permanent way and perhaps the replacement of their rolling-stock. The extreme severity of the depression in the United States allows a large scope for recuperative influences of this character. In so far as the present industrial recovery is attributable to a re-stocking movement of the type indicated, it can, we think, be regarded as a normal opening to business recovery which entails no presumption of a subsequent reaction.6. We think it virtually certain, as we have already indicated, that the dollar prices of primary products, whatever speculative reactions they may undergo, will remain substantially above the low levels of the early part of the year. This recovery of prices is likely to improve the economic situation in a great variety of ways that may be relied upon as lasting. The impoverishment of the farming community has contributed more than anything else to the extreme severity of the depression in the United States, and to the atmosphere of general insecurity by which it has been accompanied. In the first place, the farmers represent a large proportion of the consuming population, and they have been forced to curtail their purchases in a very large degree. In the second place, they are a heavily-indebted class, and their inability to meet their financial obligations has lain at the root of the widespread insolvency of banks and other financial institutions. Similarly, an improvement in the incomes of the farming community will both directly increase the demand for industrial products, and contribute greatly to the restoration of financial confidence, and to the release accordingly into active use of funds which have been hoarded during the phase of financial crisis. It must, of course, be remembered that if the rise in the prices of farm products is associated with a reduction of their supply, whether as the result of bad harvests or of restriction schemes, the incomes of the farmers will not be increased proportionately to the rise in price and may conceivably be diminished. This qualification may prove important in the case of some commodities, particularly wheat. If, for example, the wheat harvest in the United States were to prove only half as large in 1933 as in 1932, and the dollar price of wheat were to be twice as high, the incomes of the farmers and their consequent power to purchase industrial products would be unchanged. On the whole, however, the farmers are likely to gain substantially from the rise in prices which has taken place : and this change has still to exert the greater part of its influence, since we are only approaching the season in which the bulk of farm products is sold. Except, therefore, in the highly improbable event of a fall in the dollar prices of primary products to the level of the early months of the present year, there is a vital factor on the side of recovery, namely, the improvement of the position of the farmers, which is likely to exert an increasing influence in the months that lie ahead.7. So far as our analysis has gone, the prospects seem good that the American business recovery will be sustained, despite the likelihood of setbacks in the speculative markets.   This, however, is not the whole story of the recovery
up to date. In certain industries, at any rate, there is an element the &quot;durability of which is far more open to question. In the case of the textile industry, for example, there are grounds for believing that an important influence has been exerted by the fear of the imposition of the &apos;&apos; processing&apos;&apos; tax contemplated in connection with the scheme for the restriction of cotton acreage. This possibility, coupled with the likelihood that labour costs will be increased by the operation of the codes fixed under the Industrial Recovery Act, gives an obvious incentive to textile manufacturers to increase their production in the meantime before the processing tax or the higher wages have become operative. While the possibility of a processing tax is limited to a narrow range of industries, that of higher labour costs enforceable under the Industrial Recovery Act is of general applica-tion. It is possible, therefore, that an important part of the present increase of industrial activity in the United States may represent a mere concentration into a brief period when labour costs are still low of production that would normally be spread over a much longer period.8. That part of the present recovery which is attributable to this cause is clearly precarious in the extreme. For, when costs have been raised by as much as manufacturers expect them to be raised, not merely is the additional rate of production which has been stimulated in this manner likely to disappear, but production is likely to fall for a time to a lower level than would have been main-, tained if the stimulus had never been applied. If the volume of employment were on this account to undergo a serious decline, it would be unlikely that the increased purchasing-power arising from the higher wages paid to those employed would afford an adequate compensation. Thus when the codes under the Industrial Recovery Act which are now in process of being filed have been finally settled, the American industrial recovery will be exposed to its first really critical test.9. Apart from the codes for particular industries, and in view of the possibility that considerable delays may occur before many of them are settled, the President has issued a so-called &apos;&apos; blanket&quot; code, to which individual employers are being invited to adhere. This blanket code enforces a maximum working week of 40 hours in the case of &quot; white-collar &quot; workers and 35 hours in the case of &quot;overall&quot; workers, and provides minimum wage rates for the two groups of workers. Differents are fixed for towns of different sizes. The minimum wage rates do not appear to be high. The code, however, provides that weekly wage rates shall not be reduced by an amount sufficient to offset the reduction in the working week, and this provision will naturally involve an increase in costs of production. It is not easy as yet to estimate the quantitative importance of this increase, nor is it clear what effect the code will have upon the earnings of those paid under piece rates. The code will take effect from the 1st August and will remain in effect till the 1st September, by which date it is hoped that each individual industry will have prepared its own code. All employers who adhere to the blanket code must undertake not to increase their selling prices above the level obtaining on the 1st July by an amount greater than is required to offset the actual increase in their costs under the act.10. It is important in this connection to examine the implications of the Presidents policy with regard to wages. In order that the industrial machine may again be in a position to work with full vigour it is essential that the prices at which manufacturers sell should be increased by so much more than the costs of the elements making up the manufacturers&apos; expenditure that there may be a reasonable expectation of profit from production. But the level of prices indicated by this consideration is, in view of the great reductions that have taken place in costs in the last few years, not high enough to insure a level of money income which would be in proportion to the existing body of fixed long-term indebtedness incurred both by federal, state and local government agencies and by industrialists themselves. If, however, a further rise in prices were to be encouraged, sufficient to achieve equilibrium in this direction, then it might be feared that profits would be, unduly high and wages unduly low. This would not only be in itself undesirable, hut might, in view of the possibility that such profits would not necessarily be spent, prove a real obstacle to recoveiy. The President is consequently forced as a necessary part of his policy to secure some rise in costs concurrently with a rise in prices. The. co-ordination of these two movements will be a matter of considerable difficulty, and there will always be a danger of the one outstripping the other.
11. The effect of the exchange depreciation of the dollar on the international competitive position, though this is not a matter in which American opinion is at present much interested, is, none the less, an important underlying factor in the situation. American export industries may be expected to gain from this cause a relative advantage at the expense of Great Britain and other industrial competitors, similar in character to that which Great Britain gained from the fall of the pound, though the importance of this advantage is diminished by the addition of restrictions which have been imposed in the meantime on international trade and by the decline in its volume. It is true that this advantage would disappear if American costs of production were to be increased by the Industrial Recovery Act codes or in other ways in proportion to the fall Of the dollar. But the codes which are at present being filed give no grounds for expecting so large an increase as this in American costs. Exports do not, however, play so important a part in American as in British industrial activity.12. Another uncertain factor is the extent of the influence which is likely to be exerted in the United States by the schemes of public works which it is the policy of the administration to set on foot. This is a factor upon which, in our judgment, the possibility of sustaining the recovery next year will largely depend. We have already indicated that the solidity of the recovery is likely to be tested shortly, when the Industrial Recovery Act codes have been finally determined, and the incentive to produce in anticipation of higher labour costs may accordingly be removed. But, while an industrial setback is then possible, particularly if this period coincides with a sharp speculative reaction in the commodity markets and the stock markets, we are on the whole optimistic that the forces of recovery will retain the upper hand for some time to come. Later on, however, much will depend on whether the improvement in the manufacture of goods for consumption, which has already taken place, generates a demand for the products of the engineering and constructional trades, which at the moment show little sign of improvement, or whether, failing this, the programme of public works to be undertaken by the federal government is in operation on a sufficient scale, by the time that the demand for goods for re-stocking purposes begins to expend itself.The effect on the outside world.13. The developments in the United States affect the interests of other countries in two opposite ways. On the one hand, the quickening of activity in the United States communicates a stimulating impulse to economic activity throughout the world. On the other hand, the depreciation of the dollar contributes a new element of disturbance and uncertainty to the conditions of international trade. Erom the world standpoint, and from that of Great Britain, the vital question is which of these influences is likely to prove more important than the other. As we argued in our seventh report, the immensely important part which the United States plays in the economic life of the world lends a corresponding potential importance to the first of these influences. A substantial and sustained recovery of American economic life would be followed by increased importation of materials from all quarters of the globe on a scale which would materially improve the condition of the countries producing them. They, in their turn, would become more ready purchasers of the manufactured products of industrial countries. Apart from these tangible effects the restoration of an atmosphere of confidence and hopefulness in the United States contributes materially, as, indeed, we have seen in recent weeks, to the restoration of a similar atmosphere in other countries.14. On the other side of the account, many countries, especially those which are at present on a gold basis, see in the depreciation of the dollar a menace to the competitive position of their exporting industries, a menace to their trade balance, and a menace to their ultimate monetary stability. There is accordingly already discernible in those countries a disposition to intensify their tariffs or other restrictions upon imports. There is, moreover, the possibility that, if the depreciation of the dollar should&apos;be followed by bear raids upon other currencies, the countries affected will tighten up money rates and generally recoil from any policies of expansion that could be regarded as endangering their monetary stability.   Apart from these considerations, the mere fact that it is harder than
ever to say with confidence at what level the principal exchange-rates of the world will rule in a few months&apos; time, constitutes an impediment to international trade whenever long contracts are necessary.15. If the recovery in the United States proceeds without any serious interruption, the former and beneficial influences are likely to outweigh the latter and prejudicial ones. But if the Amercian recovery should shortly undergo a severe setback, the resultant effects are likely to be of the opposite character. We have probably already enjoyed almost to the full such benefits as could be expected from the communication of mere optimism and confidence from the United States. If we are to enjoy any further and less precarious advantage it will be because, as a result of the increased demand for raw materials, such as rubber and tin, in America, the position of a number of our important customers will be substantially improved. This advantage may, indeed, be offset by the injury which we are in time likely to suffer from the impaired competitive position of some of our exporting industries. Up to the present there has been no tendency for sterling prices to fall owing to the depreciation of the dollar, nor is there likely to be so long as recovery proceeds in the United States at its present momentum. If, however, an American setback were to occur, with an important reaction in dollar prices, the sterling prices of many primary products might be carried below the level of a few months ago. In such circumstances the disadvantages to which we and other countries are exposed from a depreciated dollar would be likely to outweigh whatever benefits would remain from the fact that American industrial activity was still at a higher level than in March. It is therefore of the first importance to this country that the present policy of the United States should bear substantial fruit. While it is conceivable that a steady recovery might continue here, despite a setback in the United States, the outlook for Great Britain will be greatly improved, if the American situation develops favourably.The position in Great Britain.16. In recent months encouraging signs of an industrial improvement in Great Britain have accumulated. The unemployment figures have fallen steadily throughout the present year, and they have continued to fall after the end of the period of normal seasonal improvement. The extent of the recovery in the volume of employment can be appreciated from the following figures : Table 1.Employment in Great Britain of insured persons between the ages of 16 and 64 (excluding persons directly involved in trade disputes).Month.Estimated numbers of insured persons employed.Reduction below six-year average (1924-25 and 1927-30) of corresponding month.1932.1933.1932.1933.January . .

17. This improvement in employment is the more encouraging in that it cannot be attributed to one or two particular industries, but is spread over a large range of occupations, and applies both to industries producing consumers&apos; goods,, such as woollen and worsted, and to constructional industries, such as engineering.. It is noteworthy, however, that the building industry has been an important contributor to the improvement. The figures for unemployment among males in the building industry in January and May for the last five years are as follows : Table 2.Unemployment among males in building and public works contracting in January and June 1929 to 1933.

In this connection it is of interest to observe that it is reported that in some districts building operations are being delayed by a shortage of bricks, and that brick makers, who are almost all working at full capacity, are finding it necessary to ration supplies. That a temporary shortage-of supplies of materials should have made its appearance even in a single instance; is a noteworthy phenomenon in the history of the depression.- ... *18. The improvement in industrial activity, while it affects a large range-of industries, represents essentially an improvement in the home market, including the manufacture of goods previously imported. Though some industries have experienced an improved overseas demand, the aggregate value of our export trade has continued-to decline, as is shown in table 4. The volume of exports does not appear J;o have undergone any considerable decline; but there-has certainly been no increase.
Table 4.Value of United Kingdom imports and exports. First six months of the years 1931-33.(In   million.)-	Imports.	Exports. (United Kingdom goods.)	Exports, (imported merchandise.)

On the other hand, there is a much more encouraging outlook in the woollen and worsted industry.19. The general improvement that has taken place in the present year in Great Britain began before the recovery in the United States, though the repercussions of the American developments have probably up to the present been on balance beneficial. The improvement in building activity clearly reflects in part the gradual operation of the decline in the long-term rate of interest, while there has undoubtedly been a change in the attitude of the public towards expenditure, as the result partly of appeals for wise spending and partly of the recovery of confidence. In the light of the evidence that has since accumulated, it seems probable that, before the complications introduced by the new turn of American policy, the conditions were established in Great Britain for a gradual but steady expansion of domestic economic activity, without any very good prospect of a corresponding improvement in overseas trade.20. It is now possible to entertain some hope that the American recovery may be sufficiently sustained to exercise a stimulating influence on world trade as a, whole. It is, however, not unlikely that the difficulties of our export trades will be further increased as the result of the depreciation of the dollar and the reactions of that depreciation on the economic policies of other countries. It is, therefore, the more vital that the improvement which has begun in our domestic trade should be sustained.21. We are therefore thrown back on the question of how public policy *an best help to promote the improvement in our domestic trade. It is important, on the one hand, to preserve the conditions which have made possible the improvement that has already begun, among which conditions are the restoration of confidence and the maintenance of low long-term interest-rates by means of cheap and abundant credit. We desire in this connection to emphasise particularly one point. It is not unlikely that we may be about to enter on a period of serious instability in the foreign exchanges, accompanied by large movements of foreign balances in and out of Great Britain. If, as is possible at any time, sterling were to be subjected to a considerable strain, there might be a disposition to have recourse to the instrument which it has been customary to employ in the past in times of exchange weakness, namely, a higher bank rate and a restriction of the supply of credit. In the conditions which now obtain, such a policy would be entirely inappropriate and profoundly unfortunate in its effects. The conduct of exchange policy will obviously be a task of great difficulty in the uncertain conditions which lie ahead. But in so far as any action may be called for, the Exchange Equalisation Fund is the appropriate instrument to use; and bank rate and the supply of credit should be determined solely by the requirements of the internal trade situation.22. Subject to these conditions, the state can, in our opinion, assist the recovery of domestic trade by encouraging, in every way open to it, a steady expansion of capital expenditure upon useful projects. In this connection, the question of housing seems to us especially deserving of full consideration. In recent months there has been, as we have pointed out, a welcome expansion of
general building activity, and the possibility of sustaining the general trade improvement depends, we believe, in large measure upon the continuance of that expansion. It must be borne in mind, however, that the decline in the work upon the housing schemes of local authorities which must ensue from the abolition of the Wheatley subsidy has not yet begun to operate. The possibility must also be borne in mind that that part of the increased building activity which is commercial or industrial in character may represent an overtaking of arrears of work postponed since 1931 and may prove short-lived. Similarly, a check to the demand for middle-class houses might occur at any time. In the event of a check to building activity along its present lines, it would be of the first importance from the standpoint of the general trade position to throw in the compensating influence of an increased production of working-class houses. We recognise that it is at present - the policy of the government to leave the ordinary supply of working-class houses so far as possible to private enterprise, and to concentrate both State assistance and the energies of the local authorities on slum clearance. We suggest, however, that this policy should properly be regarded as experimental, and that steps should be taken to ascertain at once how far private enterprise is showing signs of meeting the demand for the smaller types of working-class houses to let, which was previously met by the housing schemes of local authorities. If it should emerge that the building trade is not likely to meet this demand on any considerable scale, it would be desirable, we suggest, to prepare a new plan under which the services of the local authorities could again be enlisted, on a new basis, to supply this need. We attach as an appendix a memorandum by Sir Ernest Simon, in which the housing problem is examined in more detail.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, July 26, 1933.
APPENDIX.Memorandum on the housing position by Sir Ernest Simon.SINCE the war we have built two, million houses. 1,100,000 of these have been built with State assistance, 650,000 by local authorities. Private enterprise has built 1,350,000 houses, of which 450,000 have received subsidy assistance. All these houses are of a small type, having a rateable value not exceeding  78 (or  105 in the metropolitan area). How far has this large building programme succeeded in meeting the post-war shortage ?2. There is no satisfactory basis for estimating housing requirements except on the assumption that each family requires a separate dwelling. The census gives us both the number of private families &quot; and the number of structually separate dwellings,&apos;&apos; and the difference between the two affords an indication of the extent of the housing shortage. The statistics for 1921 and 1931 are as follows : (Figures in thousands.)	Families.	Separate dwellings.	Deficiency of dwellings.1921   .. 1931   ..	8,739 10,233	8,029 9,403	710 8303. From these figures it would appear at first sight as though the deficiency of dwellings had increased between 1921 and 1931 by 120,000, despite the large housing programmes that were undertaken in this period. Such an inference would, however, be misleading, for reasons which are pointed out in the annual report of the Ministry of Health for 1932-33. For a family is defined for census purposes as &quot; any person or group of persons . . . . in separate occupation of any premises or part of premises,&quot; and the number of census families was accordingly artificially depressed in 1921 by the extreme housing shortage which then prevailed. As to the extent to which the figures of families may be distorted by this factor, the Ministry of Health in their annual report make the following observations : &quot; In the ordinary course, i.e., when no serious housing shortage exists, the number of &apos; census families &apos; varies generally with the increase in the combined number of the widowed and of married couples. Over the fifty years 1861 to 1911 the correspondence of the two figures was very close and only the housing shortage which existed in 1921 accounts for the fact that this correspondence did not continue. Had it continued the increase of census families in England and Wales in the years 1911-21 would have been approximately 1,189,000, but in fact an increase of no more than 796,000 was recorded in 1921. Had the correspondence continued over the following decennium the further increase by 1931 would have been approximately 1,101,000. In fact an increase of approximately 1,494,000 was recorded. During 1921-31 1,616,000 new houses were erected.&quot; Since the census date of 1931, approximately 396,403 further houses have been provided.&quot;Thus it is probable that substantial headway has in fact been made during the post-war period in diminishing the severity of the housing shortage.4. It will be appreciated, however, that the significance of the observations of the Ministry of Health is that the above figures probably seriously understate the extent of the deficiency of dwellings which existed in 1921, not that they overstate the deficiency which existed in 1931. We may, therefore, take the figure of 830,000 as a reasonable measure of the deficiency which required to be overtaken in 1931.
5. In order to frame an estimate of prospective housing needs, we need to know not only the existing shortage, but the probable rate of increase in the mumber of families. Up to the present the heavy fall in the birth-rate which has occurred in the past generation has had little or no influence upon the growth in the number of families, since the number of additional families formed by persons marrying in any year is affected by the number of births, not in the year in question, but a generation before. The number of births per annum (as distinct from the birth-rate) increased steadily until the early years of the present century, and did not decline markedly until shortly before the war. Thus a generation ago, the number of births was at its maximum. It is not surprising, therefore, that the number of families should be increasing just now at about its maximum rate; and in this fact we have the main explanation of the persistence of the housing shortage despite the post-war housing efforts. For some years to come, moreover, the number of families must be expected to continue to grow at a substantial though at a gradually diminishing rate. On the other hand, inasmuch as we already have a birth-rate which will eventually entail a declining population, it is obvious that the period during which the number of families will continue to grow is a strictly limited one. Mr. C. J. Hill of the Economist intelligence department estimates the probable growth in the number of families at 700,000 over the ten years 1932-41, and at a further 160,000 over the ten years 1942-51, after which date there will be no further increase. On the basis of these figures we need, in order to meet the existing shortage and provide for the increase in the number of families, over 1,500,000 houses by 1941, and nearly 1,700,000 by 1951, apart from any houses built in connection with slum -clearance schemes, and not allowing for replacement of any existing houses that are pulled down in the period.6. These figures are for the whole of England and Wales. The deficiency is fairly evenly spread over the country, the large towns having rather more than their fair share, except for London, which has a shortage out of all proportion to the rest of the country, as the following statistics show : \           -	County of London.	Greater London area.	England and Wales.	England and Wales less Greater London area.Shortage in 1931 ...	440,000	592,000	830,000	238,000In the county of London only 60 per cent, of existing families are in occupa-tion of a separate dwelling. London&apos;s housing problem seems to require separate ;and more drastic treatment than that of the rest of the country.7. There is little doubt that the great bulk of the need is for houses to let. Of the houses built since the war, it may roughly be said that those built by private enterprise, 1,350,000 in number, have been for sale; those built by local -authorities, 650,000 in number, have been for letting. The 1931 committee on the rent restriction acts estimated that there are in existence 2,000,000 pre-war houses of a class corresponding to those which have been, built for sale; thus, accommodation of this type has increased by about 65 per cent. Of pre-war houses to let there are in existence 5-6 million, so that the number of these has increased by only about 12 per cent. In fact, the needs of the working class, who cannot buy houses, have not been and are not being adequately met.8. If the needs of the working class in general are not being adequately met, those of the poorer workers are not being met at all. I estimate that there are in England and Wales a million families, containing two million children, who could not afford a rent of above 7s. weekly. The great majority of local authority houses, in receipt of the Wheatley subsidy, are rented at 12s. to 15s. weekly, including rates. At present it is possible for local authorities to build the standard three-bedroomed, non-parlour house to let at an average rent of 12s. weekly including rates without subsidy. It is plain that to house the poorer workers a considerable subsidy is still required. The rent at which, -similar houses built by private enterprise could be let is approximately 2s. a week more, i.e., 14s. weekly. This figure is a high one for most working-class families, and is absolutely out of the reach of the poorer workers.
9. Private enterprise has not yet shown any readiness to undertake the-building of houses for letting, and the terms on which it can do so are still, markedly expensive for the great majority of those who require houses to let. With a considerable shortage still in existence, and large fresh needs continuing to come into being, it seems that the time to cease local authority building has hardly yet arrived. Further, it should be realised that the slum clearance activities, to which local authorities are now bidden to devote themselves, while intrinsically good, do nothing either to relieve the shortage or to provide for fresh families, because houses are built only to replace others which have been, demolished. Slum clearance is a slow and involved process, and it is unlikely that more than 20,000 to 30,000 houses a year will be built under the Greenwood, act, however great government pressure. Under the programmes submitted in 1930 the local authorities proposed to build 100,000 houses a year for letting.. This was a rate of &quot;building much more in keeping with the needs of the situation.10.   The present time is an extremely propitious one for an extensive building programme.   The fall in the long-term rate of interest has brought about a large: reduction in building costs.  There is still extensive unemployment in the building industry.  The indirect employment given to the brick-making and other material trades, and in making roads on new housing estates, is, moreover, considerable.11.   To repeat, a million and a half houses are needed by 1941 to do away with the existing shortage and provide for new families.   Of these about half should be able to be let at rents averaging 7s. weekly, inclusive of rates.   A special subsidy would be required to make this possible.    It is difficult to imagine a. better or more profitable way of spending money in the interests of the nation. Local authorities should be encouraged to build with and without subsidy, at the-rate of, say, 100,000 houses a year.   Private enterprise also should receive every encouragement.   Ten years of activity at this rate would provide for present and future needs, and give a surplus with the aid of which the problem of slum, clearance could be tackled in real earnest.o
