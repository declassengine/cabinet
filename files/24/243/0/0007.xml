(Received August 21.) (No. 532.)HIS Majesty&apos;s Charge a&quot;Affaires at Bagdad presents his compliments to His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit to him copies of correspondence between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad, and His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires, and of notes to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command, respecting the deportation of the Mar Shimun and family.Bagdad, August 17, 1933.Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes.Sir, Bagdad, August 16, 1933.ALTHOUGH the recent disturbances in the north are attributed directly to the mandatory authorities in Syria having, without informing the Government of Iraq, returned their arms to the Assyrians and acquiesced in their crossing the frontier so armed, it is nevertheless clear that the prime instigators of the rebellion of the Assyrians have been the members of the Mar Shimun family, and that they are even now seeking to prolong the rebellion.: The Government of Iraq feels that it can no longer delay either in prosecuting them on the capital charge of conspiring against the safety of the State or of deporting them from the country. In view of the religious veneration with which the members of this family are regarded by the Christians of the Nestorian Sect, the Government prefers the second alternative.The Government of Iraq have weighty reasons for considering that the matter of deportation would be much facilitated for all concerned if His Majesty&apos;s Government would consent to receive the principal members of this family temporarily and until their future is decided by the League of Nations, at some place in British territory, and would arrange for their transport thither.Copies of deportation orders issued by the Ministry of Interior in respect of Daud, Theodore, Ishai Mar Shimun and Surma Khatun are enclosed.If His Majesty&apos;s Government can see its way so to receive the persons concerned, the Government of Iraq will be deeply grateful if their transport abroad can be arranged for to-morrow, the 17th August. If that is not possible, the Government of Iraq will find it necessary to remove them to Transjordan via. Rutba on that date.I have, &amp;c.NOURY SAID,Minister for Foreign Affairs.Enclosure 2 in No. 1,Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bagdad.Your Excellency, Bagdad, August 16, 1933.I  HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your note No.  7764 of to-day&apos;s date, in which your Excellency informs me of the intention of the Government of Iraq either to prosecute the Mar Shimun and certain members of his family on a capital charge or to deport them to Transjordan via Rutba on [879 x-1]
the 17th August. Your Excellency adds that the Iraqi Government prefer the second alternative and have weighty reasons for considering that the deportation would be facilitated if His Majesty&apos;s Government would consent to receive the principal members of this family, temporarily and until their future is decided by the League of Nations, at some place in British territory&apos; and to arrange for their transport thither.2. While pointing out to your Excellency that, so far as I am aware, the necessary consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government to deportation to Transjordan has not been obtained and would not be granted, I am authorised to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while drawing attention to their views as expressed in my note of the 15th August, are prepared to agree to the request of the Iraqi Government to transport the Mar Shimun and family to a temporary asylum in British territory on the understanding that the Iraqi Government will accept full responsibility for, and eventually refund to His Majesty&apos;s Government, the expenses incurred in connexion with their transportation and subsequent maintenance, and that the deportation does not take effect until His Majesty&apos;s Government have had time to make the necessary arrangements for the various persons concerned.I avail, &amp;c.G. OGILVIE-FORBES.Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-for.es to Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command.Sir, Bagdad, August 16, 1933.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have in certain circumstances consented to provide facilities for the transportation of the Mar Shimun and several members of his family, and for their temporary reception in Cyprus.2. These circumstances having now arisen and the Iraqi Government having applied for the above-mentioned facilities in the cases of the Mar Shimun, Daoud and Theodore Mar Shimun and the Lady Surma, I have replied consenting thereto on certain conditions, one of which was that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have time to make the necessary arrangements for the various persons concerned.3. I would therefore request you to transport these persons to Palestine en route to Cyprus at your early convenience. I realise that it may not be possible to move the Lady Surma at the same time as the rest of the party. Indeed, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it preferable for her to be deported separately.4. I understand from you that, subject to suitable arrangements being made for their reception on leaving the Iraq Command, you are prepared to transport by air the above-mentioned male members of the party, together with an Assyrian attendant on the Mar Shimun, and two Levies selected by you to accompany the Mar Shimun to his final destination and eventually to return to Bagdad, six persons in all, leaving at dawn on Friday, the 18th August.5. A copy of my telegram of to-day&apos;s date to His Majesty&apos;s High Commis-sioner, Jerusalem, is enclosed herewith.^) On receipt of a reply in the affirmative, I would be glad if you would carry out the proposal as arranged.I have, &amp;c.G. OGILVIE-FORBES.(1)Not printed.
Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes.Dear Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes, Bagdad, August 16, 1933.WITH regard to the deportation orders mentioned in this Ministry&apos;s letter of to-day, which I had the honour of handing to you personally this morning, you will please find herewith enclosed copies of deportation orders of Ishai Mar Shimun, Daud Mar Shimun and Theodore Mar Shimun. .The deportation order of Surma Khatun is still under consideration, and would be forwarded to you when completed.Yours sincerely,NAJI-EL-ASIL.Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Deportation Order respecting the Ishai Mar Shimun.(2)THE Council of Ministers having, by virtue of the powers vested in them by Ordinance No. 12 of 1933, regarding divestment of Iraqi nationality, adopted a resolution divesting Ishai Mar Shimun of Iraqi nationality; arid it having been found that the deportation of the aforesaid person is necessary in the interest of peace and tranquillity;Therefore, we, Minister of the Interior, in exercise of the powers vested in us by article 2 of the above-mentioned ordinance, do hereby order the deportation -of the above-mentioned person beyond the frontiers of Iraq.For Minister of the Interior,N ASH AT-AL-S AN A WI.Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, August 16, 1933.Enclosure 6 in No. 1.Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command.Sir, Bagdad, August 17, 1933.WITH reference to my letter No. 199 of the 16th August, I have the honour to inform you that I have now received a telegram from His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner in Jerusalem to the effect that suitable arrangements will be made for the reception of the Mar Shimun and party at Ramleh on Friday, the 18th August.2. I would, therefore, be grateful if you would proceed with the transporta-tion of the Mar Shimun and party from the YM.C.A. on that date under arrange-ments made by you.3. I enclose for your further information copy of a most immediate telegram from the Foreign Office, No. 200 of the 16th August,(3) to the effect that in no case must the Iraqis be allowed to arrest the Mar Shimun, with a view to trial on a capital charge. The same ruling would apply to any attempt by the Iraqi Government to motor him across the desert to Rutba, a journey in which, in present circumstances, his life could not be absolutely guaranteed.4. You will accordingly observe that the enclosed telegram gives us authority to take any steps we may consider fit for the protection of the life of the Mar Shimun.  I trust, however, that the necessity will not arise.5. I enclose copies of the deportation order which the Iraqi Government inform me they have served on the Assyrians in question.^) You will observe that no time limit is specified.I have, &amp;c.G. OGILVIE-FORBES.(j2) Copies of orders respecting Daud Mar Shimun and Theodore Mar Shimun, mutatis mutandis, -also received.(3) Not printed. (*) Enclosure 5.
