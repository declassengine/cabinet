Copy No.     *jO250 (SS). ----CABINET. THE MATSON LINE.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.The United States Matson Line which is heavily subsidised by the United States Government now runs between San Francisco, Honolulu, Suva (Fiji), Auckland and Sydney.   Considerable resentment has been aroused both in Australia and in New Zealand by the fact that a subsidised United States Line should engage in our inter-Imperial trade whilst British ships competing on the same route are excluded from the Unixed States coasting trade -which includes not only ports in the United States proper but also United States possessions, such as Honolulu.The matter was discussed at the Ottawa Conference and referred for consideration to a conference of the Governments concerned in London.   Action on this recommendation was deferred pending the outcome of the deliberations of the &quot;World Monetary and Economic Conference at which, as my colleagues are sware, the question of shipping subsidies was raised, in strong terms by the United Kingdom delegation.The Conference adjourned without reaching any conclusion on the question of shipping subsidies, and in September a telegram v/as received from the Prime Minister of Australia requesting that His Majesty1s Ambassador ut Washington should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Australia were giving urgent consideration, jointly with His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand, to the question of imposing legislative restriction on United States shipping similar to that applying to Australian shipping between Honolulu and the United States.
Mr. Bruce has discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and government     and we came to the conclusion that Australia and Hew Zealand could not &quot;be pressed further to refrain from saying or doing what they pleased in respect of the Mat son Line.     V/e advised Mr. Bruce, however, to communicate with the Foreign Office on the question whether it would he desira&quot;ble that an advance intimation of their intention should be conveyed to the United States Government , by His Majesty1s Ambassador at Washington.It is possible that action may shortly be taken by Australia and New Zealand in the matter.     Such action, even though taken by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the two Dominions and not by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, may arouse resentment in the United States.This may stimulate the United States to take action against United Kingdom ships in trades in which this country is open to attack.     We feel, therefore, that our colleagues should be aware of the position.W.R.Board of Trade.2nd November, 1933.
