PromFRANCETelegram (en clair) from Lord Tyrrell.    (Paris).D.September 18th, 1933.R.September 19th, 1933.No.  219.s aving.oOoFollowing from Mr. Eden:-His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador accompanied me to Quai d&apos;Orsay this morning when we had discussion with M. Paul-Boncour and were joined in afternoon by M. Daladier.2.      M. Paul-Boncour referred at once to Italian proposals and I informed him we had received text from Rome.       He thereupon gave us text of reply French Government were re-turning (copy by bag).        They expect answer from Italian G o ve rnment t o-mo rrow.3.      French reply &quot;was generally not unfavourable. French Government recognise that Italian Government have made considerable advances towards French position and we encouraged French Ministers to pursue their efforts towards Franco-Italian agreement.4.      This Italian- intervention may modify the situation to some extent, but I do not Enow what view His Majesty&apos;s Government take of it.        These Italian proposals seem to afford better proapeot of establishing Anglo-French-Italian accord,    the importance of which was fully recognised by French Ministers and therefore deserves encouragement.    Mean-while both parties intend to keep us informed.The French Ministers stated that their position had not substantially altered since the June conversation.I said that I should then, I supposed, be right in reporting to His Majesty&apos;s Government that French position was/
was that, given a sj/stem of supervision acceptable to them and a trial period during which experience could be gained of its working, the French Government would undertake, in the convention to make certain reductions during the second period.      I said that until His Majesty&apos;s Government had knowledge of what those reductions would be and until they were fully cognisant of intentions of French Government on disarmament generally His Majesty&apos;s Government could not pro-nounce upon French proposals in regard to supervision etc. We had no desire to press French Government but we were anxious for the fullest information they could give us.6.     M. Daladier said that he would agree that by the end of the second period all guns exceeding 155 mm.  should have been disposed of.      The methods and stages of reduction would have to be agreed.      As regards tanks, he demurred to the figure of 16 tons, and would prefer 30 tons, but suggested as an alternative a global tonnage limitation,  or possibly a limitation of the calibre of gun carried.      As regards air-craft, French Government found it difficult to accept British plan as it stood:    it would involve too sudden and too large a reduction for France.      France would be prepared to reduce by 50% if the other principal air Powers did likewise.      I pointed out that we had already gone r-c far in reduction that that would be unfair- to us, and M. Daladier agreed that there would have to be adjustments for particular cases such as our own, or perhaps the reduction might be made not from present figures but from figures at some earlier date.7*      Mo Daladier spoke as previously of handing over material to the League, but was careful to explain that he was fully prepared for the League to destroy it and that this formula was only intended to satisfy French public opinion.
8c As regards effectives French are agreed that reduc-tion of period of service in all conscript armies should pro-ceed during first period simultaneously with transformation of Reichswehr.      M. Daladier said that he was considering the possibility of making a declaration at Geneva on the re-sumption of the Conference concerning German re-armament, and M. Paul-Boncour added that if the German delegate made the usual speech about Germany having alone disarmed it might be difficult to refrain from making such a declaration.      They asked the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this.    I said that I would report their question but at first sight I thought it preferable if Franco-British-Italian accord could first be reached on the future of the Conference to reserve such retort against the eventuality of the Germans complain-ing that they had not been fairly treated.9o These French proposals constitute an advance in disarmament as compared with June last.     At the same time M. Daladier expressed anxiety as to position which might be created were Germany to be proved by supervision to be re-arming.      While admitting that French and other signatories would then regain her freedom he said that this would hardly be enough.      He would like to be assured as to attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government might then be expected to adopt.      He appreciated our difficulty but thought that some formula might be found which would help him to tranquilise French public opinion.French Ministers are anxious to resume conversations if you think fit to send me instructions here.
