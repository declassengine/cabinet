E C R E T.(Communicated,by the French Ministry for Foreign Affairsn)Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with reference to paragraph 2 of telegram No:  219 from Lord Tyrrell    (see CP.  218(33)) and to CP.   219(33)..P.  221(33).CABINET.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OP ARMAMENTS.REPLY OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSALS OF THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT.Copy of telegram-   of September 15th,    1933, to the French Ambassador at Rome.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1. 19th September,  1933.
The examination of the suggestions which the Head of the Italian Government brought to the attention of the French Ambassador on the 5th September has been carried out by the French   Government in the sympathetic and conciliatory spirit indicated by its lively desire to find in those proposals the bases of an understanding between the two countries.        The Government of the Republic is indeed convinced that such an understanding would have the happiest consequences for the develop-ment of Franco-Italian relations.The French Government noted with particular satisfaction that on most points the suggestions formu-lated happily resemble   French views and that they thus mark the disappearance on these very questions of the divergences which hitherto had separated the two del egat ions.The proposals of the Head of the Italian Government, by the very fact of their general nature, would certainly have to be made more precise at a later date.      It is therefore in a provisional way and in the expectation of further explanations, which it is hoped the Italian Government will be good enough to furnish, that the French Government sets out below its opinion on the various suggestions which have been put forward for its examination and which the present note passes successively in review.(1) The French Government is naturally in agreement with the principle of proposal Ho.  1 as regards the destruction of factories specialising in preparation for chemical warfare.      The French Government has no objection to raise;    it fears nevertheless that this measure may be from a practical point of view ineffective and not susceptible of supervision, the majority of chemical factories having normally other activities than the-1-
preparation of poison gases;    the experts themselves have recognised that in actual fact such preparation could he undertaken without delay by any factories for chemical products.For the same reason the destruction of stocks which may be in existence does not appear to offer useful guarant ees.Consequently these measures are of little value unless they are accompanied by sanctions.      Now the suggestion put forward does not touch this    important question which has already been the subject of discussion by the Disarmament Conference.      The French Government maintains in this respect its former thesis;    since the recognition of the individual right of reprisals necessarily renders useless in practice the proposed prohibition, the French Government is of. the opinion that such reprisals should not be authorised.      The indispensable corollary -in view of the difficulty of preventive supervision in such a matter - would be the recognition of the principle that chemical warfare must necessarily provoke sanctions which would be put into effect collectively.(2) The French Government is no less favourable to the second proposal.      It is ready, as far as it is concerned, to go still farther and to accept the total abolition of aerial bombardment and consequently of bombing aircraft on condition that an effective international control is exercised over civil aviation.The Government of the Republic notes that the Italian proposal calls as corollary for restrictions defining the characteristics of military aircraft (equipment, limitation of horse power and tonnage).(3) The French Government has noted with particular satisfaction the adhesion of the Head of .the Italian
Government to the principle of a trial period during which the mechanism provided for by the Convention would be put into operation - and in particular,  supervision -on the results of which any reduction in existing materials would be conditional.      It agrees with Signor Mussolini in estimating that this period must last at least 4 years.The French Government further accept that the contracting powers should undertake forthwith to reduce their offensive materials on the expiration of the trial period, provided that this is recognised as satisfactory. This undertaking ought, moreover, to be specified in detail in the Convention itself on account of the divergent inter-interpretations which can be given to the formula &quot;offensive weapons&quot;.(4)    The French Government is in agreement with the Head of the Italian Government on the general principle that during the trial period the present level of land armaments should not be exceeded.      It understands that this aim ought to be reached not by a quantitative limitation of existing materials which would be inapplicable in practice and difficult to supervise, but by measures giving a guarantee that there shall be no increase in these arma-ments - measures which would include the imposition of a quota and of supervision of purchases and manufactures, both state and private, of war materials.    The general principle thus laid down will moreover have to be defined so as not to impede the execution of normal programmes of modernisation or replacement, provided that the present level of armaments thus modernised or replaced shall be strictly respected.As regards expenditure on national defence, the Government  of the Republic, which has continually advocated its limitation,  congratulates itself on the acceptance of this principle by the Italian Government.    It accepts that that this limitation should be made on the present Devel,-3-
subject to the examination of special cases to which certain states might uphold their claim.      It would point out nevertheless that the proposal to restrict this measure to expenditure on land and air armaments raises difficulties of a technical nature to which it sincerely hopes a solution may be found.(5)     The French Government which had itself taken the initiative in proposing the standardisation of types of continental armies takes note gladly of the adherence of Italy to this principle, and its acceptance in this   respect of the provisions of the British plan, which submits the effectives of all overseas territories to an entirely different regime from that of metropolitan territories.      It recalls that the introduction of the system proposed presupposes a satisfactory solution of the important questions of military police and of pre-and para- military training;    it Is moreover convinced that  solutions can be found which take into account the special desiderata of Italy, while at the same time furnishing guarantees which appear more and more indispensible against the development in another country of methods tending to supplement the regular army by a second army which would escape supervision and al 1 limitation.As regards the figures of effectives, and of the period of service,  the French Government, which is ready to accept forthwith on this point appreciable reductions, considers that certain adjustments must be made to the British plan,  without bringing into question its actual principles, as regards the proportion between
Italian and French   forces.(6)    Observations called forth by proposal No. 6 are set out later.(7)    The French Government accepts the postponement,to a later date of the examination of the naval problem in its entirety, an examination which will moreover demand the collaboration of other naval powers than those which are signatories of the Washington Treaty.(8)    The French Government is in agreement with Signor Mussolini in considering necessary the immediate establishment of a permanent Disarmament Commission.      It believes, neverthe-less,  that the provisions of the British plan, notably as regards the voting rules, risk hindering the successful working of this Commission. It desires on this point to invite the attention of the Head of the Italian Government to the amendments already presented by the French Delegation,  the approval of which it considers highly desirable.(9)    As regards supervision,  the French Government was particularly gratified at the adherence given by the Head of the Italian Government to the principle of regular periodical and automatic supervision on the spot.      It expresses the hope that the Italian Government
will associate its efforts with its own in insuring that the provisions which will he inserted, in the Convention may make super-vision as.efficacious as possible in order that its application during the trial period may justify by results at  the end of this period the intended reduction of armaments. It will be desirable moreover to set out in detail the consequences which will be involved by the establishment of the fact that a violation of the engagements taken under the Convention has taken place.(10)    Point No.  10 does not at the moment call for any observation.The upshot of the preceding remarks is that, taking the questions concerning their respective armaments as a whole, there is no reason to foresee in the development of the principles set out above any important divergencies of view between Italy and Prance. The Government of the Republic is happy to be able to make this statement.      It appreciates deeply the share in attaining this result which is due to the initiative so successfully taken by the Mead of the Italian Government.
(11).    The sixth of the proposals put forward by His Excellency Senor Mussolini presents a different problem.      This proposal contemplates a modification in the position regarding the armaments of the Powers &quot;disarmed&quot; by treaties in force:    such Powers would be allowed by successive and agreed stages a quota of &quot;defensive armaments&quot;.The French Government is under no mis-apprehension as to the reasons which have dictated this proposal, but feels itself all the more justified in explaining in strict confidence to the Italian Government the serious objections which such a solution calls forth on its part.If it is a question of allowing the States disarmed by treaty, and in particular Germany, who, in accordance with the principles of the French plan, reproduced in the British plan, will be allowed pari passu    with the transformation of her army a certain increase in effectives,  to increase at the same time within limits to be fixed the quantity of war material which they are allowed to possess by treaty,  the Government of the Republic would see no insuperable difficulty in such a suggestion, provided that all suitable precautions were taken in fixing the limit of military expenditure for these States.Taken in conjunction with the reduction in their own armaments which the other Powers party to the Convention would be called upon to make within the trial period, both as regards the decrease in
the number of effectives and the immediate limitation of the manufacture of material, as well as with the fact that the system of control to which the disarmed States are at present subjected in principle would be made of general application,  such a proposal would afford Germany all such advantages as she has a right to expect during a first stage in the progressive realisation of equality of rights.If, on the other hand,  it is the intention of the Italian Government to accord from the outset to the disarmed States, and in particular to Germany, a quota, however limited, of the heavy war material which is to be retained by the other States during the period covered by the Oonvention, the French Government would regard such a suggestion as extremely dangerous.      In it&apos;s opinion the actual position, which on this or that specific point Germany has already been able to establish in the matter of war material in defiance of the treaties, would constitute no argument in favour of such a proposal.The French Government must reaffirm the principle that    the maintenance of the armaments of the disarmed Powers at a level
illcorresponding to that fixed by the international agreements in force is a necessary condition for the progressive reduction of the armaments of the other Powers. .    This principle it affirmed even before the opening of the Disarmament Conference, and the course of events in Germany obliges it to persist in the will to uphold it.Before the results of the experimental period are known and it has been possible to estimate the safeguards which such a period has provided, there can be no question of forming any definite estimate of the limits which should be laid down for the various types of armaments for all States. The risk should not therefore be taken of authorising Germany now to manufacture types of war material which it might be possible in one of the future stages to abolish in the case of all armies.In the proposals which he has formulated His Excellency the Head of the Italian Government has given many proofs of his understanding of the motives which inspire French policy in the matter of disarmament.       The Government of the Republic is confident that he will equally appreciate that this question is one of vital importance to France,  since it directly concerns her security, and that accordingly no French Government can run the risk involved in any dangerous experiment in this matter..
