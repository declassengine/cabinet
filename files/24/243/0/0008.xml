----&apos;-- /    f)   copy NO._SECRETCP. 208 (33) .CABINET india appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 22nd August 1933.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by-the- Secretary of State for India.
Confidential Appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 22nd August 1933, issued on. the authority of the Secretary of State for India.The final decisions emerging from the Poona   ,, Conference,  although they hardly appeared consistent with-such conclusions as it may be. said to have reached, were embodied in a statement issued by Mr. Aney,  the acting President, on the 22nd July. The salient points of this statement were:(1) The campaign of Civil Disobedience should not be unconditionally withdrawn *(2) Mass Civil Disobedience should be discontinued for the time being.( 3) All those willing and able to offer individual Civil Disobedience are expected todo so.(4) All Congress organisations should  cease to exist for the time being.This was amplified in a statement issued by Mr. Gandhi himself a few days later which made it clear that individual civil disobedience was regarded by him as a prelude to a revival of mass civil disobedience.        &quot;The response must first come from the intelligentsia.     Their example will prove infectious in the long run and pervade the whole nation resulting in a mass awakening that cannot&apos; possibly be crushed by any repression be it ever  so ferocious.       While Congressmen can be counted by the crore civil resisters under the new scheme will be represented only by a few thousands or even less.      If these are true men and women I am certain they will multiply into millions.   Those not prepared for civil resistance should devote themselves .to constructive activities and in particular it would be their duty to give relief to indigent families of the civil resisters, especially to utterly destitute peasantry who joined the no-tax
9 sy      ocampaign.      For they must ensure that every inch of land confiscated during the  campaign (I think lawlessly and wrongly)will&apos; he&apos; returned to them or their progeny when the nation comesitto her own as it. must some o.ay.These announcements  created widespread feeling ofdisappointment and bewilderment among Congress sympathisers. Therewas no doubt a general feeling of relief that no attempt was beingmade to revive mass movement, but many were disappointed that theformer programme of civil disobedience had not been completelyand formally-called off in favour of a constructive programme andwere bewildered in an attempt to understand what individual efforts in civil disobedience could hope.to achieve when mass effortshad failed;    what leadership the rank and file could expect whenthe leaders were individually to court imprisonment;    what hopethere was of any practical achievement when local Congressorganisations were dissolved.    The decision to dissolve Congressorganisations was,,, in fact, the part of the programme mostseverely criticised in Congress ranks.   No provincial governments anticipate any serious revival of the movement as aresult of this programme,, but reference to the question ofrestoration of land confiscated for failure to pay land revenueshowed that Mr. Gandhi, influenced perhaps by his companion inYersv.da jail, Mr. Vallabhai Patel, aimed at stirring up thePeasantry in those parts of Bombay Presidency where he had firststarted the movement.    This was one of the questions whichwas most prominent in 1930 but conditions in the areas hadmeantime been restored to normal.Mr. Gandhi!s next move gave a further indication ofthis intention.    He first made the dramatic announcement that hewas disbanding the Ashram at Sabarmati, an institution containingmen, women and children, at which his disciples were trained in   -his religious, doctrines and in spinning, the manufacture ofKhaddar cloth,  agriculture, etc.   This he represented in a letter
to the Government of Bombay as an act of sacrifice^,   the movement called for sacrifice from all its supporters and the author of the movement could make no greater sacrifice than by giving up the institution which he had bui.lt up with care and patience for 18 years.   He followed this up, however, with a further telegram in which he stated his intention of marching at the head of his companions from the Ashram through the Kaira district &quot;to tender sympathy to villagers most hit.    Ke had no desire to invite villagers to mass civil disobedience, but individuals would be invited to offer civil disobedience in terms of Congress resolution.&quot;Mr. Gandhi&apos;s programme was curiously similar to that adopted in 1930 when he inaugurated the Civil Disobedience Movement by a spectacular march to Dandi to break the salt laws. To allow him similar liberties on this occasion might have caused a serious revival of the movement not only in Bombay Presidency, but elsewhere.   He and his followers were therefore arrested before the march started and he was removed from Ahmedabad to Poona.    After a few days he was released; but directed not to leave Poona;   he at once defied this order, was prosecuted and sentenced to a year&apos;s simple imprisonment.What Mr, Gandhi hoped to achieve by this new programme is problematical and in putting it forward he seems to have been rather out of touch with realities.     He may have hoped by a spectacular act of sacrifice to win some sympathy.   By keeping alive the spirit of non-co-operation, he no doubt hoped at a favourable opportunity to revive mass movement;    by putting restoration of land in the forefront of his programme he saw the greatest hope of a successful start in an inflammable area.   His programme has so far achieved no success;   his arrest,
which effectively prevented any trouble in Ahmedabad area, excited little interest and there have been no demonstrations such as took place when he was arrested in 1930 or at beginning of 1932.    A few devoted adherents, notably Mr. Rajagopalachari and Mr. Aney, have followed his example by committing an open breach of the law and thereby ccuroing arrest and imprisonment, but the total number of persons so arrested is extremely few, and there are at present no signs in any province of their activities receiving any popular support or even sympathy. The civil disobedience movement may in fact be said to be at as low an. ebb as it was when it was suspended in May last.During the last few days another problem has confronted the Government.    Immediately after his arrest, Mr. Gandhij, who during his period of liberty appeared to have devoted little time to the anti-untouchability campaign, put forward the claim that he should have,  as a convicted prisoner, exactly the same facilities to carry on the campaign &quot;without let or hindrance&quot; as had been allowed him as a state prisoner in October last, when the movement was first inaugurated. Facilities, which are in the opinion of the Government ample,  to enable him make an important and effective contribution to this work have been granted to him, but with these he is not satisfied.   He claims nothing short of complete freedom in this matter and not being granted this has once again resorted to a fast.      If Mr. Gandhi wishes to devote himself to this work he can secure his release at once by giving up his civil disobedience activities.    The offer has, in fact, been made to him, but he has rejected it and fast which began on August 16th still continues.It is desirable to give some account of the recent events on the Uorth West Frontier.     To understand the significance of these developments,  it is necessary to refer to some of the
events of the recent months,    in March last, at the instigation of the Lewanai Fakir and his companions, a few thousand Wazir and Mahsud tribesmen of waziristan made an incursion into Afghan territory in Khost.    This situation was however, &quot;brought quickly under control as the Maliks, after receiving warning from the Government that unless the lashkars were recalled they would have to take such measures as might &quot;be necessary to enforce their orders, recalled the lashkars to. Waziristan.    The Fakir and his associates, however,  succeeded in making good their escape and one of his emissaries made his way to Bajaur territory where he has recently been fomenting trouble.    This principal individual, who was joined and supported by a local agitation,  calls himself a &quot;pretender&quot; to the Afghan throne and, in order to prevent a repetition of the incidents which occurred in Khost and to stop any agitation against the friendly Afghan Government on the Indian side of the frontier, it has been necessary to take action against the tribes who have been harbouring him and his associates.   An ultimatum was accordingly presented to the Khans of Bajaur demanding the surrender of these suspects by 29th July, after which date the Government would be compelled to take strong action to enforce compliance with their orders. The Khan of kharre pleaded inability to comply, while the Khan of Kotkai, who was actually harbouring pretender, returned a defiant answer.In view of this, warning notices were dropped by aircraft next day on the small village of Kotkai, informing the inhabitants that, unless the &quot;pretender&quot; and his associates were surrendered by a specified date, the village would be bombed.    These warnings also evoked no response, and bombing was resorted to on August 1st, August 2nd and August 4th. Although some damage was done to village, no loss of life has been reported.    The action taken has, however, given rise to a good deal of misunderstanding and misrepresentation,
and criticisms which have appeared in the press in England have had repercussions in this country, particularly in the vernacular Muslim press, while in some places there have been attempts to hold meetings to protest against the action taken against these tribes.It is represented that Government are trying to force the tribes to hand over the &quot;pretender&quot; and his associates, although such surrender would be a violation of the custom which prevails among Pathans and many other primitive peoples and which enjoins them to safeguard a guest who has sought their protection.    It was clearly impossible for Government t;o allow such customs to override the obligations of a tribe to comply with their demands for the surrender of a person or persons who are a definite menace to peace of the border or tointerfere with the fulfilment of Government&apos;s international obligations.    The Afghan authorities look to Gova:n.ment of India for assistance in this matter and Government of India could not refuse to render such assistance as was possible. Assurance was given that no harm would come to agitators if handed over,  but that they would be allowed to live in peace at some place distant from the frontier.The remoteness of the area, the adverse climatic conditions and the very slender control exercised by the civil authorities over the fanatical tribes of Bajaur rendered it impossible for the Government to apply ordinary methods of political pressure to obtain compliance with their demands and for that reason action by the Air Force had to be taken.    In anticipation of any further de-velopments which may arise in this area the bridge carrying the road over the Panjkora river into the Bajaur Valley, which had been swept away in a flood, is being rebuilt.
on7.Apart from this trouble in Bajaur territory, there has been some tension for the last 15 months or so between the Upper and Halimzai Mohmands owing mainly to the pressure the former have been bringing to bear upon the latter not to serve the Government as Khassadars (tribal police) .    This &quot;trouble came to head about the 21st July, when a lashkar of about 1,500 Upper Mohmands crossed over from the Afghan side of the border into Gandab, 40 miles north west of Peshawar, and attacked the Halimzais.    The latter, reinforced by detachments from Musa Khel and Tarakzais,  succeeded in repulsing the hostile lashkar.To protect this frinndly tribe, who have been assured, of help in such circumstances,  it has been decided as a precautionary measure to send a column into the Gandab Valley, and to improve communication in this area. On 11th August the Halimzai were again attacked by the Upper Mohmands, and several of their villages were burnt. On the following day the Gandab column, while advancing towards Khapak Pass, was fired upon, and got in touch with an enemy lashkar.    Band camp, headquarters of the Howsnera Brigade, was heavily sniped from the 11th to the 15th August with, however,  one casualty.    On 16th August, Peshawar Brigade Column was engaged in a brisk action with some 200 enemies on the hills north of Katsai.    This action and warnings that have been issued appear to have had good resuits.    The most recent reports show that the enemy lashkar has dispersed.
