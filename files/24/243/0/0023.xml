(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO.SECRET.CP. 223 (33).CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, aatea 22zs&amp; September, 1933.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India dated 22nd Sept.1933, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for    India.The last appreciation shov/ed how the attempt to create enthusiasm for the programme announced after the Poona conference by spectacular acts of individual civil disobedience had met with little success.    Further reports from all provinces corroborate this view.    The efforts to revive picketing or any form of other civil disobedience activity, even in areas where the movement had previously been most intense, were neither widespread nor sustained.    In the North West Frontier Province the attempt at revival was singularly ineffective and many of the Red-shirts are publicly abjuring the movement by an oath on the Koran.    In the Punjab the arrest of Sardul Singh Kaveeshar, who had succeeded Mr. Aney as President of the All-India Congress Committee, aroused little interest and no excitement.In Bengal and Madras failure of attempted revival is shown by the fact that the Local Governments which had suspended the premature release of prisoners till the effects of the new programme were clear, were able to issue orders before the end of August for further releases.    It is to be noted that the number of civil disobedience prisoners decreased by over 2,GOO in july    in August the decrease was only 170, owing to the increase during that month in the number of new convictions. The total number of prisoners at the end of the month was 4513. There are no signs that the continuance of a carefully regulated policy of premature release has had any untoward result.In accordance with a decision previously reached by the Government of Bombay, the Government of India and the Secretary of State:, Gandhi was unconditionally released as soon&apos; as his condition appeared to be approaching the danger zone.    He at
His release caused no excitement, nor did it in. any way enhance his prestige; iti some quarters his action was criticised on the grounds that he has twice within four months, by means of these fasts, regained his liberty while leaving his followers behind in jails.   He has, since his release, got in touch with Jawaharlal Nehru, who was released just before the expiry of his sentence owing to his mother&apos;s illness.    The statements issued by these two leaders are interesting and significant.     Mr.Gandhi realises that, if he returned to jail, he would return to the . same conditions as before, and would,, therefore, practically be committed to another fast.     He has announced that he will not court imprisonment by aggressive civil disobedience till the period for which he was sentenced to&apos; imprisonment has expired,&apos; he will, however, guide those who seek his advice, but proposes to devote this period to Harijan. service, and, if possible, to 3uch constructive adtiviiies as his health may permit.Meanwhile, he will make all endeavour in his power to explore every avenue of an honourable peace, Jawahar Lai Nehru, while professing to approve Gandhi&apos;s methods and beseeching his leadership, has made it clear that,  in fact, there are essential differences in outlook between them.     He explains that he views the position, from the economic rather than from the religious point of view and sketches an objective of &quot;bringing about equalisation in the social order by divesting vested interests.,&quot; which is profoundly disturbing to -these interests,, and particularly [ those of landlords, who have previously been the targets of his attacks.It is noteworthy also that he now specifically includes the Indian Princes among &quot;class or group which enjoys special privileges at the expense of the masses.&quot; He
reiterates the decision of the Karachi Congress that the political objective of Congress is complete independence, and, with reference to gandhis &quot;honourable peace&quot;, he explains that &quot;any final peace can only be achieved when full objective is gained.    There may of course be what may be called provisional settlements or truces, such as the Delhi truce.    The two forces that are ih conflict to-day, i.e,, imperialism and nationalism, are fundamentally opposed to each other and &quot;between them there can never be peace except on the &quot;basis of ending imperialism&quot;.It is too early yet to foresee the practical outcome of the position taken by the two leaders, out press comments tend to be critical of both, either for giving no real lead or for giving the wrong lead.    But Jawahar Lai can probably count upon the support of the younger and more militant elements of Congress.The murder of the district magistrate of Midnapore, Mr. Burge, on September 2nd came as a tragic reminder that, although the situation in Bengal as a whole has steadily improved in recent months, the danger of terrorist outrages of this kind still remains.    The outrag has been generally condemned, hut, following the lead given by Gandhi, there has also been a regrettable tendency to argue that terrorism is the natural outcome of a policy that does not concede nationalist demands.Gandhi&apos;s comment was that &quot;It is not possible not to negret that the rulers will not only not redress the wrongs which lead to such assassinations, out insist on ruling by counter-terrorism, which ordinance rule undoubtedly means.&quot;Another feature which may be regarded as indicating some general sympathy with the terrorists, as apart from
their crimes, has heen the agitation which had recentlybeen worked up in Nationalist newspapers and onNationalist platforms for bringing back from the Andaman terroristIslands the/prisoners who had recently gone on hunger strike. (See paragraph six of the sixth appreciation for June last). That complete segregation of the more dangerous terrorist convicts is more necessary is shown by the fact that recent terrorist activities in Madras are believed to owentheir origin to the influence of Bengali terrorist prisoners who were being detained in Madras jails.In a debate in the Council of State on this question the Home Member stated very fully and plainly the justification for the Government&apos;s policy of sending terrorist prisoners to the Andaman Islands and, as a result, the resolution was withdrawn and it may be hoped that the agitation will now die down.There has been a considerable improvement in the situation on the frontier during the last month.    In Bajaur no further action has had to be taken for, though the Pretender and his associates have not been surrendered to the Government of India, they have left Kotkai area.    In Momand territory no hostile action of importance has been taken against the force sent up from Peshawar to assist the Halimzais and satisfactory progress has been made with construction of the road in t he area.In British India there has been a certain amount of agitation among the Muslim community in regard to the bombing of Kotkai.    This a ction might have attracted little notice had it not been for criticism in the English press. Indian critics could not afford to be less emphatic* The reference to the action taken, and the reasons for it,, made by His Excellency in a speech to the Legislature did much to remove misapprehensions and these were still further removed by a subsequent  debate in the Assembly.
