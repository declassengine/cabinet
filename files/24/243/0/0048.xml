0.P.247/33.SECRET.. COPY NO.   37_________S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT *CABINET . PROGRAMME OP NEW CONSTRUCTION, 1955, ALTERATIONS * , MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.At the Cabinet meeting on 26th October,(Cab,57(33)), the Cabinet, in approving the proposed alteration in the Programme of Naval Construction agreed that I should (1)&quot;enquire as to how long &quot;the announcement of the change could be delayed from the purely &quot;technical point of view&quot;, and (2) &quot;consult the Cabinet as to the &quot;date on which Parliament should be informed of this decision&quot;. As regards (1), the position is this.The Building Programme originally included one LEANDER class Cruiser and three ARETHUSA cla3s Cruisers, and I informed the House of Commons on the 16th March last that the LEANDER and one of the ARETHUSAS would be built in the Dockyards and that the other two ARETHUSAS would be built by contract.    I should state here that as it is now clear that the Dockyards will have as much work as they can do, in other directions, it i3 intended to bui&amp;d all the threo cruisers of the revised Programme by contractsUnder our normal practice, which is quite familiar to the shipbuilding and ongineering firms,the invitations to tender for the two contract-built cruisers of the original Programme and for the machinery of the other two cruisers of that Programme,should have been issued by the middle of October.   These invitations are therefore already being anxiously awaited by the Firms.The revised Programme includes two of the new type cruisers, the design end full specifications for which cannot bo ready for some throe months, and only one ARETHUSA class cruiser.It /
iiiIt follows that tho invitations to he issued immediately vsill relate to only ono ARET1ITJSA, and as soon as they are issued it will ho public property that some modification of the programme he s- bscr. made ..As already explained, the isauo of the tenders is even now overdue, and it must bo assumed that spoculation as to whether the delay is due to soao change of policy is already beginning, and will increase week by week.I am of opinion that tho Invitations could not be hold up any later than the 15th November without danger of our being quost ionod*.a3 regards (2), it is desirable that Parliament should bo informed of the change of programme, before any other public announcement is made.   Tho constitutional doctrine on this subject is to bo found in the second Report of the Committee of Public Accounts 1898, where it is laid down that &quot;with or without &quot;a Supplementary Estimate,  Parliament should be informed at tho &quot;earliest opportunity of any really important extension or &quot;alteration of tho Programme&quot;.I therefore recommend that Parliament should be informed of the change not later than tho 15th November^(Iaitailed) B.E.M.MIRALTY,  S.W.I.30th October, 1933.
