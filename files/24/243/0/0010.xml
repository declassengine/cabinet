Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1933.SECRET.Copy No.   46CP. 210 (33).CABINET.51RELATIONS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT WITH THE IMAMOF THE YEMEN.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a memorandum prepared in my Department covering the minutes of a meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East, held on the 15th August last, and other papers, in regard to the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam of Yemen.These papers have been circulated to the members of the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East, so that they can inform the Secretary before the meeting of the Cabinet to be held on the 5th September next, whether they concur in the recommendations of the Standing Official Sub-Committee.These recommendations are : -(1) (a) That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam; provided the envoy is previously authorised, should the Imam prove obdurate-(i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement; that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not any longer tolerate the presence of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty&apos;s Government claim for the Aden Protectorate; and that if negotiations are broken off, His Majesty&apos;s Government will in all probability feel compelled to assert forcibly their rights in Audhali, and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces.(ii) To break off negotiations.Note. In point of fact, it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind, it will clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory, but the envoy must have an assurance that, if necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the Protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces, as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after the negotiations are broken off.(&amp;) That while continuance of negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as-a departure, in a strict sense, from the instructions approved earlier in the year to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had said their last word, the Imam&apos;s letter can be accepted as a sufficient advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa, on his return in the autumn, for the purpose of concluding a treaty; but that in order that there may be no misapprehension-hension, the Imam must understand that Flis Majesty&apos;s government note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
require the trade restrictions to be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Residents admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty is actually signed, and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss matters of wording in the text of the treaty proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot be agreed to in any form.(e) That in the event of action becoming necessary for the recovery of Audhali territory, it is essential that authority should be given for bombing, after the usual warnings, suitable military objectives within Imamic territory, and that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary.(d) That in any scheme for forcible recovery of territory occupied by Zeidiforces, it would not be possible to rely upon irregular tribal levies to carry out an organised attack; that their role should be limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action; and that it will in the main rest with the Royal Air Force not only to clear territory occupied by Zeidi forces, but also, if necessary, to prevent reoccupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air action against military objectives in the Imam&apos;s territory.(e) That the Resident should have discretion to discuss and accept verbalamendments in the text of the treaty, but that the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office should consider whether any of the particular amendments now suggested by the Imam must be objected to.(2) (a) That as regards the incursion by Zeidi forces into the Subeihi country referred to in the Acting Residents telegram of the 14th August, 1933 (Paper No. M.E. (O) 101), the Acting Resident should be authorised to despatch an ultimatum to the Imam, concurrently with a notification to the Governor of Taiz, demanding withdrawal and restoration of the prisoners and loot, to be followed in the event of non-compliance by air action, after the usual local warnings, against Taiz or other suitable military objectives within the Imam&apos;s territory in the vicinity of the disturbed area.(b) That the Foreign Office should take the necessary steps to advise the Italian Government of recent events in the Subeihi country, and the action which it is proposed to take.(e) That action in connection with the incursion into the Subeihi country should be taken at the earliest possible moment, allowing the minimum necessary time for the delivery of an ultimatum to the Imam and of notification to the Italian Government.(3) That the Colonial Office should take the instructions of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Chairman of the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East, whether the action to be taken on the despatches and telegram from the Acting Resident under discussion should be submitted to the Ministerial Sub-Committee or to the Cabinet.P. C.-L.Colonial Office, S.W. 1, August 30, 1933.
ADEN PROTECTORATE.Relations with the Imam of the Yemen.Memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office.1. THE Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East met on the 15th August, 1933, to discuss certain despatches and a telegram received from the Acting&apos; Resident at Aden regarding the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam of the Yemen. The minutes of the meeting are at Annex A. The documents considered by the Sub-Committee were : (i) Acting Residents despatch No. 162 of the 12th July, 1933 : treaty negotiations (Annex B). (ii) Acting Residents despatch No. 163 of the 12th July, 1933 : Proposed ultimatum to the Imam regarding the evacuation of Protectorate territory which his forces have been occupying for some years (Annex C).(iii) Acting Residents despatch No. 164 of the 12th July, 1933 : Appoint-ment of Consular Officers in the Yemen (Annex D).(iv) Acting   Residents   telegram   of   the   14th   August,   1933:   Zeidiincursion into Subeihi territory in the south-west corner of the Protectorate (Annex E).A sketch map is attached (Annex F).2. The following is a brief history of the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam since the termination of the War.Anglo-Turkish boundary between Yemen and Aden Protectorate.3. The Imam of the Yemen is the head of the Zeidi sect of Islam and the ruler of a large territory in south-west Arabia immediately north of the Aden Protectorate. The Yemen Was under the Turks from 1871 to 1918, and in 1903-05 the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen was delineated with the Turks in a series of agreements, which in 1914 were combined in one convention. At the end of the war in 1918, Turkish forces were still in occupation of parts of the Aden Protectorate. They were never ejected by force,, but were negotiated out after the armistice, and their place in the Yemen taken by the Imam.Yemeni encroachments into the Protectorate; occupation of Dhala and Audhali territory.4. The Imam has consistently refused to recognise the Anglo-Turkish boundary, and in 1919 he commenced his encroachments into the Aden Protectorate, taking Dhala. In 1924 Zeidi tribes occupied the upper country of the Audhali tribe (which is under British protection by virtue of a treaty signed in 1914), and invaded the lower Audhali country in 1925. The Imam&apos;s forces were immediately dislodged from the lower country by air action, but efforts to recover the upper part were unsuccessful. This failure was due partly to a lack of co-operation on the part of the Audhalis themselves, and partly to the inadequate air forces then available at Aden.Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s mission to Sanaa.5. Hostilities were suspended in 1926 and the late Sir Gilbert Clayton was sent to Sanaa (the Imam/s capital), where he endeavoured to negotiate a treaty with the Imam, but the negotiations broke down on the question of evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory.Cabinet warning to Imam.6.   Early in 1927 the Cabinet gave a serious warning to the Imam, through the Resident at Aden, that his occupation of part of the Aden Protectorate renders him liable at any time to such measures of retaliation by land, air, or [8968] b 2
sea at such time and in such manner as His Majesty&apos;s Government may deem suitable. The Imam&apos;s reply to this warning was pacific, and included an offer to resume negotiations for a treaty. It was eventually decided to pursue the method of negotiation, but to make the evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory a prerequisite to the signing of any treaty.Operations at Dhala; continued occupation of Sanah.7. In spite of this decision, it was found necessary in 1928 to take air action against the Imam in the Dhala area as a result of the kidnapping of two Protectorate Sheikhs by Zeidi forces. Various towns in Yemen territory were bombed, as also were the frontier garrisons; the Protectorate tribes assisted, and in two months the whole of the Dhala area was evacuated by the Zeidis except for a small piece of territory in the vicinity of Sanah.Al Ain incursion.8. Small incursions have occurred at other points, e.g., the Al Ain area in the north-east of the Protectorate, when a threat of bombing was resorted to, and this proved sufficient to induce the Zeidi forces to withdraw.Treaty negotiations.9. Since 1925 the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has therefore been that, apart from further incursions into Protectorate territory or any other provocation by the Imam, such as interference with Protectorate tribesmen, evacuation of the occupied Protectorate territory should be secured by negotiation. They have, however, always insisted that the signature of the treaty must be preceded by three things, namely : (a) the evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory;(6) the release of a number of Protectorate tribesmen who were captured in the Audhali country and are still prisoners with the Imam; and(c) the removal of the embargo which the Imam has placed on trade between the Yemen and the Protectorate.The Imam has now in effect expressed his willingness to carry out these three conditions, if a treaty is concluded.The chief obstacles to the conclusion of the treaty have been : (a) the consistent attempt of the Imam to introduce into the text some formof wording which will enable him to claim at least some portion of the Aden Protectorate (if not the whole, including Aden itself) as part of his ancestral domain;(b) his claim to sovereignty over certain islands in the Red Sea.The Imam&apos;s claim to portions of the Aden Protectorate is not admitted, while the sovereignty of the Red Sea islands, which raises international questions under the Treaty of Lausanne, is not within the competence of His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide.10. In the face of the Imam&apos;s insistence on these two points, the matter was reconsidered by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East in March of this year in order to see how far His Majesty&apos;s Government could properly go in order to secure the conclusion of the treaty, and it was decided that certain concessions could be made which would not endanger the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but which must be regarded as their &quot; final word.&quot; As a result of this decision, the Resident communicated to the Imam on the 11th April a revised draft treaty embodying the concessions approved by the Sub-Committee, and at the same time informed him that this draft represented the final proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who could make no further concessions to meet his views. The Resident also informed the Imam (on the instructions from London) that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready to bear in mind any views he may wish to put forward with regard to the islands at the southern end of the Red Sea referred to in Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, if at any time the future status of those islands is under consideration.&quot;  A copy of the Residenfs letter to the Imam is at Annex G.
11, The Imam&apos;s reply to this letter forms an enclosure tp Annex B. In it, he &quot; completely and wholly accepts &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government^ draft of the treaty, and states that he will comply with the terms of Colonel Reilly&apos;s letter of the 11th April and of the Note annexed thereto (i.e., the three conditions set out in paragraph 9 above). He then goes on to submit a revised draft containing what the Acting Resident describes as three major and ten minor amendments of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs terms, together with a &quot; Secret Appendix,&quot; in which he seeks to tie the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter of the Red Sea Islands, and concludes his letter by an intimation that the trade embargo will be removed after the signature of the treaty.Acting Resident&apos;s Recommendations.12. In the light of the Imam&apos;s reply, the Acting Resident recommends the immediate breaking off of negotiations on the ground of his refusal to remove the trade embargo before the signature of the treaty, to be followed by an ultimatum to the Imam threatening armed intervention to recover the occupied Protectorate territory and to effect the - release of the Protectorate hostages still in Zeidi hands. In recommending that the breaking off of negotiations and the issue of an ultimatum should be dealt with as two separate and distinct steps, the Acting Resident had in mind the desirability of avoiding the criticism that a treaty is being pressed on the Imam by a threat of force.13. The incursion into the Subeihi territory in the South-west corner of the Protectorate, which is reported in the telegram at Annex E, is a separate incident entirely unconnected with the Zeidi occupation of the Audhali territory or the Sanah area. This incursion and the capture and removal of tribesmen and live-stock required an immediate protest which the Acting Resident has already made to the local Zeidi officer at Taiz, but which he recommends should be followed in the event of non-compliance by a definite ultimatum to the officer commanding at Taiz, and by subsequent bombing of that town and other suitable objectives after the customary warning.Questions for Consideration by Official Sub-Committee.14. There were, therefore, three questions for the consideration of the Official Sub-Committee, namely (a) the suspension of the treaty negotiations (see Annex B);(b) the forcible ejection of the Imam from the occupied Audhali territory and the Sanah area (see Annex C); and(c) immediate air action to recover the prisoners and loot carried off in therecent incursion into the Subeihi area (see Annex E).The question of the appointment of Consular officers raised in Annex D is not of immediate importance and the Sub-Committee did not discuss it.15. Of these, the questions at (a) and (6) must, in the opinion of the Sub-Committee, be linked together for the reasons set out in paragraphs 16-19 below, but (c), as explained in paragraphs 22-24 below, should be treated as a separate and urgent issue. The conclusions of the Sub-Committee are set out on pages 11 and 12 of the Minutes in Annex A.Connection between Treaty Negotiations and Recovery of Occupied Audhali and Sanah Areas.16. If the treaty negotiations were to be broken off immediately, and approval for the forcible ejection of the Zeidis from the Audhali territory and Sanah was not forthcoming, or even if it were long delayed, a most unfortunate situation would be created in the Protectorate which might rapidly become intolerable. The position of His Majesty&apos;s Government is based on treaty relations with the numerous chiefs in the Protectorate, who look to His Majesty&apos;s Government for assistance and protection against the aggressions of the Imamic forces. It is common knowledge among the Protectorate tribes that His Majesty&apos;s Government are endeavouring to secure the evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory,by negotiation, and, owing to the protracted nature of the negotiations, constant efforts have been necessary to restrain the harassed tribesmen from sporadic attempts on their own (which could not be expected to
succeed) to dislodge the invaders. If now all hope of relief by negotiations is summarily removed and no Other help appears to be forthcoming, the prestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government will be seriously, if not irreparably damaged. The situation is particularly difficult in the Audhali territory. Since 1925 the Audhali country has been under-a divided regime, the northern part being subjected to the rule of the Zeidis and the southern part remaining independent under the protection of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This state of affairs has brought about a division in the ruling family of the Audhalis. In 1926 the Audhali chief found it expedient to come to terms with the Zeidis and submit to the Imam&apos;s rule. This action was immediately repudiated by the tribesmen in the free (i.e., lower) part of the tribal territory, who elected a new Sultan, a minor for whom an uncle acts as regent. The position has lately become extremely difficult, since acts of oppression in the occupied area and of aggression into the &apos;&apos; free &apos;&apos; area have strained the patience of the Audhalis almost to breaking point. The disappearance of any hope of relief from His Majesty&apos;s Government may drive the Audhalis to some aggressive and retaliatory act which would almost certainly end in disaster, or might compel them to abandon the southern Audhali territory to the Imam, thus facilitating the latter&apos;s advance towards the sea and the consequent isolation of Aden from the north-east portion of the Protectorate.17. In reply to Parliamentary criticism of their failure to implement their treaty obligations to the chiefs of the Aden Protectorate, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have more than once declared their intention of securing the evacuation of the occupied territory by the method of negotiation. It would therefore be highly embarrassing if, having broken off the negotiations on which they had openly relied for a solution of the difficulty, His Majesty&apos;s Government were not in a position to take effective steps to carry out their treaty obligations in the Protectorate.18. It will be seen from the minutes of the meeting that the Sub-Committee (with the concurrence of Colonel Reilfy, the Resident at Aden, who was present) decided in favour of continuing negotiations. While recognising that this decision was not strictly in accordance with the decision reached in March that His Majesty&apos;s Government had said their &quot;final word,&quot; they felt that the draft treaty as submitted by the Imam (without the secret appendix relating to the Red Sea islands) was not an objectionable document, and subject to further consideration of certain of the modifications of wording desired by the Imam, would give His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment the substance of their requirements. Colonel Reilly was, however, clear that it would be useless for an envoy to visit Sanaa unless he was empowered to warn the Imam (with the certainty that his warning would in fact be imple-mented) what would in all probability be the result of a breakdown of negotiations, while the Imam remains in occupation of Protectorate territory.19. It is for these reasons that concurrent approval is felt to be essential for (1) the action recommended with regard to the continuance of the treaty negotiations, and (2) the steps to be taken in the event of those negotiations finally breaking down.Air Action.20. If force has to be employed to recover the occupied territory, it is the unanimous opinion of the Sub-Committee that bombing from the air must be authorised, after due warning, against suitable military objectives within the territory of the Imam. It is likely that the Imam would remain indifferent to the bombing of areas within the Protectorate itself, and, if forced temporarily to retire, would merely await an opportunity to repeat the invasion. On the other hand, judging from past experience, the mere threat of bombing within the Yemen might procure the evacuation of the occupied areas (as actually happened in the case of the Al Ain incident).Ground Operations.21. Again, there is nothing to expect from the efforts of the Protectorate tribes or tribal irregular levies unsupported by air action. Experience has taught that no concerted or organised attack can be hoped for from tribal levies.   Their
role must be limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action, and they cannot be relied oh even to retain unaided their hold on any recovered territory in the face of Zeidi counter-attacks. It must rest mainly with the Royal Air Force not only to &quot;clear occupied territory, but also, if necessary, to prevent reoccupation by the threat of resumption of air action.Subeihi Incursion.-22. The incursion into the Subeihi territory is in a different category from the occupation of the Audhali country. Raids from the Yemen into the south-west corner of the Protectorate have taken place in the past, but owing to the fact that sections of the tribes in this area are divided by the frontier, it has been difficult to take strong action, especially as the incursions from the Yemen have been limited in range, and, in effect, have been tax-collecting raids on tribes with a divided allegiance. But on this occasion things are on a different footing, since there has been a really serious incursion, involving penetration to and inter-ference on the coast, and the capture and removal of tribesmen and livestock. In these circumstances, the Sub-Committee agreed that the immediate protest by the Acting Resident was fully justified, and they strongly supported his recom-mendation that, if no satisfaction is forthcoming within a limited period, a threat to bomb Taiz or other military objectives within the Imam&apos;s territory in the vicinity of the disturbed area, should at once be conveyed to the Imam himself with concurrent notification to the Governor of Taiz, and should be carried out if necessary, after the usual warnings. It must be realised that for security from aggression in the frontier areas the British authorities in Aden must rely almost entirely on the prompt and effective use of the air forces available, and that unless hostile elements in the neighbourhood of the frontier are made to understand that drastic action in the form of air operations will follow any serious acts of aggression the position in the Protectorate will become untenable.Subeihi Incursion should be Treated Separately.23. The Sub-Committee were clear that the Subeihi incursion should not be linked up with the efforts to secure evacuation of the long-occupied Audhali and Sanah areas, but should be treated as an isolated act of aggression to be met by an immediate threat to bomb military objectives in the Yemen. The Resident has expressed the view that to take drastic action in the case of the Subeihi incursions will not prejudice the treaty negotiations. The Imam, he says, is responsive to the threat of air action, and if anything, it may strengthen the hands of the envoy who goes to Sanaa later in the year for the treaty negotiations.24. It will be observed that on p. 2 of the minutes at Annex A, Colonel Reilly is reported to have said that the Subeihi question was bound up with the major question of the treaty negotiations and the evacuation of Audhali territory. What Colonel Reilly had in mind was that it would be undesirable to. consider the Subeihi question by itself without having first ascertained the Sub-Committee&apos;s views on the major questions; since, if the Sub-Committee should, recommend that the treaty negotiations should be broken off at once and air action should be taken to recover the occupied Protectorate territory, the clearing up of the Subeihi situation could be linked up with the major operation. The Sub-Committee, however, decided that negotiations could be continued, and the Resident was therefore satisfied that the Subeihi question should be treated separately.Colonial Office, August 24, 1933.

(Paper No. M.E. (O.) 98.)Copy of a despatch, dated the 12th July, 1933, from Acting Resident at Aden on the subject of the continued occupation of Audhali territory within our boundaries of the Aden Protectorate by the Imam of the Yemen, together with an appreciation by the Air Officer Commanding British Forces at Aden indicating a plan of action to ensure the withdrawal from this area of Yemen forces.  (Paper No. M.E. (O.) 99.)Copy of a despatch, dated the 12th July, 1933, from the Acting Resident at Aden forwarding a copy of a letter from the Imam regarding the appointment of British representatives at Sanaa.  (Paper No. M.E. (O.) 100.)
Paraphrase copy of a telegram from the Resident at Aden, dated the 14th August, 1933, reporting an incursion by Yemen forces into the south-west portion of the Aden Protectorate, and a,sking for authority to bomb objectives in the Imam&apos;s territory in order to secure evacuation. (Paper No. M.E. (O.) 101.)THE CHAIRMAN stated that the meeting had originally been convened -to consider two questions arising out of the Acting Residents despatches of the 12th July, viz. :--(a) whether treaty negotiations with the Imam were to be pursued; and(b) the measures to be taken to secure the evacuation by the Imam&apos;s forcesof Audhali and other territory in the event of negotiations being broken off.A telegram (Paper No. M.E. (O.) 101) had, however, just been received reporting a further inroad, this time in another portion of the Aden Protectorate, and this would need urgent consideration.Incursion into Subeihi Territory.Mr. CO WELL said that this area, inhabited by the Subeihi tribe, lay in the south-western portion of the Protectorate, where the boundary with the Yemen had never actually been defined. A despatch, dated the 2nd August, 1933, had just been received referring to this question and suggesting that the delimitation of the boundary should be undertaken as soon as possible after the settlement of the Audhali question. This despatch was, however, superseded by the telegram just received., COLONEL REILLY said that while a definite boundary in this area was shown on the map, it had never been recognised by the Imam. The Subeihi were a troublesome tribe, with whom the Resident had never been in close touch. Annual incursions by Zeidis into this region had taken place, with the object of collecting taxes, which had actually been paid to the Imam. Should any modification of the boundary be discussed it was in this area that we could afford to make some concession, so long as we retained the coast line. He thought that this incursion was similar to the incident at Al Ain in 1931, when an ultimatum sent to the Imam resulted in withdrawal. This question was bound up with the major question of breaking off negotiations and the evacuation of Audhali territory.Treaty Negotiations.At the Chairman&apos;s suggestion the despatch (Paper No. M.E. (O.) 98) concerning the treaty was first considered.THE CHAIRMAN said that it was obviously impossible to .accept the secret annexe regarding the islands in the Red Sea, which had been proposed by -the Imam.   He also noted that the Imam had evaded specifying that the words &quot; southern frontier &quot; referred to the Yemen.   The other amendments, however, made by the Imam did not seem to be material.Mr. WARNER said that on these two points at any rate the Imam&apos;s, proposals were of real importance. He considered them entirely unacceptable. He pointed out that they were the latest of a long series of attempts to persuade His Majesty&apos;s Government to give way on the same two matters. He was not prepared to express an opinion as to the importance of the other alterations, proposed by the Imam without further examination in the Foreign Office.Mr. LAITHWAITE said that he agreed with Mr. Warner. The India Office were not so closely concerned in this matter as the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, and he had no doubt that the Secretary of State for India would be prepared to accept any proposals which recommended themselves to tlm departments more closely concerned. At the same time, while obviously the Residents view on the question must carry very great weight, it was only fair to point out, in the first place, that we had definitely intimated to the Imam that the communications and the draft treaty already sent to him represented our last word; that if he was not prepared to negotiate on the basis then suggested to him, negotiations must be broken off. It had also been quite definitely accepted [8968] c
in the previous discussions in the Middle East Committee that, while on general grounds a treaty settlement with the Imam was desirable, we had probably on the whole less to gain by it than the Imam; in other words, that we could afford to wait and need be in no special hurry to press for a conclusion. We had long experience in negotiation with the Imam. He had never yet met any point of importance to us; but, as the result of detailed correspondence, he continued to extract small concessions from us. Even now, while he had purported to have accepted our draft treaty as it stood, he was asking, as Mr. Champion pointed out, for certain concessions of major, importance, and was pressing us to agree in a secret annexe to a formula which would be definitely compromising from our point of view as regards the islands. Moreover, it was open to question whether we should not, by sending up an envoy to Sanaa, after the categorical statement previously made by us, and in face of failure by the Imam to accept our demands, lose a good deal of face. He did not wish to press these points, which were not primarily India Office points, but they were clearly material to any decision the Committee might take.COLONEL REILLY feared that a situation might arise in which, the negotiations having been broken off, Llis Majesty&apos;s Government might nevertheless refuse to authorise the issue of an ultimatum, to be followed, if necessary, by coercive action. We should then be faced with a deadlock in which the present unsatisfactory situation would continue to deteriorate without the prospect of a solution either by negotiations or by force. This impasse might continue for several years, and would be very damaging to us politically. Rather than risk such a possibility he would prefer to continue negotiations in spite of the Imam&apos;s obstinacy. Such an alternative was not, in his view, quite a hopeless one. With one exception the Imam&apos;s modifications of our &quot;final&quot; terms did not appear to him to be necessarily or wholly unacceptable. The exception was the secret annexe, which was quite out of the question. Apart from this, the Imam&apos;s draft treaty did not strike him as being a bad document. It was true that he rejected all words implying a recognition of the Protectorate, but if he removes the trade restrictions and adjusts the boundaries as desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government, as he promised to do at the end of his letter, we shall have gained substantial advantages and an acknowledgment of the Protectorate in fact though not in name. On a strict construction of the letter sent to the Imam on the 11th April, it was not, he considered, essential that the trade restrictions should be raised before our envoy, if despatched, proceeded to Sanaa, but they must be raised before the treaty was actually concluded.He thought that if the Acting Residents recommendations for the breaking off of a treaty, to be followed by an ultimatum, were accepted in their entirety well and good; and he was in favour of going forward on these lines. Rut if there was to be any doubt or delay about the ultimatum and the recourse to force, he was inclined to close with the Imam&apos;s draft, minus the secret annexe, and subject to the removal of trade restrictions and the restoration of Protectorate territory and prisoners.Should this alternative be approved of, he thought that the best course would be for a British envoy to go to Sanaa to attempt to conclude a treaty on this basis. If the Imam proved refractory about the secret annexe or failed to remove the trade restrictions and to restore the territory and prisoners, or if he raises fresh obstacles, the envoy should be empowered to break off negotiations, and at the same time to inform the Imam of the probable consequences, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to allow him to remain indefinitely in occupation of what they regard as Protectorate territory and that, failing a peaceful withdrawal on his part, they would find it necessary to eject him by force. Unless the envoy was armed with this authority he thought further negotiations would be of no value.He hoped that a definite decision would be given on the above alternatives and that in any case negotiations would not be broken off without an assurance that forcible action would be taken to recover the areas now held by the Imam&apos;s forces.Mr. WARNER observed that the Residents letter to the Imam of the 11th April was to have been His Majesty&apos;s Governments last word. It had been sent in accordance with a definite decision that if the Imam did not accept it in toto negotiations were to cease.   The Imam had nevertheless proposed certain
material alterations in the text of the treaty. He had also refused to raise the trade embargo, a step which His Majesty&apos;s Government had insisted should precede any continuance of the negotiations. If the Sub-Committee&apos; now recommended that in spite of his attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government should continue negotiations and even send an envoy to Sanaa, they should realise clearly that they were recommending a complete&quot;reversal of the previous decision. They should also consider whether such a step would not be considered a sign of weakness by the Imam, indeed &quot; a climb-down,&quot; whether it would not merely encourage him to think His Majesty&apos;s Government were very anxious to make a treaty and would go on giving way indefinitely. He did not think that the Foreign Office would wish to oppose such a recommendation, if it was advocated by the Sub-Committee, in the light of the Resident&apos;s views and of somewhat changed circumstances; but it was important that there should be no misunder-standing as to the complete reversal of policy which would be involved and the possible consequences.Mr. LAITHWAITE expressed his agreement with Mr. Warner&apos;s views. Was it contemplated that we should secure a specific withdrawal of the proposal for a secret annexe as a condition of any visit by the Resident ?COLONEL REILLY proposed that the Acting Resident at Aden should inform the Imam in a letter that on no account could the secret annexe be considered, and also refer to the fact that he had agreed to comply with the contents of the admonitory document, i.e., our demands, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government expected this to be done before the Treaty was signed.Mr. GRIEVE said that he was in favour of the second alternative proposed by Colonel Reilly, i.e., the continuation of negotiations by the despatch of an envoy to Sanaa. He did not think that any loss of face would result from accepting the wording now proposed by the Imam, which gave us materially all we asked for. Should negotiations be broken off, and not followed up by&quot; any coercive measures, there would be no finality, and merely a more frequent recurrence of inroads. He asked to what extent the Imam had control over his subordinate governors, who were, possibly, the originators of these raids.COLONEL REILLY said that from experience he had found that the Imam had effective control over his local officers, who acted on his instructions certainly , as regards all major matters.GROUP CAPTAIN HARRIS thought that the plan of action proposed in paragraph 12 (ii) of the appreciation by the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden would be successful, and should secure lasting results. The plan proposed in paragraph 12 (i) of that appreciation was unsound for the reasons therein given and should not therefore be attempted. He insisted that it was necessary for the Royal Air Force to be allowed to take action against military objectives in Imamic territory, after the usual local warnings had been given. He thought it would be a great mistake to detail the selected objectives in the actual ultimatum.   They must be free to select them as the operations proceeded.By bombing military objectives within Imamic territory the Imam could be made anxious even about Sanaa. His anxiety about Sanaa was a very material factor in the speedy and successful issue of the Dhala operations in 1928.He was of the opinion that the longer the existing state of affairs persisted,, the bigger would be the effort eventually required to turn out the Zeidis should negotiations break down. For nine years the Audhalis had had to rest content with assurances, there were signs that both their patience and their co-operation could not be counted upon indefinitely and that their ardour might wane.COLONEL REILLY said that from his experience of the Dhala operation in 1928, when air action against forts and places well within the Imam&apos;s territory had been effective, the threat of air action would act as a deterrent and prevent future incursions. He pointed out that the area round Rada, one of the suggested objectives, was inhabited by Zeidis, who were of the Imam&apos;s own sect. Action against them would, therefore, probably be the most effective way of bringing pressure to bear. He thought that the air action suggested would succeed in clearing the Audhali country and regaining control. The Audhalis, however, could not be relied upon to hold this tract against the Zeidis without the aid of air action. w
^ LIEUT.-COLONEL HENDERSON said that the War Office were in favour of negotiations being continued and any&apos; precipitate action avoided. Their reasons were that they did hot feel happy regarding the proposed use of Arab tribal levies, which had been proved unreliable. The War Office had information that the Imam had a fairly powerful and efficient fighting force, consisting of some 12,500 regular troops, with some 30,000 armed tribesmen, equipped with armoured cars, machine guns, artillery and aircraft. Should the Imam show fight and take counter-measures, a big commitment might be involved.COLONEL ISMAY hoped that too much would not be expected of the tribal force that it was proposed to employ. Forces of this kind were occasionally useful in following up after a successful attack, and collecting any loot that might be available, but they were generally valueless for any military operations in the proper sense of that term, and it would be optimistic to expect them to remain in effective occupation of a captured area for any appreciable time. It was, he suggested, a pity to incur implicit responsibility for scallywags of this kind by employing a British officer to &apos;&apos; control and direct &apos;&apos; them, but he presumed that the military phraseology employed in the appreciation was not intended to be taken too literally.GROUP-CAPTAIN HARRIS said that the Air Ministry did not regard the tribal levies other than as &quot; moppers-up,&quot; to enter and re-occupy territory as the Zeidis withdrew. He pointed out that this was clearly indicated in the selected plan. The Air Ministry deprecated the use of levies and irregulars as the main attack for precisely the reasons advanced by Colonel Ismay. It was the air attack on objectives in Imamic territory upon which they relied to induce the Imam to order a withdrawal, and his forces to commence one. The tribal levies would be used to follow up the withdrawal.COLONEL RE ILLY observed that in the Dhala operation of 1928, the friendly Arabs did put up an effective resistance to Zeidi counter-attack. After the country is occupied these tribesmen must undoubtedly dissolve and revert to their normal occupations. This was, in his opinion, a further argument that the Air Force must have authority to attack targets outside our own borders, which was the really effective counter-measure.THE CHAIRMAN stated that the general feeling of the meeting appeared, to be in favour of continuing negotiations, but,that if these cannot be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, it will be necessary to take action against the Imam to compel the evacuation of the Audhali and other territory of the Protectorate now held by him. It was, in the view of the Sub-Committee, essential that this action should be taken against targets in Zeidi territory. It was necessary to lay the whole case before Ministers, and he proposed to ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies for a decision as to whether this question should be laid before the Ministerial Committee or await a meeting of the Cabinet.As regards the recent incursion into Subeihi territory, it might perhaps be thought that air action would be covered by the Cabinet decision of 1926, to the effect that the Imam should be warned that retaliatory measures would be taken to prevent incursions; but he was clear that, in present circumstances, reference to Ministers was necessary.Mr. WARNER explained that he could not commit the Foreign Office on this point. In any case, if it were decided to take forcible action against the Imam, it would be necessary to notify the Italian Government beforehand and explain the circumstances. Relations between Ibn Saud and the Imam were at present very strained; Ibn Saud had appealed to His Majesty&apos;s Government for -assistance, which they were unable to give, but His Majesty&apos;s Government had made representations to the Italian Government on the basis of the understanding reached in Rome in 1927, under which the two Governments agreed (1) to do their utmost to prevent conflicts between Ibn Saud and the Imam, and (2) in case of such a conflict not to intervene. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were suddenly to take forcible action against the Yemen, such action might well be misunder-stood in Rome as a form of intervention on behalf of Ibn Saud. It was the more necessary to explain matters to the Italian Government before any ultimatum was delivered to the Imam, in that a precisely similar situation had arisen in
1931, when. His Majesty&apos;s Government presented him with an ultimatum to evacuate Al Ain when relations between him and Ibn Saud were strained. Prior explanations had then been given to the Italian-Government.Conclusions. The Sub-Committee agreed (1) (a) That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam; provided the envoy is previously authorised, should the Imam prove obdurate -(i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to reach agreement; that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not any longer tolerate the presence of Zeidi forces in territory which His Majesty&apos;s Government claim for the Aden Protectorate; and that if negotiations are broken off, His Majesty&apos;s Government will in all probability feel compelled to assert forcibly their rights in Audhali, and other territory occupied by Zeidi forces.(ii) To break off negotiations.Note. In point of fact, it is hoped that if the Resident is placed in a position to make a statement of this kind it will clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action for clearing the Audhali territory, but the envoy must have an assurance that, if necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government will use force to clear the Audhali country and other areas in the Protectorate occupied by Zeidi forces, as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after the negotiations are broken off.(6) That while continuance of negotiations for a treaty may be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense, from the instructions approved earlier in the year to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had said their last word, the Imam&apos;s letter can be accepted as a sufficient, advance to justify the Acting Resident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa, on his return in the autumn, for the purpose of concluding a treaty; but that in order that there may be no misapprehension-hension, the Imam must understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government require the trade restrictions to be raised and the other preliminaries laid down in the Resident&apos;s admonitory note to be carried out before the treaty is actually signed, and that while the Resident will be prepared to discuss matters of wording in the text of the treaty proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot be agreed to in any form.(c) That in the event of action becoming necessary for the recovery ofAudhali territory, it is essential that authority should be given for bombing, after the usual warnings, suitable military objectives within Imamic territory, and that we must not be limited to local action in the friendly Audhali territory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary.(d) That in any scheme for forcible recovery of territory occupied by Zeidiforces, it would not be possible to rely upon irregular tribal levies to cany out an organised attack; that their role should be limited to temporary occupation of territory when cleared by air action; and that it Avill in the main rest Avith the Royal Air Force not, only to clear territory occupied by Zeidi forces, but also, if necessary, to prevent reoccupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air . action against military objectives in the Imam&apos;s territory.(e) That the Resident should have discretion to discuss and accept verbalamendments in the text of the treaty, but that the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office should consider whether any of the particular amendments now suggested by the Imam must be objected to. :   j.h
(2)-(a) That as regards the incursion by Zeidi forces into the Subeihi country referred to in the Acting Residents telegram of the 14th August, 1933 (Paper No. M.E. (O) 101), the Acting Resident should be authorised to despatch an ultimatum to the Imam, concurrently with a notification to the Governor of Taiz, demanding withdrawal and restoration of the prisoners and loot, to be followed in the event of non-compliance by air action, after the usual local warnings, against Taiz or other suitable military objectives within the Imam&apos;s territory in the vicinity of the disturbed area.(b) That the Foreign Office should take the necessary steps to advise theItalian Government of recent events in the Subeihi country, and the action which it is proposed to take.(c) That action in connection with the incursion into the Subeihi country should be taken at the earliest possible moment, allowing the minimum necessary time for the delivery of an ultimatum to the Imam and of notification to the Italian Government.(3) That the Colonial Office should take the instructions of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Chairman of the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East, whether the action to be taken on the despatches and telegram from the Acting Resident under discussion should be submitted to the Ministerial Sub-Committee or to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, August 15, 1933.ANNEX B.- 17957/33 [No. 52]., The Acting Resident to the Secretary of State.

(Received July 24, 1933.)(Secret.)

The Imam &quot;completely and wholly accepts&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s draft of the Treaty, and states that he will comply with the terms of Colonel Reilly&apos;s letter of the 11th April, 1933, and of the Note (or &quot; admonitory document&quot;) annexed thereto; he then characteristically submits a new draft that embodies three major modifications and ten minor amendments of His Majesty&apos;s Governments final terms, and concludes his letter with a sentence that means that he has no present intention of removing the restrictions on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate until the Treaty has been signed.3.

(ii) In Article V (1) the Imam has reverted to the text of his draft ofSeptember 1930 by re-wording, &quot; . ... and shall receive equal treatment to that enjoyed by the subjects of a most favoured Power.&quot; He has, nevertheless, retained the suggestion of national treatment in the words &quot; shall be amenable to the local laws and judgments &quot; (cf., paragraph 3 of Colonel Reilly&apos;s Secret despatch No. 157 of the 17th August, 1932*).(iii) Drawing (as he says) an inference from paragraph &quot;6 of ColonelReilly&apos;s letter of the 11th April, the Imam has put forward a new secret Article, complementary to Article III, in which he seeks to bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to formal (if covert) recognition of his reversionary interests in the Islands of the Yemen, to the definite furtherance of those interests, and to abstention from connivance in the violation of his &quot;fundamental rights &quot; in that respect.4.   The ten minor amendments referred to are as follows : (i) Article I. The Imam desires the additions of the words &quot; and HisGovernment&quot; after the words &quot;India&quot; and &quot;Yemen&quot; respectively. I conceive that he fears the impermanence of human affairs, and especially of his own, and hopes by these means to secure the Treaty from the accidents of political change.(ii) Article IV. The Imam, in an obscure comment based on a play uponwords,  argues  that  international  practice  is  inferior  to  the. international principles by which it is governed; and he deletes the former word.(iii) Article V (1). For reasons not explained, the words &quot; From the dateof the coming into force of the present Treaty &quot; are omitted from the Imam&apos;s draft.(iv) For the words &quot; . .&apos; . . subjects of the one High Contracting party. . . .,&quot; the Imam proposes &quot; . . . . subjects of each of the High Contracting parties . . . .&quot; (v) To the words &quot; . . . . local laws &quot; the Imam adds &quot; and judgments.&quot; (vi) Article V (2). As in (iv) above.(vii) The Imam omits the words &quot; and passengers &quot; for the reason that, in his view, foreign passengers in a British vessel could (according to His Majesty&apos;s Governments draft) claim equal treatment with British subjects in a Yemeni port, (viii) The words &quot;of the territories &quot; are omitted in the Imam&apos;s draft, on the somewhat obscure grounds that &quot; coasts which have no terri-tories have no ports.&quot; This argument is so unintelligible that its intention is far to seek; and I am inclined to think that the Imam hesitates to accept here a possible implication that the Protectorate is British territory, i.e., that Aden is a port of the (British) Protectorate.(ix) Article V (3). The Imam omits the whole of this clause of definition, for the ostensible reason that &quot; the interpretation of the meaning of the texts of Articles in Treaties is unusual.&quot; Here again I presume that the Imam&apos;s motive is the rejection of any reference in the Treaty to our protective obligations and position in the Protectorate.(x) A rticle VII. The Imam, while accepting the conclusion of the Treaty in bilingual texts, insists that the Arabic text shall be the basis for subsequent interpretation of any of its clauses.5. My appreciation of the Imam&apos;s present attitude is that, preoccupied by events in Najran and by negotiations with the Sa&apos;udi Mission at Sana&apos;a in that connexion, worried by Italian demands for a financial settlement, and harassed by his own ill-health and the uncertainties of the succession, he has taken the line of utmost caution and has subjected His Majesty&apos;s Governments draft of the Treaty to the very closest search to discover the remotest potentialities of danger to his interests. That he has carried this policy to an extreme, in the present instance, may indicate the existence of influences at Sana&apos;a, both foreign and local, that are hostile to the Treaty and are working on the suspicions of a sick and aged man.* No. C 97S57/32 ;No..l70J.
6. However that may be, the fact is that there is little in the Imam&apos;s present communication to indicate that, he has made any real advance towards reconciliation. On the contrary, and in spite of the ve*fy explicit statement of the finality of His Majesty&apos;s Governments conditions, conveyed to him in Colonel Reilly&apos;s letter of the 11th April, 1933, he seems almost to have gone out of his way to throw up new obstacles to a settlement; and he has refused to relax his determination to continue to enforce the restrictions on overland trade, pending signature of the Treaty.7. In these circumstances it seems clear that no good purpose can be served by a continuance of inconclusive bargaining, and in accordance with the sense of the instructions contained in your telegram No. 10 of the 25th March, 1933,* I would propose to inform the Imam that in view of his refusal to remove the overland trade restrictions until the Treaty is signed, I have been instructed to suspend further correspondence and negotiations with him in regard to the Treaty.8. I am recommending to you in a separate despatch the desirability for armed intervention to restore to the &apos;Audhali Sultan that part of his territory (Adh Dhahir) which is occupied by the Imam, and to effect the release of &apos; Audhali hostages how in Zeidi hands. In confining the reasons for the suspension of Treaty negotiations solely to the Imam&apos;s refusal to remove the trade restrictions, I have in mind the consideration that any adverse criticism, to the effect that the Treaty will have been pressed on the Imam by threat of force, may be adequately met by the clear separation of the two issues; for while the suspension of negotiations for the establishment of friendly relations is justified by the Imam&apos;s persistence in an unfriendly act in the form of the Trade Embargo, the deliverance of the territories and tribes of the &apos;Audhali Sultan (which His Majesty&apos;s Government are bound by treaty to protect) from eight years of armed and oppressive Zeidi domination, is in itself an act of justice, which is overdue, and which will become opportune on the breakdown (for other reasons) of the Treaty negotiations with the Imam.9. If these &apos;Audhali operations are approved, their successful conclusion may be expected to impress the Imam with the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are determined to safeguard their legitimate interests in the Aden Protectorate; and it may facilitate a solution of the embargo problem. Otherwise, it is probable that the suspension of the Treaty negotiations will result in a prolonged deadlock, to the detriment of British prestige in south-west Arabia generally, and to the prejudice of peace and material prosperity in the Aden Protectorate particularly.10. I therefore request that these considerations may have your favourable attention and that I may receive your instructions at an early date in regard to my communication of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Imam. In the meantime I have not replied to the Imam&apos;s letter.I have, &amp;c.R. S. CHAMPION,Acting Resident, &amp;c.* No. 17957/33 [No. 27].Enclosure.In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.(Seal of the Imam.)To Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly,, ; Resident, Aden.(After Compliments.). WE beg to acknowledge with pleasure your esteemed letter No. C/206 dated the 16th April, 1933 (16th Dhul Hijja 1351) which we have carefully perused and considered. We understand from the present situation, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are reluctant to grant us our demands by reason of some wrong impression they may be entertaining towards us.   We have been making repeated
insistence on some points Only in order to secure certain particular demands which we considered to be very essential for us. : His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the other hand, have not been able to check themselves from suspicions and doubts that the object of our persistence is the intention on our part to take some action prejudicial to the aims and important interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government, after the conclusion of the Treaty.We wish to give you now a further assurance that the history - of our Government is free from the stigma of treachery and the breaking of engagements and promises. It is, thanks to God, completely and wholly innocent of this. We most confidently assert that we are the one Nation which has not violated its engagements, neither during this regime, nor throughout all the time of its existence in the world, although we are utterly poor and weak. The pages of history are seen by all. After the conclusion of the Treaty and the establishment of friendly relations, we are prepared to maintain all its direct and indirect objects. We will never act against one who is in treaty and friendly relations with us. We boast of our sincerity; in the beginning and in the end, and we deem it desirable to submit this preamble in confirmation, although it is not necessary to do so. We consider that the submission of these representations to His Majesty&apos;s Government now, before the commencement of the Treaty that is to be concluded, will serve a useful purpose. Having made this essential preface there is something which we feel bound to say. We tender and express our thankfulness to our honourable correspondent, Colonel Reilly, for his good will, skill, zeal, and intelligence, of which we are certain from beginning to end. and for his continued praiseworthy deed. It is the nature of the Yemenis to regard or esteem one who maintains friendship towards them and to express their undoubted thankfulness to one loyal to them.Colonel Reilly! Firstly, the draft Treaty that you have sent on this occasion has been completely and wholly accepted.Secondly, it has been decided by us to comply with your esteemed letter, together with the contents of the admonitory document annexed thereto.Thirdly, we hasten to explain to your Excellency that it is our intention utterly to prevent every obstruction and contravention, by the Grace of God.Fourthly, we therefore request your Excellency kindly to complete the means for the signing of the Treaty.We have, however, made an addition only of the words &quot; and His Govern-ment,&quot; in Article I of the Treaty, as it is absolutely necessary for both contracting parties.In the important Article III we consider the sentence, &quot; of the territories of His Majesty the King of the Yemen,&quot; to be superfluous and unnecessary, because this Treaty that is being concluded, basically concerns the territories of the Yemen, and the text of the Treaty has no concern with other than the Yemen and Great Britain.We also consider that there is no necesity for the inclusion of the phrase, &apos;&apos; or by persons under their protection,&quot; in the said Article, because the undertaking by each of the two parties to prevent transgression by any person of those on his side is complete and guaranteed.Article IV is accepted, with the exception of the word &apos;&apos; practice,&quot; which we consider unnecessary; for there is no &quot;custom&quot; in International Law, but the &quot;practice&quot; of the said Law implies its fundamental and exclusive principle.We have been compelled to omit the word &apos;&apos; passengers,&quot; in Article V because &quot;passengers&quot; naturally include different kinds and origins of people, and comprise subjects of various nations. It is obvious that all passengers in general cannot be considered to be British subjects, for surely there may be among the passengers some of the subjects of other Governments, while in fact the Treaty concerns the British Government. We have no intention to make a pact in respect of all Powers in general. Passengers are subject to certain particular regulations and are not normally to be included in such a pact.We have also omitted the word &quot;territories&quot; from the said Article because the coasts which have no &quot; territories &quot; have no &quot;ports.&quot; We have made the form of the Article to coincide with the form adopted between Powers in such a matter.Moreover, we do not conceive that there is any necessity at all for interpreting the meanings of the words and expressions used in Article V (3), in Sub-sections (a), (6), and (c); for the interpretation of the meaning of the texts of Articles in Treaties is unusual.   We accept the said meanings as they stand and we do not
conceive that they can bear any meaning other than that mentioned and explained by your Excellency.This is all what we have done. We have no doubt that your Excellency will receive these explanations favourably because they completely conform with right principles and the science of eloquence.Meanwhile, in addition to this, we have made, in a separate document, a secret appendix to the Treaty agreed upon; and this we have compiled from the inferences and implications of the important reference explained in paragraph 6 of your esteemed letter. We undertake on the part of the Yemen not to disclose or publish this secret appendix in any way or manner, or by any means. This secret appendix will convince and serve as an assurance to us, and will be the absolute cause of our reaching permanent agreement with full confidence in His Majesty&apos;s Government in every respect.We are certain that His Majesty&apos;s Government will after the conclusion of the Treaty, find us to be most friendly and sincere to them, and the ill intentions and evil objects of those who were the cause of mistrust will be proved; and there will be repentance for what happened by the Grace of God.In the circumstances explained we anxiously await your Excellency&apos;s return to your high post from England in October next, in sound health, and bearing these demands. We shall be extremely grateful if you will hasten your coming to us to complete and sign the Treaty. By the mere (or immediately on) signing of the Treaty, the restrictions will be removed and the boundaries adjusted as desired by you, in a fit and proper way.In conclusion we request you to accept our best compliments.Dated Safar 25, 1933 (June 20, 1933).Draft Treaty. (Submitted by the Imam.)Preamble.His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India on the one part, andHis Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam, on the other part.Being desirous of entering into a treaty on a basis of friendship and co-operation for their mutual benefit.Have resolved to conclude this Treaty and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries :His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India.For Great Britain and Northern Ireland :His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam :Who, having communicated their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed as follows :  Article I.His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India and His Government acknowledge the complete and absolute independence of His Majesty the King of the Yemen, the Imam, and His Government in all affairs of whatsoever kind.Article II.There shall always, be peace and friendship between the High Contracting Parties, who undertake to maintain good relations with each other in every respect.

[Received July 24, 1933.)(Secret.) (No. 163.)Sir, The Residency, Aden, July 12, 1933.I HAVE the honour to refer to Lieutenant-Colonel Reilly&apos;s Secret despatch No. 83 of the 12th April, 1933,* on the subject of treaty negotiations with the Yemen.2. The Imam has now replied to Colonel Reilly&apos;s communication to him of the 11th April, 1933, in a sense that indicates his rejection of the text that had been laid before him clearly as the final terms acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government. He has also refused to agree to the present removal of trade restrictions on the frontier, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have insisted on as a condition of the continuance of negotiations; and I have recommended to you in a separate despatch! in that connexion that the negotiations should be broken off for that reason.3. The suspension of these negotiations is likely to result in a deadlock, and I fear that the situation may continue to drift indefinitely in the sense suggested by Colonel Reilly in his demi-official letter to Mr. Cowell of the 15th February, 1933. \4. The fact of such a suspension will certainly have a serious reaction on the attitude of the &apos; Audhali Sultan, in regard to whom there has lately been increasing justification for alarm lest his accumulated grievances against the, Imam, for the harsh treatment that he and his tribesmen have received and continue to receive at Zeidi hands, may drive him to some aggressive and retaliatory act. For although it has been the consistent practice of the Residency during the past eight years to exhort and advise the &apos; Audhali Sultan to hold his hands in patience, and to rely on the peaceful measures that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been adopting to effect the restoration of his territory and tribesmen, his forbearance, strained by years of unsatisfied complaint, has lately been brought to breaking point by the immoderate and oppressive acts of the Zeidi Amil of Al Beldha, in the &apos; Audhali region on Adh Dhahir that is occupied by the Imam.5. The Sultan has hitherto loyally, if reluctantly, complied with our wishes, and has acted as correctly as could have been expected under very exasperating conditions; and the Political Secretary&apos;s task of attempting to satisfy his frequent invocations of his Treaty of Protection has not been free from embarrassment. In order that the justification for the Sultan&apos;s complaints may be more fully appreciated I enclose herewith a summary of the incidents upon which they are based.6. It is not to be thought that I anticipate the launching of an organised attack by the &apos;Audhali Sultan on Zeidi forces on Adh Dhahir against our wishes and without our support: he fully realizes that he could not carry it to success. What I fear is that as the result of further hostile or slighting Zeidi acts, and of his final comprehension that the Treaty negotiations in which he has doubtfully relied to recover his rights have been suspended, he may either precipitate open hostilities on the border by incautious intrigues or by raids, or retire with all the loyal members of the ruling family, and leave his territory open to occupation by the Imam.* No. 17957/33 [No. 40]. t No 17d57/33 [No. 52]. - J No. 17957/33 [No. 7].
7. The danger of the latter alternative is accentuated by the presence on Adh Dhahir and in close relations with the Zeidi Amil of Al Beidha, of the family of the previous &apos; Audhali Sultan, who was murdered by the present incumbent in 1928. As a result of this murder a bitter feud exists between the two branches of the family. It is, moreover, important to consider that Zeidi occupation of the south-eastern &apos;Audhali territory below Adh Dhahir would give the Imam comparatively easy access to the sea, and would facilitate the isolation from Aden of the Haderamaut, Beihan, the Wahidi, and the three &apos;Aulaqi regions (which supply the majority of, and the best, recruits for the Aden Protectorate Levies and the Aden Armed Police).8. For the reasons outlined above the necessity for compelling Zeidi evacuation of occupied Protectorate territory has become increasingly apparent. As there is little prospect, either now or in the near future, of fulfilling our protective obligations to the &apos;Audhali Sultan by peaceful means, I have considered it desirable to examine in detail a scheme of operations for the expulsion of Zeidi forces from Adh Dhahir and for the restoration of &apos; Audhali hostages who are still in the Imam&apos;s hands. I enclose herewith an Appreciation by the Officer Commanding British Forces at Aden in this connexion, with which I concur, and a Note of the action contemplated to be taken by the political staff of the Residency in connexion with the scheme, and of the financial commitments that are likely to involve a charge on political funds.9. I desire to draw special attention to two considerations that affect the situation. Firstly, as the Officer Commanding British Forces at Aden has rightly pointed out in paragraph 6 (i) of his Appreciation, and for the reasons suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this despatch, it is likely that the longer the operations are deferred the greater will be the effort and expense necessary to carry them to a successful conclusion. Secondly, the present preoccupation of the Imam in his attempt to subjugate Najraii (in part or in whole) and the engagement of some 10,000 of his troops in that distant area (vide Political Intelligence Summary, paragraphs 2367, 2395, 2411 and 2425), and the imminent breakdown of treaty negotiations with the Imam by reason of his refusal to raise the trade embargo on the Protectorate frontier, would appear to indicate the desirability of under-taking these operations in the &apos; Audhali area at the earliest possible opportunity after the suspension of negotiations.10. As I have suggested in my despatch No. 162 of the 12th July, 1933,* on the subject of the proposed Treaty with the Imam, the impending suspension of the present negotiations, in the manner that I have recommended, provides a good opportunity for His Majesty&apos;s Government to undertake these operations without appearing to press a treaty on the Imam by force of arms.11. I am of the opinion that the matter is one of some urgency, and I therefore request that it may receive your early attention. ;I have, &amp;c.R. S. CHAMPION,Acting Resident, &amp;c.* So. 17957/33 [No. .r2J.Enclosure 1.-Summary of Events in &apos;Audhali Territory since the Occupation by the Imam of Adh Dhahir in 1925, indicative of Imamic Interference in &apos;Audhali Affairs:May, 1926. The Shaikh of Al Beidha, on behalf of the Imam&apos;s repre-sentative, offered to give a monthly subsidy of $120/- to the then &apos; Audhali Sultan, &quot;Qasim bin Ahmed, and his nephew, Qasim bin &apos;Abdulla, on condition that the Sultan should hand over half the revenue acquired from crops in Al Kor, and allow 5 Zeidi officials to be present at the harvesting of the crops.December, 1926. The &apos;Audhali Sultan forwarded letters to the Residency Office, in which the &apos;Amil and the Shaikh of Al Beidha invited him to go to Al Beidha and submit to the Imam.
September, 1928. The &apos; Audhali Sultan, who was pro-Imam, was assassinated by his cousin, Sultan Husein bin Ja&apos;bil, who, with his brother Muhammad Ja&apos;bil, was very hostile to Zeidi influence.The son of the assassin, a boy of 8, named Salih, was elected Sultan, with his father and uncle as regents.The son of the late Sultan, Ahmed, and the late Sultan&apos;s nephew, Qasim bin &apos;Abdulla, with his brothers, formed a rival party to the new Sultan and his father and uncle, and with their followers besieged localities in the close vicinity of the new Sultan&apos;s village of Az Zara.December, 1928. The &apos;Audhali Sultan drove his rival relations from these localities, and they occupied Lodar, the market town, about 1 mile distant from Az Zara.February, 1929. The rival faction at Lodar were assisted by the &apos;Amil of Al Beidha with money, ammunition, and men against the &apos; Audhali Sultan.September, 1929. The &apos;Audhali Sultan attacked Lodar and occupied it. The rival faction betook themselves to &apos;Iryab on Adh Dhabir and came under the control of the Imam.During the next year complaints were received from the &apos;Audhali Sultan that Sultan Qasim bin &apos;Abdulla was receiving money from the &apos;Amil of Al Beidha to stir up certain sections of Al Kor tribes to make trouble.October, 1930. Reports were received that the &apos;Amil of Al Beidha was interfering with the &apos;Useili section of the Ahl &apos;Audhilla and trying to collect taxes from them.March, 1931. Reports were received that Sultan Qasim bin &apos;Abdulla, instigated by the &apos; Amilqf Al Beidha, was interfering with Ahl Bura&apos;a, an &apos; Audhali sub-section on the western border of Al Kor, and had plundered livestock. A letter of protest from the Residency brought no satisfaction; and the &apos; Amil of Al Beidha claimed Ahl Bura&apos;a as being part of Ahl Barkan under his control, and on his part, complained against the &apos;Audhali Sultan for interfering with &apos;Audhali tribesmen who were under the control of the Imam. The Residency expressed the intention not to interfere between the &apos;Audhali Sultan and his own subjects and made it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not recognize the right of the Imam to occupy &apos;Audhali territory.July, 1932. The &apos;Amil of Al Beidha, under orders from the Imam, closed the route through &apos;Audhali territory to trade from Al Beidha to Aden. At the same time, the &apos;Amil, on his own initiative, entered into a trade agreement with the Lower Yafa&apos;i Sultan, who is in treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment, for the safe conveyance of trade through Yafa&apos;i territory.October, 1932. Under pressure from the Residency, the Lower Yafa&apos;i Sultan cancelled the above agreement, and this fact, coupled with the prevention of caravans for Al Beidha from leaving Aden, compelled the &apos;Amil to reopen the &quot;Audhali route.March, 1933. Renewed complaints by the &apos;Audhali Sultan of raids by Imamic tribesmen on eastern sub-sections of the &apos;Audhali tribe.April, 1933. Reports from the &apos;Audhali Sultan of increased oppression on &apos;Audhali tribesmen under Imamic control, by the &apos;Amil of Al Beidha.May, 1933. The Amil of Al Beidha sent a letter to the Shaikh of the Ahl Daman, of Al Kor, under &apos; Audhali control, to pay a visit to him to Al Beidha to discuss the matter of certain Imamic refugees who were living with him. The Damani Shaikh agreed, and on arrival at Al Beidha was offered a monthly subsidy if he would submit to the Imam.  The Shaikh refused and returned home.The &apos;Amil of Al Beidha arrested 10 &apos;Audhali Shaikhs from Adh Dhahir &apos; Audhali sections, and imprisoned them in chains.July, 1933. A small party of tribesmen from Adh Dhahir, actuated by a local family feud, but instigated and assisted by Zeidi officials, descended on to-Al Kor from Adh Dhahir and attacked two villages.General, The continued alienation of the most fertile part of the &apos;Audhali Sultan&apos;s territories under oppressive Zeidi control, notwithstanding the-protective clause in the Treaty between the &apos;Audhali Sultan and His Majesty&apos;s Government.The continued retention of a number of &apos;Audhalis as hostages by the Imam.-
Enclosure 2.(Secret.)An Appreciation of the Military Measures required to Restore to the &quot;Audhali&quot; Tribe the Portion of their Territory on Adh Dhahir Plateau at present in &quot;Zeidi&quot; Occupation, dated 24*A June, 1933, by Group-Captain 0. T. Boyd, O.B.E., M.C., A.F.C., Officer Commanding, British Forces at Aden, for the Chief Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief, Aden.Review of the Situation.1. In 1925, in furtherance of a policy of encroachment on the Aden Protectorate which had been pursued almost continuously by the Imam of the Yemen since the end of the &quot;War of 1914-18, Zeidi forces occupied tribal territory belonging to the &apos;Audhali both in Adh Dhahir on the top of Al Kor, and in Al Hadhn below. They were, however, driven back by tribal action, with the assistance of three Bristol Fighter aircraft of the Aden Flight based on Shuqra. Air operations were confined to the bombing of Zeidi troops in Adh Dhahir and the Zeidi headquarters in Al Hadhn in the villages of Az Zara and Lodar, and ceased as soon as both areas had been cleared of the invaders. Within two days of the withdrawal of the air support, the Zeidi forces successfully reoccupied Adh Dhahir, and the &apos;Audhali tribesmen retired to Al Hadhn at the foot of Al Kor owing, so they alleged at the time, to a lack of ammunition and supplies. The Zeidi reoccupation stopped short at the crest of Al Kor, leaving Al Hadhn in the hands of the &apos; Audhali Sultan.2. The indecisive result of these operations appears to have been due to the following causes : (i) Aircraft had only short range and small bomb carrying capacity, (ii) Insufficient aircraft were available.(iii) Lack of advanced landing grounds Shuqra only being available.(iv) Lack of tribal co-operation.  No British Officer was sent to control andco-ordinate the operations of the tribesmen, nor was wireless telegraphy or any other adequate method of communication between the &apos;Audhalis and Aden available, (v) The aircraft did not strike far enough back, with the result that the Imam, who was too remote to feel the effects of the bombing, was in no way deterred from ordering the reoccupation of &apos;Audhali territory at the first opportunity.3. Since 1925 the Zeidis have remained in occupation of Adh Dhahir Plateau, their forces being based on Al Beidha, the chief town of a district with which, although within the de jure boundary of the Aden Protectorate, we have never made a treaty. The &apos; Audhali tribesmen of the occupied area, who are at heart loyal to the &apos; Audhali Sultan (with the notable exception of the near relations of his predecessor, and their small following), have been disarmed and are subjected to the severest oppression and maltreatment by the Zeidi authorities in Al Beidha in the endeavour to force them to recognize the permanent authority of the Imam. The Zeidis also hope by such means to force the &apos;Audhali Sultan, who now resides in Az Zara at the foot of Al Kor, to break his treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government and to transfer his allegiance to the Imam.4. The strain is already telling on the tribesmen of Adh Dhahir, and both they and the &apos; Audhali Sultan realize that they are dependent on British assistance if the occupied territory is to be freed from the Zeidi yoke. The Sultan is, how-ever, disappointed and disheartened by the fact that such assistance has not yet been forthcoming.The Aim to be Attained.5.   To compel the Imam of the Yemen to withdraw all Zeidi forces from &quot;&apos; Audhali territory on Adh Dhahir Plateau.
Factors affecting the Attainment of the Aim.6.   Time anal Space. (i) The situation is rapidly approaching a point where fresh developments are almost inevitable, and unless we are prepared to assist the &apos; Audhali such developments may eventually have very adverse effects on the rest of the Aden Protectorate, and may necessitate a greater military effort than is now required.(ii) Weather conditions in the spring normally bring about the formation of heavy cloud masses over Adh Dhahir plateau and the edge of Al Kor, which would seriously impede both air and ground operations. During the summer and autumn meteorological conditions are generally favourable.(iii) Adh Dhahir Plateau is situated approximately 100 miles from aden and 5 miles from Lodar the capital of the &apos;Audhali Sultan.(iv) Rada&apos;, a Zeidi garrison town through which the lines of communication between Al Beidha and Sana&apos;a pass, is 120 miles from Aden, and is therefore within easy flying range.(v) Advanced landing grounds exist in numerous parts of the aden protectorate, which bring all possible air objectives, both in the occupied area and in Zeidi territory within effective bombing range.7. Relative Strengths.-^-(i) Zeidi Forces. The latest intelligence reports estimate the strength of the Zeidi forces in Al Beidha district including Adh Dhahir, as about 1,500. In the event of protracted operations, or for the purpose of launching a counter-attack, these could be strongly reinforced by troops from the Yemen after some delay. They include about 400 regulars, but the remainder are comparatively well armed and amenable to control, (ii) &apos;Audhali Forces. The estimated number of &apos;Audhali fighting men available in Al Ffadhn district for offensive operations against the Zeidis on the top of Al Kor is 2,700. The majority of these are in possession of arms, but an issue of rifles and ammunition would be required to increase the proportion and to replace unserviceable arms and. arms for which ammunition is not available (Martini-Henry). 650 rifles for this purpose are at present held by the Aden Residency.(iii) Possible &apos;Audhali Allies. The &apos;Audhali are on peaceable terms withtheir neighbouring tribes, who would almost certainly come to their assistance in an attempt to recapture Adh Dhahir plateau. These tribes could probably muster a total of approximately 2,000 fighting men, but would also have to be assisted with the grant of rifles and ammunition. In the event of a serious initial reverse this support would probably melt away.(iv) All the forces mentioned under (ii) and (iii) above fight as tribesmen, are entirely unorganized and would never submit to the central control of any one of their own tribal leaders.   Only a British officer would be likely to succeed in effecting any measure of concerted .action and co-operation, (v) British Forces at Aden: (a) One Day Bomber Squadron is available for air operations.(b) No ground forces can be spared from the Aden Garrison, with the exception of one or two British officers to undertake the organization of the tribal forces. Approximately 70 men previously discharged from the 1st Yemen Infantry or discharged or on leave from the Aden Protectorate Levies and Aden Armed and Unarmed Police could, however, be collected in the tribal area concerned, and would form a nucleus of organized and disciplined troops under a British officer. The Residency Office could supply two Maxim guns for use by this small force. The presence of automatic weapons with the attackers would have a considerable moral effect on the Zeidis, and also enhance the morale of&apos; the &apos;Audhali tribesmen themselves.
8.   Topography: (i) Approaches to Adh Dhahir Plateau. -The only method of approach toAdh Dhahir Plateau from the south is up the face of the steep escarpment known as Al Kor, which rises to an average, height of 3,500 feet above the plain about Lodar. There are four regular &quot; passes &quot; which are used by caravan traffic, and a number of rough and difficult tracks. A determined resistance, combined with sound tactical dispositions and a firm control of the defence, would render the capture of the crest a formidable task. This, however, is not likely to be experienced to a very high degree. The broken and rocky nature of the hillside favours the normal tribal method of attack, and, given a measure of surprise, an attack should stand a reasonable chance of success. It would, however, be difficult to retain the crest in face of a strong counter-attack.There are no permanent defences on the crest with the exception of a small fort at Husnal Alam, and the fact that the defenders would not operate as formed bodies of troops, but be scattered among the rocks and boulders, would result in there being few effective targets for close co-operation aircraft during the attack.(ii) Adh Dhahir Plateau. The occupied territory on the plateau comprisesan area of approximately 25 miles by 6 miles. It contains numerous small villages and groups of dwellings, but few towns or buildings of any size. The country is rocky and broken, and well suited to guerilla tactics. There ax&apos;e no effective targets for air attack, and it would be almost impossible to distinguish between friend and foe from the air during a period of fighting on the ground. The consolidation of the area, once captured, in the face of renewed Zeidi attacks would require careful organization and an adequate tribal garrison. Except for the moral effect of their appearance, aircraft could afford little direct assistance in holding the ground gained.9. Communications. A Royal Air Force Pack Wireless Telegraphy set is already installed at Lodar, and would provide adequate communication between Aden and any officer sent up to organize the tribal forces for the attack.10. A attitude of the Imam of the Yemen. In the course of the negotiations for a treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government, which have been proceeding for some time, but which show no signs of immediate conclusion, the Imam stated that he would be prepared to evacuate the &apos; Audhali territory in Adh Dhahir as a necessary preliminary to signature if agreement on other matters could be reached. This indicates that he has no strong reasons or desire for holding on to this area at all costs, and that if force is brought to bear on him he will probably withdraw his forces, but a definite breakdown of the negotiations may harden his attitude in this respect. The Imam is known to fear the effects-of air action, and to have a vivid recollection of the results of previous air operations against him. The immediate withdrawal of his forces from the Al &apos;Ain area in 1931 consequent on the threat of bombing directed against objectives in Zeidi territory tends to confirm this view.Courses of Action open to the Imam.11. On receipt of an ultimatum from His Majesty&apos;s Government there are three courses which might be adopted by the Imam : (i) He might accept the ultimatum,  and withdraw his  forces  fromAdh Dhahir Plateau, (ii) He might accept the ultimatum, but profess to be unable to impose his will on his local commanders in the occupied area.In either case he will tend to vacillate and procrastinate, and will try at all costs to save his face.(iii) He might refuse to comply with the ultimatum.In the event of (i) above, the aim will have been achieved, and the only military measures required will be the occupation and consolidation of the evacuated area by the &apos;Audhali. In the event of (ii) or (iii) offensive action will be required.
Courses of A ction open to Ourselves.12. If offensive action is found to be necessary, there are two possible courses open to us : (i) To organise a tribal attack, controlled by British officers, on the Zeidi garrison of Adh Dhahir Plateau, supported by close air co-operation over Al Kor and by the bombing of Al Beidha.(ii) To bring pressure to bear on the Imam himself by the concentratedbombing (after the usual warning notices have been dropped), of important military centres in Zeidi territory. At the same time holding the tribal forces in readiness to reoccupy Adh Dhahir Plateau as soon as any withdrawal begins.13. Although bombing is regarded with suspicion by delegates to Geneva, it is considered that- a tribal attack entirely unsupported by air action is doomed to failure and should not be attempted. Any such failure would he at once attributed by the &apos;Audhali to lack of support by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which would have far-reaching and adverse results throughout the Aden Protectorate, and would encourage the Imam to attempt further encroachments.14. While the moral effect of co-operation by aircraft would enhance the chances of success in the course of action described in paragraph 12 (i) above, the scarcity of suitable air objectives, and the comparative ineffectiveness of bombing small and scattered targets, would render such co-operation of little practical value and involve a waste of air effort. Moreover, the presence of large numbers of &apos;Audhali tribesmen throughout the whole of Adh Dhahir area, and the impossibility of protecting either their lives or their property from the effects of air attacks on the Zeidis in the area, make such attacks inadvisable. A further consideration is that this course confines air action to attacks on the local Zeidi forces in the occupied area. In such circumstances the Imam might well remain indifferent to their immediate fate, and merely await an opportunity to reoccupy the area as soon as the vigour of the tribal advance had been spent and the majority of the attackers had returned to their homes at the foot of Al Kor. This possibility would greatly increase the difficulty of holding the ground gained.Selection of the Best Course.15. The course of action described in paragraph 12 (ii), viz., to carry out intensive bombing of important military centres in Zeidi territory, while organizing the tribal forces for an advance as soon as the bombing has had effect, is therefore selected and recommended as the one most likely to achieve the desired end. This operation would bring pressure to bear on the Imam himself, and would be likely to induce him to order the withdrawal of his forces from Adh Dhahir, thus enabling the reoccupation of the area to be carried out without serious fighting and with the minimum loss of life on both sides.16. Several objectives for bombing exist, but the town of Rada&apos; provides the most suitable target for the initial attacks for the following reasons : (i) It is the advanced base on the lines of communication for the Zeidiforces in the Al Beidha and Adh Dhahir Area.(ii) It is the nearest point in Zeidi territory to Al Beidha which is in tele-graphic communication with Sana&apos;a.(iii) It contains large military barracks situated in the centre of the town.(iv) It is an important trade centre, with routes leading to Mocha and Aden, (v) It is within effective air range of Aden and attacks on it would impressthe Imam with the possibilities of bombing Sana&apos;a itself, (vi) It contains no Europeans.Plan of Action.17. Ground Organization. When the date for the proposed operations is decided on, and the ultimatum to the Imam prepared for despatch, the following action will be taken : (a) The Air Staff Intelligence Officer from Headquarters, British Forces, will proceed to Lodar by air, accompanied by the Political Officer who will
Enclosure 3. Proposed &apos;Audhali Operations, 1933.Note of Political Action.1. The decision having been taken to effect, by armed intervention, the Imam&apos;s evacuation of &apos; Audhali territory on Adh Dhahir, and the restoration of &apos;Audhali hostages from the Imam&apos;s hands, an ultimatum will be prepared for despatch to the Imam in the form attached hereto.2. The ultimatum will be despatched to Sana&apos;a by the quickest land route (approximately 5 days).3. The Political Officer will proceed to Lodar by air with the Air Staff Intelligence Officer to rally and organize the tribal forces and to advise the Officer in charge of ground operations on political and cognate matters (c/., the Appreciation paragraph 17).4. The necessary quantity of rifles, ammunition, and customary rations for supply to &apos;Audhali and allied tribesmen will be sent by the Residency Office to-Lodar by the quickest land route. The arms, ammunition, and rations will be kept under guard by the &apos; Audhali Sultan and will be issued as and when necessary under the orders of the Political Officer, who will arrange with the Sultan to have a supply of baggage camels always available.[8968]        &apos; e 2rally and organize the tribal forces. The Air Staff Intelligence Officer will keep Headquarters informed by wireless telegraphy of the situation and will take charge of all ground operations.(b) All &apos; Audhali or allied tribesmen previously discharged on completion ofservice from the 1st Yemen Infantry, the Aden Protectorate Levies and the Aden Armed and Unarmed Police and those still serving but on leave to their homes and who volunteer for such service, will be instructed to report at Lodar for service under a British officer.(c) An officer of the Aden Protectorate Levies, who will be invited to volunteer, will proceed to Lodar by road, taking with him two Maxim guns supplied by the Aden Residency, and all &apos; Audhali tribesmen who are serving in the levies who can be spared and volunteer for this service. On arrival at Lodar he will take command of the personnel mentioned at (6) above, and will assist the Air Staff Intelligence Officer in planning the leadership and tactical employment of the tribal forces generally with the advice of the Political Officer.(d) The Aden Residency will  despatch  such  quantities  of  rifles  andammunition as are available and can be spared and native rations of the customary nature to Lodar for distribution among the tribes under the supervision of the Air Staff Intelligence Officer with the advice of the Political Officer.(e) No. 8 (B) Squadron will arrange to equip Museimir Landing Ground with supplies of fuel and bombs and ammunition, for use as an advanced landing ground for operations against Rada&apos;.18.   Operations. (i) If the Imam fails to comply with the ultimatum, operations will begin with the intensive bombing of Rada&apos; followed, if necessary, by the bombing of Dhamar, which is the headquarters for the administrative and military control of Al Beidha and Adh Dhahir Area. The customary notices will, of course, be dropped before bombing begins, (ii) The decision as to the appropriate time for beginning the tribal advance on Adh Dhahir Plateau must be left until the situation develops, and the effects of the bombing become apparent. When this decision has been taken, aircraft will be diverted temporarily from the main objective directly to support the advance.
5. The Political Officer will arrange in co-operation with the Air Staff Intelligence Officer to obtain information of all movements and reinforcements of troops on Adh Dhahir, of any increased oppression against &apos;Audhali subjects, of the attitude of the latter towards the operations, and the action that they (and the Rasasi (Beidha) tribes) are likely to take.6. He will make a special point of obtaining immediate information of compliance with the ultimatum on the part of the Imam, indicated by the withdrawal of all Imamic troops from the &apos;Audhali portion of Adh Dhahir and the release from Al Beidha of &apos;Audhali hostages, and also immediate notice of any &quot;atrocity&quot; committed by Imamic troops or subjects in the process of withdrawal, such as, destruction of dwelling places, fields, the taking of hostages or prisoners, &amp;c.He will also obtain information of the situation on Adh Dhahir as soon as possible after the expiration of the ultimatum period.All information thus obtained will be transmitted to the Residency Office by wireless telegraphy.7. During the advance to reoccupy Adh Dhahir and to consolidate after occupation, the Political Officer will be at hand to give political advice and assistance to the Officer in charge of ground operations with respect to tribal co-operation, and other tribal matters.8. After Adh Dhahir has been reoccupied, the Political Officer will get into touch with the rival faction of the &apos; Audhali ruling family, the relations of the late Sultan, if they have not fled into Yemen territory, and try to bring about a reconciliation between them and the &apos;Audhali Sultan.He will also get into touch with the head Shaikhs of the &apos;Audhali sections who will have been released from Imamic control and discover their attitude towards the &apos; Audhali Sultan.9. After the said reoccupation and consolidation, the Residency Office will assist the &apos; Audhali Sultan to establish his position as ruler in such ways as may seem advisable.Estimate of Financial Commitments.Rs.1.

And whereas your Highness&apos;s retention of the said territories and hostages, and the oppression which &apos;Audhali subjects have thereby been forced to bear have caused increasing unrest on the frontier :And whereas the whole of the territories of the &apos; Audhali Sultan and all their dependencies are under British protection by virtue of an existing treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.His Majesty&apos;s Government require : (i) The complete withdrawal of your Highness&apos;s forces from, and the complete relinquishment of your Highness&apos;s administrative control over all the &apos; Audhali villages and lands on Adh Dhahir. (ii) The release of all &apos;Audhali hostages and prisoners from durance in your Highness&apos;s territories.(iii) The absolute prevention of every kind of damage or detriment to any&apos;Audhali subjects, or buildings, lands, crops, or other properties, before, during or after the said withdrawal, relinquishment, and release.(iv) The complete execution of the said withdrawal and relinquishment andthe release of the said hostages and prisoners within two weeks from the date of this notification, i.e., by noon on the (Arabic date)., His Majesty&apos;s Government direct me to inform your Highness that if the four demands set out above are not fully complied with within the time allotted, the towns of Rada&apos; and Dhamar, and any other places in the Yemen which it may be deemed necessary to attack, will be bombed from the air.Lastly, His Majesty&apos;s Government direct me to assure your Highness that in making these demands and giving these warnings they have no motive of hostility to your Highness or to the interest of the Yemen, nor have they any desire to interfere in your Highness&apos;s government of your proper territories. But they are determined that the territories and subjects of the Chiefs with whom they are in treaty relations shall be inviolate, and that the restoration of &apos; Audhali territories, hostages and prisoners from your Highness&apos;s hands shall be no longer postponed,I have the honour to convey to your Highness the expression of my sincere regard, and the earnest hope that by compliance with the demands of His Majesty&apos;s Government, your Highness will prevent the damage and destruction in the Yemen that your rejection of them will render immediately inevitable.Acting Resident, &amp;c.To His Highness Imam Yahya bin Muhammad bin Hamid-Ud-Din,Sana&apos;a.ANNEX D. .17957/33 [No. 54]. -The Acting Resident to the Secretary of State. (Received July 24, 1933.) -(Secret.)(No. 164.) .Sir, The Residency, Aden, July 12, 1933.IN connexion with my despatch No. 162 of the 12th July, 1933,* on the subject of treaty relations with the Imam, I have the honour to enclose herewith the translation of a letter dated the 20th June, 1933, that I have received from the Iman in regard to the proposed eventual appointment of British Consular or Political Officers to Sana&apos;a.2. The reluctance of the Imam to receive permanent official foreign representatives in the Yemen has lately been illustrated by his refusal to comply with Italian requests in that respect; and I attach no particular significance to his present unsolicited excuses.I have, &amp;c.R.

Enclosure.In the Name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.(Seal of the Imam.)To Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly.Resident, Aden.(After Compliments.)WE beg to inform your Excellency that it was declared in the previous draft Treaty which was to have been concluded and which was then urged and submitted by us, that a separate agreement should be concluded at a convenient time for the appointment of Consular officials by both parties in accordance with established custom. It was also declared that there should be a special article providing for future accord between the two Governments regarding Political Officers. Actually, the appointment and exchange of Political Officers will be arranged after official relations have been established by the conclusion of the Treaty between the two Governments. The exchange of such political officers at that time would be a matter of course. We have agreed that there was no necessity for an additional clause in that respect, and found that your communication was in fact agreeable and conformable with the very matter. But our Government, as your Excellency is already aware, is continuing to make its utmost endeavours to complete its internal organizations one after the other, as opportunity offers. It is not possible, therefore, for our Government at present to provide all the material requirements necessary for the proper entertainment of Political Officers and for their accommodation. We have for this reason been compelled to postpone the exchange of Political officers with certain of the Powers with whom we have already concluded treaties, until some more favourable time. After the signing of the blessed Treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government now, by the Grace of God, if we were to accept Political officers appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the other Powers who are in treaty relations with us would naturally ask for the, acceptance of their Political officers also. In these circumstances we consider it reasonable to postpone the exchange of Diplomatic and Political officers to some more favourable time, on account of the impossibility of providing for such officers, having regard to the reasons explained above. We deem it necessary to delay their coming to some convenient time, but we do not, however, conceive the existence of an objection, should His Majesty&apos;s Government find it necessary to appoint and depute a temporary delegate to us at any time to discuss any affairs or business with us; we similarly on our part in the case of emergency. In view of all this, our Government, after the signing of the Treaty by the Grace of God, will within a short time do their best to complete the organization of the Department of Internal Affairs; and thereafter we shall be ready to receive Diplomatic and Political Officers. This matter needs no further explanation and paving of the way.In conclusion we beg to tender our best respects.Dated Safar 25, 1353 (June 20, 1933).ANNEX E.Paraphrase of a Telegram from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.Dated 14th August, 1933.(Received Colonial Office at 8-30 p.m. on 14th August, 1933.)(No. 37.   Immediate.)WITH reference to my despatch No. 182 of the 2nd August relative to the situation on South-West Subeihi border, I have received reliable information to the effect that fifty Zeidi troops with 400 Yemeni tribesmen occupied Am-Nabia on the 21st June.   From Am-Nabia they have raided Am-Ildidiya and in the
direction of Ras-Al-Ara. Sheikh Nabia and twelve other Subeihis have been removed forcibly to Mocha, and 150 sheep and twenty camels have been looted. A British subject, who desired to anchor his dhow and land at Bir-Sukaiya, has been prevented by threats of force by a Zeidi patrol from Nabia (?) present hostile strength is believed to be eleven. I have gained the impression that these incidents have been tax-collecting raids similar to former inroads, and that they do not constitute an organised military occupation; but the number of prisoners, the depth of the penetration and the (?) interference with the (?) coast make this encroachment more serious than any since the Turan affairs of 1927, regarding which, please see Resident at Aden&apos;s telegram No. 72 of the 29th August in that year and following correspondence.Owing to the nature of these aggressions, to the delay of the Subeihi Chiefs in reporting them, and to the situation described in my despatch under reference, I have not thought it desirable to address the Imam. I have, however, sent a strong protest to the Imam&apos;s representative at Taiz demanding (1) the with-drawal of all Yemeni soldiers and all Yemeni tribesmen to the west of a line running from Huan Murad to Jebel Kahabub; (2) the release of prisoners; (3) the restoration of the looted animals, within a week from receipt of my letter. I have warned him that in the event of his failing to comply it will be necessary for me to &quot;consider taking a more serious view of the matter.&quot; I contemplate action in the event of non-compliance by definite ultimatum to officer commanding at Taiz, and by subsequent bombing of that town and other suitable objectives after customary warning if necessary. Six years ago in Turan similar action was immediately successful. May I be authorised to proceed as proposed? A.O.C. -concurs.

Enclosure.(No. C/206.)(After Compliments.)Your Highness, The Residency, Aden, April 11, 1933.I HAVE the honour to refer to my letter No. 31, dated the 15th January, 1933, in which I stated that I would communicate to your Highness the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on your letter dated 9th. Ramadan, 1351 (6th January, ;1933), as soon as I was informed of them. I have now received the reply of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the purport of whose instructions to me is as follows : 2. His MaJesty&apos;s Government desire to retain the wording of Article III of the draft Treaty which was communicated to your Highness in my letter No. C/257, dated the 7th May, 1932, subject to the following modifications which they are prepared to accept with the object of thereby making the article more acceptable to you.3. ft has been noted that in your Highness&apos;s letter of 9th Ramadan, 1351, you have suggested a draft for this Article in which the original reference to rights claimed by the two Governments in the regions in question has been omitted. In conformity with your proposal, His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to omit the sentence &apos;&apos; It being understood that nothing contained in this Article or in other Articles of the present Treaty is to be taken as meaning that either High Contracting Party renounces the rights claimed by him in those regions.&quot;4. Secondly, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to make the guarantee contained in their draft of the second paragraph of the said Article mutual and equally binding on both Governments instead of only on your Highness as at first proposed, by the adoption of the following wording in place of that sent to vou with my letter of the 7th May, 1932 :-&quot; Pending the conclusion of the negotiations referred to in the preceding paragraph, the High Contracting Parties agree to maintain the situation existing in regard to the frontier on the date of the signature of this Treaty and both High Contracting Parties undertake that they will prevent by all means at their disposal any violation by their forces of the above-mentioned frontier, and any interference by their subjects or by persons under their protection on their side of that frontier, with the affairs of the people inhabiting the other side of the said frontier.&quot;5. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to insist on either of these modifications; but, if they are acceptable to your Highness, they are willing to adopt them for the purpose of smoothing the path of agreement.6. For the reasons that I have given to your Highness in the explanatory note to my letter No. C/257, dated the 7th May, 1932, and in my letter No. C/514, dated the 3rd September, 1932, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot consent to the inclusion of any reference to the islands in this Treaty.  But if the TreatyANNEX G. 17957/33&apos; [No. 40]. --The Resident to the Secretary of State. (Received April 24. 1933.)(Secret.) (No. 83.)Sir, The Residency, Aden, April 12, 1933.I HAVE the honour to forward for your information a copy of a letter, No. C/206 dated the 11th April, 1933, and of its accompaniments, that I have addressed to the Imam of Sana&apos;a in accordance with your instructions received on the 25th March, 1933*I have, &amp;c.B. R. REILLY,Resident, &amp;c.,      ? No. 17957/33 [Nos. 27 and 28].
is concluded they will be ready to bear in mind any views that you may wish to put forward with regard to the islands at the southern end of the Red Sea, which are referred to in Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne, if at any time the future status of these islands is under consideration. I hope that this assurance will satisfy your Highness that the conclusion of this Treaty will not prejudice the status quo of these islands, and will ensure that you will be given an opportunity of representing your views about them if any change is contemplated in the future.7. I am instructed by His Majesty&apos;s Government to inform your Highness that the present draft represents their final proposals, and that they can make no further concessions towards meeting your views. I am also instructed to inform you that the continuance of these negotiations is definitely contingent on the removal of the restrictions which you have imposed on trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate.8. As this is a final offer on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government, I consider it advisable to retabulate the draft Treaty in the form in which they are now prepared to accept it. I enclose the draft with this letter. I hope that your Highness will realise that it embodies a settlement which will regularise the mutual relations of the two Governments in a manner honourable and advantageous to both of them, and that you will decide to agree to it.9. The alternative will be a failure of the negotiations at a time when they appear to be on the point of success. By long correspondence, by patience, and by mutual concessions we have reached a general agreement on all essential issues. The friendship that His Majesty&apos;s Government offer your Highness is a genuine one. They have no ulterior motives, but sincerely desire the welfare and stability of your Kingdom. The time is now favourable for the final completion of this work, and this opportunity should not be lost.10. I am leaving shortly for England and expect to return to Aden in October. During my temporary absence Mr. R. S. Champion, Political Secretary, will take my place as Resident; He has been in Aden for several years, and is well acquainted with the course of the negotiations. If your Highness will agree to the terms now proposed and to the removal of the restrictions on trade, without which the Treaty cannot be concluded, Mr. Champion during my absence, or I myself on my return, will be prepared to visit your Highness at Sana&apos;a for the Completion of the negotiations and the signature of the Treaty on the conditions which have been mutually understood and accepted. I trust that this happy termination of our endeavours will not be frustrated.B. R. REILLY,Resident, &amp;c.To His Highness Imam Yehia bin Muhammad Hamid Uddin, Sana&apos;a.Notes for the Information of His Highness the Imam.1. The attached draft comprises the final proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Treaty.2. After the despatch of this draft there can be no further negotiations with His Highness until he has agreed to remove the restrictions on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate.3. The draft Treaty having been agreed upon, it cannot be signed unless His Highness shall previously have removed all restrictions on overland trade between the Yemen and the Aden Protectorate, and restored and surrendered all the territories and subjects of the Chiefs who are in treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government, especially the territories of the Amir of Dhala&apos; in the vicinity of Sana&apos;a, the territories of the Audhali Sultan at Ad Dhaher, and the subjects of the latter Chief and of the Chiefs of Beihan, without damage or detriment to property or person.
