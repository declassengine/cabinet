My colleagues will recollect that, during the debate on the Committee stage of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill last year, it was announced that the Government had decided to continue In force for one year the existing prohibition of the import of dyestuffs, and that during that time an inquiry into the whole question should be undertaken, first as regards the trade aspects by the Import Duties Advisory Committee, and that subsequently the defence aspect of the question should be considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence,The import Duties Advisory Committee presented their Report in July, and recommended the continuation of the prohibition accompanied by certain amendments relating mainly to procedure.     A summary of these amendments is given in Annex I.     Legislation will be required to give effect to them.The Report was communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the three Service Departments   have endorsed strongly, from the defence point of view, the recommendation that the general policy embodied In the Dyestuffs (import Regulation) Act should bo continued.     The Report was published in September (Cmd, 4411).I assume that my colleagues will accept in general the recommendations of the Import Duties Advisory Committee.     The Committee state In their Report that &quot;if the choice of protective measures lies between restriction of imports and a system of import duties, the colour users would prefer the present regime, i,o. the system of prohibition and license, as would the manufacturers&quot;,     I recommend that the existingCOPY NO.

system should be continued by permanent legislation, which could also embody the suggested amendments of procedure.   The Committee also recommended no time limit for the system of prohibition, as it appeared to them that the question whether, and, if so, when the system should &quot;be terminated should be left entirely open,I do not anticipate that there will be serious opposition from the trade to this courso:   the Report has now been published for some woeks,   and no serious opposition has developed;   but certain interests are known to be in disagreement with the views of the Import Duties Advisory Committee,There is one additional point upon which I should appreciate a decision urgently from the Cabinet,     The existing powers of the Board of Trade relating  to dyestuffs expire on the 31st December, and it will therefore bo necessary for legislation of some kind to bo passed before that data.   The advantages of passing before the Christmas adjournment the Bill which I contemplate are:-(l) It is desirable that the dyestuffs question should be finally settled as soon as possible, and that makers and users should know for some time ahead under what conditions they will carry on thoir trade,(2) It is only by now legislation that the amendments of procedure, and in particular the new safeguards for consumers, can be put into force,,(5) Procedure under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act is inappropriate if we arc to accept tho Committee&apos;s recommendation that there should for the future be no time limit in tho legislation.The difficulties in the way of such a course seem to me to be solely those of parliamentary time.      I understand that the new Session is not expected to begin until late in
Novembor, and that the time of the Commons will bo largely occupied by the Unemployment Insurance Bill.     In these circumstances, it may bo dangorous to assume that legislation could&apos;be properly considered both by the Commons and by the Lords before the Christmas adjournment.     An alternative proposal, therefore, would be to continue temporarily the present powers of the Board of Trade by means of the Expiring Laws Act, at the same time undertaking that the new pormanont legislation would be pushed on with as rapidly as possible in the now Session, and that as soon as it had been passed the existing Act would be superseded.     This course would involve more Parliamentary debate, including a discussion on the schedule to the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill as well as on the new Bill,      On the other hand, if wo are to avoid this, we must be absolutely assured of the necessary time to pass the new Bill before December 31st.In order to assist my colleagues in deciding on this point, I have had prepared the first rough draft of a possible Bill, which I attach as Annex II.To sum up, a decision is required on tho following points(l) Whether the recommendations of the Import Duties Advisory Committee (that the existing system of prohibition of imports of dyestuffs should be continued., with the amendments of procedure which thoy suggest) are to be accepted.(2) If so, whether we should endeavour to push through a new Bill before Christmas, or whether the old powers should be continued, temporarily by means of the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, and the now Bill taken as early as possible in the new Session,W. R.rd of   Trade, 13th October, 1933.
Amendments recommended by the Import Duties Advisory Committee.(a) The prohibition covers dyestuffs, colours and colouring matters, and it is recommended that certain articles Included among colours and colouring matters, such as artists1 colours, printing inks, and typewriter ribbons, should no longer be subject to prohibition, but can be dealt with by duties under the Import Duties Act,     The exact line of demarcation between dyestuffs and colouring matters Is at present under discussion with the Departments and trades concerned.(b) It is proposed that the membership of the Dyestuffs Industry Development Committee, which was set up by the original Act to advise on the development of the dyestuffs Industry, should be enlarged and should include the members of the Licensing Committee.(c) To meet complaints of exploitation it is&quot; suggested that the makers and users of dyestuffs should themselves set up an unofficial standing Committee to deal with questions of prices and supplies, and also that complaints from a responsible body of consumers as to exploitation should be referred to an Independent body for Investigation,     The findings of this body would be made public.      The Import Duties Advisory Committee would be willing to accept an invitation to undertake this work and suggest that If they are invited to do it, they should be given for the purpose the powers of enquiry which they have In regard to enquiries under the Import Duties Act.(d; The Advisory Committee say that if their recommendations are accepted they would propose to recommend that dyestuffs, but not intermediate products for the manufacture of dyestuffs, should be added forthwith to the Free List of the Import Duties Act.     Some intermediate products, which are also used as dyestuffs, may be recommended for addition to the Free List lateri,
