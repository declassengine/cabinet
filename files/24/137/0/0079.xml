[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.      July 1922.SECRET.CP. 4080Imperial Wireless Chain.I circulate to my colleagues a copy of a letter and its enclosures which I have sent to the Imperial Communications Committee.July 1922. PEEL.P.W. 2717. India Office,Sir, 28th June 1922.In continuation of my leter of 30th November, P.W. 5781/21, I am directed by &apos; To Government of India, 13th Jan. 1922.   the Secretary of State for India  to  forward From ditto, 2nd March 1922. further copy of telegraphic correspondence1 withTo ditto, 16th May 1922. the Government  of India in  regard  to  the from ditto, 29th May 1922. manner in which thev can co-operate in the from ditto, 19th June 1922. establishment of the Imperial Wireless Chain.It will be seen from their telegram dated 19th June that the Government of India suggest, as a possible compromise between their own views and those stated in the latest&apos; recommendation of your Committee, that the Indian station might be constructed by and at the cost of the Imperial Government and thereafter operated b,y the Government of India.Viscount Peel trusts that this suggestion may commend itself as a practicable method of securing, without further delay, the construction of an essential link in the Imperial Chain.I am, &amp;c,The Secretary, - F. W. H. Smith.Imperial Communications Committee.Prom Secretary of State to Viceroy, Public Works Department,13tli January 19l2.174. Your telegram dated 12th November, 922 P. W. Imperial Wireless Scheme. I have personally consulted Postmaster-General regarding your wish for direct com-munication and private agency, and as result I am convinced that if construction of Imperial chain is not to be retarded, India, having fought hard for her views both at Imperial Conference and elsewhere, must now loyally accept Imperial Wireless Scheme as already planned for construction and working by Government. As regards your difficulty in providing money, Norman Committee estimate of capital expenditure to be met by India is .I85,000Z. I trust that you will be able to devise means for meeting this not very large expenditure as soon as may be. As regards construction, intention is that experts here should supply design for station in India, and it is thought that your experts could then carry out actual construction with the exception of the aerial, which the General Post Office, London, will probably advise should be entrusted to a contractor. Please let me know whether you now definitely agree to accept Imperial scheme.From Viceroy, 2nd March 1922.546 P.W. Your telegram dated 13th January, No. 174. Imperial Wireless Telegraph Chain. With every desire to assist in execution of scheme which has been, approved by the Cabinet and the Imperial Conference, and to secure advantage of State ownership and. direct control, and keenly alive as we are to risk of entrusting this service to a company which may possibly secure a monopolist control, we have re-examined the position and are confronted with following difficulties in the way of our undertaking construction of a station according to plans of Wireless Committee.2. Firstly, we are definitely unable to provide funds at present.   The work is not likely to be remunerative and would have to be financed from revenue.   We are informed that figure mentioned by you is probably a serious under-estimate.   More-over, it does not include expenditure on account of royalties, patent rights or defensive 5536      100   7/22
measures;.&apos; ; Secondly, we have not the staff to undertake the work. Thirdly&apos;, we are doubtful whether the Assembly&apos;and the general public would endorse the policy.] 3J Position stands thus with regard to communication between the United Kingdom and India :! We have taken into consideration possibility that our expert advisers may have been over sanguine as regards practicability of disposal of traffic regularly and speedily by the direct method recommended by them ; but, after further consideration, our views remain substantially those which you strongly supported to the Cabinet in your memorandum dated 6th April last, and which we reiterated in our telegram dated 12th November. We are further fortified in our views by the fact that we have already received offers from responsible companies to establish a direct service, and that the proceedings of the Imperial Wireless Co-ordinating Committee show that Australia is at present considering a scheme for direct communication with United -Kingdom.. We have received a definite offer from Marconi and Company to construct a station at their own expense within 12 months, capable of conducting efficient&apos;direct commercial service with Great Britain. We have also received from another source an offer to form ah Indian company with the object of erecting station and working service on our behalf, under licence, as link in Imperial chain. We see no difference in principle between entrusting the aerial construction to a contractor as advised by General Post Office, London, and entrusting construction of whole station to contractor as desired by us.4. Alternative before us is, therefore, either entrusting the service to a company or indefinite delay. In these circumstances, we would urge that difficulties in the way of entrusting one link in the chain to a company should not be regarded as insuperable. The company would have to bind itself to receive and -transmit all Egyptian and Far Eastern traffic- that offers, and to conform in communicating with these stations with (sic) the requirements of the Imperial Scheme. Our own traffic would, as far as possible, be transmitted direct to and from United Kingdom, but the company accepting the contract would be made to realise that the station was to be primarily a unit in the Imperial chain.5. If the principle of direct communication and company management is accepted, we should like to invite tenders for the construction of Indian unit capable of com-communicating with United Kingdom, Egypt and Far East, and operation of guaranteed service which will conform under licence with (sic) requirements of English Act, Imperial Wireless Scheme. As regards Avaves, hours of service, procedure, rates and accountancy, can you now authorise us to proceed on these lines, and, if so, can you tell us what waves will be allotted to India, and give any other information which General Post Office, London, think necessary to ensure that station, when constructed, will fit in, in every respect, with Imperial Scheme ?From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 16//i May 1922.Your telegram dated 2nd March, 546 P.W. Imperial Wireless Chain. Sub-Committee of Imperial Communications Committee are of opinion that, in order to avoid dual control in station forming central link in chain, Indian station should be constructed and operated by Government. Committee will therefore probably submit to Cabinet recommendation that station in India of 120 kilowatt power should be financed, constructed and operated by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Station would be able to communicate direct with England for several hours daily, and through Egyptian station when atmospherics are bad. Would such arrangement be acceptable to you ?   Please reply as quickly as possible.From Viceroy, 2Qth May 1922.1058 P.W. Your telegram dated 16th May, 1906. Imperial Wireless Chain. We fear that we must return a negative reply to your question. Public opinion here would be opposed to construction and operation of station in India by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and on two-step basis, when an Indian company, working in association with Marconi&apos;s, is willing to undertake and finance station working direct with Great Britain. Our Director-General anticipates administrative difficulty regarding traffic and revenue if station is operated by General Post Office, London, independent of his control and of general telegraph administration of country. A station of the power suggested would not give a continuous direct service, which we consider to be essential on strategic grounds, and is  not the kind of  station we require for
I 3ijommercial purposes.   We do not foresee any serious difficulty to our proposal on.Ilxccount of dual control if conditions set forth in para. 4 and para. 5 of our telegram Mated 2nd March are imposed, and general policy proposed in para. 2 (a) and last paragraph of General Post Office, London, memorandum of 29th March 1922, to Imperial Communications Committee is accepted.2. We should like to know whether British Government propose to acquiesce in Australian scheme, involving reciprocating station in the United Kingdom, and whether they would object to our entering into agreement with an Indian company on same lines.From Viceroy, lQtli June 1922.Our telegram dated 29th May, 1058 P.W. We have just seen papers sent, with your Public Works Secretary&apos;s letter dated 27th April 1922, and particularly the Memorandum Appendix z, adopted at ,*he 25th meeting of the Imperial Com-munications Committee. We think the solution suggested in para. 7 of the Memorandum offers a compromise which we might be able to accept, and would be glad to know how the suggestion is regarded by the Imperial Government.
