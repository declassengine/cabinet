(This Document is the Property r-f His Britannic Majesty *bGovernment).Confidential Copy 2To.Cabinet.CP.lAf)&quot;)%        School Teachers (Superannuation) Bill.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.Ah early decision of the Cabinet is needed upon two questions elating to the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act:-(1)   Should the Bill be proceeded with?(2) If so, what, if any, concessions should the Government beprepared t6 make to ease its passage ?I.liy Colleagues will recollect that a select Committee,tinder the Chairmanship of Mr.Aciand, was set up to report -Ipfhether in fixing the present scales of salaries for teachers kin grant-aided schools any undertaking by the Government or 1&apos;Parliament was given or implied that the provisions of theiI&quot;Teachers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1918, should not be alteredI I&quot;while these scales remained in force&quot;.    The Committee concluded that no undertaking, either express or implied, was given and its Report is, therefore, favourable to the Government.   On the other hand, this decision was reached by a majority only of four to three and in opposition to the views of the Chairman, who held that there was an implied though not an express under-taking.   The Teachers&apos; paper &quot;The Schoolmaster&quot;, is also prompt to notice that one member of the Committee who voted with the majority was not observed to have been present at previous stages of the Inquiry.   These circumstances, taken in connection with phrases in Lord Burnham&apos;s evidence which have been widely quoted, e.g. &quot;it seems to me contrary to all precedent&quot; and &quot;I bound to say that, looking at it from the point of view of morals, a little shabby to alter a scheme so enacted&quot;, and again, 1 think it partakes of the nature of sharp practice&quot;, lessen the Authority of the verdict which the Government has obtained and augur a contested passage for the Bill.
216I am myself quite clear-that &quot;Tru^-nand^rrtaIdng, of^Uxe^^j kind referred to was expressed or implied and that so-far^aa^.. the point of honour is concerned, the Government is-free to proceed with the Bill.   Whether it is justifiable in any circumstances, from the point of view of public policy, to alter a Superannuation Act in such a way as to reduce the &quot;benefits enjoyed by those who are already under the Act, is a matter which admits of debate .   My view is that such a step can only properly be taken under exceptional circumstances but that in the-present instance the circumstances are exceptional.   They are:-(l) The large additional benefits conferred upon the teachers without consideration in 1918:-(2) The great and unexpected increases in Teachers&apos; Salaries 3ince that date:&apos;(3) The consequent increase in the cost of the pension Scheme to the State:(4) The present urgent financial needs of the Country. The Government&apos;s case, therefore, can, in my opinion, be success-fully defended inside the House and in the country.It is true that the Bill bristles with difficulties and that the levy of a contribution (which will be returnable in certain cases) imposes a considerable administrative burden upon the Board of Education which we should be very glad to avoid. There are,  on the other hand, two powerful arguments for pro-ceeding with the measure - first, the great loss of credit which would attach to the Government were it now withdrawn, and secondly, the inconvenience of surrendering an economy in the region of Two Millions during the current financial year.
If tlie-Gsrrerraiiien^ -with the 13ill.and.^obtain itaJSecond Reading-, difficulties-will undoubtedly arise in Committee on the equity of some of its provisions. The principa3.--crriticis.Tns which I foresee are -) That the contribution of 5 per cento is altogetherexcessive in relation to the benefits receivableo     The Government Actuaxy*B-Report shews that for teachers under the age cf 25 the value of the existing- superannuation benefits is less than 10 per cento of the salary; and for teachers entering the profession at the age of 23. is very greatly less. 3?or the uncertif icated woman teacher the value of the benefits represents only 5c5 per cent of the salary on one method of calculation, and 7c7 on another,     It will be argued that it is inequitable under a compulsory system of superannuation to require the employee to pay more than half the value of the benefits.     It is not until the age of 30 that the value of the benefits exceeds 10 per cent.     With a flat rate coStri-bution of 5 per cent, it will be argued that the younger teachers are paying for the older,  the uncortifioated teachers are paying for the certificated, and the women generally are paying for the men.     To deal with this diffs-j^Lty I suggest two alternatives:(a) a pledge given in the Bill or otherwise,  that if a permanent contributory system is established as the result of the Departmental Committee;s inquiries, account shall be /taken of payments made by teachers under this temporary measure in excess of the contributions required by the permanent measure:    or(b) if the teachers prefer it., that we should introduce- into the present Bill a graded rate of contributions by which . the older teachers would pay more than 5 per cent of their salaries and the younger teachers would pay leas, or possibly nothing at all,
fii) The second point, which has already been raised by Mrs. Wintringhara, is that there are a large number of teachers whose salaries have not improved since 1918 to such an extent- as to justify such a change as is contemplated.      It will be argued that -there are some 14,000 teachers who are still being paid on the Provisional Minimum Scale, and have not got the benefit -of the Burnham Standard Scales.     They have not so improved their position that o contribution can equitably be levied from them.     -The general answer to this argument is that the step from the previously existing scales to the Provisional Minimum Scale was In most areas a very long one. In the 39 areas^ in which teachers are still paid on the Provisional Minimum Scale salary expenditure lias risen by 147 per cent, since 1913-14 and 108 per cenb. since 1917-18.     The average salary has risen from  86 in 1913-14 and  117 in 1918-19 to  211 (estimated) in 1922-23.     If the allocated Standard Scale had been adopted, the average salary would in 1922-3 be about  233 in these areas.     These figures I think afford a sufficient answer to the general argument, though it is possible that cases may be adduced of particular teachers or of particular areas in which there has not been so large an improvement in relation to the salaries received before the Act of 1913 came into operation.Two smaller points may be mentioned.(iii) That the returns of contributions without interest is inequitable.     On this point I am disposed to rely on paragraph 13 of the Government Actuary&apos;s Keport, where he points out that the value of the insurance which the teachers enjoy during their term of service against the current risk of death or disablement is substantial, and is not met by the interest on the teacher&apos;s accumulated contributions.
(iv)    That teachers should be able to claim exemption from Income-tax on the contributions levied under the Bill. The Board of Inland Revenue have advised that under the existing law contributions will not be exempt.    I think it is necessary to deal with this point, though I presume it I cannot be dealt with in this measure.I have dealt with all these points more fully in the longer memorandum which I have submitted.H.A.L. FISHER. 12th June 1922.
