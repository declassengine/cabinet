[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET.C.P.-4020. 4gCABINET.BRITISH DEBT TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I. I DESIRE to bring before the Cabinet the question of the policy to be adopted in dealing with the request which has been received from the United States Government that we should put forward proposals for funding the British Debt to the United States Government (the amount of which is now $4,135,818,000 = at par about  849,900,000).II. Since this question was last before the Cabinet the most important events directly connected with it are : (1.) The passage through the United States Congress and the signature by the United States President on the 9th February, 1922, of an Act setting up &quot; A World War Foreign Debt Commission&apos;&apos; of five members, of which the Secretary of the Treasury is Chairman (text in Appendix I).(2.) The adoption at the first meeting of this Commission on the 18th April, 1922, of the following resolution : &quot;Resolved that the Secretary of State be requested to inform each of the Governments whose obligations arising out of the World War are held by the United States, including obligations held by the United States Grain Corpora-tion, the War Department, the Navy Department or the American Relief Administration, of the organisation of the World War Foreign Debt Commis-sion, pursuant to Act of Congress approved the 9th February, 1922, and that the Commission desires to receive any proposals or representations which the said Government may wish to make for the settlement or refunding of its obligations under the provisions of the Act.&quot;(3.) The official communication of this resolution to the British Government by a letter dated the 25th April, 1922, from the United States Embassy in London, accompanied by a semi-official intimation that it would be agreeable to the United States Government if financial representatives could be sent out to Washington at an early date to open negotiations with the Commission.&quot;(4.) The official announcement in the Budget speech in the British House of Commons on the 30th April, 1922, of the British Governments intention to begin payment of interest on the debt to the United States Government in October 1922  an announcement which has not yet been formally confirmed by any official communication to the United States Government.III. Sir Auckland Geddes presses strongly for the immediate despatch to the United States of America of the special delegation which it has for some time been under consideration to send out to deal with the question of funding, and he deprecates any suggestion of postponing the departure of such delegation. He takes the view that &quot;the United States Government intends that their note should be looked upon as an official proposal for the commencement of negotiations for &apos;&apos; settling or refunding,&apos;&apos; and that the United States Government has no intention whatever of making any new or wider proposal with regard to a discussion of reparation and debts&quot; at any rate before we have discussed the question of the British[8482] B
debt with the Commission. . . . The United States Government&apos;s powers are strictly limited by the law (of the 9th February, 1922), and it would be futile for me to try to get them to agree to negotiations being commenced on any other matter save that of refunding. Should any circumstances exist which would absolutely preclude us from agreeing to any solution which the Commission^ mandate would allow it to offer (subject, of course, to most-favoured-nation treatment), I consider that it would be far better fully to inform the United States Government of the fact when answering their note, rather than to despatch a delegation whose prospects of success would ab initio be non-existent.(The reference to most-favoured-nation treatment in Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;s despatch is explained by an earlier telegram from him dated the 25th April, in which he says that &apos;&apos; The Secretary of State is inclined to believe that the United States Government would be prepared tb enter into a convention or treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government to the general effect that they would not give to any war debt or nation better terms than they give us without our consent.&quot; The last three words take practically all value from this suggestion. We have an equally good (or bad) means of self-protection already in our ability to refuse to agree to give better terms to our own Allied debtors than the United States Government gives us.)IV. An examination^ of the text of the Law of the 9th February, 1922, fully confirms the statement that the Commission is powerless to do anything more than negotiate for the funding of the British (and other) debts to the United States Government within very narrow limits. It is quite clear that if a delegation is sent out it would have to confine its official action to discussing with the Commission (not with the United States Government), the particular problem of exchanging the existing demand obligations by which the British debt is represented into bonds or other obligations maturing on or before the 15th June, 1947, a comparatively simple matter, though there are some points of detail which might prove rather trouble-some. Such bonds or other obligations would have to be in form at any rate marketable securities. Once the terms of funding had been settled and the bonds issued, it would be practically certain that every dollar of the British debt to the United States Government would be exacted, with interest, without reference to what Germany may pay by way of reparation or to what terms may be given by the United States Government to France and her other debtors or by the British Government to the Allied debtors.A decision to send out a delegation will therefore be a decision to pay the British debt to the United States Government in full, whatever may happen in other directions.V. The British Budget for 1922-23 includes  25,000,000 for payment to the United States Government of the interest which will fall due in the course of the current financial year, so far as not covered by the general postponement of interest payments for three years from May 1919. The House of Commons has also been informed that a whole year&apos;s interest, say  50,000,000, will have to be provided in 1923-24. (The forecast of the United States Budget for the year&apos; ending the 30th June, 1923, includes a corresponding entry for interest to be received from the United Kingdom and no other entry for interest on the War Advances made by the United States to foreign Governments.) It may, therefore, be assumed that whether or not arrangements are made in the course of the next twelve months for funding our debt to the United States Government, no serious difference will be made in the figures of the British Budgets for 1922-23 and 1923-24. Any provision for amortisation as part of the terms of funding can be treated as a question of turning foreign debt into internal debt and not necessarily affecting Budget figures. The only two contingencies which would greatly modify these figures would be on the one hand a demand from the United States of America for immediate payment of the capital or the postponed interest, or on the other hand an agreement by the United States of America to reduce or cancel the debt or to accept German or French bonds in lieu.   Neither contingency can be regarded as reasonably probable.VI. The strongest argument against funding is that, while we have nothing to gain by it in regard to our own Budget, we are giving up our strongest weapon for forcing the United States of America to take part in a round-table discussion of inter-Governmental indebtedness arising out of the war, unless we proceed, part passu/with our negotiations for funding our debt to the United States of America,
108\to demand that our Allied debtors, especially France and Italy, shall take immediate steps to fund their debts to ourselves and, at least begin paying interest in cash. I regard it as hopeless to expect that by so doing we should secure any cash from our Allies in the near future. If there is any real prospect of our getting payments from these Allies at all, it can only be as the result of our giving them a further breathing space of. at least two years. By raising the question of cash payments from them now, we should merely drive European public finance deeper into the slough and increase unemployment in the British Isles. If, therefore, we proceed now to fund our debt to the United States of America, we must do so without reference to the rest of the inter-Governmental debt problem. We must make up our minds that our debt to the United States Government is going to be paid in full, and that for the present, at any rate, we can count on no counter-balancing receipts from our German or Allied debtors. We know that large concessions must ultimately be made to these debtors for the sake of peace in Europe. By agreeing to fund our debt to the United States Government, we accept the certainty that we must make these concessions without ourselves getting any of the benefit of the concessions which ultimately the United States of America will have to make to Europe.VII. Nevertheless, I have come clearly to the conclusion that we ought to proceed to fund our debt to the United States of America.   My reasons are as follows :  . (1.) The letter of our agreement expressed on the face of the demand obligations by which the debt is at present represented requires us to convert these obligations into long-term bonds &quot; if requested by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America.&quot;(2.) It is quite clear that, at any rate within the next two or three years and so far as the British debt is concerned, no United States Government will be politically able, even if it is otherwise disposed, to agree to any remission, cancellation or exchange for German or French obligations.(3.) We have nothing to lose by funding now rather than later on if we are once agreed that the debt must eventually be funded and paid. On the contrary, by funding now we hasten the date at which it will be possible to stabilise sterling finally at par. While no one seriously fears that the United States Government will try to enforce demands upon us for immediate payment of large sums which would damage the exchange position, final stability for sterling in terms of gold is impossible so long as this debt is nominally payable on demand. Indeed, the time has come when it may be safely asserted that the British balance of payments enables the payment of interest and sinking fund on our debt to the United States of America to be paid without any serious exchange difficulty. The problem is not how to find the dollars, but simply how to persuade our own people to pay the taxation involved in the transfer of the dollars to the Exchequer^ control.(4.) Competent judges assure us that our refusal to meet the invitation of the United States Government to fund will be regarded unfavourably in the United States of America, and that unpleasant incidents may develop during the forth-coming election campaign if we decline to fund. On the other hand, if we agree to fund, we may favourably influence the course of events in regard to the new Tariff and Shipping Subsidy Bills, and in general improve our relations with the United States of America. While I do not advocate our making any overt conditions as part of the funding negotiations in regard to tariffs, &amp;c, our representatives should and will take the opportunities which will offer to point out that even Britain cannot pay her debt to the United States of America if the United States of America refuses to allow it to be paid in any of the forms which are in Britanrs power.(5.) If the restoration of order in. Europe and the settlement of the problem of reparation has to wait for American initiative, there is little hope for Europe or for our unemployed. But once our debt to the United States Government is funded there is much more chance that sentiment in the United States of America will move in favour of cancellation or writing down of the debts of France and the other Allies, and the United States Administration may at last find itself able to co-operate effectively in European affairs. In any case, we shall have regained our freedom to deal with reparation and Allied debts to this country on such lines as we think fit, without having to attend on the action or inaction of the United States Government. We have more to gain by the restoration of Europe than we have to lose by paying our debt to the United States Government, even if-(which I do not believe) there is any real chance of our being let off in whole or in part.[84-2] * b 2
(6.) Though I do not wish to stress the argument, it may be worth adding that there are a number of people who think that our credit would suffer more than our finances could gain by a cancellation by the United States Government of our debt to them..(7.) In the last analysis this country&apos;s prosperity depends on its being able to find markets for the surplus products which its people must be employed in making, if these islands are to support a population even approaching the present figure. To do this, we must be able not only to find markets for an amount of our goods and services sufficient to pay for the food and raw materials and luxuries which we wish to obtain from abroad, but also to find means of placing abroad surplus capital in order to enable our customers to absorb more of the goods and services which we produce. From this standpoint it makes little difference whether we lend the capital abroad or use it to pay the interest and principal of our external debt. The difference arises mainly in the degree of comfort or luxury of some of our own people who get interest on their foreign investments in the one case and in the other case pay additional taxation to enable the State to pay the foreign creditor.The paramount necessity of employing our people makes it urgent that, since the United States Government will not take the initiative, we should cut the knot ourselves, even at the cost of giving up whatever hope there might otherwise be of escaping from part of the burden of the debt to the United States Government.VIII. I therefore recommend that a special delegation be appointed to proceed to &quot;Washington as soon as possible to carry through negotiations for the funding of the British debt on the best terms obtainable within the limits laid down by the Act of Congress of the 9th February, 1922. If the Cabinet agrees to this, I shall have certain proposals to make as to the composition of the delegation.R. S. H.Treasury, June 8, 1922.
