TEE C01M5BISTSThe &quot;Permanent  cnaaission of Wine&quot; appointed by the recent Berlin Conference of the three Internationals met in Berlin last week to consider the application of the United fronts   after mutual recrimination Radek stated that the Third International would withdraw and would propagate the idea of unity in its own way.Interesting statements concerning decisions takenregarding divisional organisers and the labour Party aremade in a communication recently sent by the actingdivisional organiser to Robert Stewart:&quot;So far London and Yorkshire have decided to retain the services of divisional organisers.   London will try to raise  6 per week. ...Whether they can do it is another question.   Yorkshire will endeavour to pay Brown  2 per week.. . The North East Coast have decided to be completely self-supporting9 with a comrade taking responsibility   voluntarily, to be assisted periodically by comrades from outside the division whom they will call upon from time to time. The Welsh Divisional Council meets this week-end when I shall be in attendance personally to explain the situation.   In this division it is very doubtful whether they will retain, the services of Comrade WilsonB   This is a pity for he is a good comrade.   I have had several letters from Wales lamenting the decision&quot;&apos;of headquarters v each letter urging an alteration of the decision., which gives me the impression that they still&quot; think that we have cash in hand which will enable us to alter such a decision...&quot;Re the Labour Party Conference, I am still awaiting replies to my S.O.S* sent out to all the divisions for names and addresses of comrades who will be attending.   In the London area the final ballot has yet to be taken in many instances&apos;, but you can rest assured that this information will be sent to you along with anything that transpires between headquarters and the Executive Committee of the Labour Party.   Further, we had a hell&apos;s fire row yesterday at the Consultative meeting, because the Editorial department had not made our relations with the Labour Party the main feature of the &apos;sCommun:ist1 for the current week, and it has now been definitely decided that right up to the Conference in Edinburgh the paper will apply itself to all that is implied in the Conference decision to seek affiliation to the Labour Party.   A note will be put in the paper informing the general membership that the matter in the forthcoming sheets of the Communist&quot;relating/
relating to -theJkabour Party is-for their-?aidanoeleading up to the Conference.&quot;    * -It&apos; is reported from a source which has hitherto proved reliable that most of the Russian money sent to this countryj will, in future, he devoted to the Red International ef Labc Unions hut that the funds will bfe carefully controlled to avoid waste:   John Strain is particularly active among the woodworkers in Scotland^It is stated in communist circles that all the Soviet ships coming to Great Britain will in future arrive minus one of the crew:   a British seaman will be signed on, treatel well and discharged after a trip or two:   he will then be replaced.by another Englishmant the idea being that these meif will become converted to bolshevisia,,A group ^of women communists in London is being put throi 8 course, of instruction in accordance with the thesis of the Third International:   these women are being trained in organisation, economics and home polities.   Helen Crawfurd is active in the, same sphere in the north and states that women&apos;s groups have been formed in Manchester, Newcastle, Dundee, Eerth and Greenock but that owing to misunderstanding little success has so far been achieved in Glasgow,   She was present at the recent Labour Women&apos;s Conference at Leamingtoi and reports that good work Was done by the. small group of communists:   the delegate   from the London Trades Oouncil was communist and specie! attention was paid by the extremists to housings, infant welfare and unemployment.The -Scottish organiser Las been informed that head-quarters, will find-the money for the rent, rates and taxes of the old offices but that all the expenses.of the new premises must be met by the Division.

A ba!ton charge was made and four men were arrested *The Chief Constable&quot;&apos;of Staffordshire- informs me - that on May 22nd contingents of unemployed:from Handsworth, Smethwiok, Wednesbury and Oldburymarched to: the West Bromwich Union and held a meeting which was addressed by Tom Dingley and otherextremists:/
extremists:   the Guardians refused to receive a deputation. The Chief Constable informs me that the entire proceedings were organised by the Smethwiok communists who intended to create a serious disturbance but desisted when they found the   police in full force.The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that there is renewed activity among the unemployed In that oity: this fact may be due in part, to a visit from Tom Dingley, against whom he is taking proceedings, as well as to alterations in unemployment benefits.   On May 28th about 1,000 unemployed marched in procession to Summerfield Park where about 3,000 people listened to speeches from nine platforms:   resolutions were passed demanding admittance to the workhouse, failing the immediate adoption of the scale of relief claimed by the National Administrative Council ef Unemployed and calling upon that body to organise simultaneous mass demonstrations throughout the country &quot;with a view to determining a national no-rent strike, the same to be declared at further similar demonstrations, where a statement will be made of the decision arrived at nationally, should suoh decision be successful in a warranting a strike.&quot;    The second resolution is in accordance with the plans made at the recent London conference of the national Administrative Oouncil of Unemployed.   The Chief Constable of Birmingham states that some of the leaders are making speeches of a mischievous nature, but that he does not intend to prooeed against them at this stage.THE ENGIBBEBSThe following oiroular is an example of the methods pursued by Communists in oonneotion with the engineering dispute:EHGIUEERIHG/
&quot;ENGINEERING &amp; SHIPBUILDING TRADES FEDERATIONLONDON DISTRICT COMMITTEEDISPUTES ADVISORY COMMITTEE   .14, Baldwins Gardens, Gray&apos;s Inn Road, E.G.1.URGENT jJSED IMPORTANTV , 26th May, 1922.Comrades&apos; ENGINEERING LOCKOUTDuring the next few days, the members of the 47 unions will again be balloting upon the Employers1 terms. The Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation Negotiation Committee have drawn, up the ballot paper, giving what is supposed to be the full terms of the Employers&apos; latest offer.   A document has come into our hands, however, v.hioh we are informed on very, reliable authority, will not be included in the ballot paper, and which is of such vital importance to the future interests of the Engineering Workers, that we are taking immediate steps by circularising the whole of the look-out Committees and Branohes affected; so that if possible, the full conditions laid down by the Employers&quot;in making this offer, can be within the knowledge of the members, prior to taking the ballot.The following is the document referred to:NOTE BANDED SO NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE OF TRADE UNIONS, 20th ^_MAY 1922._-TBE FEDERATION AGREES THAT EXCEPT WHEN AGREEMENTS EXIST PROVIDING FOR.THE INTRODUCTION OF SYSTEMS OF PAYMENT BY RESULTS, SUCH SYSTEM SHALL NOT DURING THE PERIOD OF ONE MONTH FROM THE DATE OF REStMPTION OF work  BE INTRODUCED IN THE CASE OF MEMBERS OF UNIONS NOT PARTIES TO SUCH AGREEMENTS. SYSTEMS AT PRESENT IN OPERATION SHALL MEAN TILE CONTINUE. THE PERIOD REFERRED TO SHALL BE UTILISED BY THE FEDERATION &amp; THE TRADE UNIONS CONCERNED IN NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE PURPOSE  &apos; OF ARRIVING AT AN AGREED BASIS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH, SYSTEM. .....:&apos;The foregoing is an exact copy of a document handed out by the engineering and National Employers V Federation, and indicates quite definitely,:that the Negotiating Committee  . of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation have agreed wit with the Employers to sit down with them one month after resumption of work, and negotiate the question of the Introduction of payment by results in such shops where such system has not before been in operation.The date on the head of the document proves also, that it must have been handed to the Negotiating Committee at the same time as the offer which is being balloted upon, was presented&quot;to them, and if our information proves to be correct, viz., that this document will not appear on the ballot papers, it becomes the duty of every member of every Union in the Engineering Industry, to demand a satisfactory explanation from his representative in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation, the Payment by Results systembeing/
b-aiitg one of the most ooninroversial subjects^ and one which has caused numbers of disputes all over the Country from    Jf time to time, and is being bitterly.opposed by large seci&amp;oaf of Engineering Workers.We are;-iai^ that the Engineering Employers hailinsisted upon, and the representatives of the Engineering &amp; Shiplroiia&amp;rig^ IPederstitfn&apos;&apos; have&quot; agreedt that the Employers shal have, the right to decide upon what men they shall retain, ad what men they&apos;shall-re-engage..  This obviously means that tH intend to retain in&apos;their services, the blacklegs4 who havef be*en helping.... them&apos; to beat you. during this bitter fight, and that the men who have been putting up the fight will find themselves still on the stones.   The Employers are only prepared to discuss this situation after a resumption of woijThe Employers have also;indicated very clearly, that immediately;sfterna settlement has been reached, a review ofl wages will take place, and the sum of 16/6d. has been mentiol as heing the amount that they will immediately demand shall come off your :wagers. .- 7/* You will all/quite re,adiiy&apos; realise the impossibility ofL. bringing about &quot;another stoppage, on; the wages question, once j &apos;) resmptioh of work has taken place, and every-member to whose! notice it is possible to. bring these facts, Should be made tol realise the trap into which&quot;he is being ledv a rid refuse to accept the conditions. * &apos; . (      -v. .; J J .How Comrades, the ballot is to be taken almost immediate! and if you wish 1 to register your determination to maintain t present sonditions in the Engineering Workshops, rotten as t are3 and refuse to be made slaves of by the mutual consent of the Employers and the federation representatives, it is the individual duty of every &quot;one of you. to take part in the ballot, and see to it that he registers his vote against Acceptance, &apos;&apos;        ;.irirRemember what the Engineering &amp;. Shipbuilding Federation deoided- in regard to the Shipbuilding ballot; where notwithstanding the faot that a majority was registered agains aooeptanco of the reduotion in wages, the men were ordered &quot;back to Work in consequence of there not being a two-thirds majority, which the Federation said was necessary to justify them continuing the fight.   See to it, that trhis position cans) arise in this instance, and prevent these people from being able to use such tactics with you, as they were able unfortunately to use with your Comrades in the Shipping.How is the time to line up as. members of the Working Class, irrespective of Craft, Grade or Skill.   Get together through I your mass meetings and joint Lock-out Committees, and let yourj Officials in the Federation know that henceforth you are going to demonstrate a united front, and are yourselves going to settle what the terms of peace; shall be.  .Comrades!

..... The Manchester branch of the Communist Party has suggested, in connection with-;the circular letter regarding Barrow, quoted in report Ho. 156 that the Lancashire Divisional Council should call a rank and file conference of all working class organisations and of the unemployed in order to ensure co-ordinated action.TOM MANMOn May 29th Tom Mann sent en explanation of his activities and of his attitude towards the RedInternational of Labour Unions to Losovsky in Moscow:&quot;... It is true that I do not wish to be officially connected with the Red International of Labour Unions, but it is not true that there is any disagreement or dissatisfaction between any of us here; the twe comrades, Harry Pollitt and Nat. Watkins have always treated me with the greatest kindness and respeot; it Is simply this, I am entirely with the Communists, &apos;and am ever likely to be, I am in complete aooord with Russia, and all of you working for the great Cause; but I am quite sure I can best ad venae the Cause in this Country by not being officially identified; this is most certainly the case, and the reason for my decision.     Instead of being ill and weary I am in the best of health, end working every hour of every day in connection with the Beginners? Lock-out; on Committee work, at Conferences, and at Public meetings.     I never worked herder in my life, and never felt more fit, and I am all the time and everywhere preaching Communism, of course specialising on the Industrial . Side: but now the Engineers at croydon, where Sir Alan Smith, the great protagonist of the Engineering Employers, sits as member of Parliament, they want me to stand against him as a Candidate, and I may possibly do so; in any case I shall be in the Movement all the time.&quot;You may rest assured there is no finnicky business going on here in this Look-out, we are all at it hard and strong.&quot;Please give my very kindest regards to all the Comrades on the Bureau, I much appreciate their good will, and if you and they will trust my judgment we will hurry up and do big things.&quot;
TEE BED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSThe French sect ion of &quot;the Red International of Labour Unions has started a new publication entitled &quot;La lutte de classes&quot;.    Tom Mann and Harry Pollitt contributed articles on the engineering dispute to the second issue   and on the &quot;extension of the influence&quot; of the Red International of Labour Unions in England.   The editor of this paper is Alfred Rosmer who for seine time represented France on the Executive Committee of the Third International:   Rosmer is in touch with R. Palme Dutt and proposes to exchange papers with him.- TEE &quot;DAlb* HERALD&quot; AND THE GO-OPERATIVE movement the Co-operative Party will propose at the forthcoming Brighton conference a fusion of co-operative trade unions and *    labour interests in the ownership of a daily newspaper and the directors of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are seeking to improve the opportunity,of inviting the oo-operative delegates to tea on Whit-Sunday.   &quot;The Co-operative News&quot;, however, views the project with professional jealousy and informs its readers that although the Co-operative Party*s circulars have been dispatched in Co-operative Party&apos;s envelopes the recipients should not assume &quot;that the Union has given any sort of approval to the Party&apos;s request to the Sooieties&quot; to support its proposals. &apos;ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS &quot;As a roault of the unemployed demonstration on May 29thfour men were charged at the Mansion House on,May 30th:Councillor George Wheeler:   accused of being drunk anddi orderly and assaulting a constable - remanded.Arthur Stanley Maidmah:        aociised of insulting wordsend behaviour - remanded.Edward Charles Evens: accused of insulting wordsand behaviour and of assaultsentenoed/
- sentenced to one month*s imprisonment and bound over for six months;-i-Robert Dixon: accused of insulting words anabehaviour and of assault: fined .   40/- with the alternative of eleven days8 imprisonment.On May 29th Peter Harmon, a prominent communist,appeared at Sheffield Police Court in connection with a reoenthold-up of one of the Direotors of Messrs, Outhbert Cooperand bo *IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINArt O^rien is still active as a Republican propagandistend appears to have funds for this purpose at his disposal.She latest London edition of the Irish Bulletin, issued by him from No. 3, Adam Street, and printed in first class style withphotographs of murdered ce -holies, etc., is a very one-sided-     aocount tf the happenings in Belfast.   It is prepared farAmerican consumption and calculated to produce the impression\ that the &quot;English&quot; Government are greater sinners than theOrangemen of Belfast.The annual meeting of the Gaelic League took place in theL.O.C.. Sohools,. Red Lion Road, Holborh, On the 27th May.From the report submitted it is evident that the League, likeits sister organisation the Irish Self-Determination League,is suffering from the effects of divided opinion:   the lastterm of the Session usually shews a falling off but this year it.was very marked:   the eooial gatherings erganieed by theLeague have also been a failure.   The paid up membership showsan increase sn last year but notwithstanding this fact those responsible for the working of the League admit that the resultsof their efforts have been disappointing as the success of theorganisation is measured more by the number of students whoattend regularly than by the paid up members.     This league isimportant/
important from the Republican point of view aa it haB always served as a recruiting ground for the Irish Republican Brother!-and the Irish Republican Army.The extremists olaim that there are still some Irish political prisoners in England and Scotland and, in order to*oal publio attention to the matter, the Poplar branoh of the Irish Self-Determination League is organising a meeting in Victoria Park on June 3rd to demand their release.Roderide Connolly, President of the Communist Party of Ireland^ has recently visited James Stewart, national organiser of the Young Communist League, London, probably for the purpose of starting a branoh of the Loague in Ireland.J-^eph Robinson and Charles Diamond of Glasgow,  who had been to Loohgelly, Fifeshire, interviewing officers of the 4th Battalion of the Irish Republican Army, returned on May 15th. Robinson left for Dundee on May 21st where he addressed a meetir in opposition to Sean Milroy, the Free State speaker:   handbills were sent from Dublin for Robinson&apos;s meeting and were freely distributed.The Sinn Fein movement in Scotland is suffering badly frem laok of funds owing to the continued unemployment of so many of its members.The-meeting of the Scottish Sinn Fein Exeoutive on the 19th May broke up without arriving at a deoision on the business before the meeting. The principal item on the agenda was a complaint against the Thomas MoOurtain Club for refusing to hand money in their possession to the Exeoutive. Michael Gallagher, who was present at the meeting, objected on behalf of the Free State part to the distribution of funds to dependents of prisoners unless his party were represented on the oommlttee.There is a good deal of dissatisfaction with regard to the treatment of men who have been released from Prison,   numerousapplications/
- u -applications for assistance hare been sent to the Secretary of the ExecutiveD who is evidently picking and ohoosing who shall be assisted and there is a growing belief that ap;clinations from those with Eree State leanings are being shelved.   Many ex-prisoners are is very straitened circumstances as they are unable to obtain employment and are refused relief by the looal authority.
