SECRET CP.4009 .Referred to. Committee of Home AffairTHIS DOCUMENT Ib THE PKOPEZITY OF Illy BiaTAH^IO MAJESTY!S ttOVL-IffMENT.CAfclKET.BILL TO AHEiiD THE OVERSEAS TRADE (CREDITS AWD; &quot;-Ii^URi^ETTTOTS, 1380&apos; - lflfel.-Memorandum by the President of the iioard of Trade.A difficulty has arisen in connection with the administration of the Export Credits Scheme.   A new eyetern described as &quot;General Credits&quot; was introduced in the autumn with a view especially to facilitating the utilisation of the scheme by merchants doing business in British goods on short term credits.   Formerly an exporter had had to submit to the Department each specific transaction in respect of which a credit was required, and in the case of several classes of business this procedure &quot; was found-cumbrous in practice.   Under the new system, which was strongly recommended by the Association of Chambers of Commerce, the Department considers applications from exporterc for General Credits up to speoifio amounts, in rospect of specific countries and for specific periods. The exporter is then authorised to enter into transactions abroad up to the amount fixed, and the Department under-takes to guarantee the bills drawn within the agreed period for the goods shipped.   The new system has been taken advantage of to a very considerable extent.Under the provisions of the Acts, no fresh credits can be given after the 8th September of the present year. The question has, therefore arisen as to what date should be regarded as the date of the giving of a credit - whether it should be the date on which the Department undertakes to give a credit (or guarantee), or the date on which the transaction actually crystallises.The question has been submitted to the Lav; Officers who have recorded their Opinion that in the case of. -1-
specific credits, the Board of Trade are justified in regarding the date of the agreement to grant a credit or give a guarantee as the operative date for the purpose of the timo limit imposed by the Acts, but they do not think that it is within the powers of the Board to grant general credits or to give general guarantees in respect of future transactions which are to be entered into after the 8th September. 1922,   A copy of their Opinion i3 attached, (Appendix A.),The usual term for which General Credits are given is six months, and therefore, under the Law Officers ruling, this part of the scheme would already have become inoperative, so far as 6 months&apos; credits are concerned.   The Treasury, however, have agreed that the Export Credits Department should continue to give general Credits on the understanding that the lav; will be amended to moot, the point dealt with in the La,w Officers1 Opinion.   The draft Bill (Appendix h) has accordingly been prepared, and I would suggest that it should be introduced at the earliest possible moment.(initialled) S,B.1st June, 19r:2.
APPENDIX A.OVERSEAS TRADE (CREDIT AND INSURANCE)* ACT. 1920.OPINION OfThe Law Offioere of the Crown and Mr. W. Bowstead.1*     We aro of opinion that in the case ot special oredits the Board are justified in regarding the date of the agreement to grant the credit or give the guarantee as the operative date for the purpose of the time limit imposed by the Acts, and therefore that special credits promised before the 8th September, 1922, are Intra vires although they may not crystallise until aftor that date.   But we do not think that it is within the powers of the Board to grant general credits or give general guarantees in respect of future transactions which are to be entered into aftor the 8th September, 1922.    A contrary construction of the statutes would make the provisions fixing the time limit practically illusory.   For instance, the Board might on the   1st September, 1922, agree to grant a general credit in respect of transactions to be entered into during the following three years.2.    We have nothing to add.(sgd.) Gordon hewart /art (sgd.) Ernest MJPollock. (sgd.) W.*iowstead.Law Officers&apos; Department,9th January, 19
