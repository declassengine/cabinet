We repre-sent also the vital interests of some 750,000 little farmers who depend on the stability of the cattle breeding industry for their existence and who, being unorganised, would be inarticulate if we did not speak on their behalf.We bed you to adhere to the recent Cabinet decision, and to give your support in every way you can to the Leader of the House of Commons and the Minister of Agriculture in /
the coming debate on.the advisability of altering -the Diseases of. Animals Act of 1896,In considering whether you. ,-can .properly&apos; give us your .support certain questions are sure to arise :ih your-,minu9 and we venture.to set thorn forth here and&apos;&apos;-to supply the correct answers to them.-: -.v ..-We. have no axe&apos; to grind beyond our grave .anxiety on account of the present crisis -in Agriculture and our desire to se*3 the unprecedented difficulties overcome and prosperity&apos; once more, return to our farmers...Our views on this question are therefore unbiassed-dd&apos;&quot;:&apos;  &quot;I&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos;-&apos;&apos;:.&apos;.-.   . -..&apos;.:&apos;.:&apos;-&apos;&apos; &apos;   &quot;&apos;&quot;&apos;;     Iand&apos;unexaggerated.        &apos;    &apos;   &apos;       ,      ;,gjl^     WOULD&quot; THT&apos;1 INTRODUCTION OF STORF CATTLE FROM ..,.&apos;;&apos;-&apos;- .   CANADA CAUSE RISK OF.. IMP OR TAT I CN OF DISEASE?.&apos;. . &apos; -,v-j    -&apos;.;Although-it is admitted - that Canadian cattle&quot;&apos;&apos;-.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; &quot;are free from fdot-and-mouth disease and pleuro-.&quot;.&apos;.-&apos;-? pneumonia, they..&apos;-are of course liable to other.; - dangerous&apos;&apos;diseases such&apos;as   tuberculosis, conta-V&apos;&apos; &amp;ipus abortion, and mange.------i     .The rest of the North American continent ishot so free,&apos; and the United States have some 3,000 miles of&quot;undefended-boundary with Canada. Up till.now the flow of-cattle has been from . ,.        horth to south, so there has &quot;been little oppor--      xunity for disease&apos;-to; come, from the south,.   But if Canada once established an important export -&apos;- -   &quot;  trade,- the direction of the flow would bo reversed ^and&quot;th&apos;e&apos;&quot;exclu3ioh.&apos;of-disease would be impossible.If this occurred, Canada would suffer as &apos;-&apos;&quot; &apos;-\well - as.- ourselves. .&apos; Q..2I- --- all THE-PROPOSED ALTERATION IF THE LAW BE CONFINED TO CANADA FOR-ALL TIKE?/       It would obviously be-.impossible to give &apos;&apos;-&quot;:&apos;:&apos;-:&apos;--:  -Canada a preference over other Dominions and&apos; friendly countries if they in years to come --&apos;:&apos;-- bould provet a clean bill of health over -aperiod, of &quot;years -which -would have to be agreed. .The old. battle against diseasb would then Recommence- (see-&apos; page 6.- of &quot;enclosed pamphlet),Q,*Z.      COULD VIE DEPEND: ON A STEADY- FLOW OF CATTLE &apos;       &apos;   FROM CANADA?   .. &apos;&apos;       &apos;   -:&apos;&apos;- .Th.e history, of the Export cattle trade of Canada&apos; for many-years past shows it to be very -   - variable from year&apos;&apos;to year.. The hostile-&apos;tariff of the U.S.A.-cannot be permanent&apos;..&apos; - The moment it &quot;is removed the surplus Canadian cattle will once again go to U.S.A.. their natural market.
q,.4. IS THERE kM TRUTH IN THE SUGGESTION II THE &apos; NORTHCLIEPE PRESS- THAT - IE V,&apos;JS DO NOT YIELD &apos; TO &quot;CANADA OVER THIS QUESTION HER. WESTERN &apos; PROVINCES ARE LIKELY-TO WISH TO ATTACH THEM-SELVES TO U.S.A.?-&apos;  Certainly not,   A certain&apos; proportion of the Canadian.population are&apos;of U.S.A. and foreign extrradtion and recently arrived.   They are mostly congregated .in. the Western-States.    No sentiment- binds them to the Mother Country,, nor do her interests.concern them.   Naturally they judge- the--question from their own narrow outlook.Rut the suggestion of the Northclif fe-press that these.states, might be driven to seek annexa-tion to-the U.S.A. is resented by the Canadian press.   .To,give one example, The Montreal Star____wrote:&quot;-&apos;    &quot;Nomoro cruel misrepresentation of the&quot;feeling of the West&quot; could, be., conceived- -than . . &quot;to suggest that its &apos;people could.be stampe-Jed &quot;into&quot;seeking annexation to America, if the &quot;&quot;fiscal policy of the&apos; Home Government were 1 &apos; &quot;hot, deflected in their favour&apos;.&apos;&quot;&apos;Q..5. .-&quot; DOES THE PACT THAT THE DISEASES OF ANIMALS-&quot; ACT OF 1896 PROHIBITS:-THE&apos;IMPORTATION OE ALL ANIMALS PROM ANYvVHEKE ABROAD CONSTITUTE A SLUR -ON CANADIAN,&apos;CATTLE IN-PARTICULAR? ..Obviously, not. &apos;-&apos; .- This talk of a &quot;slur&quot; v/as.only, rousod into activity when.the U.3.A. tariff came into operation and the Canadians had to seek an alternative market..6, WILL THE IMPORTATION OS LEAH CATTLE DECREASE THEPRICE OE MEAT TO.THE CONSUMER?No. ..    . r: -   -...... The price of best grado imported chilled meatgoverns. the market.   Home grown, and killed meat keeps at a fixed margin above it and joes up. and down- in saypathy ... - .&apos;;-.The Pirilay Commission even after mistaking the possible supply of store cattle from Canada, as . being 8 per cent of our meat consumption instead .  of 3 per-cent as : it&apos; really is, only said, &quot;these cattle mi-ht -tend-.to- some extent to doorcase the price&quot;.;   If their arithmetic had been accurate jthcy could not have aaid even this.   In fact their whole report must necessarily have, been different.
Qo70     WOULD THE IMPORTATION OF LEAN OAT Inter REDUCE THE HOME-BRED SUPPLY, AND. THEREFORE BE A REPLACEMENT MERELY AND NOT AN ADDITION?Yes, &quot;undoubtedly.The added risk- of disease, the increased instability-bility of the market, the rush of oattle from abroad at the termination of .the grazing.season at the very moment when the thousands of little hill farmers in England, Wales and many parts of Scotland must sell, -will so shake the confidence of the home -breeder that manywill, give up&quot; altogether, and even more will rear fewer calves than they do at present.The flow of our healthy, sturdy, hill folk into the cities and overseas will increase, and many out-of-the-way but fertile straths and valleys will become dereliot - a real national calamity.The lot of the smaller farmers on the poorer types of land all over England will be made even more difficult.You yourself, Sir, once said that &quot;Confidence was the best fertilizer of the soil&quot;. .   fie agree, and we ask you to see it is not withdrawn from us.Qj.8.      CAS TEE FARMERS OF TEE UNITED KING-DOM SUPPLY ALL TEE STORE OATTLE REQUIRED?Yeso     Many more than the requisite number of calves are bred annually in this Country, but too many are slaughtered for veal.If a steady and profitable store trade was assured they would&apos; be reared in future.     Arable land going back to grass and tie fall in the price of milk will both cause an increase in stock raising IF people have confidence in it.IN VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE IN TIME OF WAR OF THESE ISLANDS BEING -AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SELF-SUPPORTING IN MEAT AND ANIMAL FATS,  IS IT WISE&apos; DELIBERATELY TO MAZE /OURSELVES DEPENDENT ON SUPPLIES FROM OVERSEAS?We are content, Sir, to leave you to reply, with-out ourselves answering the above vital question.Q*10q   DO THE WORDS USED BY LORD  RULE AT THE CONFERENCE OF DOMINION PREMIERS IN 1917 CONSTITUTE A DEFINITE PLEDGE Oil EVEBY SUCCESSIVE BRITISH GOVERNMENT FOR ALL TIME UNDER ALL CONDITIONS?It was most unfortunate that Lord Ernie&apos;s wordscaused a false impression in the minds of theCanadian/
Canadian statesmen.     Lord Ernie uttered them under a misapprehension of the true facts and during ex-oeptional war conditions.     He has several times explained that he never meant to give a definite pledge or bind the Government, and the Canadians were so informed.Neither he nor his successors have ever felt bound by his words.This outcry about, the Government going back on its word was raised by the interested press when . their lie that meat Would fall 6d- a lb. had boon exposed, and they had to find a further excuse to oarry on their campaign.When Lord Ernie himself contradicted their state-ments they reverted to the possible disloyalty of Canada as the next sensational argument.Q.11.ARE THOSE WHO.ADVOCATE THE REMOVAL OP THE EMBARGO DISINTERESTED?No.     The urban dwellers have been deceived with the &quot;cheap meat&quot; lie.Various port authorities such as Glasgow and Dundee are greedy for dock dues.Certain newspaper   owners are seeking popularity in Canada at the expense of the British farmer. The Times and the Daily Express in particular have an intimate personal connection with the Dominion.Certain M.P&apos;s are afraid of the urban vote.   Some are seeking a good Election cry.The meat traders think they can see a bigger profit for themselves.A small section of farmers who are solely &quot;feeders&quot; have experienced difficulty of late in securing stores. This was a transitory difficulty owing to food control during the war, but as the breeding herds are not de-pleted the country is fast recovering in this respect. Lately they have been soared by the fallacious theory that foot-and-mouth disease came from Ireland.   Their better judgment has been warped and they are taking a selfish and short-sighted view of the question.0.12. WHAT EPPECT 10ULL THE IMPORTATION OP FOREIGN STORES &apos; AND CONSEQUENT DEPRESSION OP HOME BREEDING HAVE ON AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT?A bad one.     Arable land is going arid will go more and more down tc grass.) This will throw many men out of work.     If theyare to be kept on the land it oan only be by breeding and rearing cattle on the newly laid down land.If there is no confidence in this branch of our industry it will not&quot; be undertaken.     Much land in consequence would not be prcpexly laid dGwn to grass
but would merely become derelict, as occurred only too.frequently during the agricultural depression towards the end of last/century and before&apos; the pass-ing of the Diseases of Animals Act of,1898,In conclusion, Sir, we assert that all hope of growi ing cereals at a profit, except on exceptionally good land, has vanished. ;Stockbreedlng, grazing and dairying must now become the mainstay of the farming community, which is&apos;quite unable to bear any further disturbances and disadvantagesiThe cause of the outcry for the abolition of the so-called Embargo is mostly political in Canada, and almost en-tirely so in this country,&apos; .But the more intensely industrial any country be-comes the more important is it for her to have her agricul-tural area prosperous and highly productive.     In ether words, the importance cf the agricultural community of any country varies in inverse ratio to its voting power as corn-pared to the urban voting power.This should lift the consideration of any agricultural question out of the sphere of contentious politics.Unfortunately powerful sections of the sensational Press are doing all they can to misrepresent this question to the urban population and to make it a political one.They have made one misstatement after another, and have lately even sunk to the depth of suggesting disloyalty to a portion of one of our Dominions, where owing to the corn-position of the communit?/ they think such scandalous sugges-tions may bear fruit, and so gravely embarrass both the Canadian and Home Governments as to force \is to give in.It is inconceivable that the interests of British agriculture should be sacrified to the clamour of irrespon-sible and vindictive newspaper ovmers who know nothing of and care nothing for. those Interests,
Two further considera tiona. ,are&quot; worthy of your notice, we venture to think.First, Sir Arthur Boscawen has won for himself by his unremitting zeal, by keeping in the closest touch with the farming interests, by his courage and straightforwardness and by his sympathy and understanding, the complete confidence of the farmers.    We respect him, and we should deeply regret if, by a vote adverse to his policy, the House of Commons passed what would amount to a vote of censure on him.     But if he has your support as well as that of Mr. Austen Chamberlain, the blow, if it should come^ would be so softened as hardly to count.Secondly, the agricultural community is seriously de-pressed not only financially but mentally.     Men are beginning to feel hopeless.     They have a feeling that most Governments disregard their difficulties.     They know that the present Government happens to contain a more than usually small number of members who can from their training naturally sympathise witfc them or understand the intricacies of their industry.     Despair Is no Incentive to effort.You, Sir, are one of the very few who by your words and actions have shewn us that you do sympathise with ou^ diiliculties do realise the national importance of our Industry, and do wish to assist us.The greatest service you can render us is to lift this depression off our minds.     We cannot fight on with the courage that we ought to show if we feel ourselves deserted.And so we do most earnestly beg of you to give Sir Arthur Boscawen your invaluable support towards securing to ua the policy of &quot;Absolute Safety&quot; for our cattle-breeding industry, which is not merely of national but of world-wide importance.We have the honour to be Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Sgd)    CKEVJE,(  &quot; )    GILBERT GREENALL,( &quot; )    MERRIK R.  BURRELL.
