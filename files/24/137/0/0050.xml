Reference given to tho Committee were&quot;To consider the proposod amalgamation of the- Royal Dutch, Shell, Burmah and Anglo-Persian Oil Companies, and the policy to be adopted in regard to tho British Government1 a interests in the Anglo-persian Oil Company.&quot;
3. Proposals for bria;-7.ing the Royal Dut-ch-Sholl group under British control have been considered at some length on two previous occasions,,In 1916, the Board of Trade examined tho situation of the British Empire in regard to oil supplies ana came to tho conclusion that it was necessary to secure control of foreign sources of supply by bringing about a combination of British interests operating in foreign territory.     It was decided that such a combination would be ineffective anless it included the Royal Dutch-Shell group and the formation of an imperial Oil Company was recommended, with tho Royal-Dutch, Shell and Burmah Companies as shareholders, and with a permanent British majority and control. The proposal was approved in principle by a Cabinet Committee, but certain aspects of it wore unacceptable to the Admiralty, for this and other reasons the negotiations eventually fall through.4, The subject was revived in 1918, when thoPetroleum Imperial Policy Committee, of which lord Harcourt was Chairman, was much impressed with the importance of bringing the Royal Dutch-Shell group under British control.     It was hoped to secure this by arranging for the group to have a larger share in the development of Mesopotamia by increasing its holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company,   A provisional agreement was actually concluded on these lines, but, owing to certain difficulties on taxation questions and to the delay in the settlement of Mesopotamia, the matter was not proceeded with.
5.        The pros-eat scheme, (see Appendix) which has been put forward by the Bunaah Oil Company reverts to the idea of amalgamation, but differs from that considered in 1916 in including the Anglo-Persian Company in the now combination to be formed.   Without the inclusion of the Anglo-porsian Company it would be impossible to secure a British pro-pondcrancc, as the Royal Dutch and Shell Companies hava made large- additions to their capital since 1917.-      The proposals now under consideration, therefore^ involve either the participation of His Majesty&apos;s Government in a great international trust, or the sale of its interests in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with a view to the formation of suoh a trusts6. In the course of our enquiry we have had tho benefitof hearing in turn tho views of the following gentlemen i as to the probable effect of the proposed amalgamation, especially with regard to tho points enumerated in the preceding paragraph:-Rt-Hon,Tho jkrl of Balfour        lord president of the Council.K * G * j Oqivi.&apos;Sir Charles Greanway, Bart.       Chairman, Anglo-Persian Gil ..Company,Sir Henri Deterding, iLB^Eo       Director-General, Royal Dutchpa t roleum C ompc. ny*Sir John I. O&amp;rgill, Bart.

Managing Director, Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company.Bt.Hoc Lord Inchoapo of A Government Director,Strathnaver, G.C.M,,Goj Anglo-Persian Oil Company.Sir E. Hussey PaoJfco, Z.B.E. do.
We desire to express our sincere thanks to these gentlemen for the information which they have afforded to the Committee, which has been of the greatest value in our enquiries. 7.       Throughout our enquiries we have focussed our attention on the probable effect of the proposed Amalgamation as regards the following points :-(a) The benefits which would accrue to the Contracting Companies.(b) The effect such an amalgamation would have on the consumer.(e) The effectiveness or otherwise of the British control over the Amalgamated Companies.(d) The effect of such an amalgamation on other producers of oil within the British Empire^ especially in India.(e) The diplomatic situation.We have also turned our attention to the outlook in future trade for the Companies concerned, in particular the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, if the suggested amalgamation does not take place. 8,      Prom, the commercial point of view there are obvious advantages in amalgamation to all the Companies concerned particularly in regard to reduction of capital requirements and working costs.The Royal Dutch and Shell Companies would secure large and increasing supplies of cheap oil which would be marketed by their existing organisation; the Anglo-Persian Company would avoid the necessity of creating costly facilities for distribution; while the Burmnh Oil Company, at present mainly dependent on a single oil field, would spread Its risks.     The latter Company, as a large shareholder in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, has also insisted on the commercial objections to basing a large and expensive distributing organisation on production which is so fir confined almost entirely to a comparatively restricted area in Persia, )9, Theoretically/
9.     Theoretically competition between the companies should lead to a reduction in the price of oil to the consumer, though it may be doubtful whether this end would be secured in practice * Tt is reasonably certain that under the amalgamation such a large proportion of the supply of oil available outside the United States of America would be under the control of the combine that it would be able to adjust demand and supply to suit its own interests.vie have also considered carefully whether any form of price control could be introduced which would secure a share in the benefit of economies to the consumer.     We are not satisfied that- however specious the schemes which might be designed for this object, any of them would be effective. The witnesses who appeared on behalf of the Oil Companies for the most part frankly concurred in this view, 10..   The intention of His Majesty?s Government when they originally became,shareholders in tho Anglo-Persian Oil Company was to place the Admiralty in a position to draw a large nucleus of their nav^l requirements of oil fuel from a source which was independent of Foreign Trusts and under Government control/.     One of the chief advantages claimed by those responsible for the present scheme is that British control over a. substantial proportion of the world 1s supply of oil would be secured.     Attractive as is the idea of British control we have been unable to obtain from any cf the witnesses examined any precise definition of the phrase. Whatever may be the value of such control over oil properties in foreign territory,  ws are not satisfied from the evidence placed before us that under the proposed scheme an effective and permanent control, which would be exercised continuously in British National interests, could be secured.     In the last resort effective control over oil Companies in time of war can only be obtained by control over production in the producing territory.     So far as this applies/- b -
applies-to the products ^ the-&quot; n^ial Dutch group, in, Borneo it also applies to the Shell Companies&apos; production in the &quot;Jolted States of  mcrioa, Mexico, Eouraania, Russia and elsewhere,    British control of the policy or of the election of directors of Companies operating in Foreign Territory could only be secured by creating shares of a nominal amount with a special voting power which could be assigned to nominees approved by His Majesty1^ Government,     The real management of the amalgamation will inevitably pass to the men of outstanding ability and keenest brain, whatever his nationality,, 11,     We concur in tho i%dmiralty,s epinion that the proposed amalgamation would entail a weakening of their position whereby at present they hol  a long contract with the Anglo-Persian Company who are under the direot control of Hie Majesty^ government.     The only fuel oil that the combinB would be able to produce up to the Admiralty specification outside tho /nglo-Persian Company fieldfl in Persia would be in Borneo and Sarawak,     Admiralty supplies of eil fuel would be practically in the hands of a monopoly in the East, and ono result of the combine would be that commercial storage of oil at ports en the Eastern route would be reduced.The possibility of artificial restriction of production under the combine is also of great importance from the admiralty point of view, and therefore, in order to place the \ c ountry in a position of security as regards the supply of oil fuel, it ia necessary to provide that some considerable portion of the -udmiralty^ annual requirements shall come from a source which shall be as free as possible from this disturbing influenoe.     This is provided for under the present arrangement whereby the .m$lo-Persian Company, having independent control of considerable supplies of oil, ia bound to &quot;Hia Ha^esty^a Government by financial and contractual obligations.     Such an arrangement can hardly fail to havo its effect on the term a and oaaditions on which tha remainder of the Admiralty*s requirements, not already obtained from tho \nglo-Persian Company, v;i 11 bo mot.
IE.     The effect of the amalgamation on oil producdng^cxmpariics within the Umpire, and especially in^India, would he unfavour-ahle.     It would clearly he to the interest of the amalgamated companies to restrict production in the more expensive fields and it is doubtful whether really effective safeguards against such restriction could he devileds     Burmah, whore the cost of production is comparatively high, would he the first to suffer with the result that an industry of considerable importance to India might be crippled,.     Small Oil Companies in India and Trinidad would be open to the danger of being overwhelmed, or forced to amalgamate, and it is possible that fresh capital might he discouraged in these countries by the existence cf tho ccmbineo13*     We consider that &quot;Is Majestyrs Government for political reasons must exercise great care In tho matter of holding shares in an oil c ompany, and it is a matter ox common knowledge that the existing Government shareholding has been a source of political misunderstanding with the United States of yjaerica. I;,or this reason we are ox opinion that, should the amalgamation be proceeded with, it -will be necessary for His :&quot;6jes.t.yxa   -Government to cease to be shareholders in the wlnglo-Porsian Company.     The 3arl of Balfourxs evidence before the Committee was conclusive on the question of the serious effect, on the relations between the United states of .-.america and this country which would follow any idea by the --uaerioan public that the British Government were holding oil shares with intent to gain a. monopoly of the oil supplies of the v.,orld.     Even If HisMajesty Tja Government were to soil their existing shareholding in order to enable tho proposed amalgamation to take place theywould be facod with tho allegation that the British Government were setting, up an organisation in opposition to the Standard Oil Company, and by embittered propaganda they tiould be involved in serious diplomatic difficulties.
,4,     Aftor careful consideration of the arguments&quot;ixLaced&quot;bofore-ms,* :e make the following recommendation to the Cabinet:That His MajGstyls Government should refuse permission to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to enter&quot;the proposed 1carnation.15a     VJe see no reason at present why His Majesty&apos;s Government should part with their existing shareholding in the Anglo-Persian Company, but should, this question arise later serious consideration&apos; should be given as to the safeguards required to assure the position of the Admiralty.V/e are advised by Lord Inchcape as v/ell as by the Chairman of the Company that the Anglo-Persian Company is in a position to carry through its present policy to a successful issue and the former considers it probable that His i.ajesty&apos;s Government could obtain, at a later date, a higher price for their shares in this Company, than would be possible at the present time.     We therefore make the following recommendation:-That His Majestyfs Government should retain the existing government shareholding in the Anglo-Persian Oil company for the present. 16t     Summary of recommendations,(a) That His majesty&apos;s Government should refuse permission to the Anglo-Persian Company to enter the proposed amalgamation,(b) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should retain the existing Government shareholding in the A. glo-Persian Oil Company for the present.(Signed)STANLEY 3ALDT/I1?

APPENDIX.PROPOSED COMBINATION of theROYAL DUTCH/SHELL, BURMAH, &amp; ANGLO-PERSIAN oil companies.Memorandum by the Managing Director of the Burmah Oil Company.The outstanding objects t6 be secured, from such a com-bination of the above as is herein discussed would be -(e)    The financial and commercial control by a British share holding majority over the oil production of the Group which to-day, so far as the Royal Dutch/Shell oil is concerned, Is Dutch controlled.(b) The greater security of the British Governments Liquid Fuel contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Cot Ltd; which to-day isi dependent on Crude Oil produced from the Persian Oil Fields alone but which under such a combine would have the security of the Oil Fields all over the Fforld whioh the Combine would control.(c) As a consequence of (b), the relief, to such extent as might be feasible and desirable from time to time, of Persian Crude Oil production from the onus of having to be disposed of largely as Fuel Oil rather than in the shape of the much more valuable Petroleum products which it containsand for vrtiich there is now, and will be in in-creasing measure in the future a geographically suitable and remunerative market which to-day because of this onus, has to be supplied from geographically unsuitable sources of production,(d) The/
(d) The formation of a strong,British unit acting as one both In protection of British oil market-ing interests against this powerful American Standard Oil interests and in securing further oil concessions throughout the World for British interests - whereas to-day these British interests -as represented by the Shell on the one hand and the Burmah/Anglo-Persian on the other - are com-competing against each other for and putting up the price flf these concessions against each other.(e) So far as concerns the parties comprised by the proposed combination, a reduction, theoretically at least by 50$ of the capital expenditure and running costs of organisations to distribute Petroleum products in the British Empire and else-where, thereby reducing the cost of oil products to the consumer, for ultimately the. consumerdoes and will pay the whole costs of distribution.(f) The concentration ordinarily in the U.K. and/or the Empire generally of the Finance, and of the plant and Stores purchasing operations thereby securing for and from the Empire the requirements of men, money, and materials of the combination.(g) Enormously increased assurance that the Empire generally - and not merely the Admiralty In tha case of Fuel Oil - will be able to secure its full requirements of all Petroleum productsso far as this is not actually prevented merely by the legislative action of the Countries, or any of them in whose physical possession the territories/
territories containing the oil of the combination may be situated.     For it is - and must always be recognised that neither this nor any other g.c.m.g.-bihation, nor any independent corporation can definitely secure to the British Empire, in every conceivable circumstance, oil which is produced in territories not vdthin the Sovereign control of the Empire.These broadly are the general, Imperial advantages from such a combination;   they are capable of elaboration, and many other indirect advantages in detail can be readily Imagined.     Besides those Imperial advantages the attraction to the Burmah Oil Co. Ltd. of such an arrangement - assuming satisfactory terms being 3ecurable - is that it broadens the whole basis of their business and of their security in that it gives them an interest in world wide Oil Fields and markets in place of their dependence on the Oilfields of Burma, India and Persia ?daose geographical position practically, If not entirely, limits their marketing powers to the East and, In a war of rates, largely isolates them there while their aggressors are compensating themselves in ^ther parts of the world for the cost of their attacks in the East,(h)    In one of the ways suggested below, the Government, while not only securing but actually strs&amp;agthenlng the objects they had in view when they made their investment In the Anglo-Persian Oil Coc Ltd., , would rid themselves from the diplomatic and other complications - whether real or imaginary it is not&apos; the business of this Memorandum to decide, but in any case vocal - which have arisen and will continue as/
as a consequence of their direct financial interest in and, a fortiori, natural special sympathy with a particular oil group, viz: - the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.Ltd., The Combination now being considered has been previously examined by Government and in principle had the support of the Beard of Trade but was ultimately not proceeded with largely because, as then presented, it gave merely a paper control to British interests owing to the fact that the purely British assets to be combined had a lower value than the Dutch assets.In any case, so satisfied are those who control the Burmahinterests of the great advantages which their combination with the Royal Dutch-Shell would yield to their Shareholders both in financial results and in actual oil securitythrough the resulting broadening of the basis of their operations that the Burmah Company on this occasion intend -actively and on their own behalf (which thev did not doon the last occasion) - pursuing conversations in thisdirection both with the Royal Dutch-Shell and the Imperiland Indian Governments to tho point where, if not com-pleted, the preposition may be turned down either becauseof terms or of Governmental veto or of both.But if in principle the Imperial Government are preparedto contemplate, and/or in any case not veto such anarrangement it is desirable, if at  all possible, thatsuch a combination should take- the wider scope necessary&apos; tosecure to British interests not merely a paper controlbut an actual financial prepojideratingiit, British share majority.
(5) No definite figures in either direction can at this stage be given, and this because ^none of the parties has so farcome to such elose quarters:    obviously in any case theBurmah would endeavour to secure the very beat possible basis for themselves.     Merely, therefore, for purposes ofillustration it is assumed here that the combination ofthe Burmah with the Royal Dutch-Shell might not be securableon a more favourable basis than  6      per issued BurmahOrdinary Share and  5-1 per Issued Shell Ordinary Share.On this basis the following would be the position, vizt:-5,143,500  1/- Burmah Ordinary x  6^/8 s     34,075,68719,321,296 &quot;     Shell &quot; x   5$     -     106,267,128Royal,Dutch z 50^ (i.e. 60%/$0% in present Royal Dutch-Shell combine) more thanShell.&apos;. r.     159,400,692Total Combination - -&apos;   100*__ 299.745.507..1 . Burmah r 11.37&apos;;? Shell   - 35.45?Total British - 46,82*Royal Dutch     - ,53? 18&apos;&apos;100&quot;(6) It will thus be seen that a combination with the Burmah alone would leave the Dutch interests with an actual share majority over the British interests of over 6;* and British control could be secured only on paper in some such manner as was not, at least generally, considered sufficient when the proposition was previously examined.(7)    But, If the Governmentrs holding in the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd,, were brought into the combine either(a)/
(a)    By prior sale to, and then through the Burraah, or(h)   By the Government itself going with their A.P.O.C.shares into the combinethen, assuming a valuation  which is considerably abovethe basis of their last dividend and the present value ofmoney) of  4/- per Bhare for the Government&apos;s 5,000 , 000Anglo-Persian Oil Company1s Ordinary Sharesj the position3et out in (5J above would be changed to the following effect, viz:-i5,143,500      1/- Burmah Ordinary %  6- z   34,075,687819,321,296       &quot;     Shell       &quot;          0   5^ 2 106,267,1285,000,000 A.P.0.C (Government)     %   4   s 20,000,000Royal Dutch 3 50$ (i.e, &amp;Qf./of, in present . Royal Du44Bto/^^13--Gcn7ibdjn^)^ Shell as above a     159.400,692Total Combination - 100&apos;/&apos;. s    319,743.507.&quot;, Burmah   z   10,68&apos;,!Shell     s   33.24;1A.P.53.C.B     6.25tTotal Britfish   : 50.17^, * , Royal Dutch      ft 49,83r&quot;100?(8)   The result Is an actual if bare British majority holdingwhioh can be made completely effective within the combination for all eoTrmerolal, financial, and political purposes excepting only - and this merely to enable the oonsent of the Dutch Government to be secured - that the Dutch interests in the combination would have control on questions affecting merely the production and marketing of the combined oil production frorc Dutch Sovereign possessions.
(9)   It Is not considered necessary cr-desirable at the moment to overload this statement of the proposition &quot;with arguments pro or con or with fuller details which, if not superfluous are at any rate not absolutely essential to enable Govern-ment to consider and come to a tentative decision in princi-pie on it,     FV.r instance, all the parties involved fully appreciate that Government have the intm?ests of oil consumers also to consider and that ostensible, however invalid, objections on the score of suggested monopolies may have to be carefully weighed in any decision arrived at.     Actually there would be nomonopoly:   because apart from other Independent organisations the Standard would always remain as a powerful competitor.     But on this point - and the possibility of safeguards for the consumer it is not considered impossible for the parties concerned to formulate effective and reasonable proposals and they would, therefore, like to be consulted If and when it may threaten to he a difficult?/ with Government in coming to a decision.(10)    The more restricted combination of the Shell-Mex andBritish Petroleum U.K. distributing companies which was touched upon at the Conference on 27.7*1921 would auto-matically result from the larger scheme and Is therefore not meantime discussed here separately.For THS BURMAH OIL COMPANY LIMITED.Managing Director.Britannic House,23, Great Winchester Street, London, E.C.2,
