A/7(THIS DOCHMBBT IS THE FBQP5RTY CP HIS BP-ITAUSTIO MAJBSTfS GOVERMflTyC A B I IT a T.P. 4058 IMPERIAL TIRELESS CHAI1I(Memorandum by the Postmaster General)(l) The report of the Imperial Wireless Telegraph Committee, which was approved by the Cabinet on August 4th 1920. rsoosasended that stations of the Imperial Chain should be erected in England, Egypt. East Africa. Singapore and Hong Kong by and at the cost of the Imperial Government and in India. Australia and South Africa by and at the cost of the Dominion Governments.   This policy was endorsed by the Imperial Conference in 1921, subject to a reservation by the Australian Prime Minister retaining freedom of action as to the method in whioh Australia should oo-operate.   The Cabinet at the end of 1920 appointed a Technical Committee whioh reported last December and produced a detailed scheme for the design and construction of these stations.(2) But the Imperial scheme has not received the support from the Dominion Governments which the Resolution of the Imperial Conference foreshadowed.   The Australian Government have definitely concluded a contract with the Marconi Company for the oonatruotion and operation of the Australian station;   the Government of India have expressed themselves unable to finance the Indian station, and the Government of South Africa have not yet corns to a decision on the subject.(3) Since the Report of the Technical Committee was received in December, the specifications have boon drawn up, sites have been inspected and the Post Office Is ready to proceed with the stations for whioh it is responsible.But the position has been radically changed by thedecisions
decisions cf India and Australia which males an Imperial scheme on the lines originally authorised impossible and the decision of the Cabinet is required upon the modifications which the attitude of the Dominions necessitate,(4) The situation has been considered &quot;oy the Imperial Communications Committee and the more important of their reccmmendations, which have recently been circulated to the Cabinet, are that -(i) The English stations should be constructed and operated :$y the Govexnmant, and the Australian Govarmnant should be so informed:(ii) The Indian station should similarly be constructed and operated by the Imperial Government:    -(iii) The second station in Egypt and tne station in iilast Africa should be deferred and the station in Hong Kong reconsidered:(iv) The station in Singapore should be proceeded with,(5) I agree taat the English station should be constructed and worked by the Government and should be so designed as to communicate efficiently with the Marconi station in Australia, when the latter is completed,(6) I think the decisions of the Government a of India and Australia are regrettable both from the point of view of practical working and of Imperial sentiment, since they necessarily destroy the original conception of the Imperial Chain, which was based on the policy that each station should be owned and operated by she. Domini on in which it is situated.   But I do not consider that there is sufficient reason for the considerable departure from precedent involved in the Home Goverrnoent making itself responsible for the finance, constxuction.and operation of a Wireless station situated in&apos;India, and I understand that the view of the Indian Government ars opposed to this proposal, I recommend that India be treated on the same linos as Australiaand
and that the Home Government should acquiesce in the erection of stations by the Marooni Company in India and Australia, whils retaining the communicating station in this country in its cvm nands.(7) I agree that the second station in Egypt and the stations in East Africa and Hong Kong should be deferred for the present.   The station in South Africa must await the decision of the South African Government which has not yet been reoeived.(8) The station at Singapore is not likely to pay its way, at any rats for 3oae tizoe to come, and I doubt whether the expenditure upon it could be justified on commercial grounds.   Unless therefore it oan be shown to be urgently required for Military or STaval purposes, I recommend that it be deferred for the present.(Sgd) 5*. Kellaway. 28 June 1922.
