Memorandum by Mr, E.A..L. Figher.The Committee on the Reform of the House of Lords has [en set up: to implement the pledges given by the Prime Minister Id by Mr. Bonar Law, and more than once repeated j that the [varnment would deal with this subject.     t must, however j [press my strong personal view that what with Ireland, Finance,, [employment, and Trade, Parliament will be more than sufficiently Irdenei in the coming Session without the addition of a [asure uncalled for by the public voice, involving large jrifices of opinion,, and inevitably so contentious as to give all the opponents of the Government In the Country a strong plying cry.     For myself I should have thought that, in view the fact that an unkind fate has deprived us of the leisure m Autumn Rooess and that tho Cabinet as a whole has been able to address its mind to this important and delicate oblem, a sufficient justification was forthcoming for a irther postponement of the Measure.     I realise, -however, that Lodges have been given and that acute interest is taken in is subject by many Unionist supporters of the Government in parliament, and assuming that we are. under the unhappy necessity   putting out a plan for a new House of Lords I offer, the 11 oTing solution as being perhaps the least objectionable of le various methods which may be suggested for the redemption of ie G o v ernrnent1 s pledge .,
In framing these proposals I have had in view the desirability, firstly, of founding the Second Chamber upon a clear and intelligible principle, involving the least possible disturbance of existing traditions, and secondly, of so arranging for the adjustmoit of oonflicts between the two members of the Legislature as to provide (1) a reasonable period of delay, (S) opportunities for joint discussion, and (3) the passage of Measure supported either by an overwhelming majority in the House of/Commons with little assistanoe from the. House of lords: or by an average majority in.the House, of Commons aided by an average minority in: the Second Chamber.I propose then a Second Chamber consisting of 300 Members j ell Lords of Parliament.     Of these, 230 should be elected by-Proportional Representation for a period of 12 years by the existing body of the Peerage.    The whole of the Peerage should be grouped to go tb or for the purpose of election and every fourth year one-third of the members so .elected should retire but should be re-eligible.   To this Body I would add six Peers of the Blood Royal, two Archbishops and six Bishops, six Law Lords, and 50 Lords of Parliament,. including always the Lord Chancellor ana&quot; ex-Lord Chancellors (if not already elected) nominated by the Crown for the same period of 12 years *   The number of Lords of Parliament so nominated not to exceed five In any given year.   It .will, of oourse, be. necessary to accord to Peeresses in their own Right the right to vote and sit in the Seoond Chamber, if elected.So..much for the composition of the Second Chamber. It is frankly based upon the established and faiaillar principles of Heredity and Crown nomination.    If it be regarded
&quot;    442aa a Legislative Committee of the -exis-ting House of Lords then we should be following, not indeed in the letter but in the-spirit the precedtent already established by the de facto.devodution of the legal business of the Upper House to a Committee of Peers learned in theLaw.    It may be urged that in times such as these there is no particular advantage in following the lines of historical evolution     To this we may reply that at least nothing will be lost in point of substance and something will be gained in point of sentiment by the.nominal preservation of the House of Peers,-even if its legal powers be delegated to one Committee and its legislative powers to another.An Assembly -or Committee const!tuted as I have described, would contain all the merits of the existing House withrone of those defects which flow   from its unwieldy and uncertain size, its wayward and flucti&amp;tmg Division Lists, its occasional fits of irresponsibility, and its large admixture of mediocre intellect and. feeble ohara^cter with many of the highest and most accomplished political minds in the Empire.   It would represent in a very high degree that element of personal merit tested and guaranteed by aotual public service, and fortified by practioal experience, which may properly be expected of an Ideal Second Chamber.   To, suppose that such a Body as this would be intrinsically weaker than an Assembly elected by County Councils or by Members of the Lower House is out of accord with the probabilities of.the case.   Either the Second Chamber may. be wholly dissimilar from   the Popular Chamber or it may be a . pale replica of it.   My submission is that there is every advantage in making it wholly dissimilar and &quot;that a Second Chamber composed, of men secure in fortune, exempt from the necessities of popular candidature, chosen for a period of years sufficiently long, even if they are not re-elected, to enable them to acquire a firm grasp of legislative business and comprising, as it would inevitably&apos; do, a large number of Cabinet Ministers, Judges, and distinguished Public Servants, would have more authority than could belong&apos; to a Chamber partly or wholly chosen by small Electoral Colleges.
It may, however, he urged that a Chamber of this kind cannot be a microcosm of tLvj Nation and that however varied its -composition and however wide its experience, it will necessarily represent a class, the Class of those who pay supertax.    It would, therefore, be peculiarly liable to come into conflict with the Popular Chamber in all questions affecting property and finance.    This is true.   It is an objection, however, which applies to the existing Chamber and is likely to apply to any unpaid Body not constituted by direct election on a broad democratic basis.From the aristocratic character of the proposed Chamber, it would seem to follow as a necessary consequence that Labour would not normally be represented in it and consequently that Ministers should be entitled to speak in both Houses.   Other-wise a labour Government on first attaining Office would be likely to find some difficulty in conducting its business in the House of Lords.As a Peerage would no longer carry with it a right to take part in the legislative work of the Upper Chamber Peers could not equitably be excluded from seeking.election to the Lower House.   I see no valid political reason for limiting the prerogative of the Cfhv/n in the creation of Peerages.    So long as&apos;every peer became on his creation or on his accession to the title a member of a Legislative Assembly, grave political arguments could be brought either in favour of the curtailment of the unlimited prerogative of the Crown or in favour of its preservation as an instrument to be used in the last resort on behalf of popular liberties.   As soon, however, as it is decided that a Peerage ceases to carry with it the right to take part in legislation and that the Second Chamber is to be limited in size, an increase in the number of peerages is only of political importance as widening the reservoir from- 4 - which/
which a proportion of the Second Chamber is chosen.    A Peerage of 4,000 members.. would,,- it may be observed, form a more substan-tial electorate than a peerage of 600 though, on the contrary, there are no doubt arguments against unduly cheapening the dignity of the Peerage.I now pass from tho composition.of the House of Lord^ to its powers and to the problem of the adjustment of r&quot;ifficul-ties between the two Houses.   Here I accept the first four provisional decisions arrived at by our Committee, i.e. (l) That the House of Lords shall have no power to initiate, to amend, or to reject a Money Bill; (2) That any public Bill which contains provisions of a financial character which is introduced into the House of Commons shall be referred to a small Joint Committee of both Houses before -it is- read a third time in that House: (3) That it shall be the duty of this Committee to decide whether any Bill so referred to it is (a) a Honey Bill;  (b) not a Money Bill;  (c) partly a Money Bill and partly not a Koney Bill; -and to report its decisions to both Houses of parliament: (4) that the decisions of this Committee shall be final. With respect to disagreements.arising between the two Houses with regard to any Public Bill other than a. Money Bill, I suggest that such disagreements should be referred in the ensuing year to a Joint. Session of both Houses without tho intermediate process of a free conference and that this Joint Session should be composed upon the principle that the Second Chamber comes in not as.;.-an overwhelming and overriding authority however lar.se may be the Government, majority In the House of Commons, but as an element of. reinforcement for a conservative minority and as a safeguard against the passage of legislation which had not been submitted to a full measure of competent- 5 -. criticism/
criticism and was&quot;not supported by an overwhelming majority in the Lower House.-   In order to ascertain how.a Joint Session should be composed in order to yield this result I an; submitting Tables (see Appendix) illustrating the results which would -follow under six hypothesesA.,   if the Joint Session were composed of the wholeof the House - of --Commons - reinforced -by 100 peers;   . - B.,    if it were composed of ha.3.f the House cf -Commons reinforced by 50 Peers;.C.&apos;,    if it were composed of half the House of Commons reinforced by 100 Peers; and I am testing these results under the two alternative hypotheses (l) of a House of Peers containing four Conserva-tiyes to one-Liberal, and (S).of a House of Peers.containing three Conservatives to one Liberal.   I realise that - statistics of this character must be treated with due caution.   The Division .Lists, in . the-House-of-.Lords dp not always conform to the relative strength of Parties.   On a question concerning Property, the House of .Lords may..generally be trusted to vote Conservativeon matters-of Social, Reform or-Education opinion may very well be predominantly-progressive.    Still, -in - view of the. contingencies of; the future, we are justified in the supposition that Conservative Peers will generally vote against the proposals, of a Labour Government-and that some Liberal Peers would follow them into the Lobby..It will be noticed (see Appendix Table D. Columns I, and III)- that under the hypotheses A. and B. a Liberalmajority in the Commons exceeding- 60 will be; necessary tosecure-a bare majority in the-Joint Session, while in the,  -case of C. the Liberal majority. in . the House of.commons would have to exoeed. 100.    Of the.-three-plans suggested I am.-in favour of 3. . It is - superior to A., as fur ni shir.-, a JointV -   &apos;:     -   - &apos; /Session/-  5. -
Session of manageable dimensions/ and:to C; as offering to a Government powerfully supported in the Commons &apos; a &quot;reasonable &apos; hopedf carrying, some. Of-its Measures.   If it be a primary condition.of agreement in the Cabinet and in the party supporting the Coalition that the parliament Act must go and that divisions between the Houses must be settled in Joint Session, this is the least objectionable plan.     I repeat however   (with J.St Mill) &quot;that the&apos;main reliance&apos;for tempering the asoendancy&apos; of the &quot;majority cannot be placed in a Second Chamber of any Icind. &quot;The character of a representative Government is fixed by the &quot;constitution of the popular House.   Compared with this, all &quot;other questions relating to the form of Government are &quot;insignificant .M( Sgd.)  .  H.A.L. PISHER.,..:..h Deoember-, &quot;1921.
APPENDIX.1.   The following Tables have been prepared to show the working of the &quot;Joint Sitting&quot; plan in the following alternative ci r oums t anc e s: -(l) &quot;here the Join,t Sitting is composed of the whole ofthe House of Commons and a Delegation of 100 Peers.   Table A.(2) Where the Joint Sitting is composed of half the House ofCommons and a Delegation of 50 Peers.   Table b,(3) Where the Joint Sitting is composed of half the Houseof Commons and a Delega-tion of 100 Peers. Table C.The examples in Tables A. B. and C are the same as those n H.L.C 15 namely the six Parliaments between   1837 and 1914 in which the Liberal majority in the Commons exceeded 100. These majorities were.     1358 1281830 1861886 1661906 3541910 1241911 1263.   In each Table the figures are given on the basis that in the House of   Lords the Conservative peers may be regarded as out numbering the Liberal peers in the proportions of 3 to 1 and 4 to 1 respectively.4.   Tables A, B and C. only deal however with what may be regarded as abnormal Liberal majorities in the Commons and in Table S, an attempt has been made to show the fate of Hypotheti-cal Liberal majorities varying from 10 to 150 in a House of Commons of 630 members under the three alternative plans indicated in paragraph 1 above and on the same assumptions as to the respective proportions of Conservative and Liberal volunteers on the Delegations.If the assumptions on which the figures are based are orrect it would, seem that under Table D. Columns I and II a Liberal majority in the Commons exceeding 60 would be necessary to secure a bare majority in the Joint Sitting while under Table D, Column III the Liberal majority in the Commons would have to exceed 100 to secure a favourable issue on the Joint Sitting.
