. Referred to I ^Committee of Home affairs this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.&quot; LIGHTS ON VEHICLES BILL.CP.4047. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;Memorandum f or the Cabinst by the Parliamentary 5 e ore I ary t o the Mini i try of&quot;Tr a nsp or t.At the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on 2nd March, 1922, the first draft of this Bill was considered to be of too indefinite a character.Instructions were given by the Committee for the Bill to be reconsidered and I have accordingly had it re-drafted and present the new draft.The Bill as now framed requires (Clause 1) all vehicles other than bicycles to carry two white lights shewing to the front and a red rear lamp, and in the case of bicycles, one white light and one red rear lamp.It confers power for exemption by Departmental Order of certain classes of vehicle in respect of which the full requirements would be either dangerous or unnecessary.Applications for exemption in the case of harvest carts are to be initiated by the County Council, and in the case of other vehicles carrying inflammable loads by the Body immediately concerned.     The other exemptions are left to the discretion of the Department who will also have power to require distinguishing lights to be carried in the case of trailers and overhanging or projecting loads and by vehicles used as ambulances or on military or police duty, etc the question of headlights is dealt with   separately (Clauses 2 and 5) the general scheme being to prohibit the use of more than two side lights and two head lights and to enable regulations to be made so as to reduce the glare of headlights. This can be done In the case of existing lamps without any expense to the owners while preserving a driving light safe at any reasonable speed.     If greater speed and therefore more light is
20th June, 1922.required, some alterations in the lamps will be necessary.The Bill also contains provisions (Clause 5) for Departmental sanction to the use of special lamps in case of fog end to the use of inspection lamps.Clause 7 provides for penalties and Clause 8 repeals the existing provisions relating to lights on vehicles including the various bylaws made by Local Axithorities.The Bill is not likely to be contentious in character but a certain section of the cyclists will object to the re-imposition of the regulation requiring them to carry a red rear lamp.     This provision Is essential both in the interests of the cyclists themselves and in the Interests of other users of the road.The urgency of the matter has already been explained CP.5597, 4th January, 1922, and I ask leave to introduce the Bill.(Sgd.)    ARTHUR HEAL.I endorse the foregoing.(Sgd.)    CRAWFORD &amp; BALCARRES.
