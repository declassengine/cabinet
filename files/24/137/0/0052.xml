[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.], ^Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET. CP. 4052.CABINET.HOUSE OF LORDS REFORM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE announcement yesterday by the Lord Privy Seal that the resolutions for the Reform of the Second Chamber will be introduced in the House of Lords in the week beginning the 16th July brings us up against the fact that these resolutions have never been agreed to by the Cabinet Committee which sat upon the question, and have never been discussed by the Cabinet. It therefore appears very urgent that this matter should be faced at once. Lord Curzon&apos;s proposals seem to me at the outset to raise some of the very gravest questions which could possibly be debated in this country.The most important point is the proposal contained in Resolution IV for a joint session at which a quota not stated in the resolutions, but understood to be one-half-oi a Second Chamber of 350, i.e., 1.75, are in cases of disagreement to sit and vote with half of the present House of Commons, i.e., 353. This is a most formidable proposal. The franchise has just been extended on an enormous scale on the responsibility of a War Cabinet which contained a majority of Conservative Ministers, and the House of Commons now stands on a basis of upwards of 21 million electors. It is proposed, for the purposes of a Joint Session, to suppress half the representatives of this immense electorate, and to leave half the constituencies of the country unrepresented in the debates and decisions of the Joint Session. I should imagine it would be a matter of the very greatest difficulty to persuade the House of Commons to agree to this, and I am sure that if agreed to and brought into practice, the complaint of the excluded constituencies on the first occasion when the Joint Session takes place will be a most serious factor. Unless such reduction takes place the joint assembly of over 1,100 will be impossibly unwieldy.Assuming, however, that the House of Commons had been thus mutilated and the Parliamentary representatives of half of Great Britain excluded, what is to be the character of the delegation which they are to meet from the House of Lords ? 175 representatives of the Second Chamber are nearly 50 per cent, of the reduced House of Commons. The basis on which these Second Chamber representatives will stand is purely arbitrary and artificial. Lord Curzons plan of reforming the Second Chamber may be as good as any other, but there are an almost limitless number of competing schemes, many of which could show far more symmetry of principle. There are two criticisms which could certainly be made against it: (1) that it cannot compare with the present House of Lords in antiquity and tradition and that it will be shorn of much of the strength arising from history, custom and long usage ; (2) that it cannot compare with the democratic credentials of the House of Commons. Yet this Second Chamber, standing solely on a basis of fancy franchises or selection, is to send a representation to the Joint Session half as strong as that of the House of Commons.Mr. Fisher has prepared a series of tables showing what the effect in a Joint Session of a delegation 1.00 strong would have been over the House of Commons majorities of the last fifty years, taking the party balance of the House of Lords alternatively as three to one and as four to one, applied either to the whole House of Commons or to half the House of Commons. Mr. Fisher has circulated&apos;these tables to the Cabinet at my suggestion (C.P.-4059). The devastating effects produced by a delegation of even only 100 upon the Liberal majorities from 181)8 onwards can be studied in these tables. Judge theu what would be the effects of a delegation of 175. Except for the four-year period L9O6-1910, it would have given the Conservative Party a continued, absolute, over--riding control throughout the whole half-century, and no Liberal Government other than the one referred to would have had the powrer to carry a single measure to which the Conservative elements of the country objected.On these arguments being stated, it was naturally replied that the new House of Lords will be very different from the old one; that it will contain many Liberal [8545]
elements, some Labour elements and possibly on occasion a non-Conservative majority. It is therefore contended that the figures adduced by Mr. Fisher have no relevance. But the issues in the future do not lie between Liberal and Conservative Parties. Both these parties are together conlronted with the steady, remorseless growth of the Labour-Socialist vote. However they may quarrel or agree among themselves, it is certain that the line of cleavage will be between the Socialist, and non-Socialist parties, and that Liberals and Conservatives will be forced to act in many respects together in resistance to the great Socialist movementTherefore the delegation to the Joint Session ii-om the Second Chamber must be considered not in relation to the cleavage between&apos; Conservative and Liberal, but to that between non-Socialist and Socialist parties. From this point of view the composition of the Second Chamber as proposed by Lord Cvirzon will be found to give results even more unfavourable to a Labour Government in the future than would have been applied to liberal Governments in the past on the basis taken in Mr. FisheFs figures. Can any fairmiuded person studying the method by which it is proposed to constitute the new Second Chamber doubt that it will be, as it ought to be, in the future as in the past, an overwhelmingly anti-Socialist body &apos;? The Second Chamber suggested by Lord Curzon would have a far smaller proportion of pro-Socialist Peers than the three to one or four to one delegation stated by Mr. Fisher in his tables I doubt very much whether there would be fifty. To throw a delegation of this Chamber, 50 per cent, as strong as the House of Commons delegation, into a Joint Session would unquestionably amount to a denial of the power to legislate to any Labour Government that may take office, except under the very conditions when restraint is most desirable, viz., those of an overwhelming populist landslide. The arrangements proposed really amount to little less than a refusal to provide means of constitutional redress to Labour and Socialist grievances. It will be stated from the very outset of this controversy that the measure proposed is an attempt to undo and take back the franchise extensions just granted, and to secure a permanent Conservative control of the Legislature, however the Socialists and Labour men may vote.Although these arguments will no doubt be contradicted by the advocates of constitutional change towards the Right, they will certainly gain widespread support among the masses of the people, who will be on all hands assured that the Parliament Act is to be undone, that the House of Commons is to be mutilated, and that they are to be put under a fancy Chamber predominantly Conservative and overwhelmingly capitalist. 1 believe that the task of rebuttal of this by those who cared to undertake such rebutting would prove a crushing burden to Coalition candidates in democratic constituencies throughout the country, and that it might very well bring about just the same sort of conceal ration against the Coalition at the next election as came into being against the Conservative Government which appealed to the. country at the election in 1906. A more imprudent step on the part of those who desire to secure the stability of this country, its institutions and its constitution, written and unwritten, can hardly be imagined.But more important than what happens to parties or party combinations is the great question of the association of the people with Parliamentary institutions. There is no doubt that, the respect for Parliamentary institutions has greatly diminished, and all the violent parties regard them with positive aversion. They know well that, granted free elections and fair Parliamentary debate, their wicked schemes can never succeed with the British democracy. Extreme thought therefore turns constantly to direct action and to forms of Sovietism which, by a series of indirect elections, exclude the popular will. We know how formidable such direct action may become from the great strikes we have witnessed during the last few years. It is surely not the interest of those who care about the stability of this country and the continuity of its history to let it be said, as it will be said, that all other roads have been blocked, and that the constitutional path is no longer open. An enormous impulse would be given to all forms of direct action and of extra-constitutional and anti-Parliamentary opinion, and the defenders of the existing foundations of society will be robbed of the supreme and dominating argument with which all agitation can be confronted  &quot; Convince the people, get a majority, and then you will be able to carry out your schemes. But till you get a majority which changes the law by lawful means, you will have to obey the law&quot; All this argument will, in my opinion, be vitiated if it can be shown that, in hardly any circumstances which we can conceive in the near future will a Labour Government be able to legislate otherwise than in accordance with the wishes of the capitalist classes, and that no majority which Mr. Gladstone
ever commanded in the whole, of his career would afford a Labour Government constitutional means of legislation.This prospect may appear very comforting to persons who hope to build up a sort of dyke or dam behind which property, and privilege may take refuge from the multitude. But at this stage it is pertinent to ask, what would be the value of such a safeguard, even were it created with so much political risk and disadvantage? Suppose a Labour Government takes office in the next few years with a majority of 150 in the House of Commons, producing a majority of 75 in the Joint Session, and suppose their principal nleasure in their first Session is rejected in a Joint Session with the Second Chamber. What would the Labour Government do ? It could not ask for a further creation oi Peers that great reserve weapon of the Constitution will have gone ; but it could call a General Strike, or one could be called for it which the Labour Government would not attempt effectively to resist, and might even actively encourage, and the Second Chamber and the Parliamentary Opposition would be immediately confronted with the choice between immediate counter-revolutionary action and a humiliating surrender. A Labour Government denied constitutional satisfaction for its measures, and acting through the agency of a General Strike could easily compel compliance with its wishes Therefore this barrier, for which we are to risk our democratic; -credentials and our political power, would be found quite useless for the purpose for which it is really required.How much wiser, in the broad Conservative interests of the country, would it not be for us to stand on the ancient, historic prescription of the House of Lords, reformed by any internal process they may think fit, and equipped with the immense delaying power of the Parliament Act ? This is a position which nobody at the present time is challenging, and which, if prudently and skilfully developed; would be found to be one of immense political strength ready for the first occasion when it may be required.There is one further observation to be made. Those who wish to preserve in Parliament in any form the hereditary principle, as such, would be well advised to consider the danger of the course on which they now.ask us to embark. Powers such as are claimed for the Second Chamber by Lord Curzon could never be exercised over the House of Commons except by a body possessing an equally authoritative basis. Such a basis could of course be found in an electorate of, say, over 30 years of age, by adopting proportional representation, by varying dates for dissolution and fixing different terms of service for members of the Second Chamber. Once we are drawn into this discussion, it is to these logical solutions that we shall inevitably be drawn, and in the process the hereditary rights of the Peerage will, in my judgment, most probably be altogether swept away. We should surely pause before we embark irrevocably upon a pilgrimage every step of which will be accompanied by loss of political strength, by disturbance of constitutional tranquillity, by the dividing of friends and the uniting of enemies, for results which, even if attained, will be found at once illusory and disagreeable.W. S. C.Colonial Office,June 21, 1922.
