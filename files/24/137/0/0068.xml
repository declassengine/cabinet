[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET.Referred . Home WtW&quot; Com^teeCABINET.RAILWAY AND CANAL COMMISSION (CONSENTS) BILL.Memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Bill is to be introduced this Session by the Secretary of State for War, who has circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum (CP.-4036, &quot;Occupation of Land&quot;) explaining the reasons for which legislation as proposed is necessary. The position of the Air Ministry in regard to this question is practically identical with that of the War Office, and the statement of the Secretary of State for War of the importance and urgency of the proposed legislation is fully confirmed by my Department. Like the War Office, the Air Ministry is interested in the first and second sections of Clause 1 more vitally than in Section (3), which, since it relates mainly to land purchased for re-sale, concerns rather the Disposal and Liquidation Commission. As regards Section (l), it will be necessary in about twenty-three, possibly twenty-five, cases, to obtain the consent of the Railway and Can-il Commission to the continued closing of highways over lands of which the Air Ministry has been in occupation. The number of cases falling under Section (2) cannot be stated, the policy in regard to retention or surrender of certain emergency holdings being still unsettled. It is clear that it will not be possible to ensure that the consent of the Commission to the continued closing of roads is in all cases obtained by the prescribed date, viz., the 31st August, 1922, or that the Commissions decision on the many applications which may have to be submitted to them for the retention of land temporarily occupied will have been given by the 8.1st August,. 1923. It is, therefore, necessary that the extension of time which is sought in Sections (1) and (2) of Clause 1 should be granted. The Bill is required not less in the interests of the Air Ministry and the other Departments concerned than in those of the Railway and Canal Commission, who would have to sit in continuous session if the applications submitted to them were to be dealt with within the prescribed time.I support strongly the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War that authority should, be given for the introduction of the Bill.F. E. G.Air Ministry,June 26, 1922.[85-69],
