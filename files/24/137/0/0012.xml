[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET.CP. 4012.CABINET. wSPECIAL   REPORT   ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 67.    WEEK ENDED MAY 26, 1922.THE  SITUATION.The dispute in the engineering industry continues to affect workpeople not only in that industry, but also in allied industries, especially in the shipbuilding trades. From all parts of the country it is reported that ship-repairing work continues to improve, but constructional work is practically at a standstill.From the Midlands and North-Eastern. Divisions some improvement is reported in the iron and steel industries, but this tendency is scarcely likely to be continued unless an early settlement of the dispute in the engineering industry is effected. In Scotland and Wales the position remains practically the same. In the South-Western and Scottish coal-fields there is no appreciable change in the situation; in the latter, however, work is being retarded by the dispute in the engineering industry. In the Lancashire pits the outlook is unfavourable owing to the shortage of orders and the recent reduction in wages. In Wales some improvement has been recorded at certain towns, notably Aberdare and Ammanford.There has been a marked improvement in the cotton industry, due apparently to a revival in the Indian markets, which has kept exporters busy.The seasonal improvement previously recorded in the clothing trade continues. A general improvement in the glove trade is also reported.The improvement in the hosiery and woollen and worsted trades has been main-tained in the North-Eastern Division, but in Scotland the anticipated improvement has not materialised.In the building trades, seasonal decorative and repair work continues to flourish, but there appears to be little demand for builders&apos; materials and for constructional work.In the boot and shoe trade, employment has improved in the Midlands Division, but the severe depression continues at Bristol and Kingswood.In the South-Eastern Division, there are signs of revival in the printing trade, but depression exists at Bristol. The position in the jute industry has considerably improved at Dundee and Arbroath, and in the fishing industry in Scotland inter-intermittent employment is now available. Although the depression in the pottery trade continues, there are signs of improvement in some towns in the Staffordshiredistrict.&quot; T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour
NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON MAY 26, 1922.1.

I.^-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An &quot;Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to May 20, 1922.

Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 133,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).
