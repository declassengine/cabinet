THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.P^235* Copy No.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.RABBITS BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I circulate herewith a draft of a hill enabling local authorities to take steps to destroy rabbits which are causing damage on agricultural land.     The bill is generally on the lines of Section 10 of the Corn Production Act 1917, which was repealed by the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act of last ye&amp;r except that the administration is entrusted to County Councils instead of the Minister.     I have been urged to introduce the Bill by the Agricul-tural Advisory Committee for England and Wales and by the Council of Agriculture for England (who have twice passed resolutions on the subject).     It is possible that some opposition to the bill will he raised by the County Councils Association on the ground that its administration will impose additional expense on the rate-payers.     I made it quite clear to the Council of Agriculture for England, however, that no funds from the national Exchequer were available for the purpose and that any expenditure incurred would have to be a charge on local funds.I ask leave of the Home Affairs Committee to introduce the bill this Session.A.G.B,June 16 th, 1922.
