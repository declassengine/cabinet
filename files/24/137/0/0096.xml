This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.62SECRET.CP. 4096.a 0Sired to rcittee of home the CABINET.(Home Affairs Committee.)Bill to Authorize the Payment of Rebates and Distribution of Profits arising1 from Canteen Trading with His Majesty&apos;s Forces.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.During the war, it was found necessary to create two special organizations for the     li purpose of providing canteen facilities for the troops the one, the Expeditionary&apos;Force Gen Canteens, operating in theatres o  war, and the other, the Navy and Army Canteen    2707 Board, operating at home and in certain permanent stations overseas.   In the course of 1919, the Navy and Army Canteen Board took over the work of the Expeditionary Force Canteens, who went into voluntary liquidation.   Between them, the two organizations catered for the Navy, Army and Air Force, and also for Dominion, Indian and American Forces.The trading resulted in large rebates and profits, and, in accordance with the original intention, these moneys were to be distributed for the benefit of those who had contributed towards them and of their dependants.With Cabinet approval, as the great majority of those concerned became civilians after the war, it was decided to set up an independent organization called the United Services Fund, to take over and administer the profits due to such ex-Service men, so far as the Army and Air Force were concerned. The Admiralty did not participate in this scheme.Pai&apos;t payments to the United Services Fund, and also to the Dominions, Indians and Americans, had already been made, when an opinion of the Law Officers was obtained that these canteen profits and the rebates were technically public moneys and could not, therefore, be disposed of for any purpose other than that of the public service without the sanction of Parliament.It therefore became necessary to regularize both the payments which have been made and the payments which still remain to be made as the result of the war trading, and also to authorize the disposal of rebates and profits in future. For this purpose, the attached Bill has been drafted.With the Bill, I propose to lay a white paper explaining the figures on which the Bill is based.In view of the considerable agitation which is taking place regarding the payments of the balance due to the United Services Fund, the matter is very urgent, as no further payments can be made until the Bill becomes law. Negotiations regarding the remaining sum due to them have been proceeding with the United Services Fund and a promise has been given that Parliament will be asked to pass the Bill during the present Session, and that the payment will be completed as soon as the Royal Assent is given.L.
