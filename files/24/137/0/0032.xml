CABINET.SECRET. UNITED STATES SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.The United States Gpvernment have introduced into Congress, and we are informed intend to pass in one form or another, legislation which means a reversion to the old system of the Navigation Laws, with consequences so serious to British shipping and to the commerce and peace of the world that I feel compelled to bring the matter before the Cabinet as one of great urgency.   My proposal is that we should tell the Unitod States courteously but firmly what the consequenoes of this legislation must be before it is too late.The United States Bill is analysed and its effect desoribed in a letter which the Board of Trade wrote to the Foreign Office on April 26th last, and a copy of that letter is attached to this memorandum (Appendix I).   The main points are that the Bill not only provides very large subsidies for American shipping, a matter in which we have no right to interfere, but also differentiates between American and other shipping, the proposal being(l) the granting of differential railway rates on cargoes carried to or from United States ports on American vessels (S) the granting of income tax rebates on freight paid by American shippers to Amor loan shipowners, (3) the doubling of all tonnage dues on all ships and the application of the resulting Increase in that revenue exclusively for the benefit of American ships, and (4) the carrying of at least-50 per cent of the immigrants into the United States in American ships.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1a GOVERNMENT.
For tho moment proposal (4) has been withdrawn, but it is to be re-introducod in an Immigration Bill.The reasons which have led the United States to formulate a measure of this kind are, firstly, the determination to maintain a strong Mercantile :.Iarine, and never again to be dependent as they were in the old days on Europe for shipping in time of emergency.   secondly, they have, owing to the war, an enormous amount of Government-owned merchant tonnage which they are determined to hand over to private ownership, but cannot until the-.American private owner is assured by a system of subsidies and discrimination of being able to make the ships pay at tho pricos the Government is asking.   Thirdly, the hope has been openly expressed in the United States that the British ships in the Combine, notably thOse of the Whito Star, &quot;will bo brought under the Stars and Stripos in the very near future in order to permit them to obtain direct aid from the American Government&quot;.   In other words the policy is to make the running of these British lines impossible so that thoy will seek transfer to the American flag.The Board of Trade     letter of April 26th stating the oase against the Bill was sent to the Ambassador at Washington with instructions to use it as he thought best, but no instructions were given to him to make official representations to the United States Government, and so far as I am aware, none have in fact boon made.   It was not known what the fate of the Bill would be, or whether official representations would be likely to do good.The Bill is being pressed on Congress by President Harding.
The Information which the British lines receive from their agent3 and friends on the other side 13 to the effect that the subsidy part of the measure will be passed in some form at an early date   that the differentiation sections may be withdrawn temporarily, but if so they will be put forward in a new Bill which will be pushed through speedily.   The advice given on all sides is that very firm official representations should be made to the United States Government at onoe.The case for making strong representations is, put shortly, that if a country like the Unitod States reserves part or whole of its import or export trade, whether goods or passengers, to its national ships, by refvising in its ports equality of opportunity to ships under other flags, the inevitable consequence must be that other maritime countries in self defence must follow this evil example, with results that will be disastrous to international trade and international good feeling.The world would rolapse, at the instigation of the United States, of all countries, Into the old bad regime of Navigation Laws.I 3ay wat the instigation of the United States pf all countries&quot;, both because they have always professed the freedom of the seas as a cardinal principle in international intercourse, and freedom of the seas means equality of opportunity in the ports if it means anything in times of peacej and they were amongst the most vigorous objeptors to our old Navigation law.When we in the middle of last century opened our ports to vessels under all flags, in all trades, on a footing of absolute equality with ships under the British flag, we did so on a positive assurance from the United States that they
would reciprocate by putting at onoe our ships on an equal footing with their own ships in United States ports. We threw open all our trades including our coasting trade, the United States threw open its foreign trade but kept and still keeps for its own ships its coasting trade.By now attempting to drive our ships out of their foreign trade, the United States aro breaking away from the bargain under which our ports were thrown open to their ships in all trades.Fortunately wo have at hand a weapon dating from tho time when the Navigation Laws were repealed which was intended to be used in cases of this kind.   Sections 324 and 325 of the Customs Consolidated Act of 1853, which are still in foroe, give the Crown by Order in Council very drastic powers of retaliation.   The text of these Sections is --attached to this Memorandum (Appendix 2)1 propose that the Ambassador at Washington should be Instructed to call the most serious attention of the United States Government to what in our view must bo the inevitable consequences of their breaking away from the bargain mado when we abandoned our Navigation Laws.   It must result in re-introducing into the world at this stage the old policy of the Navigation Laws; other nations will be constrained to follow their example; and that we, very much against our will, will be compelled to consult with our Dominions and with other maritime countries who are prepared to give equality of opportunity to vessels under all   flags as to measures of self protection and also to put in foroe retaliatory powers which we hoped would never have to be usod.If the Cabinet acoept this proposal, it is Important that the action should be taken by the Ambassador himself, who is proposing to leave the States very shortly, and therefore the necobaary Instructions will have to bo sont to him by telegram.(Initialed).

APPENDIX 1. Board of Trade letter to Foreign Office.M.4587/22, Mercantile Marine Department,Board of Trade,3, Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith Street, Westminster, S.W.1,26th April, 1922,Sir,1,   With&quot; reference to your letter A.1772/239/45 of March Both respecting the Merchant Marine Bill recently brought before the Congress of the United States, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the Information of the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, that the Bill is obviously intended to benefit the American shipowner at the expense of his foreign competitor, and a memorandum has been prepared after consultation with leading shipping representatives showing in detail what the effect of the Bill if passed in anything like its present shape, on British shipping would be.   A copy of this memorandum is forwarded for the confidential information of the Secretary of State and of His Majesty1 s Ambassador at Washington.   It is important that the figures given in this memorandum should not be made public in any way.2.   The Board, however, view with even greater appro-hension the effect which the proposals would have on international commerce and, in particular on the commerce between Great Britain and the United States,3.   The foundation of international commerce is thefreedom of the seas and such freedom can only be secured so the Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S. .V.1.
long as the ships of all nations are able not   only to carry, but also to receive and distribute their cargoes on an equality in all ports.   It is only by maintaining this principle that international commerce can reap the enormous benefits offered by the international freight market of the world.4.   Ifo question could be raised as to the right of the United States to grant direct aid to its shipping, but the Board view with grave concern the effect on international commerce of steps designed to secure anything in the nature of a monopoly for the ships of one nation in the carrying trade between that and other nations.   So long as a 3hip to which a national bounty has been granted is in all other respects on an equality with all cither shipping in competition for the carrying of international commerce, that commerce has at its service the international freight market of the world, but if once a nation attempts to create in favour of its own shipping, anything in- the nature of a monopoly, in the carrying of international commerce from or to its ports, that commerce must be placed at a serious disadvantage in world competition in so far as it is deprived of the enormous advantages to be derived from the competition between the ships of all flags in the international freight market.5,   The attempt to restrict commerce, whether Inwards or outwards to national ships, is. a reversion to a policy which had to be discarded in the middle of the last century by this country beoause it was found to be contrary to its own interests and because it had become unworkable under the conditions of a rapidly expanding world trade.   Such a policy is only possible under present world eonditiona so long as it is confined to one or two nations.
-    2506.   In all foreign trade there are at least two parties, the exporting country and the importing country, both having equal rights, and if both insist on the right to carry, commerce becomes impossible,   5 very step towards conferring exclusive advantages on the shipping of one of the nations, must impede and hamper international commerce.   The maintenance and promotion of the free flow of commerce is the object which of all- others is most urgently required at the present time and, indeed, at all times, and the employment of shipping is only a means to that end.7.   The present proposal is directly contrary to the principle of the open door as advocated by the United States Government in regard to China and Manchuria.   It is in con-sis tent with the principles and spirit of the Conference at Washington which seemed to offer such promise of a better understanding and co-operation between the nations.   It embodies a proposition which cannot possibly be generalised and must certainly lead to strife.8,   International commerce and shipping are of such vital importance to the Empire, that^Ki^ Majesty&apos;s Government .vould be compelled, if the American proposals were adopted in their present form, to consider, in consultation with the Dominions, what measures should be adopted for the protection of the commerce and shipping of the Empire.9,   I am to suggest, that if the Secretary of State seesno objection, a copy of this letter and of its enclosuresshould be forwarded to His Majesty1s Ambassador at Washingtonwith the request that he will, in his discretion, take suchaction or make such representations as he thinks best.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed)    C. HIP WOOD.
THE EFFECT ON BRITISH SHIPPING OP THE PROPOSAL..IN THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE BILL, 1922.A.     Subsidies:   Direct and Indirect.The effect on British shipping of the American proposals in regard to subsidies direct and indirect, appears to be as follows1.   Subsidy.The rate of Subsidy varies according to the speed of a vessel but on a 6,000 gross tons cargo steamer, half a cent, per gross ton per 100 miles of travel,   *ould, on a round Atlantic voyage, represent about  400 -  425, equal to about  8 a day in the cost of operating the   steamer.     On faster ships and on passenger ships, the amount of the subsidy would be larger and In the case of a passenger vessel, would reach a very large sum, e.g., on the &quot;AGAMEMNON&quot;, on a round Atlantic voyage would amount to  8,000 and on the &quot;LEVIATHAN&quot;, to  20,000.2.     In come -tax de duo 13 on.It Is suggested that a deduction from income-tax for shippers, equal to 5% of the freight paid on goods transported in American ships, should be made.      Taking an average freight of 20/- a ton inwards and putwards, this would represent a handi-cap on British shipping of l/- per ton on the cargo carried, and assuming the total quantity of such cargo on a   completed voyage to be about 10,000 tons, this would represent  500, equal to about  10 a day in the cost of operating the steamer,3.     Liberal Depreciation allowance In lncone-tax returnson shTpo.This is a matter of internal taxation, but it is presumed similar allowances will be granted to British shipowners in respect of their income-tax returns in the United States.4*     Preferential rail rates on through shipments ofAmexToan ships.At the time   the Jones Act was introduced, the Inter-State Commerce Commission reported very strongly against this practice
and pointed out the difficulties which would be involved.    (See criticisms of Art. 28 of Merchant Marine Bill, 1920, of Inter-State Commerce Commission in Annual Report presented to Congress 8th December, 1921).     Apparently goods are very often sent forward from the Interior long before it is known whether they are destined for ocean transport or home consumption, and the complication of accounts will probably render this system impracticable.     It is believed that it will meet with serious objection on behalf of the Railway Companies.     If, however, it be persisted in, the effect on British shipping would be some-what as follows :-Assigning two-thirds of the cargo comes from the Interior and the average rail-road rate to be about 60/- per ton, on, say, 5,000 tons of cargo, it would represent a rail-road freight of  15,000, and assuming the differential amounted to 5%, that would represent  750, or  15 per day on an Atlantic round voyage of 50 days.5,     Creation of Merchant Marine Naya! Service.Army transport to be transferred to the United States 5Shipping Board. Government&quot;&quot;freight and passengers to be carried in United States ships.These all appear to be domestic matters.6.     The creation of a Construction Fund of 125,000,000 Dollars.&quot;This fund is to be set aside out of the revenue from sales,and may not materialise to any great extent.7,     Payment of one-half of all profits over 10$ into the Merchant Marine Fund.&apos;From the point of view of the British Shipping, this may prove to be an advantage in that it may act as a deterrent tobuyers.8.     Increases of tonnage dues, etc.It is proposed that all tonnage dues, taxes or fees imposed on vessels entering United States ports, should be doubled and that the whole of this amount should      paid Into the Merchant riarlne Fund,
This appears to be an indirect way of taxing the foreign vessels as the amount thus paid is returned to the Amerioan shipowner in the form of subsidy, and though not perhaps a definite infringement of any Article in the 1815 Convention, might be regarded as coming near to contravening the obvious intention of the Convention.9.     Of the above proposals, those which will have the most serious effect on British shipping are ;-(1)     the payment of direct subsidy,(ii)     the preferential rail road rates, (ill)     the income-tax allowances to American shippers.(Iv)     the doubling of the tonnage dues, etc.10.     Apart from the Indirect advantages, such as theliberal depreciation allowance on Income-tax returns, the differential against a British cargo steamer on a roundAtlantic voyage may be estimated as follows:-Subsidy as above ......................  8 a day.Income-tax allowances to shippers as above ...............,.............. 10 &quot;   &quot;Rail road differential as above ....... 15 &quot;    &quot; 33.It is estimated that a British ship in respect of wages, provisions, etc., can operate to the extent of  10- 12 a day cheaper than American ships, so that it may be stated that if the above regulations were put into force, not only would this advantage be wiped out, but a handicap would be imposed on the British ships engaged in the American trade of about  7,000- 8,000 pevyear, equal to, say, 10$ on the capital oost of building.B.    The effect on British Shipping of the Amerioan proposals in regard to immlgrationT11.   The normal pre-war third class movement to Americawas about 1,000,000 per annum, and the following summary ofthe third class passenger numbers carried from Europe to theUnited States of America by British Lines in competition with-10-
the Lines from the Northern Continental and Mediterranean ports gives an idea of how these passengers would normally be carried though the total nurabsrs carried in 1920 and 1921 were abnor-mally low for the reason that :-(a)   during 1920 there was an insufficiency of tonnage available to move the traffic offering, and   (b)   in 1921 the traffic wag, adversely affected by the poor labour conditions existing in America, and during the last six months of the year by ths restrictions of the United States 3$ Act.Statistics of Third Class Westbound carryings, europe to U.S.A71920.       1921.British Llne&apos;s CarryingsBritish Passengers ...................... 64,370 34,696Scandinavian &amp; Finnish Passengers....... 4,671 3,293Continental Passengers via British ports, 18,339 35,211 Continental Passengers via NorthernContinental ports..................... 22,665 11,302Mediterranean Traffic via MediterraneanService Steamers...................... 32,161 16,004142,206 a 100,506 -2Q% 27%Northern Continental Lines (not including British Lines in continental Trade.)1920. 1921.From Continental Ports .................. 161,206 114,688From British Ports ......................       - 162From Scandinavian Ports .................   27,904 26,366Total traffic by Northern -Continental Lines .................... 189,110.141,216*38$ 59$Mediterranean Lines (Not including British Lines &apos;       1       .        m Mediterranean Trade).From Mediterranean Ports ................... 171,909 * 125,408 *34$ 34$Total Third Class Traffic All Lines ........ 503,225*367,130 &quot;100%        100%
Of the above numbers, the Amerioan Flag vessels carried a very small proportion indeed - not more than about 39,140 or 8% in 1920 and 5S,946 or 14$ in 1981.IS. The proposals now before Congress under which these small proportionate carryings would be increased to at least 50J2 are almost oertain to invite retaliatory legislation on the part of the ^iuropean countries of origin with a view to developing their own mercantile marine by restrictive legislation on similar lines to the proposals nov; made by the^.Amerioan Government.   This situation would result in ohaos and if carried to its logioal conclusion would create a deadlock in that emigrants mijtht on the one hand be prohibited from travelling except on their national steamers, whilst on the other hand the American Government would prohibit their immigration to America except on American vessels,13. Apart from this, however, it is quite imposBible for the British Steamship Lines to operate profitably their North Atlantic Passenger Services without the assistance of the emigration movement; and if they are at the present critical period to be subjected to the further drastio re. duction in their potential carryings by the provisions relating to Immigration in the Bill now before Congress, it will, in their opinion, mean that sooner or later several of the British ijines will be driven out of business. C.   Restriction of trade with the Philippines .14. The United States do not appear to have had any sub-stantial commercial interest in the Philippines prior to the year 1898 when these Islands were taken over by the United States from Spain, Up to that time, the trade of the Islands had been almost wholly in the hands of Spanish and British merohantsand sea transport was conducted by Britiah and Spanish vessels.   Since that date, however, assisted by preferential duties, Amerioan ^erohants have taken a considerable place in the general trade of
the Islands but the sea transport even up to the end of the.late war was almost entirely conducted by British and Japanese shipping.15. Full particulars of the export trade between the Fhilippines and the U.S.A. for the year 19S1 do not appear to be available, but the figures published for the year 1920 show that the trade was conducted by British merchants up to the extent of nearly one-half of the total as will be seen from the following figures:-Hemp &amp; Copra.^apey tons,bales.        -British.............    485,000 19,500Amerioan &amp; Fhilippine 373,000 5,000 Other nationalities,i.e., Spanish,switzerland s s, German, J apaneee^etc..&apos;..............    307,000 8,000Sugar. tons.126,000 13,000Cocoa-nut oil. tons.1,600 40,00044,000       45,00016. In these ciroumstanoes it would appear most unjust to require British ^erohants who have built up their business through a long period of time to abandon their old connections with Britishjsteamship companies for whioh many of them have long held theiager. cy? and to deprive the British steamship Companies of a business which&quot;they have built up. This Injustice will equally be felt by ^hip-owners of other nationalities, in particular Dutch and Japanese.17. An anomolous position would be here oreated under whioh American ships, after crossing the Faoifio to &amp;anila and having the benefits of high freights and freedom from competition, would go on to India and iSuropean ports with opportunities on British coastwiseroutes equal to those of British vessels - whereas the latter,after.    IIhaving to meet Amerioan competition on the British routes would be de-&apos; barred from all share in the traffio between Manila and the United States.
