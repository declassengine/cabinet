This document is -the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE CABINET. (Home Affairs Committee.)OCCUPATION OF LAND.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.1. The Acquisition of Land Acts, 1916 and 1920, give Government departments Gen. No certain post-war powers over lands occupied originally purely for war purposes, but they 1174 make the exercise of some of those powers subject to the consent of the Railway and Canal Commission being signified within specified periods. The number of applications which will have to be made to the Commission under these Acts is very large, and it is impossible to guarantee that the Commission will be able to dispose of all of them before the expiration of the specified periods. I desire authority, therefore, to introduce during this Session the annexed Bill with a view to providing for those cases in which the application has been made to &quot;the Commission within the prescribed period, but the Commission have been unable to dispose of it before the expiration of such period. In one class of case, at any rate, viz., cases involving powers of keeping public highways closed after 31st August, 1922, I am satisfied that the Bill is inevitable and most urgently necessary.The Closing of Highways Question.2. In some 50 eases, some of them important and controversial, it will be necessary to keep closed, temporarily or permanently, public highways (mostly footpaths) over lands to be occupied temporarily or acquired permanently under the Acts. For this -purpose the consent of the Commission, is necessary, and must, I am&apos; advised, under existing legislation, be finally signified before 31st August next. I am further advised -that neither the Expiring&apos; Laws Continuance Bill, nor any existing Statute, can be utilized to give more time for consideration by the Commission. A number of applications to the Commission have been already filed, and in two cases &quot;orders have been obtained by consent. Many cases are, however, disputed and formal hearings will be necessary. In the circumstances, I see nothing for it but forthwith to pass Clause I. (1) of the present Bill into law. The effect of this clause is to give power, provided any application has been lodged with-the&quot;Commission before 31st August next,.to keep the highway closed whilst the Commission are dealing with such application.The Further Powers sought.3. Clause I. (2) similarly extends the statutory period within which the Commission must decide applications for the continued temporary occupation of land. Under the Acts as they stand at present, the department can, with certain reservations, remain in occupation of land until 31st August, 1923, on its own authority, and with the consent of the Commission until 31st August, 1926 ; but application for such consent has to be made before 28th February, 1923, and. the consent must be given before 31st August, 1923. In view of the number of cases involved, it is impossible to guarantee that all the applications made before the former date will have been disposed of by the latter date. Here again, therefore, the Bill gives power to remain in occupation, after 31st August, 1923, whilst the Commission are dealing with applications for temporary retention up to 31st August, 1926, provided only that such applications have been lodged before 28th February, 1923.4. Clause I. (3) of the Bill relates to the cases in which the consent of the Commission is necessary to the compulsory purchase of land under the Acts.   The most important(b22/176)   100   6/22   w.o.p.   120SECRET. .......CP. 4036.
class of these cases is that in which the land is to be bought, not for military purposes, but for resale, in order to secure the value of works and buildings which have been erected oh it at the public expense, or to avoid the expense of reinstatement. The Disposal and Liquidation Commission is, therefore, more concerned in this part of the Bill than the War Office. Under the Acts as they stand, the consent of the Railway and Canal Commission must actually be given by 31st August, 1924. In view of the number and difficulty of the cases, and the delays always incidental in legal proceedings, the clause provides that if an application to the Commission is lodged before 81st August, 1924, and the consent of the Commission is subsequently granted, the purchasing department may effect the purchase within such time as the Commission may allow.L.
