LORD DERBY:   Mr. Prime Minister,  in the first place I want to thank you sincerely for having received this deputation whichaI have the honour to introduce to you.    It is/thoroughly representative deputation.    It consists of representatives of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners, the Association cf Cotton -Spinners &amp; Manufacturers and all the many kindred Associations In the Cotton-Spinning-Industry, and the only one that can be considered as unrepresentative is myself.THE PRIME MIHISTSR:-   Not.. of -Lancashire.LORD DERBY;   No, perhaps as a Lancashire man I can claim some right to come ho re.    we have, come to speak to you on the question of the Fabric Glove Inclusion under the safeguarding of Industries Act.    ire quite realise that this Jict is law, and that the. Government..has to consider any particular Industry-,which they think should be.safeguarded under that ^ct, but at the same time we want to emphasise to you the desirability, when safe-guarding one industry, that nothing should be done that shall be detrimental to another industry.    In other words, to quote the old adage, it is no good cutting off your nose to spite your face; and before any protection should be given to one industry, it should not only be, carefully&apos; considered what effect it shall have for the protection of that industry,  but also whether it will have.a detrimental effect on other industries,   We venture to think that in the particular case of this fabric glove manufacture under the schedule, whilst it may do good for that particular form of manufacture in this oountry, it may do harm to a far larger manufacture, and that is the various cotton spinning manufactures of .this, country .    I say it may do harm. Gentlemen round the table will tell you that it will do harm. I am.prepared to agree with them, but I do not want to go that far on this occasion, because I realise how impossible It would be for you at a moment like this to accede to our request - as we should like - to have the-Order rescinded; but we want you to refer it back and give, further consideration to it, and let those whose interests we believe to&quot;be adversely affected by its
ijicJxLsLcnxJaav^e.^^^ the reasons why they hole1 that particular view.   We do not say more on this occasion than ask for this.   We ask &quot;because I Understand, under &quot;the terras of reference it was not possible for the Committee which dealt with this question to take the evidence and the views of those connected with the Cotton trade in Lancashire; that it should be referred back with the reference so enlarged that these people shall be able to express to you the fears that they have if this be put into execution,   I make an appeal on several grounds, I make that appeal as justice to the Cotton trade, but I do it from another point of view,   Th* cotton trade is perhaps the one trade In this country where employers and employed have always worked harmoniously together (hear hear).   There have been dixfi-culties between employers and employed, but there has always been a genuine desire, which has triumphed in the end, that these difficulties shall be got over] and when you see such a deputation as this present, representing the whole cotton industry, employers and employed, I think you will realise that they would not have come here unless they genuinely felt that danger would threaten their industry., The trade has gone through a very bad time, and is not out of the wood yet, but if I can judge from what those I have conversed with on this subject saye they..see daylight, but if the trade is to go ahead, it Is to be because those engaged in it must take a bright view of things and take courageous action; they must prepare for good times and anticipate good times rather than look forward from tho present black outlook; and at a moment like this to do&apos; anything to Kake them doubt the wisdom -of &quot;that courage would be detrimental to the trade and to the whole ootton industry, and.,I beg you therefore in the interests of this great industry to hear what the deputation will say on this subject, and to give, I hope, favourable consideration to , those views.   With your permission, I will.call&apos; rpbn Mr, William H&apos;vwarth. to state the ma-nufacturere 1 point of viewoMR. WILLIAM HOWARTH:   Mr. prime Minister, president of the Board pf Trade, Lord Derby and gentlemen, I am speaking, as Lordm    3
Derby has stated, on behalf of the whole of the cotton trade of Lancashire.    I make that statement because the Press has generally assumed that this matter was one for Bolton&apos; Town alone, and I wish to make&quot; this explanation,  that&apos; the cotton trade cf Lancashire divides itself into v*hat are called the BoIton and Oldham camps, but-when we refer to Boltoh of Oldham we do not refer to the&apos; township!; but to the class of work which is carried on in those&apos; towns as centres,  but the actual&apos; work is performed in many other towns.   There are Athertbn, Leigh, practically all the- mills in Lancashire, there are many mills in Rochdale,  some in&apos; -Oldham-, and in every centre where&apos; the cotton spinning is practised this matter&apos; affects them. That is why I make the explanation.,, because it ha&apos;s been gen-erally assumed by the Press that the thing only referred to the products of the Bolt on mills.,.    Then as to the terms of reference,  I have, to put forward that they&quot; were in a form that we protest that the reference to,, the Oommittee that made the Order was wrongly drawn,, and further that if the Order is enforced, the Egyptian yarn trade of Lancashire will be seri-ously interfered with,    I will deal with the second and most important part of our oase first.     - I am able&apos;to bring under your notice a document issued by the Pabric 8*1 dve makers dated 27th June,  and I hope to convince you that the arguments are built upon false promises and do not represent the actuali-ties of the case,.    The glove&apos; makers ask this question - let us assume for one moment that the inclusion of the&quot;fabric glove trade., will have the effect, of considerably increasing the out-put of the British makers and diminish that of the German manu-facturors.-,   The same-amount of yarn will still be required for gloves, and it:,will -be the&apos; - same, whether they sell British or German; it cannot adversely affect tha case,.    They say that. Germany will retaliate that the:, spindles for these are in Lancashire *   The gentleman who.drew up.this particular document must be aware of the fact that the British glove&apos; making Indus-try is a very small one compared with that of Saxony.   Saxony
Glove making, li^e other textile industries, has localised itself, and there is skill and knowledge in such centres which cannot be readily transferred.    It is doubtful whether, if every mill in the British Isles were employed - ahd I understand that at present they are fully employed -&apos; whether the usage of your yarn would be equal to 20$ of the Lancashire yarn used&apos; in Saxony,    This Is an important matter.    If we stimulate the Germans to seek other sources of supply, we are injuring &quot;wider interests than the British makers,    I am not dealing with the Question as.to whether German manufacturers will seek to put an import duty on to the yarns or retaliate In that way -under the Trestles they oannot do that,  but we know that in business prejudice p&amp;ays a larger part in the actualities&apos; of&apos; trade between one country and another, and between individual and individual than what those duties do. had considerable experience in the isigyptian trade with regard to what prejudice can do.    Some 30 years ago - it is 40 years since I entered a cotton mill - there were many mills in Lancashire spinning 40 Egyptian yarn for the different makers, of Germany,&apos; We had some little disturbanoe, and tho. Germans -set.out to&apos;produce that yarn for themselves,   We had six mills specially erected fer the production of that yarn - in Bolt on, and&apos;it is doubtful&apos; whether&apos; this particular yarn has been spun in Helton in the last ten yea;asja    The Germans started ten years ago... und when&apos; thoy had once established the trade they decided that they would never let it. go again.    And then we have, another instance. Some 25 to 30 years ago we had a very big trade in 72&apos;s for he^^suppll^L^l^FTes-to-America and to the other markets of the world,, and not only those in finished form, and those of us who know anything about textile manufactures conceive it to be impossible that British makes will be able to oust Saxony from the market in the near future,  or at any other early date.
Jiapaii^^^ni-tw^^ll^/e^H^^hich&apos; they use for making the Japanese Silks which they send to the rest of the world,    bome con-troversy arose; wo were out with Japan for a time,, and they set out to make machinery for this yarn;  and. I say as a fact that whereas we had 10 to 15 mills engaged in making 72Ts and two-fold 80&apos;s, there has not  been a cwt cf that yarn gone into Japan in the last 14 years, and we lost that trade,  and wherever we lose a trade through any difficulty suoh as. that,: which in -that ease &quot;was through&apos; this&apos;: controversy, we never.get.it hack again.    %ith regard to-.- the - alt eras five- sou fees of supply, the gldve - makers&apos; say that these fine&quot; things&apos; are- made in Ihr each ire It is a pleasant fiction.    Vfe.&quot; ourselves play up to that fic-tioh,. but it- is a&apos; very&apos;-great-- disaster, and -handicap.- to:. British trade; when we have- to &quot;expound&quot; the&apos;virtues of oui- compe&quot; xtors and tell, the world where our-markets lie;-but. then I.-think, the President of the Board of Trade; has-been-furnished with- iiiforaa-ti-oh&apos; as to what is possible &quot;in&apos;France ;-.- If. ho has- not.-, I&quot; am prepared- to give him full details&apos; and&apos; full&apos;-statistics-.    We do-not want to advertise our- competitors- unduly, -but--in- Prance -and in portions of Italy, and even&apos; before the&apos; War&apos; in .-Russia,&apos; and in Poland and-one- or two mills in boaintho class, of yarns we puoduoo for making gloves wore made in these-places; and If there is a profitable- -market, there, iand. they aro&apos; past, the difficulties there,. We shall bo overrun with sellers of. these, and &quot;&quot;the---difficulties we &apos; want - to; get over&apos;in -our own trade and replace&apos; us in the state we were in before the war. will be swept away.    Owing- to&apos;-this controversy our own. spinners &quot;are swarming all over &quot;these German-markets- and the: profits which: we &apos;-obtained have- teen swept away; and- I would like to. call your-, attention to the fact that act ive&apos;,! a crape tit fen has been rabidly built up against use    There are in the. world 15-3, 6.57, 000-. spinning .spindles, i  Of these&apos;. 56,420, 000&apos; are in this: country, , There ..arc in Great Britain 15/726, 000 spinning Egyptian -yarns,  and there-arc in other countries, roughly a quarter, of a million at the present time,  and I say plainly that these spindles can bo
turned profitable in an analysis ofthese markets fend pthei. -products where we have ever held a place supreme.   There are4,219^000 -spindles in course of erection in the world.-  Thesearc- our latest gathered statisticsThey are published to ,the world for other purposes altogether, end out .of these4,.119-j.OOO only 36Q.000 are being or-ccted in Great Britain,239,000 in France, 98.000 in Germany. 7,000 in Italys 52,000in Belgium and 40,000 in Poland, and smaller numbers when yougo.t_.ta other parts such as India and Ohina.THE FTsTMTC yTWT?egypt^R -    Take tho Preach, are those in addition to what they had before the&quot;war, or in substitution ox those destroyed by the war?    There was a good deal ox destruction at -.illo for instance. &apos; &quot;LIB. HOhAKTH:    Yes, there is only, one that has not boon re-equipped - at Thiery.     They have built new mills and fully equipped them out of reparations.THE  KIMS MINISTER:    Yes, I know, but they are not a quarter of a million in addition to what they had before the wareMR. HOWARTH:    It will be approximating to this.   The -major portion of it will be in.-addition to their former spindle-ago. That is owing to the fact that they have taken over mills in alsace, and the production of this class of yarn was known in Prance before it was known in England.     They are fully competent with regard to that.     I think the figures illustrate vividly that foreign competition will be rapidly built up against us because all these spindles can be turned on to a market which, if we disclosed is a profitable one, they will go for.THE PRIME MINISTER:    Has Prance no &quot;tariff at all against gloves of this kind?MR6 HOV/ARTH:     I cannot say.THE PRESIDENT OP THE-BOARD OP TRADE:    She has&apos; a tariffupon gloves. -   almosti .    There is/prohibitionin it *THE PRIME MINISTER:    Is hor tariff lower or higher? &apos;Decidedly &apos; THE PRESIDENT: &quot;/higher., I should say.,: ci 7 -* ;-v
flrf. HOWARTH:    She has on &quot;her yarns as weli&apos;7 and their spin-&apos; ners arc protected in that fashion, hut at the same time by working longer hours and making bigger productions thoy can easily match us in price., and the:/ get.the weight due tothe lack of prejudice against them, which will be created against us .THE PRIME MINISTER:    You think there is  a lack of prejudice in Germany against Prance.  - You had,, bettor ask your neighbour about that.MR. HOW ART H:    I would not say that.   .THE PRIME MINISTER:    Does not the question of British fair play come in?   -ME* HQWARTH:    If we do this as schedule to the Act suggests all sense of British fairplay will bo absolutely destroyed. The argument will be this &quot;We let. you send your yarns into our country free, or with very small tariffs.1,1THE PRIME MINISTER:    Can we. send gloves to their country?MR.- HOWARTH;   We can sell our yarn,, and when they have done a little at that---THE PRIME. MINISTER:. . They want our yarns;, that is raw material, but I should be very surprised to find that we could sond our gloves to- them without a duty.MR. HOWARTH:    I have never heard of a duty.THE. PRIME,MINISTER:-   I am not speaking because I know, but if finished products e?an. go into Germany------MR.. HOWARTH:    I have, never found, it there.   There is areparations duty, but apart from that I do not know anything...manufacturedTHE PRESIDENT:.   There is a duty on everything/that goesinto Germany...     I have boon fighting Gorman ehitioa for year&apos;s -.&apos;&apos;There is a duty; on cotton glares cMR-. HOVjARTII.:;&apos;   I say that these spindles are looking forthe most profitable outlet for their proutlets., ar.d thoy will find it in the rest of tho world..   The rest pi the world will be competitors of&quot; ours unless we. brook dovn this., particular
proportion of the schedule which wo have under survey this afternoon, ith regard to tho other, features that tno7 rials . that wo aro ocking protection, that. is a porver-sion- of - words.     It is ntond-od to raise prejudice that Lancashire is approaching this sttor otherwise than from a business point of vie?;;, we aro -ppro aching this iron the fact th at- we know that our business gill bo jeopardised and.injured in more than one way if this articular schociulo is applied 0     I would like to direct your&apos; t tent ion to the fact that. from an employ: ion t point of view, ;he figures of this, trade aro very importantGenerally peaking tho average counts that are produced are 40&apos;s to 50Ts, )ut the counts for the glove trade are 80 *s.     We have taken a regular survey of that s and from the employment point of view he standard wage paid. for spinning 100 lbs is 47 .08d.    Vie have lifferont advances on that, but they are proportioned in every le, and do not vary one- against the-other.,   v..hen we spin-80&apos;ls and this is the trade under survey - the operative gets 178 *8d J!or 100 lbs against the 47 e08. which . I was referring to.     That is j&amp;l times more 7-and when I call your attention to the fact that Err 1915 our exports to the whole- of tho world wore 210 million f.bs, of which the largest portion went to Germany, you will realise/hat a tremendous proportion our export - trade is.    It was not tQLi for fabric gloves; something like, 40 or 50$ that we mado las for this purpose - not only for gloves, but other fabrics /hich Gorviany exported to ovory part of the world.   In 1921 ormany took a much smaller proportion of our total exports all ^ver the world, but from tho employr^nt point of view tho figure is groator than what tho weight- -measure, -in Itself would toll; fad I think it is a very important point, .. because .that represents hrob times more labour that what a pound of other -yarn would do. In Juno .. 1914/ the . a:ports ,from Saxony woro roughly speaking 40^ x-tho total exports of cotton yam to Grormany.     The glovo &apos;:.ib.ric makers raise tho question of- tho incidonco of exchange on heir, relative conpotitivo. position-.    I do not want to be put in tho position of defending C-or -:ar.y or tho u-orr .ns, fh&amp;yc
suffered too much,, and- most of the gentlemen, round this, table have suffered too much to want to attempt to defend them, or.-assist them unless we are doing more service to ourselves in the process, -but; I think the President of the Board of. Trade and the Prime Minister will recognise the futility of trying to regularise tariffs by rates, of exchange-,.,.. The rate of exchange, was. between 700. and 800; it. is. now anything from 16.00 to 2000-, - varying-from day. to, day,-- and..if we started -regular-i sing. tariffs where-, the&apos;- exchanges are. cone concerned ---- - we shall, be In a difficulty,.all; the world over.-. .(At this stage Lord.Derby suggested that figures might fee- submitted.

They state in their.report that  they were precluded from doing so by the&apos; terms of reference. Wo do not think that is fa-Sir to Lan-oa-shire&apos;.   &apos;&apos; -We think the hurt done to Lancashire will, be greater -than any. benefits that can accrue to tho glove-,makers under this &apos; schedule,.,and-we ack you . to give us what m consider reasonable -fair&apos; play,.-put this matter back, and lot us be taken into account before any order is issued that will jeopardise our trade, which will be the case If this is brought Into force.---11- MR BOOTH/
MR BOOTH:   I do- not propose to- tra-ver-se any st^ernerrt Mr Rowai Lhv has--ms.de-.-&quot;but I dc-want to emphasise- the fact that I cm speaking here for the whole of the operatives of Larx.as-hirec     We are absolutely united on this matter^     There is no opposition whatever^     We speak with one voice,  and I can say that between -300.^000 and 400^000.are affected; and the view taken, of this projected legislation is one of much concern; and the point of view that is taken and which we take Is that the Lancashire trade is essentially ah export trade, and that the only  effect in our view that this projected legislation can have will be that it will tend&apos;to reduce our exportsLargo numbers of people are dependent upon the trade as I have indicated and at least 80$ of those are dependent on the export trade     The only effect of tariffs in our case is to hisider the export trade-,     The trade has for two or three years been going through as bad a time as any other trade in the countryj and I venture to say also ^ it sounds like what we call a bit of swank -you have heard very little of the cotton trade here in Londona    There are other trades which^, if they had had-      . been     -the experience of the cotton trade o3 Lancashire, would have/made much more noise about up here.     We make that some excuse for coming before you today.     As an export trade of course we have always ab-injured any protections     Mr, Howarth did not go into the meaning of protection and.Free&apos;Trade; neither do I. but we cannot get away from the fact that&quot;this is a measure of protection in favour of a very small industry, the effect of which can only be a great disad-vantage to a very large industrye     I do not want .&quot;to develop that further now, but still less should any trade require any legislation of this type in its favour that has a home market at its feet so to speak.     The Lancashire cotton trade must go to the other end of the world to find its market, Egypt and other &quot;places, and. must send its manufactured products as far abroad In the opposite direction.     The only trade here, the fabric glove trade, has the greatest market in the world at Its. feet,     Surely It ought not to&apos; require protection from any country abroad, which&quot;must moana much more disadvantageous position for others than the fabric glove trade has in this country.... That is a. line-, of argument which might appeal to you,/
:   -    i &apos;&quot;. 580and I do not propose to ta.:a up time developing it; but &quot;we do say on behalf of the operatives of Lancashire that not only should you hesitate to put this promoted legislation into execution, but that yon will decline to do so for tiae substan-tial reason that the advantage accruing from ouch legislation will be in no wise comparable to the disadvantage to the larger trades.    Those are the lines on which I was requested to speak to you, and I hope you will give full consideration to thomatter, : - : - &apos; : &apos;,REP I YTHB &quot;IS 1KB   MINISTER;    I&apos; need hardly&apos; soy that eaay represents-tions which are made to the Governmont- on behalf cf so fcnpor&apos;;en$-an industrial Obunty and sc Important      industry   as the I-ezw&amp;h.Cotton industry is will receive the most oarefti ard ar..iiot[s consideration by the Government, &apos;a&amp;d muyt do so.   imonget our-many triumphs the Lancashire Cotton Trade is one ef the most remarkable features, achieving by skill- fenS. enterprise the pre-&apos; dominant position which it holds in the ^arksto of the world. It is a very wonderful tribute to British intelligence, and even those who are not directly connected with the Lancashire industry quote It with pride beoavss- it.is british %n . there-fore any Government is bound V, be very careful in whatever it does not to infllot an injary upon this oonspiouous industry; and it is fram that point of v.i3w that we will oensidar the arguments that you hate put bsf&amp;co ue,   You are entitled to put tho oaso to us that   wo must Wvilgh the balance of advantages and disadvantages to British industry as a whole; that   wo have no right to benefit a small industry at the expense of a greater one, not from any selfish point of view, but simply because the interests of the country are naturally more involved in the1 bigger industry than.the smaller; and you have a perfect right to put ;the case, and not only that, but it is our duty to oon-sider it from that point.of view. .Lot me say this much,though at the outsat, that in re-fererenoo to this question of Preo Trade end.

Toeing the real value of their wages, tho pur-chasing- valuej I am hot fit all sure they are paid-43$ of what is paid in this countryi   it is true that that affects their quality as workmen, and that they are&apos; not able to turn out the same quan-tity or quality as &quot;thoy were&apos;able to produce before the war, but    i it ii. a very rjerious &quot;possibility with which we are confronted that -ycivi/got- the &quot;most highly industrialised country in Europe, except cur- own - &apos; highly organised, - very intelligent, very . entorpriMiH^,, ftrvploying: workmen at Something like 40 or, 50$ of the wages whxoh&quot;are paid to our own workmen and sending those goods for c cmpot ition&quot; throughout the -world,;.. .That is .an unnatural- -    .. ..        ,    &quot; Reformers &apos;   &apos;-&apos;condition that was not for6seen.-by Tariff.   ./..,. or Proo.Tradersbefore- tho- war,,    It, is&quot;, true that for the moment-&apos; it-.has not had.the effect which.-we ill anticipated;- &apos;The German-goods, have notflooded the markets of &apos;th&apos;o&quot;world/-although- they- can bo,, producedmuch mors cheaply thai here ,--&apos;hut- that is- also due.,&apos;to- very, specialc ire u;ns tan cor which may at - any moment como to ,an end.    It is duo.to the fact, that the fall of the nark increases tho iemahAof the hoino market,, It. is an; oxtfiorcinary paradox, that pe oplo buy

He drank all the wine, but the empty bottles are worth more than the 10,000 kronen put into tho hank.- . If you work it out you. will . rind that that is tho case,.    You will see. what the effect is; the effect is that every man in Germany says THere,. is        money tumb-ling down, it is no use my saving;;; aupposing.&quot;;I saved 100. marks and put, it by in the pavings Bank,, that, 10.0 marks will not,-he worth 10. marks in six months.&apos;1, so what he says, is. &quot;I will buy clothes for. myself and my,wife,  or buy a piano or&apos; furniture&quot;.. That has the effect of stimulating the home, market.    The rosult is that when there was,a great collapse,recently in Berlin of tho mark, the -shops were cleared - out, in two or v three days; the shops had no more goods ,because, everybody rushed, there to buy,LORD D3RBY: Would not that also act in this way - are you quite certain that your putting, on this -duty-,, will protect your home made glove .?. -      . .  .,.......THS PR 1MB HIIU3TSR: I.am. coming to. that.
