4w Jl^-J^^y &apos;[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]392Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET.CP. 4046. XTHE CABINET.DISBANDMENT OF IRISH REGIMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I circulate a letter from Mr. Stephen Gwynn to the Earl of Ypres, together with a letter from the C.I.G.S., written with reference to a letter on the same lines which Mr. Gwynn had addressed to me.W. S. C.Colonial Office,June 20, 1922.Temple Hill, Terenure, Dublin, Dear Lord French, June 14, 1922.I ought to apologise for troubling you once more (after a considerable interval, in which many disagreeable things have happened) with a letter. But some of us met to-day to consider if there was possibility of saving the continuity of the Irish regiments, in a new phase. The conclusion we came to was that the Free State was not in a position to make any move towards taking them over at present; that if any move were made publicly to induce the Free State to do so, or even to canvas the question in public, the door would probably be closed definitely; but that a state of things might arise within a few months, in which the Free State might be thankful for the opportunity. Disbandment having been decided in principle by the Imperial Government, the only possible chance seemed to be in persuading the Imperial Government to be dilatory on purpose, and to keep the regimental cadres in being for some months.It was thought that you were the likeliest person to be able and willing to press this course on the Imperial Government, and Sir Henry McLaughlin and I who were present agreed to write to you. Will you kindly take this quite informal letter as coming from us both ?I am writing also to Mr. Churchill, who presumably has the power to secure the delay. We hoped you might be able to move him, or Lord Cavan, but obviously you would know, as we cannot, where your influence could be applied. We even had the idea that the King might be glad to strengthen any chance that may exist of continuing this tradition which represents so great an element in the normal life of Ireland.That life is, as you must know, even less normal to-day than in the last years or months of your period at the Viceregal Lodge, and the abnormal cannot last.Somebody, as I hold, will have to bring back sanity with a big stick ; but the stick and the wielder of the stick must be native products. I have the feeling that the Irish regiments might be the stick.Nothing could be more natural than that you should desire to wash your hands of Ireland, but we who worked under your orders have hopes that you may respond to this appeal, which cannot leave you wholly indifferent. The commanding officers of [8539]
several among the regiments concerned have though not of course publicly  made it clear that they would welcome the project of continuing the existence of their famous corps as regiments of the Irish Free State.I am, Dear Lord French,Yours sincerely,v   STEPHEN GWYNN.My dear Marsh, War Office, June 17, 1922.I beg to return the letter which Mr. Churchill had forwarded to me respecting the Irish regiments. I fear it is absolutely impossible to postpone the disbandment of these regiments. Further, it ia impossible in law to &quot; transfer the services of men who enlist on special engagements to the service of another Government.&quot;There are many other objections which I need not go into now, but the proposition from the Army point of view is one that it is quite impossible to carry out.If the Provisional Government choose to create new regiments there will be no difficulty in letting the men know that they are invited to enlist in such new regiments.Yours,CAVAN.E. H. Marsh, Esq.,C.B., C.M.G., C.V.O.
