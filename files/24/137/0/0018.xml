nerred to ommlttee of Home affairs this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. CABINET.CP. 4018., MEASURING-INSTRUMENTS BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1.     The object of this Bill is to remedy a defect in the existing law under which measuring instruments are free from, any effective control.    Patterns of measuring-instruments can be submitted to the. Board of Trade for approval, but are not required to be so submitted; nor are measuring instruments in actual use required to be periodically examined by Inspectors of Weights and Measures. This position, which obviously gives scope for abuse, will be remedied if the Bill is passed, and it will then be possible to deal with several descriptions of measuring instruments which ought to be subject to control.    Of these, the most important are petrol-measuring pumps. 2. PETROL PUMPS.    Petrol measuring pumps of various types which deliver petrol direct to the tanks of motor cars from underground reservoirs, have been growing steadily in numbers for some years, and the question of their legal status has been raised from time to time by Local Authorities in all parts of the country, who are very dissatisfied with the present position.    Complaints of short measure have also , been made by private individuals, and in the technical press; and in America, where the pumps are much more common than-they are here, a considerable amount of trouble has also been experienced.    On the other hand, the petrol-pump, with its underground storage chamber, is much to be preferred, from the point of view of public safety, to the two gallon can, and is more convenient in every Way, so that there is
00no doubt that it will come much more extensively into use in the future-       It is therefore desirable that the types in use should be brought under regulation at the earliest possible moment, before a large number of possibly unsatisfactory pumps are actually installed. 3.     The principal makers of all types of these pumps desire to be brought under inspection, and have, in fact, submitted patterns for approval under Section 6 of the 1904 Act in readiness for any regulations which may be imposed; and as already indicated, Local Authorities, Inspectors and users of petrol may he expected to welcome the proposals in the Bill.4. MEASURING INSTRUMENTS USED IN FACTORIES.    It will also be possible to deal under the Bill with measuring instruments used in factories for ascertaining wages, such as(l) &quot;Wrap-reels&quot; used in textile factories for automatically measuring the length of material produced by a workman and (2) instruments for measuring by counting, such as scales of unequal leverage which count a large number of small articles, - e.g. screws - by placing a few in one pan, and the bulk in the othor. The proposal to bring such instruments within the scope of the Bill is concurred in by the Home Office. 5* GENERAL.    The Leather Measurement Act, 1919, is repealed (except as regards Ireland, to which the Bill does not apply) as all the powers it conferred will be exerciseable under the Bill.
6.     It urould be neither desirable nor practicable to bring all measuring-instruments directly under the full provisions of the weights and Measures Acts.   Hence the procedure under the Bill is by way of issuing regulations specifying the description of measuring instrument to be brought under control, and the provisions of the Weights and Measures Acts to be applied.   It is intended to deal immediately with the particular cases mentioned In paragraphs 2 and 4 of this memorandum, and the Bill gives the Board of Trade power to make regulations about other kinds of instruments without further legislation.     Such power is likely to be needed having regard te the trend of modern development.Any regulations made under the Bill will, under the Weights and Measures Act, 1904, require to be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after they are made.Authority is desired to Introduce the Bill at an early date.(Initialled) S.B.7th June, 1922.
