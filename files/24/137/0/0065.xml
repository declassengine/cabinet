In September, 1919. a Royal Warrant (Army Order 324 of 1919) was issued 9 laying down revised rates of pay, half-pay and retired pay for Army officers. It Gen. No. provided (Table XVI, paragraph 5) that the new rates of retired pay would be payable &quot; to ail permanent regular officers who, being otherwise entitled, have given paid military service to the satisfaction of the Army Council during the Great War, including officers whOj having retired on retired pay before the war, have been re-employed as officers during the war and have thereafter reverted to retirement.&quot;2. A claim was at once made, and has since been constantly pressed, that those Secretaries of Territoi-ial Army Associations who had been permanent Regular Army officers and had retired on retired pay before the war, are entitled to a re-assessment of their retired pay, as having performed paid military service during the war, and the following arguments have been adduced to support the claim : (i) It is said that their duties were analogous to those of a Deputy AssistantQuarterm aster-General.(ii) They were paid, although indirectly, from Army Funds.(iii) They were permitted to wear uniform, and in certain cases where they had not held a commission or were not entitled on retirement to retain rank and wear the prescribed uniform, they were, if the Association recommended, given commissions in the Territorial Force Reserve and outfit allowances of  20.(iv) Their service  during  the  war  was  permitted to count for promotion andprecedence.(v) Those who had been appointed to the Order of the British Empire were trans-ferred to the Military Division, when the latter was instituted.(vi) The High Court of Justice decided that they were liable to income tax at militaryrates only. v   .(vii) The Admiralty have awarded the new scale of pension to all pensioners whoserved during the war, including those serving in a civilian capacity under the Government who were directed to remain in their civil employment.(viii) Retired Royal Engineer officers, who were re-employed during the war by the ordnance Survey under the Board of Agriculture, were eventually granted the new rates of retired pay, although they were, while re-employed, paid from Civil Votes, not mobilized and not under the military authorities.3. Of the 7 7 Secretaries of Territorial Army Associations, 31 are affected, including 9 who rose from the ranks. As against the contention that the appointment is of a civilian nature, it is stated that of the remainder all but two have previously served in the Volunteers, Yeomanry, or some other branch of His Majesty&apos;s forces.4. The question has twice been raised in the House of Lords, first on 25th April, 1920. and again on 17th May, 1922, when a resolution in favour of the claim was agreed to without a division, but against the advice of the Government representatives. On both occasions, Lord Haldane supported the claim very strongly, on the ground that the Territorial Army Associations through their Secretaries undoubtedly performed military administrative duties during the war, and that the. decision of the High Court as to income tax is conclusive and inescapable.(b22/176)   100   6/22   w.o.p.   121
5. The arguments adduced in paragraph 2 above are not accepted by the War Office for the following reasons in each case : (i) The appointment of Secretary of a Territorial Army Association under normal conditions is unquestionably, a civil and not a military appointment. It carries no rank or commission (though naturally very suitable for a retired officer), and some of the Secretaries both before and during the war have been pure civilians who have- not even been &quot;Volunteer officers. In no circumstances may an officer on full pay hold the appointment.In the Great War, there was no definite line between the duties performed by Army officers and civilians. Both, for instance, made contracts, handled clothing and did Pay duties. Hence, no valid argument can be founded on similarity or analogy of duties. These Secretaries held no different appoint-ment during the war from that they held before or after, though their duties, like those of many others, became more onerous. They were not recalled to full pay, and were, therefore, not &quot; re-employed during the war &quot; in the sense intended by the Royal Warrant, nor have they &quot;reverted to retirement.&quot; They were not under military discipline, nor had any military authority the power to give them orders, (ii) &quot;Paid militaiy service&quot; in the Warrant of 1919 (paragraph 1) means direct employment under the Crown. These Secretaries are neither appointed nor paid directly by the War Office. They are the servants of the County Associations (which are not military bodies nor under military orders) and are appointed and dismissed by them. Their pay is fixed (subject to certain maxima laid down by the War Office) and issued by the Associations, which provide funds out of commuted grants paid to the latter from Army Funds. In 1908, it was expressly laid down that the funds of Associations are not public funds, and retired Army officers serving as Secretaries were thereby relieved of certain deductions under the Superannuation Act of 1887.(iii) The concessions as to rank and uniform were purely concessions to sentiment,and were definitely stated, when granted, as being given on this ground and not as being essential for the discharge of the duties involved. It was also explicitly laid down that no charge to Army Funds, except the outfit grant, was to be involved.(iv) This is not strictly correct.   Retired officers recalled to the Army counted (forprecedence relative to officers on the Active List) previous full-pay service less time since retirement. Subsequently, service after retirement in various capacities, including the Secretaryship of a Territorial Force Association, was not deducted ; but it was not allowed to count positively, and the instruction specifically differentiated &quot; military appointments &quot; from &quot; positions closely connected with the Army, such as Secretaryships of Territorial Force Associations.&quot;(v) Appointment to the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire, admittedly a minor point, was a concession to sentiment similar to (iii). The Order was new, and no very definite qualifications were then (or are as yet) imposed, (vi) The decision of the High Court as to income tax was a legal interpretation of the phrase &quot; service of a naval or military character&quot; in Section 30 (1) of the Finance Act, 1916. This does not oblige the Army Council to interpret the phrase &quot; paid military service,&quot; in the Royal Warrant, in a sense contrary to their intention.(vii) The Admiralty pensioners concerned were in direct Government civil employ-ment and were refused leave to rejoin the Navy, which was not the case with Territorial Secretaries. A concession on this ground would open the door to a large number of claims from other ex-officers and ex-soldiers.(viii) The retired Royal Engineer officers in question were held to be entitled tore-assessment on the technical ground that Ordnance Survey duty (which until comparatively recently had counted as Army service) had already been officially classed as military employment under Article 102 of the Pay Warrant, which deals with employment under other Governments and Civil Departments.6. There is no desire to disparage the services of these retired officers, but the question is one of the interpretation of regulations, under which the Army Council, who are the sole interpreters, hold that the claim is barred. If the interpretation were stretched in these cases on grounds of policy, an equally good claim could be preferred
The War Office,27th June, 1922.L. W.-E.on behalf of the many other retired officers who did work directly connected with the Army during the war, side by side with serving officers, but not as serving officers. Further, a concession on this point might give rise to consequential claims for the pay and gratuity of the rank held, and the financial effect might be very serious. As a matter of equity, it would be unfair to grant the concession to the Secretaries of the Territorial Army Associations and to refuse it to the pensioner clerks of. the Associations, whose claim to a re-assessment of pension is clearly barred by the Warrant applying to them, because they were not re-enlisted.7. In view of the resolution recently carried in the House of Lords, I ask the Cabinet to decide what, if any, action is to be taken, but I strongly recommend that the Government should maintain the refusal to entertain this claim.
