The international character of communist propaganda andJts -danger in countries where the working classes are lessstable than in Great Britain are shown.in the following extract from a report which I have received from theCommissioner of Police for the Union of South Africa:&quot;It is now beyond doubt that the methods of the Russian communists do not aim at peaceful conversion but rather conversion by force end violence, and, , although at present sitting in apparently friendly conference with other Powers at Genoa, it is their avowed intention to overthrow the Governments of other states   this is expressed in instructions , ..    issued by the Third International held at Moscow. Certain of these instructions, which were issued at Moscow on December 8th, 1921, and signed Zinovieff, President of the Communist International, cciaeide exactly with the action taken by Communists in South Africa, more particularly on the Rand, in the early months- of,this year;   from this latter fact end the faot that Ivon Jones, who was at one time a very active communist in South Africa^.. attended the Third International, and who is at present on a speaking tour in Russia for the Red. Trade Iniwrhatiohai, it is highly probable that the communists in the union are guided by Instructions issued from Russian Headquarters.&quot;The communists are evidently astute enoxigh to know that in so far as the British Empire Is concerned4, the Dominions are a particularly vulnerable spot, especially suoh Dominions as South Africa and India, where diversity of racial end political. .,, .....  alms oreate events which may be seized upon an4.ns.edas the unconscious instnMente,of the. communistsu*: and though their efforts may never be completely successful in this country, they will invariably bring bloodshed end incalculable misery and hatred to South Africa, already burdened with many sad. memories. -  r: &apos;*&apos; - -. &quot;There,if clear evidenoe that Msimarig on the v    Reef, and Masab^lela in the Cape, paid through Europeans out of funds from Europe, are making a big effort to organise the natives, and evidences are. many that the Natives are beginning to realise that unity means strength, this is more and more frequently exemplified at different centres in the Union when Natives have banded together, and, in some oases forcibly, resisted authority when they have considered that such authority was against their interests.      .&quot;The blacks are being told.that tho Government, and the white people generally, are out to make this a white man&apos;a country, regardless of :the   1 -interests/
interests of the Hative races, and that the first step in this direction is to abolish the flatire franchise in the Cape, thereby depriving them of their only parliamentary powers    They are then told that they must organise ana unite as their very existence and future is endangered,&quot;One shudders at the mere thought of what might happen before our Forces could be sufficiently organised if the communists, through their insidious propaganda, brought about a fairly concerted Native outbreak,.  *The time seems to have arrived when the Government elected by the people of this country to control its destinies must decide to put a stop to the activities of those who openly and defiantly antagonise public sentiment, and endanger the peace of the country by disseminating anarchist doctrines utterly at variance with,, and repugnant to, its governiBnt and &apos; ideals,&quot;.On July 9th a &quot;world congress&quot; of International Workers&apos;Famine Relief organisation is to be held in Berlin:   a preliminary oonference will take place on July 5th:   the two questions for consideration are:   -(a)   &quot;The continuation of Famine Belief adapted to the new situation confronting Soviet Russia and the World Proletariat.&quot;(b )   &quot;The practioal realisation of eoehoinio re con struct ion I &apos; in Soviet Russia.&quot; :; &apos; -Mm Mttazenberg is making the arrangements:   E.T. Whitehead and H, Young may be present and it is possible that Arthur McManus, F. Feet and W, Gallaoher may also attend.Wijnkoop has invited MoManus to attend, or to send a representative to the international meeting which the Dutch Communist Party is arranging at Amsterdam on June 25th: M. Cachin and Klara Zetkin are expected to be present.It was stated at the recent national conference of fiorwegian munioipal workers that an agreement between British and German municipal workers was under consideration and that the Scandinavian unions might be included later.The Berlin Committee of the Women&apos;s Section of the CommunistInternational/
International has informed the British representative that  Lara Setkin,- who has gone ;to Moscow will discuss with the Comintern the question of a financial grant to the women1s communist movement in Great Britain. a:...   There are several indications that the communists intend to concentrate on the industrial aide&quot;of&apos; Labour in this country:;  the sub-executive-committee of the Party &quot;has agreed to a proposition for intensive-national propaganda for the purpose of establishing industrial nuclei and affiliation to the&quot; Red&apos; International of&apos; Labour Unions&quot; and divisional organisers were summoned to London on June 20th for consultation.   Cormnunist nuclei exist already in many trade union branches and others are being formed.Certain London communists are working among railwayrnen and: transport workers for njoint defensive action&quot; by the two unions, as they are closely allied industries and &quot;are being confronted by attacks on their living conditions by the employers.&quot; -     :   &quot; --&apos;&quot;-&apos;:-&quot;&apos;--&apos;&apos;&quot;. The Party Commission and the Sub-Executive * which have made an exhaustive enquiry into the Party finances, have decided to lawer subscript ion rates which were found to be higher than those operating in - Continental Parties and &quot;much too high,to attract any considerable body of workers other than the very enthusiastic&quot;..   The following rules have now been sent to branches: ;-5     *&amp;(?&quot;On and after July 1st, 1922, the rate of subscription from members to branches shall be one shilling per calendar month. \ Of this sum sixpence per month shall go to headquarters, threepence to the diviaional council and threepence per month shall he retained by the branch.&quot;The headquarters levy of sixpence per month shall be ^aytfble hy a 4- members without exception.   Divisional councils and branches shall have power to fix reduced rates for the proportions payable to division and branch respectively in the case,of those members formerly oovered by half and exemption rates.&quot;Divisional dues shall be remitted direct by branohes to Divisional oounoil on the basis of membership shown on last monthly return of their total membership to headquarters.&quot;-An/
branoM&quot;An entrence fee of 6d. in addition to the subscription of the current month shall be paid by all aej members as a contribution to the branch funds.&quot;On and after July 1st, 1922, the above rules will supersede the. present rule on Finance in the Constitution! and Rules as adopted by the special delegate conference at Manchester in April 1921. which reads as follows:-&quot;The minimum rate of subscription from members to branches shall be 6d. per week.   Of this sum 3d. shall be remitted to headquarters, Id. shall be remitted to Divisional Council, and 2d. shall be retained by the branch.   The branch shall have powetl to increase the subscription if the 2d. retainable by the branch is insufficient to cover ordinary working expenses.   Married women whose husbands are] members of the Party shall pay half the subscription] Youths and apprentices shall pay 3d. per week, for Divisional Oouncil, and the branch.     Any. member more than three months in arrears shall, after receiving notice and failing to pay arrears, if he does not tender a satisfactory explanation within fourteen days, be struck off the books.     Unemployed members or those sick or on half time, should on notification to the branch secretary, be exempted frj payment.&quot; * &apos; 1The &quot;London Theses Committee&quot; is meeting regularly to consider the application of the Moscow Theses in the Metropolitan area:   as Palme Dutt, Page Arnot, George Deacon,I E. Cant and Mary Moorhouse are among the members it is likely I that their finding will, be generally adopted.   The committee meeting on June 6th dealt chiefly with-the thesis on organisation and deoided to give first consideration to &quot;working the Trade Unions and Workshops&quot;.John Inches, treasurer of the Scottish Divisional Counol and George Whitehead have sent a circular to all branches regarding the Guarantee Fund, for which they want  50..... The Chief Constable iof St. Helens informs me that several! communists regularly attend at the British Legion Club, ChuTci] Street, and that the local.committee Is said to have hired a room to hold meetings and address their Own. members on oowwThe circulation manager of &quot;The Commtunist&quot; is endeavour^ to increase the revenue from advertisements&apos; and has offered
branches free advertisements of any local meetings for the week ending June 17th in order to make the project popular.A receiving order in bankruptcy has been noted against Francis Meynell,Albert Inkpin and Guy Aldrea are expected to be released from prison this week.Edgar White he ad reached ICasan on May 85 th en route for Tsantsin.W.P. Earsman, an Australian communist, has arrived in England with Peter larkin, who was     &apos; -.sentenced to a long term of imprisonment in Australia in connection with the Industrial Workers of the World outbreaks in 1916.   George Hardy, the Industrial Worker of the World from America, is also reported to be in London. THE YOUNG C0MMUHI3T INTERNATIONALThe Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist International has informed the Young Communist League that it will send an extra sum of money to defray the cost of the national conference in August.Some idea of the quantities of literature sent from Berlin to the Young Communist League may be gathered from the following details of a consignment despatched on June 9th for &quot;Children&apos;s Week&quot; (June 26th,. &apos; &apos; July 2nd): ,, - ;.12,000 post-cards sent to London for distribution there and in the provinces. 612 posters sent to London 136 &quot; Glasgow50 &quot; Aberdeen20 &quot; Perbh20 &quot; &apos; DundeeConfd/
20 posters sent to Leith100 &quot; Manchester30 &quot; Liverpool20 n Leeds20 &quot; Castleford10 &quot; Shipley20 &apos; &apos;&quot; Newcastle.Hyman Gilbert, a former official of the YoungCommunist League is going to Berlin chiefly toascertain whether Junes Stewart&apos;s denial of havingreceived money from Berlin be true.INDIANS AND THE BABOPg PARTY CONFERENCEComiuunist headquarters are working in conjunction with Indian extremists such as Saklatvala to obtain the signatures of Indians in this country to a memorial which is to be presented to delegates to the forthcoming annual conference of the Labour Party.   In a covering letter to various trusted communists, Harry Webb, wrote:&quot;Enclosed you will find instructions of how to get into touch with the Indians in your district.   Upon approaching them you should be careful not to mention the Communist Party but to urge them to 3ign the memorial in the name of representative members of the Indian association. Under no circumstances should the memorial or any of the documents be left ia the hands of any of the signatories, but upon being filled up should be returned to Headquarters r-o later than the 20th inst....&quot;Please treat all papers as confidential.   Do not part with any.   Present memorial for perusal and signature but do not leave it behind.   Impress upon all Indian friends it is not any attack upon Government of India or Britain it is only making a statement of facts to prevent Labour Leaders from misguiding public opinion here on India.&quot;The text of the memorial is as follows:-&quot;UiDIA&apos;8/
&quot;INDIA&apos; S   VOICE&quot;To the Delegates at the twenty-se-coduct Annual Conference of the British Labour Party.&quot;Dear Prlends,We the undersigned Indian Residents in Great Britain have notioed with horror and dismay an artful Resolution on India tabled in the agenda of your Confer-enoe on page 16.   The Resolution calls upon your Con-ference to ^approve of the support given by the Parliamen-tary Labour Party to the Government of India Act&apos; , which has been better known as the Montague-Che1msford Reform Act, and vtoich was drafted with the assistance of Mr. Morris, the Inspector General of Prisons in India.We protest most vehemently against the above insolent and offensive Resolution which is an-outrage upon our national rights and which is an unpardonable insult to Labour in India.So far, we thought the Labour Party was bound ;to respect the self-determination of the people of India. The Indian National Congress which voices the opinion of the people of India in larger proportion than the British Labour Party does represents the entire, working class opinion of this country, has expressed its detes%ation of the above Act in no unmeasured termsi   The people of India have not been slow in perceiving the imperial trick-ery permeating the so-called Reform Act.   Even tho limited number of voters created by this Act &quot;rom among carefully selected followers of the Government, have resented the enactment of the Act, have refused to have anything to do with&apos;it-, and after all influences brought to bear on them barely 16 per cent of these voters cared to go to the Polls.     The Labour of India as such is practically kept out of any and all efficient&apos; voice in the affairs of their country by this hideous Act.-   The Trade Union Con-gress of India has unanimously resolved upon the boycott of this Aot.Can anything be more outrageous and more insolent than the support of this Act by the Parliamentary Labour Party, in the House against the almost unsnimotvs &quot;voice of the People and the Labour of lndia*     A ^hcrt time-ago your joint Council issued a similar resolution against which an immediate protest waa entered by the Indian Community  in London, who were on the .spot.Por some years Mrs.Annie Beasant has been aotive-ly oarrying on a propaganda to popularise imperialism and British domination in India.   At the National Congress of India attended by nearly .12000 -representatives, she failed to obtain 25 votes of favour of Amendmoxit to support the above Aot.     When Mrs. Besant last-left England ehe was treated at a Banquet at v/hich Lord Lytton was present officially to thank her for the great support she had given/
given to the Government (not the people) of India at a critical time, and in this he was joined by Mr.Sen Spoot of your Labour Party.Is your Labour Party determined to remain hostilo to the birth rights and political freedom of India, which is today perhaps with Ireland and Egypt, \ most oppressed country in the world, thanks to the new Act?    Or is your Labour Party, the rank and file of which is notorious for its ignorance of India, and vthiol never cares to consult India or Indians, being misled some of your ambitious Peril amen tar lass who may coneifoi access io power more easy by adoption of rank imperialiDelegates of the Sank and Pile, you who repre sent on the floor of this conference the struggling masses of Britain, it is up to you.   The oppressed masei of India expect, as they have the right to expect, that you will declare with no uncertain voice for the comply self determination of India.&quot;TO unemployed on June 12th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,443,100, an increase of 5,130 on the preceding week but a decrease of 300,633 since the beginning*Jof the year.So far the &quot;agitation week&quot; of the unemployed does not appear to have resulted in any great increase of meetings but it is possible that special efforts will be made on Sunday next.On June 20th about 100 unemployed in groups of 10 visite the House of Commons:   the 10 group leaders were admitted to see their members while the remainder were kept moving in Palace Yard:   no disorder occurred.TEE COAL MINERSThe Central Committee of the All-Russian Miners&apos; Union has sent to the British section of the Red International of Labour Unions a copy of the following communication, which was written to Prank Hodges on May 26th:&quot;We/
&quot;Iff. sent you a letter-on-the 3rd of March of this year (No. 43) proposing to you to exchequer into negotiations with our Union and asking .You. to send us various publi-oatlons of the International Secretariat as well as those of the English Pe d e r at i on of Mine rsk. - Howe ve r, we have received ho reply to it yet.&quot;We again apply to you and ask you to forward us the. above mentioned material.    Besides, the All-Russian Union, of Miners, fishes.hei admitted .-aa a member Into &apos; the International federation.     We consider the partioi-. ,. pation in the International- Federation as: binding; for&quot; our Uhioh, the more so at the present Juncture, when the proletariat is rallying its forces to. resist Capital1 s offensive.     The miners particularly have to co-ordinate their forces in the present struggle inde-pehdeht of the different political ideals of the members in the Unions of the various countries. :fWe hope to reoeive your.immediate reply as well as the material we requested in our previous letters and the Constitution of the International Miners federation.. &quot;The alloRussian Union unites at the present all workers in the mining industry.&quot;The following interesting communication has been sent toNat Watkins by A.

We are prepared to strug-gle together with you, just as you can always count on us whenever the help of the Russian proletariat becomes, necessary in the struggle against the bourgeoisie.     But ,we-: warn, you not to rely on the Russian trade unions while you are&apos;occupied with filling the antechambers of ministers and with concluding.. qonip,rcaaise.8.;,.with the bourgeoisie,&quot;In order to enable the workers of the world to de-decide whether or not our attitude&quot;Iscbrreot we propose the.....;., following:.

We propose, fuitherodre, that representatives of the Red.

De Valera may try to avoid civil war but the general opinion is that Rory 01Connor and his Irregulars will get outof hand.    Further attempts to obtain arms and explosives inthis country may be expected.Roderiok Connolly^ organ &quot;The Workers Republic&quot; of June3rd publishes a letter purporting to come from the BxeoutiveCommittee of the Communist International, Moscow, saying:-&quot;Your party was accepted as a seotion of the Communist International at&apos;the session of the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comin-tem on January 10th, 1923,&quot;Commenting on this Connolly says:-&quot;This gives official confirmation of the fact that for the first time the revolutionary section of the Irish Labour Movement is admitted as a fighting seotion of theworld/
