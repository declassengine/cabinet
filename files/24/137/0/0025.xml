June(Soo.   CP, 4016).His Jlaje style. Government have given olcse attention to the memorandum on the vyprJs of the Hague Commissions presented to K4.8 FaJe^y*a Charg6. d^Affaires in Paris by His Excellency the President of the Council on June 2nd,     They have been, anxious to return a prompt ana. helpful reply, but nave found some difficulty in doing so, because the argument of the French memorandum appears to&apos; rest upon some confusion of thought and also . to show, some unfamiliarity with the /ground covered by the Genoa conference^     It would not, ..in their, opinion, serve any useful purpose to call attention to these features of the French memorandum in a controversial spirit.     They propose therefore to deal as simply as possible with (j) the procedure to be. adopted at the Hague,(II) the general lines on which $hey have instructed their representatives to proceed, and (III) the subjects to be discussed.     In as much as their views upon all these three aspects of the Hague meeting wero clearly enunciated at Genoa, they will content themselves with calling attention to pertain points, as they arise, lip. which the French memorandum of June 2nd appears to be unpractical or inconsistent with the Cannes jjte solutions and with the conclusions reached at -Genoa*(1)Procofiurc;
193(I.) P.roceduro at the Hague .--2. -  .Tha. Hague&quot; conference is to - se a&apos; conference of experts..

His majesty*s Government have no intention of  &apos; appointing political or diplomatic, representatives, to a preliminary centerence at which osperts would be nominated and the principles of procedure laid down. The;? would regard any such arrangement as dilatory and superfluous;     The object with which .the /representatives of the non-Russian povvers     re . invited to.&apos; me..e t. at the&apos; Hague ten days before the Kussian representatives was simply to provide for the constitution of the non- ......Russian Oommission.&amp;nd the, choice/.o . methods of procodure, such .as the appointment and distribution/-.of.;,v;..orfc among Sub-commissions,- where ncco.8sa.ryc,   , His liajestyls .. Government sea no reason for any preliminary discussion of princ principle;-.     On ,tho c orrtraryj theywould regard any such discussion as a superfluous retracing - of gr ound already: covered.at Genoa, arid would oppose&quot;,-it.; strongly. The Hague Commissions were. proposed; -in order. to &quot;provide an opportunity for a practicalidiscussion of the.-Russian problem by Experts.     --Arguments- on principle, when presented to the. Russians, would only produce &apos;&apos;those counter-arguments which&apos;the&quot; ^aheh^GOVe^niiieht desires&quot; to prevent and would, thus. -cre;ate&apos;4&apos;Q.h^opp&apos;:ort&apos;anlty&apos;; for that very propaganda which, - in. c common^with/all-&apos; other civilised governments, it severely reprobates.4. His    &apos; &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos; &apos;
1944, . His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore see no reason for any extension of time between June 15th, when the non-Russian representatives arrive at ths Hague and June 20th, when the constitution of the ncn-Russian Commission is to be complete ., or June  6th, when the non-Russian and Russian commissions are to meet. 5.     His Majesty &apos;s Government are also resolutely opposed to the suggestion made in the $reach memorandum that the Russian memorandum of May 11th should-be withdrawn before the.Hague commissions meet.     No Question of calling for the withdrawal of this document was raised at Genoa, On the contrary at the final plenary session all the delegations j including the French delegation, accepted the proposal for the  ppointment of the commissions which will meet at The Hague.     In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government in common with others have regarded the memorandum of the 11th May as superseded by the proceedings and decisions of the Plenary Session; and they concur in the view that the commissions at The Hague should entirely disregard this document.     Indeed to call for its withdrawal at the .present stage would bo to introduce a fresh condition not assented to or contemplated by the parties when the agreement for the Hague conference was made at Genoa.     Had it been intended to impose this withdrawal as a condition precedent to discussionamongst experts at The Hague it surely ought in fairness to all parties to have been raided at Genoa,,-3- (II) The
195(II).    Tho Gonoral LI no 8 of Settlement.6.     His Majesty1 9 Government are all the more ready to accept the contention of the French Government that tho Cannes Resolutions must govern the deliberations of the Hague Conference, since th-3--British Sapiro Delegation at Genoa consistently pressed those resolutions as essential to any settlement of the Russian problem.    .Tha,Russian Delegation accepted the Cannes Resolutions in principle at the first Plenary Session of tho Genoa Conferanee, with tho reasonablo proviso that they should be reciprocal, and they re-iterated thoir readiness to stand by the third Resolution, on which the French memorandum lays especial stress, in their memorandum of May 11th.7,     There ,1s nothing in the French memorandum of June 2nd with which His Majesty1 s Goveriiment are in more complete accordance than tho argumont which it ably sustains that  the Cannes Resolutions must not be used singly as convenience may dictate, but accepted as a whole.      They mast therefore take occasion to point out that some of tho contentions of tho French government are inconsistent with its own argument in this respect.8.      In the matter of private property; for instance the French &quot;government contends that foreign claimants have &quot;the right to demand its return&quot;.     The only exception vhich it admits to this right is in tho case of cultivable land, who re peasant owners would have to bo evicted if - tho property were to be returned.      His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept this contention.     Every state has the right compulsorily to acquire private property, whatsoever its nature on payment of just :componsation.   Every State has exercised that right down to the most recent times.     The French Government1 s argument in this connection is contrary to tho first CannesRes olution...
196Resolution because it contravenes an. acknowledged right  &apos;of sovereign states throughout the world,   whether the Russian government makes restitution of private property alienated from its owners or. pays compensation for it, is a matter solely for the Russian Government.    His MajestyTs Government would bo repudiating British principle, amd British practice if they took any other view; . and they think it hardly necessary to prove that this principle and this practice are common to the French government, the government of the United ctatas, and to civilised governments in every continent.     To attempt to force any other principle upon the Russian Government would be to demand of Russia what no sovereign state has ever been willing to concede. They -entirely agree, however, that the compensation must be real not shadowy.9..,   His.-Majesty&apos;s Government also agree that, the surest way. for the Russian government to restore .the prosperity of its country and to obatin capital for that purpose will b* by so-curing the return, to thair .undertakings of those, who by their skill and experience have, done so much.to assist Russia in the. past..     But subject to  the principle of compensation this is a ma 11 er wi th in the c ompe tsnc o o f the Rus si mi g o vo r nmen t v   And the fact that it would be a wise and prudent course does not give to the government of other countries the power to demand it as of right...    - --   ; .10.&apos;.- The same objection applies with equal force to the French Government&apos;s contention that tho non-Russian commission &quot;have first to agree on a plan for the restoration of Russia s a plan complete in detail, proceeding by stages and apportioning tho roles to bo played both from the point of view of reconstruction-.
197ant. of credits&quot;.      It would be quite impossible to arrive at such a plan without presuming the right to diotate to Russia on a thousand matter? which are absolutely subject to her own centre]  vc a Sovereign State.     Russia is a. Sovereign. State t whatever opinion foreign Towers may hold of the character of her government., .   To endeavour to assume the oontrary is not merely a waste of time; it. is a denial in the single case of Russia- of those very principles to which fur ope wishes Russia to return, principles deeply rooted in European civilisation which govern tho relations of all self-respecting and other-respecting States.11.     Separate consultations will indeed he o.on-* stantly neee .;sary between the members oi the non-? Russian commission, no less than a general measure of agreement on the method, of approach to the subjects to he discussed with the Russian Commission,     But to suggest, as the Pre nob. memorandum does, that the non-Russian Cotamission should elaborate a complete scheme of hussian reconstruction without reference to the Russian delegation and shoult then present it as an ultimatum for Russia to take or leave, is to make a travesty of the purposes entrusted by the Oenoa conference to the Hague commission.     If that were the object with which the non-Russian commission was to be assembled at the Hague.&apos;, it woulc have been morecourteous
198courteous as wall as more practidal not to invite tho Russian commission there at all.    The difficulty of the Russian problem resides, moreover, not in the enunciation of the principles on which Russia may expect assistance from western capital and resource, but in the application of those principles to the special o ircumstancos of Russia at the present times     Consultation ar.d co-operation with the  fopresan tatives of Russia is absolutely necessary, if tho Hague is to give any practical -results in this respect.    It was made clear at Genoa that this was to be tho purpose and the method of the Hague ootamiss ions* work, and His Majesty!s Government are not prepared to adopt any other methods12.   They disapprove the method proposed by the French Government not only because in their opinion it is unpractical but also because they regard it as inconsistent with another principle to which the French Government itself attaches tho greatest importance - namely, tho avoidance of polities.     His Majesty1 s Government remain of the opinion, which they axpraaad   at Genoa, that the Hague commissions should confine themselves to the practical aspect of the Russian problem.    In other words, they desire&apos; that the Hag:;e commissions shall consider the question of the debts, the question of private property, and tho question of crddits as expertsdealing....
199dealing with experts, treating each oase on its merits in accordances with tho oommonsense maxims which govern business throughout the worlds.III.   Business at the Hague*&apos;.13.     It. remains to outline, in accordance with the conclusions reached after full discussions at Genoa, tho practical business which His Ma jo sty&apos;s Government desire the Hague commissions to transact.14...    They desire, in tha first place, that practical arrangements shall be made with regard to the Russian debts.   The French memorandum recapitulates the distinction between pro-war and war debts In terms renaerad familiar by the. Genoa &apos; conference.    This distinction, whiah was clearly laid down by tho British Delegation at the very outset of the Genoa discussions, His Ma. jasty&apos;s Government&apos; still maintain. The Russian Delegation at Genoa admitted at one point of the Genoa discussions their willingness to re-eognisfj both kinds of debt, provided that, in the oase of tho pre-war debts, an arrangement could be reached with the representatives-&quot;Of tha bond-holders regarding tho remission and postponement of Interest, and that in the case of the war debts the.creditor governments should in assessing Russia1 s liability take Into account her condition and ability to pay.     With regard to the former, tho representatives of the bondholders will naturallybo.. .,

Such questions, are for the&apos; experts&apos; to investigate.-16.     In&apos; the&apos; third pi Sao His Ma jo sty7 s government propose that the&apos; Hague commissions shall discuss thesubjeci of credits;     They find no fault in the con-?side rations sdvahcdcl in the French memorandum on thistopic, but they do not understand the necessity forlaying down a Series of maxims in advance..      If Russiatk to secure credits, she can secure them from privatelenders who consider &quot;the security adeq.ua-to.u     This .con\dition applies equally &quot;to credits from private individuals or organisations for &apos;;the promotion of business :in Russiaand to loans, if any&apos;s&apos;udh; bo-&quot;forthcoming, from privatesindividuals to the Russian-, government.    .
