(the-document-lo-the property of His Britarrnio Majesty&apos;s Government)%OABINET. 4 2770 j. _ &quot;*lJ -HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.PBTROLBUM     BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Tho Committee of Imperial Defenoo in a memorandum dated the 16th September, 1921, (278-B) called attention to -(a) The importanoe of safeguarding in timo of emergency supplies of oil fuel and light petroleum products suitable for naval, military or air purposes.(b) The necessity for ensuring the safety of important defences which might be damaged or otherwise rendered Ineffeotive by the ignition of the supplies.They recommended that there should be direct Government control of petroleum storage and that a licence to be issued by the Home Seoretary Bhould be necessary before the erection is commenced of any installation for the storage of 5,000 tons or more of oil fuel and 1,000 tone or more of petroleum spirit in the United Kingdom, and suggested that, in view of the increased importance of preserving all   suoh supplies in times of emergency and of safe-guarding them against attack, the details of the proposed site of any suoh installation should be referred to them for consideration from the defenoe point of view before being finally approved.Legislation is necessary to carry out these recommendations and the attached Bill provides for the lioenslng system recommended j and also makes oertain other amendments in the Petroleum Aots for improving the control ever petroleum storage which were recommended by   a Departmental Committee appointed by the Home Offloe in 1915 and which are urgently required.     The Bill is not likely to excite any controversy and I ask authority for ita immediate introduction.     I would suggest that it might be oon-venient if it were introduced into the House of Lords.K.8.S8th June, 1922,
