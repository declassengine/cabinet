HIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)..I.BO HE,I.CABINET.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OFFICER COMMAHDING-IN-CHIEF ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR WEEK ENDING 10TH JUNE, 1922.   1(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War).GENERAL.   -In a military sense the situation generally has improved owing to the affairs at Pettigoe and Belleek; less trouble is expected on the Ulster Border in future. A certain number of public meetings are being held by the various candidates for the Southern Ireland Elections.     These are almost exclusively confined to the panel candidates; the Independent,Farmers1 and Labour candidates/$fteV($ $i$&amp; with printed election addresses. Three cases of intimidation on non-panel candidates have already taken place.     In South Tipperary the Irish Farmers1 and Labour Parties decided to put up a candidate each to oppose those of the panel, whereupon the notorious Daniel Breen, now Commandant General, Insisted on addressing a meeting of the Farmers1 Party and suggested that in the national interests the electors should abstain from putting forward independent nominees, so that panel candidates might be returned unopposed. To anyone living in County Tipperary a suggestion from such a man as Breen is tantamount to a command backed up by threats. The Farmors1 candidate has retired from the contest. The position of Labour candidates is somewhat different, as the Sinn Fein Party is deeply in their debt, owing to their action in abstaining from contesting seats at the 1918 Elections.   - It is doubtful, therefore, whether Republican. &apos; intimidation will be directed against the Labour candidates. &apos; .On the 6th June the newspapers reported that the residence of Mr. Denis Gorey, who had bean nominated by the Farmeis1 Union as a candidate for the County Wicklow, was raided by armed men.     He was given two minutes to come down by the leader of the gang, or bear the consequences.     On Mr a Gorey appearing at the door armed with a shot gun the raiders left.     It is understood that Mr. Gorey is determined to contest the Elections, Mr, J,P, Oooney, Sinn Fein Election Agent for East Tipperary and Waterford, was given three minutes notice to leave the 3rd Tipperary Brigade Area by the Executive Republicans. During the past week end the public speeches of Mr. Collins and Mr, De Valera in the South of Ireland shew a general tendency to discourage the appearance of any candidates at the Elections other than those nominated by the Panel. Presumably
Presumably as the result of an outspoken letter of his to the &quot; Irish Independent &quot; of June 12th, in which letter he drew attention to the fact that the powers of Government came from the Treaty and could only be upheld in future by carrying out the Treaty, Mr. Darrell Figgis, independent candidate for County Dublin, was visited in his Dublin house late on June 12th by a gang of three youths who out off his beard 2     The intruders confessed to him that they wore acting under the orders of the &quot; Army Authorities &quot;, Several attacks, have been made on ex-R.I.Cs men in the Ballinasloe and Athenry districts of County Galway. Two ex-R. 1.0. constables in Ballinasloe were wounded, and others have had their houses fired into.     All have been given notice to leave the country without delay. DUBLIN J)I3TRI0T AM) ClTY, During the past week two cases have occurred in Dublin District of soldiers, when walking out unarmed, being held up by armed men and their empty bandoliers taken. It is Understood that there are no Liaison Officers in Dublin at present and it is reported that the Senior Liaison Official, Mr, Dalton, has been transferred to the Curragh as Director of Training at that place.     The Provisional Government has been approached on this point.. The Executive forces, i,e. Rdry CCohnor^ men are still in possession of the Four Courts, NORTHERN IRELAND. Operations at Pettigocu The incidents leading up to the occupation by British troops of the east end of the Belleek Pettigoe triangle (County Fermanagh) were mentioned in last week 1a report. On June 3fd a detachment of the Lincolnshire Regiment was landed in the triangle opposite Boa Island.     A considerable number of shots were fired at the boats from I&apos;ree iit&amp;te territory as they moved along the northern shore of the island, and on June 4th in the neighbourhood of Viaterfoot this detachment was fired at heavily from across the border. At 10 a.m. &apos; on Juno 4th, another detachment of the Lincolnshire Regiment, with two companies of the South Staffordshire Regiment and a section of the 4th (How) Battery, R.F.A., moved on Pettigoe village from the east under the command of the Colonel Commandant of the 18th Infantry Brigado.     Whilst the preliminary reconnaissance was being made of the village from Ulster territory, ,a
a drooping fire was opened on the troops from across the border..    As a result the troops were deployed and an advance was made on the village..    During the advance hostile firs had increased to such an extent that the howitzers were ordered to fire four rounds at the v/ood west oi&quot; the village whence the fire appeared to come.,    Hostile fire was . also, opened from the woods south of the village,, and resulted in the only casualty to our side, the police driver- of a Crossley car being killed..About 1.30 p.nu. Colonel. Wyatt,. Commanding the 18th Infantry Brigade, walked into the village, accompanied by an armoured oar...    Ho was met by Commandant Michael O'Farrell,. who was in Free State uniform..    Colonel Wyatt gave O'Farrell up to 2 p.m.. to clear his men out of the village,, but as more fire was opened on the village before this hour, the Commandant was made prisoner..    The village and surrounding country were then cleared by the troops, with little firing.     The operations terminated soon after 3 p.m..     The result of the operations was two officers and thirteen, other ranks of the IRA taken prisoners,, and. a Lewis gun,, several, rifles and shot guns, and ammunition: seize a.,    Of the prisoners Commandant O'Farrell and two o^. his-men were in uniform and claimed to be Free Staters0.A Lancia car taken, from the police, a few days previously at Belloek was found in the village,, and handed back to the police..     About, fifty members of the I.H.A... were found in the village when- the troops-arrived, and were ordered, to leave the village..With the. exception ox some unarmed drivers with police lorries conveying the troops, only British soldiers took part in these operations..     A communique issued to the newspapers by Headquarters. Boggars Bush (Free State) was most inaccurate and misleading..     Our troops continue to hold Pettigoe village and the high ground commanding it from the. &quot;west,, much to the satisfaction of tho local inhabitants who have now returned to their houses., Op or at! ons at Belleek., On June 8th a reconnaissance was made, by British troops of Belleek village,. which lies entirely in Ulster territory.     Our troops advanced in two columns,, one north and one south of Lower Lough Erne,.     Soon after midday, an armoured car was .sent on. ahead by the northern colxaan^   and when it arrived at the sohool at the east end of Belleek village,, hostile lire was opened from, a, spot 3 00 yards; north of the school and from within Ulster territory.,     At the same time the advance guard of the southern column was fired, upon from Belleek Fort (Free State territory) whilst moving; into a position of readiness 80O; yards south of the Fort.     The troops wore in Ulster territory whilst the whole of ,the above operations took place..As
As a result of the hostile firing the northern column engaged the enemy with infantry and afraourod cars and advanced, in extended order to Belieok village.     The southern column replied to the firing from the Fort by firing-four rounds from a section of howitzers.     On &apos;t-he^first shell bursting outside the ,-u&apos;ort the whole garrison (about 40 men) retired.     At the request of the northern colutnn. the howitzers fired some more rounds at hostile infantry and machine guns north-west ox the village..At 1.30 p,m. a party of the Lincolnshire Regiment entered the Fort without opposition, and hoisted tho Union Jacks.AS far as is known the only casualty to either &apos;-&apos; side in these operations was one British soldier Slightly woundod..Except the three shells which landed in the Fort no other damage appears to have been done to property in the -vicinity.   &quot;Looal inhabitants reported that about SCO Irregular I.s;A. had been collected in the neighbourhood, and that there were no Free State troops amongst them..    Our troops are still in possession of Belleek village. Later reports from reliable sources show that all the trouble of the past three weeks in the Belleek-Pettigoe triangle started from the time of arrival of 0'Farrell in that area.     His parties of undisciplined hooligans ha-y o terrorised the neighbourhood.     0clone 1, Barton of :,atorfoot (east end of the triangle) and his family were continually sniped at from across the border whenever they wont into or out of the house.   -Oolonoi;Barton was obliged to send his family away by water, and a boat containing his nurse and children was fired at from Free State territory. The Belleek-Pottigoe opc rat ions -- appear to have had a good elicet on the situation on the western border of the Six Counties,     Reports shew that Free State and Irregular Forces have withdrawn from Strabano., Clady and other districts, and the military situation in the Sir Counties, both in Belfast and generally along the border, is easier..Belfast. On June 3rd a disquieting incident took place in Belfast.     On that day a soldier- of the Somerset Light Infantry posted in a house to deal with snipers -quite &apos; justifiably shot two Protestant civilians who were using a rifle     Shortly afterwards a patrol of 1 E.C.O&apos;. and 3 men of this Regiment. in the same neighbourhood, . were, in retaliation shot by an individual Or individuals from amongst a hostile Protestant crowd.-The N.C.O.. and one private wore wounded, and the remaining two &apos; soldiers, whilst attending to their wounded comrades, wore set upon and brutally beaten. -Three rifles belonging to the patrol were stolen by the crowd.
A great outcry has been made with regard to the so-called attack on the Mater Hospital.     The hospital is in proximity to the gaol.     Owing to a low shots being fired in the vicinity, the police at the gaol got excited and imagined that an attack was being made on thonr.     The result was very heavy firing from rifles anc. machine, guns from the gaol, seme bullets of which not only hit the Mater Hospital, but also fell in Victoria Barracks, where British troops   ere quartered. On the whole, during last week things have quietened down a good deal in Belfast. The casualties for the week ending June 10th arc Killed. Wounded.        Total. Protestants: Catholics:1114Total:-1417Curfew.The hours of Curfew throughout the Six Counties are now the same as in Belfast City, namely, 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.(Signed). C.F.JSJ. MACRBADY.
