(idTelegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General of Canada. &apos;(Sent 2ist June 1922).Clear the line.     Following from Prime Minister for your Prime Minister begins   21st June Urgent.     Your telegram of May 11th raises questions of so important and delicate a nature that we have felt justified In reserving it for very careful reflection.   There is pressiire here for the publication of the confidential proceedings of,the 1917 and 1918 Imperial Conferences and we have had to take this Into account together with yotir proposal since it involves very similar considerations.     Our decision regarding the proposal made to us In our own Parliament is that publica-tion would be Improper and undesirable until the question has been discussed by the Imperial Conference as a whole and publication approved by that body with full knowledge of the really vital issues Involved,     After weighing your proposal no less carefully we consider that it should be reserved In the sama manner and m* believe that you will share this opinion In view of fchss following considerations which have governed our own decision,The Imperial Conference has a very delicate and&apos;no men-tous part to play in maintaining the peace of the world, :-the interests of the different nations, of t*he Commonwealth, and the unity of those nations in a world-wide system of citizenship under one sovereign.     It is feeling its way In accordance with the practical sense of the British peoples.     It is making Its own precedents, and it is bound to do so with the utmost care if its character and procedure are to represent the will,and sentiment of all the -con-stitueht nations.     It has accordingly set its faceagainst/
against hasty developments and innovations.     These have never yot been accepted by Conference when-in session, and loyalty to spirit of Conference appears to&apos; us to enjoin a similar caution upon all tho partner Governments in their individual capacity,&apos; ,    - ------Proceedings of Imperial- Conference are. collective property of that bodyv     It was very strongly urged by more than one Prime Minister &apos;at the 1921 Conference&apos; that - no.-; -individual Government or Governments .amongst those-which -, constitute Conference would&apos;be - justified in taking separate action or coming to separate decisions on Constitutional matters which affect position of other Governments within the Conference or Constitutional practice of Empire.Publication of past&apos; proceedings.of Conference should In our opinion be considered in the light of both preceding paragraphs,  since a decision to -publish would. Inevitably alter character and narrow utility-of future sessions.     We need not recapitulate here reasons for universal custom under British constitutions of maintaining confidential and intimate character of Cabinet discussions.     Sufficient to say&apos; that if that custom were to be changed and &apos; Cabinet discussions made liable to publicity of debates in Parliament, collective&apos; responsibility of Ministers as colleagues in a Government would ipso facto disappear and. with it all that is most valuable in system of Cabinet government.     There is same collective responsibility in members&apos; of Imperial Conference. &apos;&apos;-  They are colleagues&apos; in a system of oven wider and more - difficult-responsibility than that of a single national government, and if their discussions are to be published like Parliamentary debates except by, general agreement/they will not In future be %,* able to exchange views and&apos;discuss differences upon same -intimate/
intimate and informal terms as have hitherto prevailed. Reconciliation of divergent viewe which often arises naturally out of frank and confidential discussion would thus become increasingly difficult.     Publicity would of necessity stereotype differences of opinion which without it would have been capable of mutual accommodation, and essential objects of Imperial Conference would be thus sacrificed.Foregoing observations regarding character.and function of Imperial Conference appear to us important not only with regard to proceedings of Conference itself but with regard to communi cat ions exchanged between Governments of Empire -on Imperial Conference business before and after sessions cf Conference.     Other Governments entrust to the British Govern-ment and Foreign Office responsibility of conducting foreign policy of the Empire upon the lines which Imperial Conference lays downe     In view of this and in order to meet needs of Imperial Conference for complete Information we place all the arguments and documents upon vital matters of policy at disposal of Dominion Prime Ministers.     This was done before last Imperial Conference and will be always done while pre-sent conditions obtain, but-If everything communicated in this manner is to become subject to requests for publication afterwards when Imperial Conference is not in session and cannot weigh arguments for and against publicity, we- shall be compelled against our will to communicate- nothing which, In our Opinion,&apos; is unsuitable for eventual publication.     To impose such restrictions on inter^Imperial consultation would be to erect new barriers between Governments of Empire. In the discussion of general policy aid other matters of vital common interest.     We except of course matters of purely domestic concern between two. governments of tho Empire for example the cattle embargo question between yourselves andus.
Above are general considcrations-.     We attach so much&apos; Importance to them that; m aro against creation of any precedent in favour of publication except-, in case of &quot;docu--ments prepared with &quot;a view to publication.and.pas-sed&apos;for publication by whole Imperial Conference..    If.,once a   .   ... certain number of the &apos; confidential&quot; documents relating to.. Imperial Conference became public it;.--would be harder to resist other demands of the same, nature and the Conference would find itself committed to a practice of publicity -entirely prejudicial &quot;to its present intimate and informal character.     This objection applies-equally to all the confidential documents of Conference, though many of them may not be of a specially secret character..&quot;With regard to specific.-documents enumerated by you, Foreign Office takes particular, exception to publication of those dealing vaVtiv Anglo--Japanese Alliance, Pacific question, Egyptian question, and question of petroleum in Mesopotamia and Palestine, - &quot;. Lord Balfour,- however, adds in his minute- on the subject that the publication of any of the documents requested even where ,there is no special inherent object!oh would constitute, a very om-barrassihg and inconvenient-precedent in the conduct of delicate&quot; relations&quot; with foreign Governments and he begs that none at all should bo published until the wide issues raised by your proposal can be discussed by-the Imperial Conference,&quot;    The same view. Is taken-by other Departments with regard to documents ih-which they are specially   . concerned. &quot;   -   &quot;\        .The advice of Lord-Balfour. as-Acting Foreign.. -Secretary upon the special responsibility of Foreign OfficewV- to/
to the Conference therefore strongly reinforces argu-ments which I havo used regarding general responsibility of this&apos;Government as trustee for the Conference;   and our view of your proposal is the same whether, we regard it In our capacity of agents of the foreign policy laidordown by the Imperial Conference/in our capacity of guardians of the character and practice of the Conference when not in session.     We cannot consider.ourselves as having powerto agree In name of the Conference to the creation of such a precedent, and for that reason we ask that it be reserved for decision by. the Conference . as a whole.     On the other hand, we are strongly.of. opinion that arrangements for publicity hitherto made by Imperial Conference are Inadequate, and we. suggest that whole question should be thoroughly reviewed at tho next session, which Is due to be held, if convenient to the various Governments, next summer. I should add that the admission of the Irish Free State aa a Dominion to the Imperial Conference Increases complexity of the Conference^ functions and renders it essential that the constitutional practice of Empire should be governed by the decision of the Conference in its corporate capacity.     This Is view of constitutional procedure which has consistently been taken throughout our deliberations on the Irish settlement.We are repeating this telegram to the other. Dominions and are ready to concur in its publication with the omission of one or two specific references to foreign countries If you and they agree in   considering this desirable.     Ends.

( TV )COPY OF LETTER FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA TO TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TEE COLONIES.INDIA OFFICE, .     LONDON:, ..S.W.1;. 6th June,  1922.My dour Churchill,Many t hanks for your letter of the 24th June,, forwarding me a copy of the message sent to the Prime Minister of Canada about the Imperial Conference sapors.I am inclined to think that as the chief representa-tive of India at last yoar&apos;s Imperial Conference was the Secretary of State for India, and the Government of India therefore had not such a direct relation with the Conference as the Governments of the Dominions, it would be enough to send the Viceroy a copy of this telegram by mail.     The Government of India have so far raised no question of publlca-tion and if they did it would naturally be dealt with by the Seoretary of State In the light of the Prime minister&apos;s telegram to Mr. Mackenzie King.     Inoidently this would avoid the technical difficulty about telegraphing the message in cypher to India, about which your Private Secretary has written to mine.Yours sincerely,&quot;jfsgd) peel;Sht Hon. Winston churchill, M-.p.2., Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. July 3rd, 1922..
