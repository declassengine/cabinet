He fears that the firing of a single shot.by an Ir-responsible would have most serious results.

(S)Tedegramrfromvtgr^ptey?oJilll&apos; to Mr^Oollins. 6th June. 19 22. Your 71 and ether telegrams from Cope.   On Wednesday last information was received that- armed republican forces had invaded the northern territory and had entered both Belleek and Pettigo as well as portions of the Northern territory between the villages.     A number of refugees fled before the advance of the raiders.,     We immediately brought this to your notice at the Conference at Downing street at 10 a.m. the same day 31st May and invited you to state whether the alleged action was taken by the authority of the Provisional Government or by persons responsible to that Government.   we were glad to receive from, you and Mr.Griffith a prompt unqualified repu&amp;ia-tion of these raiders and their conduct.     You told us that thes forces, were not your forces and that you disclaimed any responsibility for ^hera and that you repudiated their action. I announced this to Parliament in your presence the same afternoon,    It is wi,th surprise that I read in the Cpmmunique issued from GvHiQ.-Beggars Bush that there were &quot;no other Irish.troops&quot; than &quot;our troops&quot; i.e. Free Stats troops&quot; invthe district then or now&quot; and I shall be glad if you will explain the discrepancy.     Following on your assurance of Wednesdays morning that the Provisional Government was, in no way responsible for the incursion, orders were immediately issued by H.M.Government to ;the military authorities to occupy Belleek and Pettigo and the district between them and the British forces were authorised for  the purpose of these operations to take any stops necessary to deal with persons or armed parties who might fire at them from your side of the herder.,    &apos; :s necessarymovements were  then made by the military authorities,-   fhePettigo situation has now been dealt with.    British troops have also been ordered to occupy BelleoJc village which lies.wholly,,c
Vbollyxi^ the Northern territory.     This they will laow proceed to do,     I have to give you warning on behalf of H.M.G. that if the British troops entering or holding Belleek are fired at either from Belleek fVrtor adjoining Free State territory the military authorities have full discretion either to bombard or occupy the fort or any other points from which fire is brought to bear upon the British forces.     It must not be supposed that any part of th^o border can be kept in a continued state of disorder- and alarm either by raids or by fire directed&quot; from your territory, and all persons and armed parties over whom you, have any control should be warned by you that they will certainly Jdo counter attacked.     There can be no question of any enquiry into these operations which have been carried out by the military commander at the express orders of H.M.G.     With the occupation of Belleek the present operations are at an end and unless further provocation is given by fire or raid from your &apos;4ide of the border there Is no reason why they, should he resumed.If as &quot;ou claim the forces in this district are under your authority you can yourself prevent any further&apos; &apos; Yencounters by giving orders and enforcing the observance of such orders to respect the boundaries &apos;df the Northern territory and to ensure that no attacks^ arc made or fire directed upon the forces of the Grown or the inhabitants.
