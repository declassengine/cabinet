These minutes show that, for reasons therein ated, I recommended the Sub-Committee not to proceed for the moment th the    question of the form which a Bill should take, but to agree ilth me that our immediate action should be to issue a statement of policy, as a Command Paper, carrying into effect, as soon as may be, ach recommendations of the Cave Committee as are agreed by us and as re administratively possible under the existing legislation.The grounds upon which I recommended this course are set forth a the first and second pages of the minute of the Sub-Committee. ad the recommendations of the Sub-Committee are in the sense of my proposal.    I, therefore, append the statement of policy submitted by s to the Sub-Committee with certain amendments which the Sub-Committee bought it desirable to make.Perhaps I ought to say,as regards the Bill, that I suggested to &apos;e Committee, and it was agreed , that they should proceed with the amination of the form of the Bill, and it was generally agreed to form the Home Affairs Committee, and through them the Cabinet, that [o of the provisions of the Lill- would in all probability be as Hows: -

It would be proposed to adopt this recommendation in the Bill.(3gd) T.J. KACUAMARA.23/6/22.

SJTgOgSTaP STATEMENT FOR ISSUE BENDING THE INTRO-DUCT ION OF A TRASS BOARDS Bill. Revised Draft circulated by the Minister of labour.I.       (1) H.M. Government have given careful consideration to therecommendations of the Oommittee appointed under the Chairman-ship of lord Cave to enquire into the Trade Board system.   As was stated by the Minister of labour in the House of Commons on 10th May, it is the intention of the Government, if time permits, to Introduce a Bill during the present Session dealing with these recommendations.    It is realised, however, that if the Bill is to do justice to all the interests concerned, and to deal in a comprehensive manner with the many points raised by the Cave Committee, its consideration is a matter calling for the expenditure of considerable time and labour.   The Minister of labour is fully aware of the serious administrative difficulties occasioned by the provisions of the existing Acts, to which attention has been called by the Cave Committee, and proposes to remedy these forthwith in so far as this can be done within the limits of the existing statutes. (2) The main recommendations of the Cave Committee relate to the following five points:-(1) Establishment and revision of Trade Boards. (2) Expediting of Machinery.(S) District Committees and District Boards.   . (4) Fixing and confirmation of rates. (5) Miscellaneous.
The extent to which these recommendations can, and will, he put into operation by administration are indicated below.(1) SgtabJLishment and Revision of Trade Boards.The Gave Commit tee&apos;s recommendations on the question ofthe establishment of the Boards are as follows:-(1) That the power of the Minister of Labour to apply the Actsto a trade be confined to cases where he is satisfied -(a) that the rate of wages prevailing in the trade or any branch of the trade is unduly low as compared with those in other employments; andfb) that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages throughout the trade,(2) That in any case in which the Minister considers that a prima facie case exists for applying the Acts to any trade,he shall cause a public enquiry to be held into the matterand shall have regard to the report of such enquiry.In accordance with this recommendation it has been decidedthat no Trade Board will be set up unless these conditions aresatisfied and then only after a public enquiry.    The interprata-tion of the words &quot;unduly low&quot; as compared with those in other employments will be a matter for determination by the Ministerof Labour in accordance with the facts of each case upon theReport of the person appointed by the Minister of Labour tohold an enquiry.In the case of a number of existing Boards difficult questions of scope, i.e., jurisdiction of the Boards, requireto be adjusted either between trades already under the Acts or between trades under the Acta and others on the borderline.These cases have caused difficulty and friction.    It is proposedaccordingly to proceed with revision in suitable cases.   Where,however, revision entails the application of the Acts to new
trades, it will only &quot;be carried through, after a public enquiry.(2) SxpQditin^ of Machinery. It is recommended by the Cave Committee that (a) the period for lodging objections against varied rates should be reduced;  (b) that the period taken by the Minister for confirm-ing should be reduced; (c) the provision by which no rate can be varied without the Minister&apos;s consent within six months shall be cancelled;  (d) the notices of objection shall date not from the receipt of the notice by the firms concerned but from the date of the publication of the notice in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;; and (e) the Boards shall have power to revise rates within reasonable limits at the fixing stage without re-advertise-men t.Two of these recommendations cannot be carried out without amendment of the statute f/ i.e., the period for lodging objections is definitely fixed, and the requirement to re-advertise at the fixing stage if rates are substantially altered is equally part of the statute.Apart from these two points, however, the following steps to expedite procedure have been already taken or will be immediately taken -(a) The Minister of Labour will consult with the Trade Boards between the proposing and fixing stages so that he may in every case be able to transmit his decision within fourteen days of the receipt of the rates.(b) A regulation will be made dating the period of objection from the publication of the notice instead of from the date of its issue to the trade.With i^egard to (c) the Act of 1918 provides that the Minister may give his consent to the issue cf new proposals within the period of 6 months, If ha is satisfied that special circumstances exist.   During the period following the passing
of that Aot wages owing to alterations in the cost of living have fluctuated so rapidly both up and down that in every case the Minister has been able to give his consent. As long as conditions remain inconstant it is probable that &quot;special circumstances&quot; enabling the Minister to give his consent will continue to exist.(3) District Committees and District Boards.The Cave Committee recommend in Paragraphs 8,9 and 11 that in the manufacturing and productive trades the Minister shall have power to set up District Committees and in the distributive and retail making up trades and allied trades the Minister shall be authorised to set up District Boards.So far as the first recommendation is concerned, the present powers conferred on the Minister of Labour under the existing Acts are limited., to setting up District Committees upon the request of the Central Board for the trade in question. This power cannot be altered administratively but the Minister of Labour will draw the special attention of all the Trade Boards concerned to this conclusion with a recommendation that its application to their trade shall be seriously oonsidered.With regard to the Distriot Boards, power to set up such Boards already exists under the present Act.   The Minister of Labour will, if satisfactory arrangements cannot be made on a District Committee basis, consider whether it is desirable to set up Distriot Boards in the appropriate tradeB already covered by the Acts.
(4) Fixing and Confirmation of Rates.The grounds upon which tho Cavo Committee make theirreoommendation6 with regard to the fixing and enforcement ofrates are set out in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the Report whichread as follows :-&quot;53. Tho issue so raised appears to us to be of vital importance to tho future of British industry: and we do not think it can be determined exoept upon a consideration of tho principles upon which the Trade Board system rests and by which its existence is to be justified.     Is it the intention of Parliament that tho coercive powers of the State should be used to prevent the oppression of the worker by forcing him to work at wages below the level of subsistence and under conditions injurious to his health; or is it desired that they should be applied (through th9 medium of the Trade Boards) to the general regulation of wages0     In other words,  a the Intention of the Act of 1909, which we believe to have been directed to the prevention of &quot;sweating&quot;, to prevail; or is effect to be given to the interpretation widely put upon the Act of 1918, namely, that it is to be used as an instrument for the public regulation of wages throughout the industries concerned?     In our opinion, the former is the correct view.&quot;&quot;54. It appears to us that, while the coercivepowers of the State, and particularly the criminal law, may properly be used to prevent the unfair oppression of individuals and the injury to the national health that results from the &quot;sweating&quot; of workers, the use of those coercive powers should be limited to that purpose and that any further regulation of wage-s should be left, so far as possible, to the processes of negotiation and collective bargaining.     It is one thing to say that an employer shall not pay to his adult worker a sum insufficient for his or her maintenance under the conditions of the time, be the sum 35s., 40s., or 50s., per week;  it 1b quite another thing to provide that he shall not pay to a skilled worker of a particular class lees than 70s., 80s., or 90s., even though the worker is prepared to work at a lower wage, and that If he does so he shall be liable tc fine or imprisonment.     It may be desirable that the higher wage should be paid, and it may not be unreasonable for a trade organisation to insist on that wage being paid and to enforce its decision by economic means; but to compel the payment by the threat of criminal prosecution appears to us to be an oppressive use of the pewors of the State.&quot;The actual recommendations resulting from thoboconsiderations are as follows
(3)   That it he the duty of a Trade Board to fix -(a) a gonoral minimum time-rate for the general body of workers in the trade, such rate to be fixed with reference to the lowest grade of ordinary workers in the trade;and that a Trade Board be authorised to fix -(b) if so authoricod by Order of the Miniefcer of Labour, a special minimum time-rate for workers performing work ancillary to that performed by the general body of workers;(e) a pioce-work basis time-rate;(d) a guaranteed time-rate for pioce workers;(e) minimum pieco-ratoe for out- or homo-workere engaged in piece-work in the trado:(f) overtime rates based upon the above rates;and that such rates when confirmed be enforceable in manner now provided by the Trade Boards Acts.(4)   That a Trade Board have power to fix -(a) apodal minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates for special classes of work in the trade or workers engaged In any special process;(b) minimum piece-rates for In-workers:(c) special minimum piece-rates for in-workora to be fixed on the application of an individual employer to apply in respect of workers employed by him;(d) overtime rates based upon the above ratea;and to apply for confirmation of such rates, and that such rates if confirmed be recoverable by civil proceedings only.(5)   That any question arising under the last preceding recommendation be determined by agreement betwsen the members representing employers and the members representing workers, and that for this purpose the assent of not less than three-fourths of tho members of either side present and voting on the question (not loss than one-half of the members on the side being present) do bind the side.Under the existing Acts the body of ratos thus dividedinto two classes by tho Gave Committee are criminally
enforceable and can be fixed by a bare majority.The position recommended by the Gave Committee cannot be reached without alteration of the existing statutes. The Minister of Labour, however,  in confirming rates will bear the recommendations of the Cave Committee in this respect in mind and would hope that rates other than general minimum timo-rates would be commonly fixed by the Trade Boards by agreement of tho two aides.     It must not be understood by this that the Minister will necessarily con-firm in every case where such agreement has been reached nor that he will necessarily withhold confirmation in every case where it has not been reached.     But it is desired that Trade Boards in fixing rates shall have this recommends tion of the Cave Committee in mind.(5) Miscellaneous.These are the principal recommendations of the Cave Committee.     There are, in addition, a certain number of other recommendations of considerable, though less, importance, all of which would require statutory amendment. No action, therefore, can be taken upon these recommendation pending legislation.Finally, attention is called to certain points ofadministration with regard to the relations between theTrade Boards and the Minister of Labour which have beenthe regular Departmental practice for so^e time and whichwill continue to be tho practice of the Department -(l) There should be a regular practice of earlyconsultation between the Department and the Trade Boards as to the form in which the determinations of the Boards are to be expressed.(2) The Trade Boards should have facilities for obtaining at any stage legal advice on questions relevant to thoir work, and should have an opportunity of expressing their views themselves to the Minister&apos;s legal adviser.
While the Minister is ultimately responsible . for the enforcement of the Acts and, subject to the Courts, for the interpretation of scope, arrangements should be made to ensure the closest co-operation between the Depart-ment and the Trade Boards in tho carrying out of the39 duties.
