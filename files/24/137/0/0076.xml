TSIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT,CABINET.4077. HOUSE OP LORDS REFORM. J      P.9.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.*The difficulties of making proposals for any reform of the present Second Chamber are very evident in considering the two schemes put forward - one by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the other by the President of the Board of Education.The scheme put forward by the Foreign Secretary is obviously one of compromise:   It consists partly of hereditary peers elected by and out of their own body, partly of members elected by indirect election, and partly of nominated peers* It is obvious that a body so created, while being able to claim a broader basis of representation than a purely hereditary Chamber, will not be able to command in a democratic conanunity, that authority which a body, which Is based on the broader franchise and can claim to be representative, would be able to. The hereditary principle - one of the chief causes of attack on the constitution of the present Second Chamber - will remain sufficiently large to enable, In a future conflict between the two Houses, a similar attack to be directed as has been the case in the past.     It is probable from the composition of the hereditary peerage that the whole of Its elected representatives would represent one political party of the State, even when a system of proportional voting is applied to its eleotion which may enable a small number of Liberal Peers to be Included in the hundred.While the proposal would probably concentrate ths mest active politicians from the hereditary peerage and do away with the reproach of Important questions being decided on occasions by the votes of those who rarely, if ever, take any part in the
tJ lu fc*proceedings of the House of Lords, It will undoubtedly very much diminish the importance of the privilege of the hereditary peeragei    The hereditary principle has one advantage, namely, it gives an entirely free and unbiased expression of opinion, whether popular or not, by its Members.     Whether a body consisting partly of one class of peers and another class of Lords of Parliament would form a harmonious combination or whether there would be a contingency for a division on these lines is also a question of importance.Regarding the elected members, except for the purpose of differentiating in some way the electoral bodies returning members to the House of Commons and members to the House of Peers, it is difficult to see what the advantage of the system of electoral colleges, as proposed in the scheme, is to be.     I see a very grave disadvantage in the fact that it makes bodies primarily elected for and concerned with the local government of this country, the political instrument of the greatest importance to various political parties,     County Councils on the whole, and Borough. Councils to a large extent, are elected on local and not neoeswarily political issues. In view of the fact that under this bfheme they would really control the political complexion of the Second Chamber, seats on these bodies would become cf the utr,iOgt importance to the various political parties and their organisers.As tho Minister most concerned with local administration I should view this with the gravest apprehension and it does not appear to me that tho cb;ject desired cannot be achieved in other ways.     It would be quite possible by providing either that large oleotoral areas should vote directly on the system of proportional representation for
elected members of the Second Chamber or. If that Is considered too cumbrous, that they should themselves provide electoral colleges, which I believe used to be the method of election of Federal senators in some of the States in the United State.s of America.     This would avoid dragging the personnel of local Authorities into the arena of party conflict. There is an omission in the scheme which may perhaps be covered by the nominated members, but to which considerable Importance should be attached.     According to our practice, under precedent, men who have rendered long service to the State by holding Important offices, as Viceroys, Governor-Generals, or Ministers of the Crown, are as a matter of course raised to the peerage and given an opportunity of placing their experience at the service of the country without question of election.     I think It very Important that if any other system except an entirely elected Second Chamber be adopted, provision should be made to make it certain that such precedent should be continued5     The calls that are made to-day on those filling such posit ions are greater than probably at any previous period.     Indueemertp to fill them sro rather less than more.     The knowledge that when these services are completed, the holder of them will be able to exercise a continued influence on the Government of the country in his later years in the House of Lords must be an important factor In obtaining the best men in the country to continue to fill these positions,     In fact I am not sure that we ought not to go further and entitle members of the House of Commons who have been members for a considerable length of time, say 20 years, to have, If they wish, a right to a life seat in the Second Chamber without necessarily conferring on them an hereditary peerage.     These objects could be achieved by expanding the nominated members but not leaving it necessarily to the option of the Government but to establish a certain
definite right of individuals who fulfil certain conditions to obtain this privilege.     If the number was larger at the moment than the number of nominated members this difficulty could be met by filling vacancies on the death of existing members from such a panel.The difficulties and defects of these proposals are of necessity inherent in any scheme based on an attempt to reconcile in one body the hereditary principle with the electlve.The President of the Board of Education in his memorandum frankly faces this problem and proposes to eliminate the elective principle entirely and rely on a combination of hereditary peerage and nomination.If this is all the change that It is proposed to make, it would soarcely seem worth while to alter our present Second Chamber, with all its defects, for the chief accusation against It, namely, that It represented in the past merely the views of one great political party of the State and had in fact merely been an instrument to obstruct literal legislation, would be maintained with equal force.     Even under the more progressive scheme of the Foreign Secretary there is little doubt that the general complexion of the Second Chamber would be of a Conservative character.     But at any rate there is a possibility, even If a somewhat remote one, of something approximating more closely to an equal balance of parties.     As a matter of fact no Second Chamber can possibly give a fair chance of equal treatment to any of the political parties of the State who succeeded In obtaining a majority in the House of Commons except a purely elected second Chamber, and no Chamber, except such a Chamber of that character, would ever have sufficient authority to act as a really effectual barrier to a Government basing itself on a democratic franchise in the House of Commons, The creation of suoh an elected Second Chamber in detail presents
no really serious difficulties, as so many examples exist, both in our Dominions and in other democratic countries, any one of shich may be followed and modified to suit out special circumstanoes.     Such a body based on large electoral areas, with a longer term of existence, and proportional representation with a franchise of a some *h at different character to that which elects the House of Commons, would undoubtedly form a body of great strength.     It seems very-strange, but it has often bean pointed out as an objection to such a scheme, that there would be very little distinction between the body elected in that way and the House of Commons, But if we are to have a Second Chamber there seems little object in making a change unless a really effective body capable of exercising a check on the extreme legislation of a future Labour Government is to come into existence,I believe the elective principle would be more likely to meet with acceptance and coxxld be even more logically defended than any of the half and half proposals which have been put forward in an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable.Perhapa the most important question that emerges In connection with this matter is not merely the constitution of the Second Chamber but its relation to the House of Commons in case of a difference,I do not know whether it la Intended, but it would appear that the proposals made both In the memorandum of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the memorandum of the President of the Board of Education, would Involve the repeal 6.f the Parliament Act and Its replacement by some system of joint sitting.It cannot be questioned that the operation of tho parliament Act is open to many objections and it may be unfortunate that its method of endeavouring to deal with the problem was ever adopted.     It must, however, be evident
how difficult, even In fact how very impossible, it is for Liberals who were instrumental In placing this Act on the Statute Book as a result of ah acute constitutional crisis and two eleotions to consent to its repeal.The solution of Joint Sitting offers a certain real difficulty.     It depends entirely on the relative proportions of members taking part in it from the two Housesi   if the proportions are arranged so that a relatively small majority of the House of commons becomes the determining factor, it may well be argued that in effeot there is no protection at all;   if, on the other hand, the proportions are so arranged that a very large majority of the Commons is required In order to carry out its desires in a Joint Sitting, the effect really becomes a re-transfer of that power of veto to the LordB which the Parliament Act was intended to repeal.    As to what is reasonable or unreasonable in this respect is a question of opinion and partisans on both sides would find it easy to argue their case whatever figures are adopted.     It is impossible to oonaent to a principle in this matter as everything really depends on these figures of proportions.    The Parliament Aot with all its faults is a definite arrangement on the Statute Book.     It has been in operation and has shewn in practice how difficult it is for any Government to persevere Session after session with the same measure In case of dispute between the two Houses.     No Government with a small majority would be at all likely to be able to survive the period whioh the Parliament Act requires for its operation, - certainly not If the general feeling of the country go-ee-against Its proposed legislation.     It is a much stronger safeguard than a Joint Sitting In which only a relatively small majority of the House of commons is required for effective legislation.     In viewing the question fro*. all its aspects I can only repeat that it seems to me impossible for
any Liberal member of the CoAlltion to assent to Its repeal and I feel eonfldent that If he does so, he will oease to be regarded as being a Liberal by those who are now supporting him as such.I earnestly hope that this difficulty will not be presented to us at this critioal moment.     To introduce controversy which may readily result in the destruction of the existing Coalition on a question in whioh there Is no public Interest or popular pressure would surely not he Justified.A, MOND, 1.7,1922.Ministry of Health,
