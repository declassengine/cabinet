This document is the property of His.Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government.)I!GAB I N E T,4088. I    s-.DISPOSAL OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. /Memorandum by the Home Sec-rotary.I circulate herewith for the information of the Cabinet a report of a conference held at the Home Office on the 19th June to discuss the position resulting from the existence of a considerable residuum of the enormous stocks of firearms, ammunition and explosives that became surplus to national require-ments after the Great Warg   All the departmental representatives present at the conference agreed that there is far too much of this dangerous material in the country,,    Its existence is a   : constant tomptation to ill-disposed persons and a standing menace to peace and order both at home and abroad.   The Home Office and Scotland lard view the situation with growing anxiety,I recommend that the Government should issue instructions forthwith -(l) that all firearms in excess of what are likely to be required for legitimate purposes within the next year or two are to be destroyed immediatelyj and(S) that no more ammunition is to be sold to private firms for breaking up.   All that cannot be dealt with in Government establishments under the strictest supervision and control should be destroyed absolutely. A3 regards the export of all such material  (whether it has been acquired in the past from the Government or comes from other sources) the conference suggested two methods of securing that stocks shall be exported only in British shipsu   As noon as it is decided which is the better method, this requirement will be enforced.E, S.7th July, 1922.S.F.4.40.
On 19th June, 1922, an Inter-departmental conference met at the Home Office to consider questions arising out of the existence in Great Britain of large stocks of service firearms, ammunition, grenades, etc. surplus to the requirements of H.M. Forces.Sir John Anderson presided.     Representatives were present from New Scotland Yard, Admiralty, War Office, Air Force, Disposals Commission, Board of Trade and Customs.Sir Wyndham Childs, Assistant Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, said that two souroes of danger were indicated by recent information (l) stocks in warehouses etc. or in transit in this country might be raided or pass into wrong hands;    (2) stocks exported might be intended or diverted for use against Great Britain, obvious danger spots being e.g. Russia, India, Afghanistan,&quot;Egypt and Ireland,It appeared that the Service Departments, over and above stocks, that must be retained, have enormous quantities of fire-arms (including machine guns), ammunition, grenades, etc. declared, or soon likely to be deolared, surplus.     These are guarded by the Service Departments,When they are transferred to the Disposals Commission that Department,becomes responsible.     Its arrangements for guarding stocks, in warehouses or in transit have been reviewed recently in consultation with the Home Office and the conference did not consider that question in detail.The function of the Disposal Commission is to realise stocks to the best advantage.     Arms are sold intact;    with certain exceptions, grenades, bombs, detonators, and ammunition are sold only for breaking down under supervision.Before the war arms were not sold intact.     Ammunition etc, was destroyed,.It should be stated that during the war the Inter-Departmental Committee on the control of firearms recommended
that the British Government should retain all surplus servicearms and ammunition under its own control and should seoure aninternational agreement that no Government should sell or alienatestocks, that manuafacture and sale should he controlled, and thatexport and import should he prohibited except under licence.At the Peace Conference such an agreement was embodied In an iArms Convention.     The United States of America however refused to adhere;    it has not been thought right to Close to British traders markets open to other competitors;    manufacture and sale are allowed to any extent provided the dealers are registered or that private puchasers have police certificates;    export and import have been controlled hut the control of export has not been so rigid as was originally intended;    and the British Government has allowed surplus stocks of usable firearms (but not ammunition) to come upon the market.At the Conference, Sir Wyndham Childs and tho representatives of the Service Departments and the Disposals Commission expressed a definite opinion in favour of reverting to the pre-war practice of destroying all surplus service ammunition etc.  (preferably by sinking at sea) and of rendering all service firearms unusable before sale.The adoption of this recommendation may involve a certain loss of revenue but will diminish the world&apos;s stock of arms and a constant source of danger to Britain abroad and at home0      Stocks require constant guarding while under Government control or in transit and there is no effective guarantee that they will not fall into the wrong hands when disposed of.As regards export of Government stocks already disposed of or of stocks manufactured in this country or imported, Sir Wyndham Childs and the representatives of the Servioe Departments agreed that it would be better if it oould be prohibited altogether.     Short of this, they considered that export should be closely restricted if nut, positively hampered.     The reasons
against allowing any trade interest to weigh unduly were similar to those urged against any national profit-making out of realising surplus stores, e.g. the danger of having large stooks in hand or in transit and the risk that there may be export to undesirable destinations or that stooks exported to accredited destinations will be diverted or will releaso other stocks for improper use.Export at present is controlled by the Board of Trade who grant licences only for certain destinations and, before licensing largo consignments, consult the Foreign Offioe and the War Offioe.At the Conference the War Offioe representatives explained that their official advice,- when they were consulted, has regard only to military considerations.The Board of Trade however consult the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police if there is any sort of ground for suspicion and under -standing arrangements tho Home Office communicates to the Board of Trade any information (e.g. from the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, or the Aliens Inspectorate) as to persons wh03e applications should be handled with caution.Recently the Board of Trade, after finding that the War Office &quot;had no objection&quot;, granted licence for the export of 49,000 rifles to the Piraeus,    The vessel, the Odland II, was diverted at sea, under sealed orders in the hands of a supercargoj it proceeded to Sweden, and the cargo was re-exported to Murmansk whence it is believed to have been conveyed to the Afghan frontier. The Customs have the question of a prosecution in hand,   but such incidents should be prevented.Sir Wyndham Childs at the Conference therefore urged further precautions, and in particular, that export of large stocks, even if the War Office and the Police have been consulted, should be allowed only in British ships, under British masters, and with approved British crews.Two methods of imposing a condition that large or special stooks should be exported only in British ships were mentioned
S.F.4. 36-9.in the subsequent discussion -(a) the Board of Trade might impose it as a condition of the licence, if the Board find that such a practice would not be a breach of general treaty arrangements(b) the Home Secretary might make an order under section 9 of the Firearms Act   1920 prohibiting &quot;removals for export&quot;  (i.e. removals within Great Britain precedent to actual importation) except with a police permit, and he might instruct the police not to grant permits unless they were satisfied that shipment would be in British bottoms under satisfactory conditions.Course (a) has the advantage of simplicity6    Course (b) would bring polioe knowledge to bear, though some, forces would have little or no useful information.   Both courses will be oarofully considered.  .Possession of firearms and ammunition in this country and removals to Ireland which are controlled under the Firearms Act did not oall for discussion.The absence of any restriction of the quantities of firearms and ammunition that may be imported or manufactured, and the fact that other countries may be taking advantage of opportunities for foreign trade in arms, have a certain bearing on the policy of foregoing the sale of surplus Government stocks of service firearms in usable condition and of restricting export by traders., but as a result of the Conference it is submitted that the discontinuance of such sale should be considered and that any possible improvements in the control of export should be effected,
