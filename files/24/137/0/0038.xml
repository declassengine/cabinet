Memorandum byi the Home Secretary .-In July, 1921, I circulated to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill (CP.3153) to give effect   to the recommendations of the Parmoor Committee on Industrial Assurance.   In this memorandum I suggested that the Bill should &quot;be introduced.in the Session of 1921 in order that all persons concerned might know   what were the Government proposals and &quot;be able to submit representations0    The Bill was accordingly introduced in,the House of Lords in August, 19210   Lord Onslow in introducing the Bill explained that it was not intended to proceed with the measure in the ;., Session of 192.1 and that the Government would consider any representations made by persons affected before, introducing legislation in 1922.The Companies-and Societies oonoerned,, as was to be expected, have conducted a strong campaign against the Bill, especially by advertisements in the press.   They also sub- &apos; mitted to me as an alternative a Bill of their own whioh omitted the main provisions contained in the Government Bill for the protection of the policy holders.   At a deputation from the Association of Industrial Assurance and Collecting Societies which came to see me I said that the alternative . Bill proposed by the Companies could not be aocepted, but that I was prepared to discuss modifications of the Govern-ment Bill with a view to meeting the objections of the Companies so far as was reasonably practicable while preserving the essential provisions for the protection of the policyholderso   As a result negotiations took place
between representatives of. the Association and Sir Alfred Watson., the Government Actuary, and Mr. Stuart Robertson, the Chief. Registrar of Friendly Societies, who have been advising me on the Bill.    In the course of these negotiations it was found that a number of the objections raised by the Companies were either withdrawn on explanations being given or could be met by modifica-tiona of the provisions of the Bill.There are, however, certain provisions in the Bill of 1921, on which no Agreement is practicable.   These are Clause 4, providing substantially, that: the expenses of management shall not exceed 40^ of the weekly premiums plus 25$ of the other premiums, and the provision in Clause 18(4) that if a valuation discloses a surplus in the Industrial Assurance Fund it shall be a condition of the distribution of the whole or any part thereof that not less than one-half of the amount distributed shall be applied to the benefit of the Industrial Assurance policyholders.The origin of these provisions is as follows:-The Parmoor Committee recommended that procuration fees for new business should be abolished and a minimum weekly wage substituted with commiasion on any&apos;increase of collection over a certain leveli (See paragraph 42 on page 11 of the Report).   These proposals were strongly opposed by the Companies and it was felt that there were objections to prohibiting by statute this particular method of remunerating the agents.   Remuneration by commission is not of course confined to Insurance Societies and strong arguments would be urged by all sections of the business world against legislative interference in a matter of this kind,   I decided, therefore, in 1921, to adopt as an alternative to the Parmoor proposal a provision imposing limits on the share of the premiums which can be spent on expenses, leaving it to the Companies to decide for themselves what is the best method of spending..this share,,This proposal by itself was open to attack on the ground that limitation of expenditure might simply mean an increase of the
dividends to the shareholders at the cost of the agents, and it was indeed argued in the Insurance Agents&apos; newspapers that the proposal emanated from a capitalist Government anxious, not to protect the policy-holders, but to clear the way for an increase of dividends by reducing the sums distributed amongst the agents.   The argument that it is wrong to limit expenses without at the same time limiting dividends is a strong one, and in the Bill as introduced in 1921 dividends were brought within the expenditure on which Clause 4 imposed limits, and it was provided by Clause 18(4) that the polioyholders should reoeive 50$ of whatever surplus was distributed.These proposals, however, are strongly opposed by the Societies and Companies and by their Agents organisations and . having regard to the strength of this opposition I have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to omit them from the new Bill.The argument in favour of such provisions is as follows:-During the years 1912-1917 the average expenditure of all the Companies and Societies on management and commission was o^er 41$ - dividends to shareholders brought the figure up to 44$.    Since the war there has been a general increase in the ratioj and I am advised that it is possible, on the tables of benefits generally in force, for an efficiently conducted Company to remain solvent while continuously spending as much as 45$ of its weekly premiums on management and commission.   The collection of weekly premiums is, of course, a costly business and the expense ratio of such a method of insurance must always be high - but there is no doubt that the present system of competition inflates the cost unduly, since competitive effort instead of being directed to providing greater benefits for the policyholders Is concentrated ohiefly en &quot;pushing&quot; business and securing more
effective oanvassing by the agents.But though a system under which out of every l/- collected weekly 5ld. goes in expenses is open to serious criticism, it is, I fear, under present conditions impracticable to secure an immediate remedy.    It is argued that a limitation of expenses is improper interference with the carrying on of insurance business by men who know their own business bestj that it involves many practical difficulties, e.g. it would hamper a new Company attempting to establish itself by lavish use of advertisements and agents; and finally that if a figure for the percentage of expenses is fixed in the Bill, this will be in effect not a maximum rate, but a fixed universal rate.   If left to themselves some of the Companies and Societies say they will be able to reduce expense below 40$, but if this figure is fixed in tho Bill, the Agents will oppose any reduction below this figure.The opposition of the Insurance Companies and Societies to these provisions would probably be supported on principle by business interests generally - insurance is not the only commodity of which the price is inflated by the cost of competitive methods -and there is no doubt that if these provisions were retained the Bi would be highly contentious.    On the other hand, I am given to unde stand that with the omission of these provisions the Bill will not excite any substantial opposition,A draft Bill omitting the contentious provisions in question and containing other amendments resulting from negotiati ons with t&quot; Insurance Companies and Societies is attached, and I ask for approval to its immediate introduction.   There is a strong demand in certain quarters for legislation to carry out the Parmoor recommendations and I have stated in reply to several Questions addressed to me this Session that I hope to introduce the Bill at an early date,6th June, 1922.
