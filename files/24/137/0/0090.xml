War, when Railway rates and charges generally were raised, the Post Offioe agreed to contribute an increase first of 60$ and then &quot;of 100$ over the pre-war rates to the Ministry, of  . Transport for the credit of the Railway pool.After the removal of Government control in August .1981 negotiations, were opened with the Railways as to the future remuneration,, and the Companl.es have, agreed to accept .40$   . Instead of the 55$ prescribed by the Parcels Act, on condition that the Post Offioe. does not transfer the Parcel Mails to road transport.   This will represent a saving of nearly  800000 per.  nnuma   This Bill Is required to, confirm that .. agreement.   As the Railways are at present being paid provisionally on the new basis,, which Is considerably higher . than the payments justified by the Act of 1915, It is desirable that statutory, -authority to regularise their . payments should be obtained without delay.The Bill has been considered by the Technical Suh-Committee of the Provisional &quot;Government, of Ireland Committee and it was decided that it should not apply to Southern IrelandoPOST .01*57.03 (PifoOHEiS) ICABINS T.Memorandum by the Postmaster. -General..P.
