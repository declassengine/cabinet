The reception of the terms of the Constitution by De valera&apos;s party has naturally been hostile, and this, combined with the results of the elections, may precipitate action on the part of the extremists in favour of a Republic,From the election results published so far it appears that a large-majority of votes have been given in favour of the &quot;Pro-Treaty&quot; candidates, oheinteresting fact being that a large proportion of the votes cast in favour of. the successful Labour candidate for CORK CITY nominated a Pro-Treaty candidate as their second choice.

Until such time as the general public in BELFAST take steps to assist the Grown Forces in the arrest and punishment of the gunmen of both parties no great diminution in the number of outrages can be expected.The three rifles, which were reported as being lost by a patrol of the 1st Somerset Light Infantry in last week&apos;s. summary, have now been recovered.4, T3ie neighbourhood of NEWRY was raided by bands of armedmen during night 16/17 June.Four men and one woman were murdered,, two men wounded -all Protestant loyalists.
