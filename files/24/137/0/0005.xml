h(THIS D0CUM5FJ? IS SHE ?ROPE &apos;i!Y OP HIS BKITAMIO MAJESTY13 G0TJSF;HM2Ff)SECRET. 0 A B I I S I.CP.  4005. HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.LAW OP PROPERTY BILLBy the direction of the Chairman I circulate to the Committee,for information,the following letter, which he has received from the Solicitor-General relative to an amendment to the law of Property Bill.P. WICKS Secretary, Homo Affairs Committee.30th May, 1922.My dear Fiaher,With seme doubt I accented an amendment to the law Cf property Bill to-day of which I think the Cabinet should be informed,    I did it quite provisionally and made it clear that I might move to take it out on Report. Under the grades Union Act 1871 a trades union is precluded by law from buying or leasing land of a greater extent than one acre.    I accepted an amendment deleting this limitation.   i&apos;he amendment was moved by Colonel John Ward, who said that all the Labour Party.wanted it and that he thought it was very desirable that the Labour Party and the trades Unions in particular should own as much land as possible in order to give them a proprietary interest, which would disincline them to revolution.     &apos;J?he view commended itself to me, but I am not sure that it was within the scope of the Bill, nor am I sure that the amend-ment may not clash with some rule of law as regards mortmain or some statutory provision.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) LESLIE SCOOT.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I. slst. May, 1922.
