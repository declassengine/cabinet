DRAffT Off A GERMAN NOTE TO TE&amp; ALLIED POWERS.The extraordinary drop in the -rate of exchange of the mark which has taken place during the last few weeks and the deterioration of .the financial situation of Germany connected with this fact,  compel the German Government to approach the allied Governments with proposals^ which have for purpose a reduction of the cash payments at present to he rendered in ac c c rda nee with the Treaty of Versailles.   In the annex I have the honour to forward copy of a note which the Chancellor has transmitted to the President of the Reparation Commission.    In this Mote, after a detailed statement of the oircumstances necessitating such proceeding, it is requested to distribute the cash payments beooraing due in the course of this year in accordance with the decision of March 21st, 1922, over a space of time extending to December 31st 1924 and to grant a respite with respect to all other oash payments which might become due during the term of time mentioned in accord-ance with the schedule of payments of May 5th 1921. Attention is further drawn to the necessity to come to new arrangements with respect to the German obligations arising out of the Clearing proceedings and out of Section IV of Part 1 of the Treaty of Versailles, as far as they concern cash payments to be made by the German Government,By order of my Government 1 beg to direct the request to the Government to come to an arrangement withrespect to the last named obligations as soon as possible.If the German Government is to be aided, these arrangementswouJ d have to be shaped in the following manner for thetime extending to the end of 1924:In an Agreement dated June 10th 1921 it was determinedby the Governments concerned, that on the part of Germanytwo million pounds should be paid every month to the AlliedClearing
6311Clearing Offices in order to cover the German Obligations arising&apos; out of the Clearing proceedings.    The German Govern-ment is of opinion that in future, the monthly payments should not exceed half a million pounds1.   Payments to this amount would be rendered regularly without considering tho state of the accounts at the timecWhat payments the German Government will have 4o render in accordance with Section IV of Part x of the Treaty of Versailles and particularly in accordance with 8 S97(e)is Incalculable0    Claims to an extraordinary high amount have been brought against the German Government before the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals; new claims are still continuously coming in.    TheN result of these law-suites is uncertain.   Claims which-have been decided upon are to be paid for in the first instance from the returns realised from German property in the Allied Countries concerned.    Special agreements have been reached with certain Powers with respect to this matter.    In as far as the returns realised by liquidation do not suffice, cash payments are demanded.   The German Government is of the opinion that it would be advisable not to charge Germany with further cash payments during the time of respite which she asks for. Two ways are possible with that end in view.   Either the Governments concerned do not demand payments in fulfilment of such claims during that time, or Germany only renders such payments up to the amount of,the monthly.instalment which will be fixed, for .reparation cash payments, suoh payments being included in the instalment so that this instalment represents the total monthly obligation arising from Reparations and from. Section IV of Part X...
D R A P 1     of a German Hote to the Reparation CorralssioniIn spite of grave economical objections virich have already been set out in the note of January 23th of this year the German Government has up to nor; effected those payments, which had been fixed by the decisions of the Reparation Commission of January 13th and March 21st of this year.Meanwhile conditions in the rates of exchange have further altered to the detriment of Germany.     In May 1921 a rate of 60 Paper Marks for the Dollar formed the basis for the fulfilment of the German reparation.payments, while In March 1922 the rate of exchange of the Dollar, rose to 285 and on. July 7th 1922 to 500 Marks.-    Supposing that in accordance v/lth the agreements concluded at that time, an amount of about 2 Milliards of G-old Marks of the obligations fixed by the London Schedule of Payments of May 5th 1921 had to be paid in cash, this amount, would have required an inner covering of about 23 Milliards of Taper Marks. In order to effect those cash payments, reduced to .720 Million Gold Marks by the decision of the Reparation Commission of March 1922, an amount of 51.4 Milliards of Paper Marks would according to the .rate of e xchange of March 1922 have been necessary,.which amount, taking into consideration the present conditions of exchange, has now risen to 80 Milliards of Paper Marks.     To this sum must be added the other.obligations of payments in foreign currencies, which -Germany is bound, to make under the Treaty of Versailles, totalling about&apos;600 Million Gold
Marks or 66 Milliards- Paper Marks annually.If under these circumstances the German Government should he obliged to continue to procure foreign cur-currencies to an extent similar to the present in order to fulfil the obligations arising out of the Treaty of Ver-sailles, the present depreciation of the value of the German Paper Mark would progress rapidly and perpetually and lead to a complete dissolution of the f financial, economical and social life of Germany.     For this reason the German Government is, under the actual conditions, unable to promise any further cash payments in accordance with the decision of the Reparations Commission of-March 21st 1922.The German Government propose:a) to distribute the paynents in cash still be-coming due, in accordance with the decision of the Repa-ration Commission of March 21st 1922, in the course of the year 1922 over a time extending, to December 31st 1924 jb) to grant the German Government a respite with respectto all other cash-payments which might becomedue during the above mentioned space of time in accordance with the Schedule of Payments of May 5th 1921. &quot;The decision asked for by the German Government will only attain its propose, if all other payments, besides purely reparation payments arising out of the Treaty of Versailles, in as far as they have to be paid in foreign currencies, will likewise find due consideration.   Among such payments must particularly be mentioned the obliga-tions of- the German Government arising out of Section IV to Part X of the Treaty of Versailles.     And with regard to the German payments to the Allied ClearingOffice?/
Offices the same reasons which make it impossible for the German Government to fulfil the obligation of payment arising out of tho decision of March 21st 1922 also apply to the carrying out of the agreements which were concluded on June 10th 1921.     For this reason the German Government lias addressed a letter to the government-ments concerned, with a view to arrive at another arrangement in respect to these Clearing payments. Copy of the said letter is herewith enclosed.     The German Government requests the Reparation Commission to support on its part the demand addressed by this letter to the respective Governments.The recent development of the rate of exchange of the Mark, which began with the adjournment of the nego-tiations of the loan Committee, necessitates a speedy, provisional settlement of the cash payments, the relief expected from a foreign loan having, not yet been realised..     In consideration of the above the German Government would be glad If the Commission would take its decision as to the demand for a respite with all haste and trusts that such a decision will further the resump-tion of the loan negotiations *
