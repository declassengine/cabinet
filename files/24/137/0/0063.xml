This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government-SECRET.CP. 4063.THE CABINET.LOCOMOTIVES AT WOOLWICH.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In 1919, the Cabinet sanctioned the building of 100 locomotives at Woolwich as a means of affording relief to unemployment (Cabinet 16 (20), Conclusion (2) ).. Negotiations for their disposal to Roumania unfortunately broke down, owing to the fact that the terms of payment offered were such as the Treasury could not approve. The locomotives were,, therefore, formally notified, in September, for disposal to the Disposal and Liquidation Commission.A suggestion was subsequently made that they might be sold in the Colonies, but the Secretary of State for the Colonies has ascertained that this is impracticable.It is now understood from the Disposal and Liquidation Commission that, in the present state of the market, it is not anticipated that the engines will sell for more than  5,000 each, if as much. .The total estimated cost of the 100 engines is  1,600,000. Of this sum,  1,365,000 had been spent by the end of May, leaving  235,000 still to be expended in materials, kbour and on cost.We are, therefore, faced with the expenditure of a further  235,000 in order to obtain a possible  500,000 for the 100 completed locomotives.On the other hand, the Director-General of Factories estimates that 50 of the engines could be completed for an expenditure of about  35,000, to realise  250,000. The remaining 50 boilers, he considers, would fetch  2,000 each,  100,000 in all. In addition, the semi-manufactured parts should be disposable, and, in any case, ought to be worth a further  50,000. The total would then be  400,000. From a comparison of the above results, it appears that  100,000 of the total loss would be saved, if the work on the engines were stopped at once.A further consideration is that the engines have to be kept in the open, and that unless they are disposed of without undue delay, they are liable to serious depreciation.Against the above must be set the fact that the whole of the contribution to the on cost of the factory will not be really saved, and further that this course will put an additional 250 to 300 men out of work.&apos;Immediate action, however, is necessary if any saving is to be effected, and, unless objection is taken by any of my colleagues within the next week, I propose to cut the loss and give instructions that only 50 engines are to be completed.L. W.-E.The War Office,June, 1922.(b22/181)   100  6/22   w.o.p.   138
