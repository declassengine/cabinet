[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s government..Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1922.SECRET.m^^mmmmmmm^^mmmmmmm \CP. 4073. *  3CABINET.SPECIAL   REPORT   ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 69.   WEEK ENDED JUNE 23, 1922.THE  SITUATION.It was hoped that the termination of the dispute in the engineering industry would, in some quarters at least, result in a revival of trade. In point of fact, some only of the men affected have been re-engaged, as many of the firms concerned have insufficient work to enable them to re-engage all their workpeople.In the shipbuilding industry very little constructional work is to be obtained, and apart from repair work, which is brisk in the North-Eastern Division, not much improvement is to be expected.The volume of unemployment in coal mines continues to be abnormal. No improvement may be looked for until a resumption of work occurs in the engineering industry.In the iron and steel industry, the position remains much the same in the Midlands, but further discharges are occurring in Scotland. In some parts of the North-Eastern and Wales Divisions, however, trade shows an upward tendency.The building trade is quiet in the South-Eastern, North-Western and Wales Divisions, but in the South-Western Division some slight improvement has been recorded.From most Divisions reports indicating a steady increase of employment in the clothing industry have been received.Trade is brisk in the hosiery and woollen and worsted trades in the Midlands and in the North-Eastern Divisions, but no change is reported from Scotland, where, however, there is some activity in the linen and regular employment in the linoleum trades. The revival in the jute industry has not been maintained. Some improve-ments in the lace industry have been recordec&apos; at Barnstaple and Exeter, while the glove trade is brisk at Barnstaple.Increased activity is reported in the Lancashire cotton mills.Unemployment in the transport services is particularly acute at Bristol and Southampton. Transport workers are working full time at Barry, while some improvement has been reported at the Newport and Swansea Docks.The situation in the pottery industry in the Midlands remains almost unchanged, but there is some slight tendency towards improvement.[P.T.O.
In the South-Western Division the paper-making and printing trades have suffered a set-back. In Scotland the fishing industry is reported as having a very unsuccessful season. There is no improvement in the industrial outlook in the slate quarries of North Wales.&quot; T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of LabourNOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON JUNE 23, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year. .During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 60 per cent, in December&apos;, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 were: To the end of  Per cent.January ...      -   ... ... ... ... 6-9February ... ... ... ... 8-5March     ... ... ... ... ... 100April      ... ... ... ... ... 17-6May        ... ... ... ... ... 22-2June       ... ... ....... ... 231July       ... ... ... ... 16-7August    ... ... ... ... ... 16-3September ... ... ... ... 14-8October   ... ... ... ... ... 15-6November ... ... ... 15 9December ... ... 16-5The figures for 1922 are: To the end of-January ... ... ... ... ... 16-8February ... ... ... ... 16-3March    ... ... ... ... ... 16-3April      ... . . ... ... ... 17-0May       ... ... ... ... 164NOTE. In some items in the Report the figures given relate to Great Britain and Ireland, in others to Great Britain only. In each instance the scope of the figures shown is clearly stated. Where figures relate to works financed partially by the Government, or to other expenditure from Government funds, they have in all cases been given for the area (Great Britain only, or Great Britain and Ireland together, as the case may be), the expenditure in respect of which is met by the British Government.

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet,&apos; when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to June 16, 1922.

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 109,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN AT JUNE 16, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.	i Number Employed j in Greater London.	j Number Employed in Provinces.
