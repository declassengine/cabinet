(Reference how.Ca-105, Conclusion 2)a		10      I refer to the memorandum (C.P-v-3670) of 31st 1922, submitted by the Minister of Health and cons in the Committee of Home Affairs on 23rd February^		January, considered	2b the it	Tn the discussion on the Hemorandum I stated position in Scotland had not then become acute has how materially changed as the result of a d	that , but ecisionby the Pirst Division of the Court      Session cn 24th June.The Court have reached the same conclusion&quot;as that reached by the Court of Appeal in England, viz., that a notice;to quit is necessary in order to.enable the hovse pwner to exact the increases of rent permitted under the statuteo3o According to information which has been furnished to me this judgment will cause very serious trouble in Glasgow and district, not only to house owners but also to rating authorities&apos;. In this district house owners as a general rule have proceeded upon the footing that a notice to quit was unnecessary, and large sums;by way of increases of rents have been ingathered on this basis.4.     In these circumstances I am of opinion that the question should be further and immediately-examined-.     Amending legislation is, I think, urgently required-,,(Signed). ROBERT MJNRC.Scottish Office..27th June; 1922,.
