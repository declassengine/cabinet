Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Paris,June 2nd, 1922.Monsieur le Charge d!Affaires,I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a memorandum in which are stated the conditions which are necessary, in the opinion of the French Government, in order that the meetings of the Experts at She Hague may lead to practical results.I should be grateful if you would be kind enough to submit this memorandum urgently to your Government.The French Government would be glad to learn at the earliest possible moment whether your Government shares its views as regards these conditions.I have etc.,(Signed)    R. POIHCAHS.Sir Milne Cheetham, British Embassy, PARIS.
June 1st, 1928.The negotiations &apos; which have been carried out with the Soviet Delegation at Genoa for six weeks have led to no practical result.     In its reply of May 11th to the memorandum addressed to it, the Russian Delegation deliberately rejected the offer of assistance made to the Russian people;   in addition it refused all the conditions and guarantees of security expressly demanded in the invitation addressed to Russia on January LOth and reiterated on April 10th, at the opening of the Genoa Conference, as having been accepted at the same time as the invitation to the Conference.In short, in that note of May 11th, the Russian Delegation, without appearing to understand the feeling of human solidarity which had led the democracies of Western Europe to come to the assistance of the Russian democracy, refused to return the property of foreigners, to compensate them for damages sustained and to recognise debts&amp;Notwithstanding that fact, .the majority of the Powers represented at Genes felt constrained to take note of a proposal contained at the conclusion of the Russian reply and to agree to the meeting of a Commission of Experts which, commencing on June 86th, would continue the discussions with a Russian Commission &quot;with a view to examining onoe more the differences between the Russian Soviet Government and the other Gova&apos;nments.     The questions to be dealt with by these Commissions should comprise all those relating to debts, private property* and credits&quot; (clauses adopted on May 19 at Genoa).On the other hand, it has been agreed that &quot;the Powers represented at Genoa, other than Germany and Russia,should/
should be invited by the President of the Genoa Conference to send representatives to The Hague on June 15th, 1922, to examine the conditions on which the Commission of Experts would act in regard to the Russians.     The President should be asked to address a similar invitation to the United States of America if he were assured that the latter were disposed to accept it.&quot;     It was added &quot;The representatives at The Hague will decide on the composition of the Commission to be entrusted with the conduct of the negotiations with the Russian Commission.The Erenoh Delegation had understood that only experts would be sent to The Hague, but the text of the foregoing re-commendations gives ground for assuming that the meeting of Experts will be preceded by a meeting of representatives, and it is not stated whether these representatives will be political or diploma tic.     Neither is it said whether they will continue to sit along with the experts to be appointed by them nor whether they will meet diplomatic or political delegates of the Soviets.The exchange of views which will precede the meetingof the Commission of Experts must in any case be exceedinglyshort since, according to the text communicated to theRussian Delegation and accepted by that body, it is &quot;on June 20that the latest that the particulars of tho Powers represented on the non-Russian Commission, together with the names ofthe members of that Commission, will be communicated to theRussian Soviet Government.&quot;     In five days, therefore, therepresentatives of/bhe Powers invited by the President of the genoa Conference must draw up their conclusions regarding theconditions on which the Commission of Experts will actandin regard to the Russians,/must decide    ........
9. 9decide on the composition of the commission,. and the Governments represented &amp;.t the preliminary exchange of opinions must stste whether they agree or not to participate in the labours of the commission.In the course of the meetings of the Genoa Conference, the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs referred with reason to the shortness of the time allowed at Genoa (about six weeks) to settle such important and sovel matters as those dealing with the relations of the European Povrers with the Russian Soviet Government.If it is desired to arrive at any result it is, therefore, essential to know exactly and in advance what matters will be dealt with in the powers exchange of views at The Hague, for they will not have the time to accomplish in five days whet the Genoa Conference was unable to do, that is to say, to agree on a plan and a method in regard to negotiations with the Russians.It is all the more indispensable to do this as it results clearly from the discussions with the Russians at the Genoa Conference, and from the memoranda   exchanged, that the Russian Delegation has accepted none of the principles&quot; submitted to it.     Since a complete change of method is pro-posed, this method should be settled before discussions are commenced once more.In whatever field will be pursued the negotiations which it is desired to renew, it is impossible not to delimit it beforehand:    all the Powers represented at Genoa were of opinion that the principles of the Cannes resolution of January 6, 198S ought to be adhered to.     There is no reason to depart from them, for the more these principles are studied the more is it realised that they constitute a minimum which cannot be abandoned without rendering impossible all political and commercial relations.These /
These are the very principles which are plainly disowned in the Russian reply of nay 11th.     This reply refers furthermore to the first memorandum circulated at Genoa by the Soviet Delegates.     It will be recollected that this memorandum was of such a nature that the Soviet experts1 announced intention to use it as a basis of discussion obliged the French experts to withdraw;    they only agreed to resume the conversations after the formal withdrawal of the memorandum.If, therefore, it seemed impossible to engage in discussions in the faoe of such a document, the same attitude wouldappear to be enjoined with regard to the Russian reply of May 11th, which contains the same denials and the same claims;    it is above all advisable that the Russian Soviet Government should withdraw its reply of May 11th, otherwise there would be a ri,sk that the negotiations might probably end in failure or in the surrender of Europe.Again, from the very beginning of the Genoa Conference, the Soviet delegates have declared textually that &quot;the meaning of the Cannes resolutions is not clear and we ask that they should be made more clear to us.&quot;     The object of the French memorandum of January 31 was to remove contradiotions which are only apparent:      it seems necessary to restate clearly the explanations given.In reality the Soviet Delegation only accepted at Genoa the first of the Cannes resolutions, according to which &quot;nations can claim no right to dictate to each other regarding the principles- on which they are to regulate their system of ownership,  internal economy and. government.     It is for every nation to choose for itself the system which it prefers in this respect&quot;.
This principle establishes the respect for the internal sovereignty of States.     Each country is free to live as it wishes within its own frontiers.But the two following principles refer to the conditions which must he fulfilled by States if they desire to have recourse to foreign credits.     They refer in reality, as stated in the French memorandum of January 31st lest, to the conditions necessary for one country entering into financial and commercial relations with other countries.One of the errors made at Genoa by the Soviet Delegation was that of imagining that foreign governments controlled capital, public as well as private.     Neither one nor the other is at the disposal of governments;     the former depends on the will of parliaments, that is to say of the country as a whole, and the latter depends on the will of private individuals.     It follows that capital is completely free to go where they wish.     Points 2, &apos;5 and 4 of the Cannes conditions merely specify the general principles according to which capital may he most easily directed towards the countries in need of it.     If (point 8) foreigners who must furnish the funds have not &quot;the certainty that their property and their rights will be respected and that the fruits of their enterprise wall be secured to them,  &quot; they will not lend their money, which will then flow into those countries where they will find these assurances.     If, moreover, capitalists have no guarantee that the country in which their capital is going to be invested will not &quot;undertake freely to recognise all th&quot;e public debts and obligations, past or future, as well as the obligation to return or restore confiscated or secu.estre.ted property or, failing that, to compensate its owners,   &quot; they will understand...... .
understand that In that country there are no more guarantees for fresh capital than for old capital, that the principle of continuity is abolished, that some day or other the government which has repudiated in such a &quot;bare-faced manner the debts of the past may repudiate those of the future and that no security can be obtained from it;    they will establish no undertakings in that countrycThere,is therefore, no contradiction between the first and the subsequent principles:   each country is free to live in peace as it jpleases,    , but application to other countries which are built up on the principles consecrated by centuries can only be effective if these countries find in the borrowing country conditions which satisfy them.From the foregoing it follows that to accept the first Cannes resolution without agreeing to the others and without putting them into practice is to condemn oneself to isolation. If respect for foreign property and private interests is not derived from the domestic legislation of Russia, special pro-visions should guarantee the necessary elements of security. It is for the borrowing country to decide whether it prefers to modify its internal legislation or to grant special privileges to foreigners.This being so, hov: is it possible to put in practice the Cannes resolutions?     This question was studied at London, doubtless incompletely.No ambiguity should be allowed to exist as to the three matters to be discussed at The Hague, namely debts, private property, and credits.In the first place, it should be clearly understood that The Hague Commission will only concern itself with these three points and.with nothing else.     It is a Commission of Experts whose business is not to interfere in the realmof/
realm of politics and which should confine itself to questions of a practical nature, both from the e economic and the financial points of view.     It must give no fresh excuse for declarations of principle by the Soviet Repreaentatives which are nothing else than a means of propaganda.     The labours of the Commission can only be fruitful if they are clearly and practically defined.Itebts are divided into two different categories, the settlement of which must remain clearly separate;   debts of one State to another, and debts owing to private individuals.The first mentioned arise from loans made during the war and for the ?;ar.     It goes without saying that the principle of these debts must be recognised:   that is to say that the -Russian&apos;Soviet Government must recognise all the public debts and liabilities which have been contracted or guaranteed by the Russian Imperial Government, by the Russian provisional Government, or by itself with foreign powers.     This recognition does not, however, imply that the lending govern-ments will&apos; demand at once the payment of the capital or the interest on the leans made to the Russian Government during the war.     Such procedure would be so contrary to sound sense that there is no need to dwell upon it.     The creditor govern-ments will be able to estimate the manner of the repayment of their loan&amp; by the capacity of Russia to make payment and by her economic and financial revival, but there should be no doubt as to the obligation undertaken by the Russian Soviet Govemmaat to recognise the debts of its predecessors; it is a principle of public law and of    ...........
honour on which none can compromise.In the memorandum handed on May 2nd to the Russian Delegation &quot;by a certain number of Powers represented on the First Sub-Commission, mention was made of diminutions or modifications which might be made in the settlement of the war debts of Russia when a general liquidation or settlement of the respective war debts should take place among the Allied and Associated Powers;   it is natural indeed that when Russia has undertaken the same liabilities as the other contracting parties she should be treated on the same footing as they are, but there is no reason to concede beforehand to her special advantages.On the other hand the Russian soviet Delegation presented at Gejioa a certain number of claims to the Entente Powers;   these claims amounted to the sum of fifty milliards of gold roubles;   they were based upon the most inad-missible claims and the most empty calculations.     They went very wide;   the Russian Soviet Delegation claimed that the war was a general undertaking from which the Allied and Associated Powers had emerged victorious and from which they had drawn numerous benefits, v/hile Russia on the contrary had lost and had come off with a bad bargain in a war which had given advantages to the Allies.    It is unnecessary   to examine the question whether the Allied and Associated Powers won the war or whether Russia lost it: if they did so these Powers would be obliged to recall what the war cost them from the time when the Russian army, demoralised by Bolshevik propaganda, laid down its arms and allowed the enemy forces to rush over to the western Front;   and to calculate the losses resulting in humanlives...
flives and money.    we do not think that is a task for a Commission of Experts,The Soviet Government must recognise not only war debts but its liability to fulfil the financial engagements which itself or its predecessors, that is to say the Imperial Russian Government or the Provisional Government have contracted with foreign nationals;   this recognition will embrace the financial engagements of all Russian authorities, provincial or local, and also those of public utility enter-prises in Russia.    It is a question of debts owing to private individuals who had confidence in Russia;   this confidence must not be deceived and the Russian Soviet Government must take the necessary steps to comply with these engagements to the extent compatible with its ability to make payment. Were this not done&apos;, Russia would not find a single person to lend her money in any country of the world.It would appear moreover, that the best way of con-sidering an arrangement of this nature would be a direct agreement between the holders of bonds and the responsible Russian authorities;   that was the solution considered at Genoa.    It must be understood that in the event of agreement not being reached submission should be had to an arbitral tribunal v/hose decisions the Soviet Government would under-take to accept.The Hague commission will in the second place have to examine all questions dealing with property.    These questions were the subject of numerous discussions at Genoa but none succeeded in agreeing on a text which would satisfy...
- n -satisfy everyone.It must not be forgotten that Russia has been developed and animated by the work of foreigners;   it is they who, not only by their capital but also by their personal intervention, have created Russian industry;   the greater part of the industrial regions of Russia was in the hands of foreign proprietors or holders of concessions.    One of two things will happen;   either these former owners will be called back to resume their labours and their work of exploitation, thus enriching those around them once more, in conditions compati-ble with their legitimate interests, or their properties will be given to other strangers, on different conditions.    There is no doubt that such a solution, which would arouse the un-animous disapproval of the civilised Powers, would, render impossible the resumption of normal relations with Russia; moreover, at Genoa itself, the various European countries gave it to be understood that they would not be parties to such negotiations.     It must be clearly laid down that the property of the former owners belongs to them still, and that so long as they are not declared to be at full liberty either to resume possession of their property or to accept freely a sufficient and adequate compensation, these properties cannot be disposed of in any manner.With this end in view the Cannes resolution spoke of &quot; the obligation to return or restore or in default thereof to compensate all foreign interests for loss or damage cau&amp;ed to them by reason of the confiscation, or sequestration of their property&quot;.It clearly followsdthat the property in question should above all be handed back and restored and that the claimant had the right to demand its return and the restoration of hispeoperty...
property, rights and interests.    It may be impossible, after the revolutions which Russia has gone through In the last few years, to identify the property in certain cases;   it may have been destroyed or have undergone such an enormous transformation-tion that it may no longer be possible to hand it back as it was.    As regards cultivable land, for Instance, it may have been parcelled out in such a way that it would be necessary, in order to restore it to its former owner, to evict the peasants who consider themselves as having acquired It lawfully.     In these cases, but in these only, the claim might be. satisfied by an agreement between the Soviet Govern-ment and the party concerned either by the grant of equivalent property, rights or interests or by other processes which would be approved and for whose settlement the special Mixed Arbitral Tribunals would act.    In any case, in conformity with the principle that every requisition gives occasion to an adequate indemnity paid beforehand, the compensation, whatever it may be, which the former proprietor would receive must have a market value and must be capable of being dis-posed of at once, that is to say it must not consist of bonds or obligations not immediately carrying interest.It is of the utmost importance that, in view of the reconstruction of Russia, the principles laid down at London and too much ignored at Genoa should be recapitulated and clearly stated;   it is impossible that the former proprietor, the former holder of a concession or the former merchant should return to Russia without the assurance that he will be able to exploit his land, his manufacture   or his business in conditions which will permit cf a normal return on his capital invested, and, as stated in the Cannes resolution, the certainty &quot;that the fruit3 of his enterprise will be secured to him&quot;.
It must not happen that after having recovered his property the former owner will he obliged some months later to cease working it because the conditions imposed on him are such that it is impossible for him to live in Russia. Special guarantees must be given in that respect;   they must be precise, in the interests of Russia herself who, more than anyone else , will benefit by the return of the former holders of concessions.Finally the Hague commission will have to study the matter of credits;   the restoration of Russia depends toa large extent on the help which that country will receive from foreign capital;   the Experts at the London conference had already recognised that fact in stating that &quot;without a thorough change of the existing conditions which specially affect commerce and industry foreigners will refuse either to resume their former undertakings or to create new ones&quot;.     So long as these conditions have not been modified in the sense which has been outlined, no co-operation will be possible and no foreign capital can; be invested in Russia.    The investment of fresh capital in Russia can be made in various ways once the necessary securities and guarantees have been obtained;   first of all the foreigners who come to resume their trade or manufactur-ing will be able to borrow;   afterwards, various countries will be ready to grant to certain Russian bodies the. capitalnecessary for the purchase of goods;   finally, it will benew undertakings possible to create/in Russia which will receive capital,particularly as regards agriculture.
It is certain that the restoration of Russia must begin with the restoration of her agriculture.    Whereas that great country before the war exported normally 10,000,000 tons of cereals yearly, now it does not produce half the quantity which is necessary for its domestic consumption.    The result is not only the general impoverishment of the country but the frightful famine which is decimating its population.The Soviet Delegation claimed at Genoa that it had schemes for the restoration of Russia, but it never produced them, and every time the question of the economic revival of Russia was broached, it replied that State credits were necessary and that other things mattered little.    It is clear that nothing can be done in Russia so long as the attitude of the Soviet Government as indicated in the memor-andum of May 11th remains unchanged;   so long as that Government claims to require credits for itself alone or to disinterest itself practically in the reconstruction of Russia, the other Powers will be unable to take any steps for the benefit of the Russian nation, which has suffered so much and which is so worthy of consideration.The essential condition of the restoration of Russia is that of the restoration of production;   the production of cereals, oil, and raw materials of all kinds can only come from Russia herself, that is to say, from the labour of the Russian peasants.    The re-establishment of the culti-vation of the lend is at the very foundation of Russian existence, and nothing can be done to help the Russian peasant, that is to say, to give him agricultural implements and the seed which he requires, so long as he does not resume work.    He cannot resume work effectively until he is certain that he will enjoy the fruits of what he owns andwill..
To summarise the matter, the work which must be done at The Hague allows of the drawing up of a very definite and complete joint scheme of the conditions which Russia must accept before everything, and it is important that the whole world should be in agreement before it is presented to&apos;the Russian Government.    It allows at the same time of an exhaustive study of the economic conditions of Russia. Instead of sending the Russian Delegation, as was done at Genoa, a very vague draft of what can be done for Russia,all...will receive in exchange for his crops the goods which he lacks.     It is for the Russian Soviet regime, and for it only, to modify the present state of affairs in this sense.These questions were not dealt with at Genoa;   if they are not dealt with at The Hague, no good will he done there, It is indispensable that the various countries concerned should take into account the economic situation of Russia and the appropriate remedies.    This work must to a large extent form the labours of The Hague Commission.    The Allied and Neutral Experts must study all the documents placed at their disposal and consult when necessary the Russian experts in order to make an exhaustive examination of the situation in Russia.    They must be able to make investigations on the spot.     In every country experts examine the most varied matters and obtain information for themselves on behalf of their nationals.    If the Russian Government were to refuse to allow these expert enquiries to take place, it would adhere to the position it adopted in its memorandum of May 11th and it would be finally shown that it is impossible to negotiate with it.
all the Governments have first to agree on a plan for the restoration of Russia, a plan complete in detail, proceeding by stages and apportioning the rOles to he played hoth from the point of view of reconstitution and of credits.The elaboration of this plan and of the conditions which Russia must accept will require more time that is available between June 15th and 20th to the representatives who will proceed to exchange views at The Hague.    What it was impossible to accomplish at Genoa in six weeks cannot be done at The Hague in five days.    The solution of the Russian problem is a matter sufficiently serious to give it the necessary time.    No result has hitherto been achieved because people have been satisfied with hasty and insufficient-ly concerted investigations.    Since the work which has scarcely been commenced must be resumed at The Hague, it is necessary to act njethodically and, without abandoning the generous sentiments which inspired the calling together of the Genoa Conference, to face realities.
