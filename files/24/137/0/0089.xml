THE COMMUNISTS

Two important facts regarding the communist movement have come to light this week: a full time Industrial Organisation Committee has been appointed and the Red International of Labour Unions, which is merged in the Communist Party, has been informed that its "financial difficulties have now been repealed".

When the divisional organisers came to London last month the plan of campaign for permeating the unions, which had been drawn up by the sub-executive and approved by the Commission, was explained: the main decision was that in order to assist the apparatus of the Party a Joint Committee of seven members, three from the Party, three from the Bureau, and one agreed upon by both bodies, be appointed to conduct a special supplementary campaign for the building up of Party nuclei in the branches of the unions, the factories and mines, and to secure the affiliation of the most important unions to the Red International of Labour Unions. The Committee is composed principally of communist miners and engineering workers, but more regard was given to their understanding of communist activities than to their association with particular industries. The following names were agreed upon:

N.T. Watkins,

J.T. Murphy,

H. Pollitt or F. Smith.

W. Callacher,

W. Brain,

H. Webb.

A secret communist document further states that at the head of this Industrial Organisation Committee "is a new comrade of exceptional ability whom we will call/
wm    2call Comrade X&quot;:   (efforts are being made to ascertain the idertity of this man).The Committee is to be empowered by the Executive Committee of the P^rty to instruct any branch secretary or president to summon a special branch meeting to faoilita the work of the committee, to call speoial conferences of branch nuclei etc. through branch chairman or the nations or divisional organisers for the-purpose of securing uniformity of activities. The Bureau of,the Bed International of I - bour Unions will empower the committee use any local committee of the Bed International of laboi Unions to facilitate the work of convening local trades union conferences where necessary.r     The work of the commit tee is.officially defined asunder; - ;ini:p.?u  c-*&quot;(1)   To visit all the most important centres of party and Union activity for the purpose of (i Building party nuclei, (b) Winning affiliation! to Red International of Labour Unions (a) Extending where possible the nuclei organisatl to factories and mines.     &quot;(2)   To set up in each Party branoh a speoial committee ..     for co-ordinating the activities of the industrial nuclei. -u   ^(3)   Jointly with any Red International of Labour Unions&apos; Committee or other such committee, to call local conferences of the union, to oampai the specially selected unions with speakers at &quot;literature. &quot;&apos;     !&apos;; --^(4)   To assist branch leaders in the instruction oi the members as to how to make the fullest possible use of Party headquarters and the Bureau of the Red International of labour Uni(&quot;For an effective campaign along the lines indicated it will be necessary for the Party and tl Bureau to issue their programme for the miners and&apos; -    engineering workers.   The:programme should embody immediate economic and political demands as well at the reorganisation plans for the unions.   The campaign should also be supplemented by speoial attention to the work of the Committee in the pagesv     of the communist.&quot;    ,A literature oommittee,; consist Ing; of Deacon, Browiand Murphy has been set up to co-ordinate the publioaticof the Communist Piirty and the Red International of LaboUnio

We will send you for the first time 10 copies of it, will you please inform us if it will be sufficiently for you, or if we should send further copies to other addresses, which you will be as kind and communicate us. We are sure, you will find in these &apos;Press-Informations&apos; also material for the &apos;All-Power&apos;. You would oblige us very much by communicating us your opinion on these &apos;Informations&apos; for instance as about the fitness, of the translation."

Following upon this letter the July issue of "A11 Power" has been enlarged "as a result of the personal sacrifices of a small branch of comrades" and contains articles by F. Willis, R.M. Fox, T. ? and Arthur Siffleet.

The Central European Bureau of Labour Unions has sent to the British Bureau two manifestors? to the miners and one to the metal workers.

The attention which the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions is paying to the miners may be gauged from a communication sent by J.T. Murphy to J.R. Campbell.

"Can you make a special miners issue of the &apos;Worker&apos; for next week. The Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain Conference is on the 18th July and any later date for a special effort would be no good. I think the following phases ought to receive attention.

1. The Constitutional weaknesses of the Amsterdam International, as compared with the Red International of Labour Unions.

2. Its policy of splitting the unions. Special story of the French Union struggle would fit this.

3. &apos;Orders from Moscow&apos; and ? discipline.

4. &apos;The ? mind&apos;. Could not Jack Clark get hold of Hodges stuff from the Labour Party Conference and knock stuffing out of it. He is practically certain to pursue the same course at Blackpool.

5. What about a special article on Hodges in view of his dirty attack on ?

6. The Miners&apos; Agenda.

7. The Industrial Truce."

The/ 
The Vigilance Committee movement appears to be making some progress in west London and Liverpool, where Jack Tanner and Jim Breslow hope to be elected to trade union positions.

THE LABOUR PARTY CONFERENCE AND THE COMMUNISTS

The 22nd annual conference of the Labour Party, which was held in the United Free Assembly Hall, Edinburgh, from June 27th -30th inclusive, differed little from previous meetings: the perennial omnibus resolutions were passed but there was, on the whole, a smaller escape of hot air than was the case last year: apart from a somewhat extreme presidential address by F.W. Jowett and a few communist Interpolations the proceedings might almost be described as dull. Communist advances to orthodox labour were definitely repulsed and the voting on various questions indicated the desire of the delegates to dissociate themselves from bolshevism. The negotiations with the Communist Party were set out at considerable length in the report of the Labour Party Executive Committee and it is worthy of note that lengthy extracts from the "Statutes and Theses of the Third International" were included, in order to show the chief points of conflict between the constitution, objects, and policy of the two parties.

In the course of the debate on affiliation Frank Hodges declared that:

"The British Communist Party are intellectually slaves of Moscow, and have unthinkingly, unheedingly, accepted, without criticism or comment the orders issued from Asiatic minds and from the middle-class intellectuals of Russia. It is not even the judgment of the plain Russian people, but the edicts and ? of the same type of intellectuals whom they despise in this country."

? McDonald said that the communist executive were not entitled to come to them and make any pledge. They were signed/
signed, sealed, and delivered, mind, body and soul, toaocept whatever instructions they got from Moscow.     TheCommunist Party was oreated to oppose the Labour Party andto smash them,&quot;They want to oome in because they think they can wage war against us more effectively from within than from without.   They tell us&apos;quite candidly.,that they want to shake hands with us, and, at the same time, that they   have a dagger in the other hand to &apos;s&apos;tab us.&quot;The communist case was put by E. Pollitt who was supported by H. Hinshelwood of the Amalgamated engineering union:   MacManus and other prominent communists left the hallimmediately after the debate and intend to consider thedecisions of the conference this week-end:   meanwhile HarryWebb&apos;8 comments are not uninteresting:!$rom the pronouncements in the Press it is more and more obvious that the whole of the Labour Leaders are obsessed with the prospects of electoral success. The Ballot Box, has beoome&quot;aa end in itself.   Hodges&apos; speech, which was lauded&quot; to the skies by the &apos;Times&apos;, definitely proves that official Labour has made a united front with capitalism against the revolutionary working; olass.   Personally, I believe that if official Labour takes the advice of Hodges and makes war upon the Paifty, It would give us every advantage to unmask the treachery of the people,&quot;The question of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; was debated in private session:   the result1 is given in another part of this report:The result&apos;of the more important resolutions was:-Affiliation of the Communist Party to the Labour Party,Exclusion of dele-gates not accept -ing principles of Labour Party.Befuaal to allow : labour officials to beoome Privy  .

Wa have an active worker in the County of Norfolk, and there are also active workers in Dowsby and Southall.

Are there government organs (periodicals) whioh contain statistical and informational statements concerning the &quot;government measures?;v   .;    4.-    Are tho bourgeois organisations subsidised by the government or tho municipality?&quot;Horace Young is returning to this country shortly from the berlin Bureau where &quot;a young Irish comrade&quot; is now working:the Bureau is complaining that the pomraunist Party of GreatBritain unlike the Irish Communist Party does not devoteany spaoo in its organ to Young Communist League matters.THE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL   &apos; rir  &apos;The &quot;Group of Revolutionary, Left Wing Communists ofRussia&quot; i.e., the Russian Section of the Fourth International,has sent Sylvia Pankhurst a communication which throwslight upon ths position of the group, the leaders of whichare at present in Berlin:&quot;At the international conference of tho Fourth Workers1; International, which will take place here in Berlin at August 15th and for which special reason I am-already here, I very muoh hope to speak to you, Comr.Pankhurst, and to organise a-Viay Of commuhication. . You.will surely be aware that our little group is under daily control and letters very often do hot. reach us &apos;: as. ,wel;las we. - due, to the control of the :iTsohekaT -are condemned to &quot;underground-work bhlyi;^And many a times eyon that -was not - and is not possible.     The Russian revolutionary members of our group have collected,several millions Rubel to support our propaganda.     I took&apos; this money with to Germany (for only here printing.of pamphlets, manifestos etc. is possible) and had to see that the -admirable collection ..sura did not even, cover the charge of postage I had until now.

The Communist Proletarian Movement grown up to oppose the Russian Soviets Government the new eoonomic policy and ----- the united front, depends on the help of the western brethren.

Peeling against the National Wages Agreement appears to be growing and some associations are of opinion that it should be terminated.   There are rumours that an appeal will be mado to the Government for a wageb subsidy and some miners1 officials are pressing for an enquiry into the state of the industry.The South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has deoided to postpone for a week the tendering of fourteen days1 notioe on the non-unionist question.mm/
BBS POSTAL WORKERS1 IHTERHATIOIIALThe Russian postal workers are attempting to affiliate to the Postal Workers1 International and had arranged to send representatives to the Executive meeting of that body in Coblenz on May 31st and June 1st:   tho position is, however, complicated by the adhesion of the Russian postal workers to the Red International and the French and Belgian delegates insisted that they must renounce.this before they could Join the Postal International&apos;. &apos; V&quot; *      1I THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;On July 2nd Noman Ewer, foreign editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; sent the following details regarding the future of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; to Philips Prioe, who is expected to attend a meeting of the papsrrs foreign correspondents at Paris on July 14th:&quot;The result of the Edinburgh Conference was an absolutely unanimous vote in favour of taking over the *Daily Herald1 and of a 2d. levy on all individual members and member-organisations of the Labour Party which are not affiliated to the Trades Onion Congress; this, of course, assuming that the Trades Union Congress in Septombor will vote a similar levy.&quot;G.L. has not come back yet, but be telephones that during the whole discussion there was absolutely no word of criticism of any of the staff or of the paper itself.   Moreover, as the personnel of the Labour Party Conference is indistinguishable - unless by the aid of a microscope - from the personnel of the Trades Union Congress, there isnTt the slightest doubt that the Trades Union Congress vote in September will also go in our favour.&apos;&apos;&quot;Working on this assumption arrangements are being made immediately for winding up the Tjaily Herald Ltd1, and transferring the ownership of the paper to Victoria House Ltd.   The V.H.sharesi will be hold by Henderson and Bo worm an as trustees for the whole movement.&quot;The new directors will be G.Lansbury, Franek Hodges and Ben Turner of the 0ld directorate, and with&apos; thorn Henderson, Boiverman, Thomas, Tom Shaw, R.B.Walker. Clynes and, I think, purcell.&quot;It/
&quot;It is an interesting galaxy;   but I doubt if any of then, will interfere much, except Henderson, Shaw and possible?..y u?/yr.es*    Any way our line is the obvious and easy one of waiting and seeirg.   For one thing, it scens pretty clear that Henderson&apos;s pro*.. pooal of this Paris conference, weens that he has no felonious Intentions at present towards the foreign.  staff.    Of course-, he. may change, his mind when he sec you all together!&quot;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY. ACTIVITIES: IN GREAT BE I TAINThere have been very few outward? signs of activity in Sinn Fein oiroles in Groat Britain during the week.    Bevel ments in Ireland have set people thinking and wondering who are their friends;   outwardly at least the majority approve the militant aotion of the Free State Government although they regret its necessity.
