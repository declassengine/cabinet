114(THI3 iJOOUMEZJT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MASESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).S EC R E T.CP.-4022. CAB Ml E T.REPORT BY THE GENERAL OF SI CSR COMMANDING-IN CHIEF 013 THE SITUATION IN IRELAND, WEEK ENDING JUNE 3rd4 1922.(Circulated by the Secretary of state for War.)DUBLIN CITY AND DISTRICT,Very little public interest in the Nominations for the Elections has been noticed.       In accordance with the pact between Collins and De Valera no political meetings are being held.   The most interesting &quot;Independent&quot; candidates in this are&amp; are the Lord Mayor of DUBLIN (DUBLIN CITY) and Mr. Darrell Figgis (CO. DUBLIN); both of these are for the Treaty.No further information has been received pointing to the discovery of the murderers of Gunner Rolfe, R.G.A.. and L/Cpl. Emery, R.A.S.C, and the various Army Motor Vehicles and Cars, which were stolen by Executive Forces and taken into the Four Courts, have not yet been returned.In very fine weather His Majesty&apos;s Birthday was delebrated for the first time for some years by a Review of the troops in Phoenix Park.     The Parade was a groat success, and the troops turned out and marched past remarkably well.     Considering that the shopkeepers of DUBLIN could not be present, there was.quite a good attendance of onlookers including many e; -eoldiars.   It was noticed that the spectators were respectful and that hats ware lifted when the various Colours of the Regiments passed by.    Many officers of the two Headquarters of the I.R.A. were recognised in plain clothes amongst the onlookers.During the week the following places in DUBLIN were handed baCk to their owners or representatives of the Provisional Govern-ment:-    ilmainham Gaol, Lever Bros. Buildings, the Masonic Hall, and the Kildare Street Club.On June 3rd a remarkable incident took place in DUBLIN.   About 40 or 50 men, some armed, preceded by a band, marched down. GRAFTON STREET in broad daylight and wrecked the premises of Hessra Woolworth in that street.       No attempt was made to interfere with these proceedings which originated In strike troubles.     This incident is typical of many other Bnlahevic actions of a similar nature throughout the 26 Counties.On May 30th a motor van, on which was painted &quot;Civil AxLat^011 Dublin&quot; and which hold an aeroplane believed to bo.a 5-aoatet A^ro, was escorted down to BAL DOM NEIL Aerodrome by provisional GovernmentTroops.
115SOUTH Off IRELAND COAST:On evening of May 26th two gunners returning on foot to FORT t CARLISLE, CiLsiSNSTOWN, were head up by a party of armed youths in a no to r oar and asked if tfcoy had any ammunition.;     As the bandoliers of the soldiers were empty they were allowed to proceed.The holding up by ono of Hie Majesty&apos;s Vessels of the &quot;Seattle Spirit&quot; (Moore - McCormiek Line) in TEA1SS BAY on June 3rd, and the discovery on board of nearly 250,000 rounds of ammunition, will have a subduing effect on the I.R.A. extremists.NORTHERN JRSLAND:There is no doubt that the justifiable proclaiming of the I.R.A- I.R..B0 and kindred Organisations within the Six Counties on May 24th, and the consequent large number of arrests, brought on a strong attack of &quot;hsrves&quot; amongst the loyalists of the North. Repi-j eels, both within and from^.-without the Border, were feared, and it *as only ueoecsary for small collections of I*R.A* to appear on the Free State side of tbo Western Border to raise the cry of &quot;Invasion^ &quot;lorry will be attacked and looted&quot;.These feazs vrsre not diminished by the statement of the Sinn Fein Lox d Fay or of EEKRY, vhc , as the result of his being held up one day and s:arched by Specials, uttered threats of the burning of that City rather than it should remain under the control of the N or the rn Sove government nt.Undoubtedly loyalists in CO. DONEGAL and near the Border were persecuted and forced to withdraw Eastward;   but the reports brought in were grossly exaggerated, and the Northern Newspapers made the most of them for political purposss.The accounts of happenings during the last week in the North, including BELFAST, show to an impartial observer with some know-ledgo ox the facts, how impossible, it is to baliava tha South of Ireland Newspapers on the one hand and the loyalist Newspapers on the other.     Both sides give an entirely distorted or biased view of nearly every incident which takes place.The centre of interest towards the end of the week lay in the BELLE EK-PETTI GOE Triangle, which is entirely out off by narrow strips of Free State Territory from the rest, of CO-FERMANAGH, the only approach without causing an &quot;international&quot; situation being by water across LOSER LOUGH ERNE, BET.T.KKK&quot; VILLAGE, which is entirely in Northern Territory, had previously been evacuated by the Special Constabulary;    but last week eom^a armed I.R.Ao came into the Village from BSllLEEK FOR&apos;;1 and vicinity.       This Fort commands the Village fx*om a small eminence on Free State ground and holds a garrison .:i some 50 men.      Other parties of IcR,.Ao moved into the Triangle and others opened fire on some Specials in the Ulster portion of P3TTIG0S VILLAGE, the larger portion of which lies in Free State Territory.       These incursions and attacks resultoc in a landing by water of a party of Specials on the &quot;/astern ona oi the ITriangls, their return to ENNISiOLLEN after about 24 hours stay; the withdrawal of the Specials from PETTIGOS VILLAGE and a reconnaissanca by Specials of BELLEEK VILLAGE from the Soivth Side of LOITER LOUGH ERI?3.     Both the landing on the Triangle
116and the reconnaissance of. BSLE3SK led to small affairs with I.RVAV; one casualty to the. Specials and the loss of a Lancia Car.     In all these cases, as wall as at GARRISON [LOUGH KELVIN J, the Specials asked for military, assistance; this was- either forthcoming and found needless or was refused owing to the danger of involving BritishTroops in a fire fight on the frontie r without the \authority to c ross the Border and without freedom of manoeuvre..&quot;;On May 30th two Military. Officers, With the 0.C, Special Police from CLONELY (two miles East of PSTTIGOE) and two Rolls Royoe Armoured ^Cars reconnoitred PETTI GOE.     The three officers advanced on foot towards the village and were fired on f,om across the Border and from the high ground west of the village. It was estimated that-fifty men and a badlyhandled machine gun took part in the firing.   The Armoured Cars covered the retreat of the officers with their fire, but two of the crews were slightly wounded.     The officers reported that there appeared to he a considerable nervousness on the Erae state aide of the Border.     Subsequent operations carried out by the troops in the BELLE2K-PSTTIG0E area will be reported in next &quot;Week&apos;a report.There has boon a considerable amount of sniping between Specials and I.R.A., in the vicinity of STRABANE (CO. TYRONE) and at FOREHILL and JONESBOROUGH (CO. ARMAGH).    ?7het was undoubtedly an attack by I.R.A*. across, the Border at STRABAJE was driven off by a &quot;A&quot;, a at &quot;BSpecials before British Troops got to the scene,.   It is reliably reported that during the firing between Specials and I.R.A. on the Border of JON3SBOR0UGH on the 27th May, telephone conversatiohs took place between both parties of Combatants requesting the other sido to stop the attack.On May 31st the old R.I.C. yor.ee In the - Six Counties ceased to exist and the Royal Ulator Constabulary have taken t&amp;eir place.      The strength of the R.U..O- is at present only about 1300 out of an establishment of 3000.     Owing to tha narrow views of the Provisional Government representatives whose duties are to try and work the Collins-Craig pact, and owing to the usual Sinn Jain intimidation., it is impossible to got Catholic recruits *for this Eorca.In BELFAST the situation showed little improvement..   The v?aek was marked by a continuance of murders, burnings and lootings.     Every effort was made by interested parties and Individuals to gat the troops detailed by small parties for the proteotion of particular houses, factories and parsons -an impossible undertaking.The following are the casualties in BELFAST, for woak. (28thMay to 3rd Ju&amp;eKILLED      . WOUNDEDPROTESTANTS   ........      ...... 5 &quot;TEZlCATHOLICS &apos; &apos;              .... 13 -56POLICE            ....      .... 2 2MILITARY         ........ .   - 2TOTAL. -20&quot;&quot;&apos;- 82In addition one unknown woman killed.
f117It will be of interest to see what will happen in the event of some of the &quot;independent&quot;, Farmers, and Labour Candidates outing some of the pro-treaty panel nominees at the forthcoming Elections *     The results may entirely upset the hopes laid in the Collins-Da Valera Coalition Agreement,(Signed)       J.
