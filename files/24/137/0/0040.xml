The communists are much perturbed, and are making arrangements to state their case as effectively as possible.Funds for communist organisation have practically come to an end and divisional conferences have been devising means of beooming self-supporting.The Scottish Workers Committee Movement is to be merged in the Red International of Labour Unions.The Young Communist League continues to receive money from the Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist International.
THE TMEMPLOYED   .On June 6 th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,440,220:   of thi3 number, about 757,000 were in receipt of unemployment benefit.The Executive of the Hational Unemployed&apos;Workers1 Committee Movement has issued a circular, signed by P.

Butcher, assembled outside a smalltenement in Providence Road and endeavoured to preventthe ejection of the occupier.   Missiles were thrown atthe/
f * fthe police with whom the unemployed came Into oontact and several arrests were subsequently made.THE COMMUKISTSIt is reported on the authority of a single informant that Arthur McManus visited an official of the Russian Trading Delegation at the end of May and was told that the Communist Party would receive no more money unless it did something effective:    in the event of a general election J would he forthcoming to cover election expenses in exoess the amount already collected by the Communist party.On June 2nd a meeting of the sub-executive of the P&amp;t was attended by A. McManus, J?,H. P6ett H. Webb, J.F. Hodgs G, Deacon, E.A. Cook, and W. Brain and after discussing tfc situation in regard to the Labour Party adjourned until J 6th, when the same people attended with the exception of C and Peet. The chairman, McManus, gave a report on Irelan based upon a message from Gallaoher that developments of t crisis were probable: the Party Commission had reoommende that A. diffleet should be appointed to the vacant seat on the editorial committee but it was decided not to consider the matter until he actually beoame a member of the Party, Charles Ashleigh was appointed to &quot;The Communist&quot; Manageme Committee and Ruderman to the Shop Management Committee.The following Is an offioial communist statement date June 1st regarding the measures adopted by divisions to meet the new finanoial situation.&quot;WALES(Divisional Council 27th May decided unanimous that Wilson be retained at  4 per week).1.

Jenkins said the vatLue of the assets held by tlDistrict Council was  116.     Two Liverpool delegates - Braoand Whitehead - asked for a correct financial statement forthe past year, but ^^hT) refused to give a statement, sayingthat he would prefer to give up his seat on the ExecutiveCommittee rather.than give a statement . with, all the complications it would involve, including the mentioning ofoertain names which might result in some of them gettingtried for high treason, but,, he added-, &quot;Some of the men whostole the money.are still in.the Communist Party and are be respected just the same as ever because the members do not know what has been done&quot;.

- 5 - 38nOn account-of the ^Headquarters in London having cut down the paid staff of the Party Lancashire has &quot;been left without a paid organiser, as J. Crossley is one of those whose pay has been stopped, but the looal parties have decided to retain Crossley*s services at  S.10.0. per week, and for this purpose they are exacting a levy of Id, per week on all members of the different Branches of the Party in lancashire. Ted Brown, organiser for Yorkshire, has been retained as a half-time organiser at  8 per Week.Harry Webb stated subsequently that he &quot;had a terrific struggle at the Lancashire Divisional Counoil meeting over the week-end.   It is obvious that some of the Liverpool delegates had been inspired to ask very awkward questions which I flatly refused to answer, thereby bringing a measure of odium down on myself,wThe Scottish Divisional Conference met in St. Mungo Hall, Govan Street, Glasgow, on June 10th and was attended by 46 delegates representing 41 branohes.

The International Fellowship of Communist Workers organised in the Communist International has not and will not bind itself by any kind of pledge.   We are the deadly enemies of bourgeois society.   Every honorable Communist will by word and deed and, if necessary, with weapon in hand fight against bourgeois society until his last breath. The propaganda of the Communist International will indeed be ,dangerous&apos; for you, master imperialists. The historical task of the Communist International is this:   to be the gravedigger of bourgeois society.   No offence, master imperialistI   So long as you by your existence offend the feelings of every class-conscious worker, so long as your foul breath poisons the whole earth, so long as a handful of billionaires continue to build up their prosperity upon the bones of the working olass, in short, so long as your blessed capitalist scoial order exists - the &quot;dangerous1 propaganda of the Communists will not cease.&quot;Workers of England.    For years you have striven for the recognition of Soviet Russia.   For years your bourgeoisie with the help of the social traitors, Henderson, MacDonald and Co., has thrown sand into your eyes.   Has not the Genoa Conference opened your eyes?&quot;There is evidence that the bolsheviks are again devotingspecial attention to the &quot;red&quot; organisation of seamen whoare considered an important section of the trade union movement. *John Thomas, B.A., one of the miners&apos; agents for the Anthracite Distriot, has sent the following ocmmunioation to Harry Pollitt:&quot;You are probably aware Of the fact that the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation have a resolution on the Agenda of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain Annual Conference to be held at Blaokpool on July 4th and subsequent dates, demanding the withdrawal of the M.F.G.B. from the Seoond or Amsterdam International and demanding its affiliation to the Third or Mosoow International.   All south Wales delegates are pledged to this resolution ao the voting will be solid and safe as far as the South Jlfalea delegates are oonperned,&quot;I have discussed the situation with Communist Party oomrades of mine in the S. Wales Division and what oonoerns us now is that districts like Scotland, Durham,Yorkshire/

Murphy has recently been in London in connection with Red International of Labour Unions] propaganda.&quot;The Worker&quot; announces in its current issue that the National Workers&apos; Committee Movement is merging into the Re International of Labour Unions and that it will therefore in future,, the organ of the latter body.W. McLaine stated at a meeting of the Famine Fund Commit on June 6th that offices in Lincoln&apos;s Inn Fields had been offered to the organisation by arcos and would be accepted i they oould sub-let the present premises in Gray*s Inn Road.COMMUNISTS AMD THE -LABOUR PARTYA lengthy statement by MoManus upon the negotiations between the Communist Party and the Labour Party regarding *- former&apos;s affiliation to the latter appeared in the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot;: aooording to this statement the Labour Party, in a letter dated June 1st, 1922, informed theCommunist/
-    368Communist Party that it had decided to reoommend the forthcomingCongress at Edinburgh to reject the application for affiliation.The remainder of the statement deals with the Labour Party&apos;a questionnaire and the oommunist reply thereto and with the presentCommunist attitude.Special resentment has been aroused among oommunists by thefollowing resolution whioh will be put before the Labour PartytheConference and whioh is stated to be expressly aimed at/Communists:&quot;(a)   Any person nominated to serve as a delegate shall individually aooept the constitution and principles of the Labour Party,&quot;(b)   Ho person shall be eligible as a delegate who is a member of any organisation having for one of its objects the return to Parliament or to any local governing authority of a candidate or candidates other than such as have been endorsed by the Labour Party or have been approved as running in association with the Labour. Party,&quot;The sub-executive oommittee of the Communist Party debated thewhole question on June 2nd end deoided to send a statement of theParty&apos;s case to the executive committees of various unions.Pred Peet voioed his opinion regarding the matter in a communication dated May 31stj- ;&quot;,.,At the last two consultative meetings I have slated the editorial staff for not having anything about the Labour Party as a preparation for our oampaign towards Edinburgh. This week we were promised two articles - no three.   We have got the three.   The whole idea seems to be missed or I am very dense.   Two of them are good articles in their plaoe but to write two slashing attacks on the Labour Party appears to me / to be the height of folly.   It makes one feel like going in .  for gardening.   I don&apos;t know whether there are sinister forces at work behind it all.   Certainly an unofficial oommittee of I the intellectuals is still at it. * What do you think about it? Please let me have your opinion.   If you think it warrants it can you write a letter to the Sub-Executive Committee.   To me it is rank sabotage,   I am writing this morning to the Labour Party for permission for Mao to get into the Conference to answer questions,   I think you should be there also.   I nyaelf wrote a small eoreed of about 900 words on the matter giving the essenoe of Party deoisions but although Itve never asked , for space before we get two arti0les whioh do not refleot the considered judgments of executives and conference.&quot;Harry Webb has given instructions that a oommunist demonstratioiis to be held in Edinburgh during the Labour Party Conference: the prospective speakers are A.

THE YOUHG COMMUU13t &quot;LEAGUEDespite disagreement with former officials, James Stewartis working hard at the organisation of the Young CommunistLeague in this country and has arranged to hold a nationalconference at the Brotherhood Church, Southgate Road, on Augus5th and 6th: the agenda is to be published in the July issueof the &quot;Young Communist&quot; and Stewart is anxious that arepresentative of the Berlin Bureau of the Young Communistinternational should come to London beforehand to confer with&apos;him&apos;.&quot;,.^... &quot;... &apos;. . &quot; *VMoscow has ordered a &quot;Children&apos;s Week&quot; to be held from june 25th to July 2nd: posters are being printed in Germanybut are to have the name and address of an English printeradded on arrival in London: the Executive of the Young CommunieInternational has issued a manifesto regarding the week:; : mpo ygiX&apos; Young &quot;&quot;Communist Leagues J &quot;     -&quot;To all Communist Parties!- ;     &quot;Comrades, -&apos; :&apos;\&quot;The tremendlous importance of the Communist Children&apos;^ Movement for the revolutionary proletariat ;ia becoming ever more apparent.     In nearly all European countries the Young Communist Leagues, have together with the Communist Parties launched the Children&apos;s Movement.&quot;    And there are indications that in other continents too, (in Australia and America for instance) the Children1a Movement has secured a foothold.     The communist Children&apos;sSections Movement has already become an important factor in the Communist Movement as a whole.. &quot;In many countries (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Germany and even Great Britain) the ChildrenTs Sections are compelled to defend themselves against the reaction. (In England a Seditious teachings Bill is t* be introduced in the Parliament, providing severe punishments for offenders against this Act).     The reaction oonsiders the Children&apos;s Sections positions of the Communist Movement and is therefore out to destroy them.     Until now, however . the Children &apos;s Sections -successfully defended themselves against the onslaughts of their enemies and have grown steadily.     The measures of the reaction have even been ,, of service In the T&apos;ork of enlightenment.- The proletarian child; Is nearly wholly at themercy of the bourgeoisie v;hose Schools, permeated.withcapitalist/
capitalist ohauvlniat ideologic, estrange the proletarian children to their class.    lessons In religion are again becoming the order of the day and helping the ekypilets to dominate the proletarian children.&quot;We Communists cannot remain aloof.     The Communist Children1s Movement must be strengthened and perfected-Mere and more proletarian parents must be made to see that the proletarian child is to be a soldier ef our class army.     The Communist Children&apos;s Sections imbue the ohildren with ocmmunist class consciousness;   They train them to fight against the capitalist system, against the national end seotarial Ideology of the bourgeois schools. In order to spread the Communist Children&apos;s Movement and oarry the idea of the necessity for gathering the proletarian! children in Communist Children&apos;8 Sections into the masses and finally, in order to make the ohildren do active work in the service of the international solidarity of the Communist proletariat, the Executive Committee of the Young Communist International decided to arrange from June 26th to July 2nd J the Seoond International Children1a Week.  , m&quot;During this Week the ohildren must everywhere increase their propaganda.   In order to enlighten the parents, meetljfo; are to be called while the ohildren themselves should        Ij oonvcke meetings of their own.   The ohildren must go from I house to house, from flat to flat in order to win for the if; Sections their proletarian mates who are still remaining   I aloof.   Hew Sections should be formed everywhere.   The Communist Parties, and especially the women, should in conjunction with the Young Communist Leagues assist the Communist Children&apos;8 Sections.   A few days of the week have been set aside as 1 later national relief days for Russian children1s homes, for the starving children in Soviet Russia. Luring, these days the children will oarry through collections of school materials, olothing, foodstuffs, money, etc.   The members of the Party and of the League should assist in organising and carrying through these collections.   July 2nd is to. be a day of demonstration of the Communist Children&apos;s Seotions.   On this day the Children&apos;s Sections of all countries ^will march up in closed ranks and bear witness of their strength and their determination.n..,The International children&apos;s Week is to be held under the following slogans:&quot;Struggle against expenditure for militarism at theexpense of the education of the ohildren of     U___the working classJ&quot;Struggle against Jingoism!&quot;Struggle against seotarian lessons in the sohoolsj&quot;Struggle against the capitalist child murders!&quot;Struggle for free education!belief for our Russian brothers!&quot;Roll up for the Int. Children^ Week!&quot;Long live the Communist Children&apos;s Movement! &quot;Long live the Cc^nunist Movement!Moscow, May, 1922.    *        The Executive Committee of the YoungCommunist.

Stewart has complained to Berlin that &quot;despite the     ) fact that you say the Theses are published at this address&quot; only a few copies have been received, and has asked for 1,000 more:   these have been promised and the West of Scotland General District Council of the League has meanwhile drawn up a Scheme of organisation based upon the Theses (quoted in Report 157).The June subsidy of  100 has been sent from Berlin and on May 26th James Stewart, informed, the Berlin. Bur that he proposed to use  50 of the first monthly subsidy for the pamphlet fund,  4 per week for organisers&apos; wages and to set the remainder aside to turn the &quot;Young Communist&quot; into a weekly.

-18370&quot;When conscription is adopted, as the Capitalist claaa will assuredly adopt it when occasion arises, the Young Communist League of Great Britain repudiates the individual evasion of military service, as well as desertion as a means of oombating the military machine of our masters.&quot;The work of the Young Communist who is a soldier or navyman is to form within the army and navy, soldiers and sailors oiroles, and later, councils, for the purpose of laying &quot;before their oomrades, in arms the position of the Revolutionary Working Class.&quot;We desire to point out that any action for the f information-tion ofcouncils in the army ornavy is only advisable   [ whenthe whole situation is really revolutionary.&quot;The work of the oirole in-the army and navy is educational, keeping the rank and file of the army and navy in touch with; all the happenings in the labour movement.&quot;!The Executive of the Young Communist International has informed national executives that.it proposes to levy international dues amounting to zq$ of monthly subscriptions.Various Government publicationsj suoh as the Report on the Cost of Living and the quarterly List of Parliamentary Publications have been sent to the Berlin Bureau, also literature concerning the Boy Scouts and the Jewish Lads Brigade.   Stewart is acting as intermediary for the Berlin Bureau with the Irish Communist Party and with the Young Communist movement in Australia.Quantities of Young Communist literature continue to be sent to this country from Berlin.ARRESTS AND CONVICTIONS       ^ &apos; .-^&quot;.Lr   -On June 1st, at the Mansion House, Councillor George Wheeler, to whose case reference was made in Report 158, was ordered to find surety of  50 to keep the peace for 12 months, on the oharge of drunkenness and sentenced to two months&apos; hard labour on the same charge.\ Chief Constable of Sheffield informs me that PeterHannon has been oommittea for tricl at the next Assizes. jf Resulting/
Resulting from the unemployed disturbance on June 7th it is reported that 13 men have been charged at Sheffield Polic$l Court with having Assembled riotously to disturb the peace: amongst them are Councillor A.E.Butcher, Councillor Albert :    Smith, Alfred Haxdock, George Melia, William Riley, William Godwin, Charles J.Barker, Lev/is Alfred fiewall and Horsfield,TEE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot; AND 3HS CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT- &apos; The recent conference of the co-operative movement at -  Brighton decided that every effort should be made to prepare the way for a daily oo-operative paper but rejected the motio advocating collaboration withthe Labour Party and the Trade union Congress in running a daily paper:   the &quot;Daily He ra;ld&quot; does not hide its disappointment at this decision which it -states &quot;will rejoice the soul of every reactionary in the lamIRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT britain as a result of the Collins - de Valera pact an   attempt is being made by the Sinn Pein leaders in thiB country to heal] the split between Pree Staters and Republicans, but, so far, very little success has attended their efforts.     The one section is content to await the result of the elections before attempting any forward movement while the other - the extreme element - is mainly occupied in getting together as much war material as possible.     There seems to be a greater demand . than ever for arms, ammunition and especially detonators.Arms agents are again busy in the mining districts and the recent robberies from Colliery Magazines in the St.Helens Distriot of Lancashire can be laid to,their charge.   Detona-tors formed the bulk of the goods stolen.   The robberies are believed to have been carried out by imported Irish Republican Army Irregulars, assisted by men familiar with the locality.
- u *A very large number of Irishmen, mostly young men who hare not been in this oountry long, are working in the mines.   At all the magazines entered considerable force must have been -used to gain access, and there is reason to believe the per-petratore were armed.In some of the magazines entered the colliery managers had taken the precaution of storing their detonators in a secret place, and the raiders went away empty handed.
