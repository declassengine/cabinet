THIS DOCUMENT IS TH3 PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT. &apos;J CABINET.THE   WAGES &apos; POSITION.- ^Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. \Secret     .      &quot;&quot;&apos; &quot; -----U7F. 4001.On the 5th October, 1921, I circulated a Memorandum (C.U.260) on the cost of production and the wages position at that time.     The 1 peak&apos; of the wages had been reached at the beginning of 1921, and during that year there had been a steady reduction of wages in sympathy with the fall in the index figure of the cost of living. The average increase in the weekly full time wages of adult work-people at the &apos;peak&apos; may be estimated to have been about 170$ to 180$ above pre-war, and the cost of living figure reached  176$.Since October 1921, the fall in wages and in the cost of living has continued.    There are about 3j: million workpeople in theUnited Kingdom covered by agreements under which wages vary automatic-ally on a sliding scale related to the cost of living, but in addition the majority of wage increases obtained during the war and subsequently were affected by the increase in the cost of living, and, in general, the increase in wages corresponded with the increase in the cost of living.    The severe trade depression, which has weighed more hardly on some trades than upon others, has to a considerable extent broken the reaction of the movement in the cost of living upon wage reductions, and trades are reverting more closely to wages based upon the economic position of the industry.    The result is that the general uniformity of wage increases is disappearing, and the position as between differ-ent classes of workers shows a wide divergence.    Thus, in coal mining and in the iron and steel industries in certain districts, wages at the&quot; beginning of May were equivalent to not more than 20% on pre-war rates.    There are distinct signs that the coal trade is. recovering its markets.    Similarly, in the Iron and steel trades, where wages are based on selling prices, the employers found themselves compelled to/ cut&apos;
cut prices drastically to deal with foreign competition and to stimulate v ome demand.In the shipbuilding industry a reduction of 16/6 per week in three instalments, of which the first 13/6 is already off, has been accepted.     The employers hope that this reduction, together with the counter-balancing increase of effort which they expect from their workpeople, will result in more orders for ships, but they have inti-mated. that it may be necessary to press for the withdrawal of the remaining 10/- of the war increases.The Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federations have inti-mated that after the present dispute with regard to managerial functions is at an end the industry will have to adjust its wages in order to get its cost of production on to an economic basis.    In certain sections of the engineering trade, particularly the light engineering section in the Midland area, a cut in wages of 16/- per week in three instal-ments terminating in July is being put into   effect.    These reductions will bring the percentage increase in the case of certain classes of workers in these trades somewhat below, the estimated percentage increase in the cost of living figure.Apart from the engineering dispute there is at the moment only one big wages Issue imminent, in the Printing Trade, but it is antici-pated that there are reasonable chances of a settlement without a stopnage of work.The main outstanding difficulty is the position of rail?/ay wages.       The trading interests throughout the country have been pressing for a reduction in freight rates and. the Companies have now decided to meet this demand.     In the statement issued by the Com-panies they have clearly indicated their intention of proposing a con-Ifsiderablc reduction of wages.      The agreement for the railway service provides for a fall-back wage approximately 100% above pre-war rates for- many grades, and it is clear that some of the companies at least/will
will desire before the end of the year to alter the basis of that agreement.    So far as indications can bo judged at the moment, it doos not appear probable that this question will become acute until after the summer holiday traffic has been carried at oxisting rates. An automatic reduction, subject to the fall-back, will come into opera tion on 1st July, under the sliding scale agreement, and the railway companies may be content with this for the summer, but undoubtedly negotiations of great difficulty will have to take place on the sub-ject of railway wages generally.One satisfactory tendency in wage agreements at the moment&apos; is the provision for a much longer duration of the agreement than has been customary during the last three years. For example, the Cotton Trade agreement fixes wages for at least a year, and the proposed agreement in the Priiiting Trade determines the course of wages until December 1923. This tendency is a reversion to the pre-war practice and will have a helpful effect in securing stability.Further re-adjustments of wagos must be- made by each trade for itself, for it would be impossible for the Government under present circumstances to adopt any other policy than, that of leaving the matter to be settled by the employers and workpeople.   On the whole, the joint machinery is working well.    It is noteworthy that in indus-tries where there are Joint Industrial Councils there has been no stoppage of national importance during the last two years,A tab\ilar statement is attached which shows for the variouschief industries of the country the pre-war rate of wages, the rate at January 1921, when wages were at their highest; and the current rate, and also the percentage increase over pre-war rates at thevarious stages.    This statement shows that, whereas in January 1921, wages were from about 170 to 180 per cent above the pre-war level, they have since fallen to about 90 per cent above pre-war.    This represents a fall in wages of about one-third since January, 1921.    So considerable a reduction in wages should enable costs of production to be lowered to a point that will assist in the general recovery of trad. ^        n ^ , (Sgd)    T.J.MacnamaracMinistry of Labour.27 ^ 90
WAGES AT JULY, 1914, JANUARY, 1921, AND MAY, 1922,In order to illustrate the relative level of wages in the irincipal industries at July,1914, January, 1921, when wages gener-:lly reached a maximum, and the present date, the attached Tables ave been compiled from such information as is available.Table &quot;A&quot; shows the level of weekly full-time rates of wages, t July, 1914, January, 1921, and May, 1922, and the percentage ncrease at the two latter dates, for time-workers in certain large industries.    The details given are based on the recognised time ates of wages of representative classes of workmen, either in-.the ountry generally, or in important centres.    It should be remembered, n considering this Table that there have been reductions in working ours since 1914, and. that the figures relate to the wages  for a. all ordinary week at the respective dates;
