S LOGjmm IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENTSECRET. CP. 4095.CABINET. UNITED STATES SHIP SUBSIDY BILL. Note by the President of the Board of Trade.In accordance with the request of the Cabinet at their meeting on June 30th, I circulate for the information of my colleagues a further note regarding the approximate number of British ships calling&quot; at United States ports and of United States ships calling at ports in the British Empire, and also an estimate of the reciprocal damage which would be inflicted on British- and American shipping respectively by the adoption of a policy of retaliation.(Initialled)       S. B.10th July, 1922.
I Tonnage (Entrances..iMployment jof American [Tonnage.UNITED STATES SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.The latest available figures as to the entrances of American ships into British ports and of British ships into American ports, are those for 1920 and they are approximately as followsBritish Vessels in U.S.A.

The present activities of American tonnage as recorded by Lloyds, is as follows :-Gross Tonnage. * ^age .To and from UnitedKingdom............  562,000To and from other british Empire. , . .Ports............. 317,000 879,000 15To and from European ports (other than United Kingdom). 1,456,000 25In the coasting trade of America or in services to south America............... 2,803,000 47In trade between United States and PhilippineIslands and Far East........     _754,000 _135,892,000 100Of this tonnage.,  it is estimated that 250,000 is engaged solely in the trade between United States and Philippine Islands.
From these it will be seen:-(1)    that about 48$ of the American tonnage in service is employed in foreign trades.(ii)   (abouj/lhal? 15^ of the American tonnage in service is en route to or from British ports.(ili)    that the net tonnage entrance of Americanships into British ports is almost as great as the net tonnage entranoe of British ships into American ports - in spite of the fact that the total American tonnage engaged in these services is very much smaller then the British tonnage engaged in them.employment of 3.     It is almost impossible without a verytish exhaustive examination, to give more than the followingpage. rough, indication as to the employment of the Britishtonnage :-Employment in Inter-Imperial trades 25$&quot; &quot; Trades between the. Empire and foreigncountries 45$&quot; &quot; Trades between foreigncountries 30$4.     These three sets of figures, which are the best that could be prepared at short notice, give a pretty fair picture, of the present position.   In order to make any estimate of the amount of damage likely to be caused by retaliation we must get a clear idea of what retaliation will mean.   At present Italy has reserved to national ships the whole of her outward emigrant trade, and the United States proposes to reserve to her national ships at least one-half of the incoming emigrant traffic, so that there are already precedents for reserving to national ships the whole t or part of the incoming or outgoing emigrant trade. Proposals have, in the past, been made in the United States to reserve part of the outgoing cargo trade to national ships, and the possibility that has to be contemplated is that the various maritime States may try to reserve to their national ships the whole or part of the incoming and/or outgoing trade, both in goods and passengers.    This looks like a nightmare, but there can be little doubt that if the process is once started by Italy and the United States, it must of necessity extend to other maritime countries who will be forced to defend themselves.5.     If we assume that the British Empire and ather leading maritime countries are drawn into this struggle by degrees, can we form any idea as to the probable results, firstly, to ourselves, and, secondly, to America?6.     These can from the nature of the case, only be very conjectural, but If reference is made to the figures in paragraph 3 indicating the employment of British tonnage, it will be seen that the inter-Imperial trades absorb 25% of our tonnage.     If we passed special laws we could keep that trade, but we should certainly lose a considerable proportion of the trade between the Empire and foreign countries, and we should lose
practically the whole of the trade betwoen foreign countries.    In very round figures we should stand to lose about half of our&apos; present trade.    Our occupation as carriers would be gone.7.   The effect on America would not be so striking as they have not at present got such of the carrying trade between foreign countries, but if the worst came to the worst the only trades they could be certain of keeping would be trades between American ports and some part of the trades between American and foreign ports.   It is very difficult on the figures to conjecture what the loss would be, but it would probably beat least one-third of her present trade, and it will be remembered that a very large proportion of her ships are laid up.S.   The prospect of such a loss \vould make it impossible for America to realise one of the main objects of the Shipping Subsidy Bill which is to dispose of the Government-owned ships to American owners, as Americans will not be tempted to buy ships if they see that their shipping trade is to be hampered and restricted all round.   This in turn will delay if not prevent the building up of a 3trong American Mercantile Marine which is the other main object of the Shipping Subsidy Bill.9.   The consequence of a policy of retaliation would be disastrous to all concerned in it, but what is the alternative?   If America persists in the policy of confining national trade to national ships, other countries will certainly follow suit, and our Mercantile Marine must diminish by leaps and bounds until in the end we reach the some position as we would have reached if there had been general retaliation.10.   The question is whether the Americans can be made to realise what must be the inevitable consequences of this policy before they are too deeply committed to it, and &quot;whether they would withdraw from it if they realised that we must be forced to resort to retaliation in concert with the Dominions and with other maritime States.
