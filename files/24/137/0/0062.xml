111 P I  &apos;/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIHIC MAJESTY1 8 GOTORHMBHT,C A B I H E T.OV3RSEA   SETTLEMENT.2:isT Memorandum by the Minister^oflabour 0The Empire Settlement Act 1922 (which enables the Secretary of State for the Colonies to assist agreed schemes for development or land settlement, or schemes for facilitating settlement in or migration to Overseas Dominions by assistance with initial allowances, training or otherwise) is now in force and I should like to call attention to the need which, in my view, exists to do something forthwith to relieve the unemploy-ment situation here, particularly so far as regards ex-Service men.I appreciate that our normal overseas policy has been, and is, to go slow, and to make quite sure that nothing is done or said that would make the Dominions think that we were seeking to make unfair use of them or that we were trying to foist upon them a burden which can and ought to bs borne by the Home Country.But we are faced with an exceptional position and an emorgoncy which in my view warrants a departure (for the time being) from the ordinary emigration policy.At present cur &quot;balance outwards&quot; is far less than it was before the war, and it was much lower in 1921 than in 1920;    this, notwithstanding the fact that in this country the ordinary growth of population is such that every year there is added to the competitors in industry a net surplus of something not much under 200,000.It must be remerabored that bofore the war there was roughly an average of 200,000 or 400,000 persons unemployed in Great Britain.     Today there are certainly 500,000 more persons
*classified as operatives in Sreat Britain than before the ware     We have to contemplate, therefore, carrying the burden of a very large number of persons unemployed even in good times.We have today nearly ls500,OCO persons unemployed, and of these something like 300*000 are young, single, fit men (many of them ex-Service men) between the ages of 80 and 30.     Most of them are unskilled.    They joined the Army before they had settled down to any particular career;    their Army service cannot be said to have fitted them for steady employment.    After leaving the Army they act a time of g3:avo unemployment and many of them have been unemployed for periods up to two years.     The prospects of their absorption into industry are very slight.    If they aro allowed to drift, this body of potentially good citizens will degenerate and will bocome a burden upon the country,  either by trying to subadst upon the Unemployment Insurance scheme or upon the Poor Law. But they are not normally the type of &quot;corner boy&quot; with which we were familiar before the war.      It is simply that for the time being the faculty of work has not been developed in them. There is a first class chance to enable them to make good, but we must take it quickly.In my vie?; we should make a frank appeal to the Dominions to help.     How that appeal i3 to be made is, of course, a question for very careful consideratIon*     Clearly the Dominions must have it first explained that when we talk abou.t our &quot;unemployed&quot; we do not mean our &quot;unemployables&quot;; if it is stated, as I have Indicated above, how It is that these young men are in the position in which they find themselves today, we shall remove the idea that we are simply trying to get rid of the unemployable.
The men can he soleotod through the Employment Exchanges (the officers of which have a record of each man and can accurately make the selection) in association with the Dominions representatives.       In so far a3 tho Dominions still take the view that men with some knowledge of agriculture, or some inclination towards agriculture, are still the best type of emigrant, it would bo worth while, in my opinion, to arrange, in conjunction with the Dominions representatives, not only for the selection of men with these qualifications in mind, but also for a preliminary intensive train ing JLn agr ioultur e ^In so far as agricultural training is to be given in this country, the establishment of new training centres would probably be very costly;   but there are one or two existing places which could no doubt be taken over, and I understand that the Army have two training farms which could possibly be utilised.On the question of cost, we have undertaken to provide  1,500,000 during this financial year and up to  3,000,000 next year.     To spend money upon a scheme of this kind, even though it might seem to be relatively costly at the moment, will in the long run be a real economy.I ask consideration of this question at once and suggest that the Cabinet should definitely instruct the Secretary of State for the Colonies to take an active initiative in formulating and fixing up schemes with the Dominions instead of waiting for the initiative to be taken by them.     Otherwise 1 fear that many months may pass before wo have enough schemes settled to start a really strong flow of population from here,     Whether that can best bo done by inviting an iramediate conference with the Dominion
representatives, formally asking their co-operation in an acceleration of the programme, or by deputing some responsible representative to visit the Dominions with tha same object In view, is a matter which I suggest should also be considered. And at tha same time, if agricultural experience is essential to the success on a large scale of schemes under the Empire Settlement Act, I would ask for authority to be given tc organise schemes for intensive preliminary training or testing without delay.[Sgd)    T.
