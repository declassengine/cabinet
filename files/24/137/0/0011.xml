(Thlo^docTaoerrt is-the.property of His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government.)T.CABINET.HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE.3LEGITIMATION bill memorandum by the Home Secretary.At the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on the 4th April it was decided that the Government must make itself responsible for this Bill and that, in consultation with the Law Officers, I should have an amended draft prepared for the consideration of the Committee.   I have conferred with the Law Officers on the matter and a revised draft is circulated herewith.In accordance with the provisional decision of the Committee at their last meeting, there has been inserted in the draft proviso (a) to sub-clause (l) which limits legitimation to cases in which the parents were free to marry at the date of the ohild&apos;s birth. I would, however, ask the Committee to reconsider this proviso. It appears to me that the insertion of this limitation is not likely to lessen any opposition there may be to the Bill, but will on the other hand be strongly objected to by the advocates of the Bill.     The effect of the proviso is to cut out from the Bill a large number of the very cases which the Bill is designed to bene-fit, viz., the cases where a marriage i-b broken up owing to one of the partners deserting the other or becoming insane and the man or woman who is left alone contracts an irregular union, has children and subsequently on the death of the absent spouse marries the father or mother of the children.     Such cases are common, the hardship is recognised, and I can see no good reason why the children should be denied legitimation because ut the time of their birth the parents were no t free to raarry\The only argument that it appears possible to advance in favour of proviso (a) is that it brings the law of England into harmony with the law of Scotland, but this is not a sufficient
answer to&apos;those who are strongly impressed by the wrong done to the children in such oases.It has been suggested to me that the insertion of such a proviso might lessen opposition to the Bill on the part of those who take a strongly ecclesiastical view and feel that legitimation is open to objection as implying a condonation of sin.     But it is difficult to draw any marked distinction between the sin of adulterous unions In such cases as I have mentioned above and the sin of other unlawful unions, and I doubt if there are many Members who would desire to withhold legit-imation  from the children of such adulterous unions while granting it to the children of other unlawful unions.It.must be remembered that proposals for legitimation have been before Parliament in 1920 and again in 1921.     On neither occasion was there any serious opposition to the principle of legitimation by sub-sequent marriage nor was any proposal made to limit legitimation to cases in which the parents are free to marry.My own feeling is that as proviso (a) will &quot;be strongly opposed and very likely rejected in Committee or on Report, and as it will Toe difficult to give good reasons for its insertion, it is better not to insert it in the BilliIf it is agreed to allow legitimation in oases wher^e the parents were not free to marry at the time of the child&apos;s birth, suoh a child should of course rank for succession purposes as junior to children born in lawful wedlock.Paragraph (b) of Clause 2 already provides that if a man has an illegitimate child by A born before his marriage to B and if on the death of B he marries his old mistress A, the child thus legitimated shall rank as junior to any children born of B in lawful wedlock:    and if proviso  (a) of Clause 1 is omitted, paragraph (b) of Clause 2 should be extended so as to provide that if a man while married to A has both a legitimate family by A and illegitimate children by B and if on the death of   A he marries B, the children of B bo legitimated should rank as junior to the children of A bora in lawful wedlock.EcS.2nd June, 19 22.
