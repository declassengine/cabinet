of Stato to inform you that the not military expenditure of thoV Government of India in 1921-2 was estimated in the budget of that year at six hundred and twenty two million rupees (Es-622,000,000) and owing mainly to abnormal frontier expenditure, the actual outlay,so far as is at present known, amounted to six hundred and fiftymillion, one hundred thousand rupees (Ks.650,100,000).     The Budgetestimate for the current year (1922-23) is six hundred and twenty. one million,  eight hundred thousand rupees (Hs.621,800j000) andthe Government of India are independently considering the possibilityfof effecting reductions in their expenditure generally, Including the military grants.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd) W. DUES.o-   &amp;   -
Sir,I have the ho.nour to communicate to you herewith information regarding the military expenditure of the Republic of Colombia for the use of the Temporary Mixed Commission for the Reduction Of Arm ace nts.The national budget for the year 1921, approved by the National Congress, provided the sum of 4 *S90 .915,28 pesos-or, which at the present rate of exchange represents approximately 1.000.000 pounds sterling for the expenditure of the 1&apos;inistry for war which also includes the Kaval department.This year, 1922, the national budget approved by the Chambers provides under the same chapters the sum of 3-315*435,28 Colombian pe,sos-or.The military expenditure of Colombia has therefore been reduced in the course of one year by approximately 1.000.000 pesos-or, that is to say, by more than 200.000 pounds sterling.The total of the budget estimates adopted by the Colombian Congress for 1he year 192 2 amounts to 23 .-.620 ..500 po.?os-or?     The sums quoted above therefore constitute scarcely more than 10$ of the liat ional rev en ue s *I hare  the honour etc *(Signeoi) i&apos;rancisco Jose UrrutiaJune 21st, 1922.Government
Translation. 3/15643 X/11295 .       Ill,PRAGUE,    June 13 th, 1922.In reply to your letter of January 3rd, 1922, (C.L.3)the receipt of which the Ministry for foreign Affairs acknowledged in a letter addressed to you on January 6th, I have the ho nous to give you the following information.The military expenditure of the czecho-Slovak Republic amounted in 1219 to 20.20$, in 1920 to 15.47^ and in 1921 to 14.20 of the State budget end it constitutes 15.69 of the total expenditure in 1922.     It is true that the total expenditure of the State has increased so that the percent ntsges mentioned above represent a rise in expenditure, but this rise, as well as the increase in the percentage of the 1922 expenses as compared with the percentages in 1921, ia solely due to the rise in prices. The oost of articles of equipment and armanents is at present three or four times higher -than in 1919.     If it were not for this feet, the figures would show a considerable reduction in actual expenditure.     The military budget is therefore well on the way towards the goal aimed at in the recommendation which was voted at the 2nd Session of the Assembly of the league &quot;of Nations, that is to say, it is becoming fixed at an amount iepreser?ting the minimum requirements.     It should be realised that the czecho-olovak Republic, at the beginning of its existence, was not in possession of anything which it could have used for the organisation of national defence.When/
VJhen the moment arrives at which current expenditure alone has to be faceda the military budget will be considerably reduced, for from 1923 onwards conscripts will only have to serve for 18 months instead of for two years as at present, and from 1926 onwards only for 14 months, so &quot;that the peace strength will be reduced to  &quot;three quarters- and finally to little more than one half of the present strength.     In consequence the expenditure on pay, food, equipments, eto., will be considerably reduced.I have the honour to be, Sir, etc.fSigned)     Dr. B.
