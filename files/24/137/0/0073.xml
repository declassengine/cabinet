MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR.Following upon the discussion at the Cabinet held on 10th May (Cabinet 26 (22) 3), the Home Affairs Committee, with the assistance of a  ub-Commit.tee appointed for the purpose, has had under consideration the question of the preparation of a Trade Boards Bill. The Home Affairs Committee have now decided, on the recommendation of the Sub-Committee, not to proceed for the moment with the question of the form which a Bill should take, but to agree that the immediate action to be taken is the issue of a statement of policy, as a Command paper, carrying into effect, as soon as may be, such recommendations of the Cave Committee^as are agreed by us and as are administratively possible trader the existing legislation.      This course was decided upon in view of the impossibility of securing in the short Parliamentary time now available the passage of so important a measure.I append hereto the proposed statement of policy, as finally agreed by the Home Affairs Committee, for issue as described above.With regard to the Bill, it is proposed that the Home Affairs Committee should proceed with the examina-tion of the form whioh it should take.It was also decided by the Trade Boards Sub-Committee of the Home affairs Committee to inform the Cabinet that two of the provisions of the Bill would in all probability bo as follows:-
(1) The existing provisions for the removalof a trade from the Trade Boards ^icts would he re-enacted hut modified in the sense suggested by the Cave Committee, namely, &quot;by the new definition suggested by that Committee of the conditions which would enable the Minister either to include or exclude a trade from the Acts.(2) There is at present no power to suspend the operations of the Acts in the oase of any particular industry to whioh they have already been applied, if such a course were deemed expedient-     It would be proposed to adopt this recommendation in the Bill,,I ask for the early approval of the Cabinet to the Issue of the attached statement of polioy as a Command Paper,     Contingent action, whioh can with difficulty be delayed further, is. required from the Ministry of labour in a number of directions.toga.)

SUGGESTED STATEMENT FOR ISSUL BINDING THE IETRO-DUOTIQN OF;, TR-h.DE BOARDS BILLC Revised Draft circulated Toy the Minister of Labour.(1)   H9M. Government have given oareful consideration to the recommendations of the Committee appointed under the Chairman-chip of Lord Gave to enquire into the Trade Board system,,     As was stated by the Minister of labour in the House of Commons on 10th May, it is the intention of the Government, if time permits, to introduce a Bill during the present Session dealing with these recommendations.     It is realised, however, that if the Bill is to do justice to all the interests concerned in the direction of sectoring greater elasticity, and to deal in a comprehensive manner with the many points raised hy the Cave Committee, its consideration is a matter calling for the expenditure of considerable time and labour.     The Minister of labour is fully aware of the serious administrative difficulties occasioned by the provisions of the existing ..cts, to which attention has been called by the Cave Committee, and proposes to remedy these forthwith in so far as this oan be dene within the limits of the existing statutes. (2)   The main recommendations of the Cave Committee relate to the following five points:-(1)   Establishment and revision of Trade Boards, (2)   Expediting of Machinery. (3)   District Committees and District Boards. (4)    Fixing and confirmation of rates. (5)   Miscellaneous,
The extent to which these recommendations can, and will, he put into operation by administration are indicated below.(1) Establishment and Re-vision of Trade Boards. The Gave Committee,s recommendations on the question of the establishment of the Boards are as follows:-(1) That the power of the Minister of Labour to apply the Acts to a trade be confined to cases where he is satisfied -(a) that the rate of wages prevailing in the trade or any branch of the trade is unduly low as compared with those in other employments; and(b) that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages throughout the trade.(2) That in any case in which the Minister considers that a prima facie case exists for applying the Acts to any trade,he shall cause a public enquiry to be held into the matterand shall have regard to the report of such enquiry.In accordance with this recommendation it has been decidedthat no Trade Board will be set up unless these conditions aresatisfied and then only after a public enquiry.    The interpreta-tion of the words &quot;unduly low&quot; as compared with those in.,other employments will be a matter for determination by the Ministerof Labour in accordance with the facts of each case upon theReport ox the person appointed by the Minister of Labour tohold an enquiry.In the caso of a number of existing Boards difficult questions of scope, i.e., jurisdiction of the Boards, requireto be adjusted either bstweon trades already under the Acts or between trades under the Acts and others on the borderline.These cases have caused difficulty and friction.    It is proposedaccordingly to proceed with revision in suitable cases.   Where,however, revision entails the application of the Acts to new
trades, it will only &quot;be carried through after a public enquiry.(2) Expsditin^ of Machinery. It Is recommended by the Care Committee that (a) the period for lodging objections against varied rates should be reduced;  (b) that the period taken by the Minister for oonfirm-Ing should be reduced; (e) the provision by which no rate can be varied without the Minister&apos;s consent within six months shall be cancelled;  (d) the notices of objection shall date not from the receipt of the notice by the firms concerned but from the date of the publication of the notice in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;; and (a) the Boards shall have power to revise rates within reasonable limits at the fixing stage without re-advertise-men t.Two of these recommendations cannot be carried out without amendment of the statute, i.e., the period for lodging objections is definitely fixed, and the requirement to re-advertise at the fixing stage if rates are substantially altered is equally part of the statute.Apart from these two points, however, the following stepsto expedite procedure have been already taken or will be immediately taicen -fa) The Minister cf labour will consult with the Trade Boards between the proposing and fixing stages so that he may in every case be able to transmit his decision within fourteen days of the receipt of the rates.(b) A regulation will be made dating the period of objection from the publication of the notice instead of from the date of its issue tc the trade,With regard to (c) the Act of 1918 provides that the Minister nay give his consent to the issue cf new proposals within the period of 6 months, if ho Is satisfied that special circumstanoes exist.   During the period following the passing
of that Act wages owing to alterations in -the cost of living have fluctuated so rapidly &quot;both up and down that in every case the Minister has been able to give his consent. As long as conditions remain inconstant it is probable that &quot;special circumstances&quot; enabling the Minister to give his consent will continue to exist.(3) District Committees and District Boards.The Cave Committee recommend in Paragraphs 8, 9 and 11 that in the manufacturing and productive trades the Minister shall have power to set up District Committees and in the distributive and retail making up trades and allied trades the Minister shall ba authorised to set up District Boards.So far as the first recommendation is concerned, the present powers conferred on the Minister of labour under the oxisting Acts are limited to setting up District Committees upon the request of the Central Board for the trade in question. This power cannot be altered administratively but the Minister of labour will draw the special attention of all the Trade Boards concerned to this conclusion with a recommendation that its application to their trade shall be seriously considered.With regard to the District Boards, power to set up such Boards already exists under the present Act.   The Minister of labour will, if satisfactory arrangements cannot be made on a District Committee basis, consider whether it is.desirable to set up District Boards in the appropriate tradeb already coverad by the Acts.
(4) Fixing and Confirmation of Rates.The grounds upon which tho Cavo Committee make their recommendations with regard to the fixing and enforcement ofrates are set out in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the Report whichread as follows :-&quot;53. The issue so raised appears to us to be of vital importance to tho future of British industry: and we do not think it can be determined except upon a consideration of the principles upon which the Trade Board system rests and by which its existence is to be justified.     Is it the intention of Parliament that the coercive powers of the State should b^ used to prevent the oppression of the worker by forcing hiir. to work at wages below the levo7* of subsistence and under conditions injurious to hie health; or Is it desired that they should be&apos; applied (through tho medium of the Trade Boards) to the general regulation of wages9     In other words, is the intention of the Act of 1909, which we helievo to have been directed to the prevention of &quot;sweating&quot;, to prevail;  or is effect to be given to the interpretation widely put upon the Act of 1918, namely, that It is to b* used as an instrument for the pubiic regulation of wages throughout the induetries concerned?     In our opinion, the former is the correct follow.r&quot;54. It appears to us that, while, the coercivepowers of the State, and particularly the criminal iaw, may properly be used to provent the unfair oppression of individuals and the injury to the national health that results from the &quot;sweating&quot; of workers, the use of those coercive powers should he limited to that purpose &quot;and that any further regulation of wages should be left, so far as possible,  to the processes of negotiation and collective bargaining.     It is one thing to say that an employer shall not pay to his adult worker a sup insufficient for his or her maintenance under the conditions of the time, be the sum 35s., 40s., or 50s., per week; it is quite another thing to provAde that he shall not pay to a skilled worker of a particular class less than 70s., 80s., or 90s., ovon though the worker is prepared to work at a lower wage, and that if he does so he shall be liable to fine or imprisonment.     It may he desirable that the higher wage should he paid, and it may not be unreasonable for a trade organisation to insist on that wage being paid and to enforce its decision by economic means; but to compel the payment by the threat of criminal prosecution appears to us to be an oppressive use of the powors of the State.&quot;
The aotual recommendations of the Caye Committee resultingrcra these considerations are as follows:-(3)    That it he the duty of a Trade Board to fix -fa)    a general minimum time-rate for thegeneral body of workers in the trade, such rate to be fixed with reference to the lowest grade of ordinary workers in the trade;and that a Trade Board be authorised to fix -(b)    if so authorised by Order of the Minister of Labour, a special minimum time-rate for workers performing work ancillary to that performed by the general body of workers;Co)    a piece-work basis time-rate;(d) a guaranteed time-rate for* piece workers;(e) minimum piece-rates for out- or home-workers engaged in piece-work in the trade;(f) overtime rates based upon the above rates;and that suoh rates when confirmed be enforceable in manner now provided by the Trade Boards i.ote,(4)    That a Trade Board have power to fix -(a) special minimum time-rates and piece-work basis time-rates for special classes of work in the trade or workers engaged in any special process;(b) minimum piece-rates for in-workers;(c) special minimum piece-ratea for in-workers to be fixed on the application of an individual employer to apply in respeot of workers employed by him;(d&apos;)   over time rates based upon the above rates;and to apply for confirmation of suoh rates, and that suoh rates if confirmed be recoverable by civil proceedings only,(5)   -That any question -arising under the last preceding recommendation be determined by agreement between the members representing employers and the members representing workers, and that for this purpose the assent of not less than three-fourths of the members of either side present ^nd voting on the question (not less than one-half of the members on the side being present) do bind the side.Under the existing lets the body of rates thus dividedinto two classes by the Cave Committee are criminally
enforceable and can be fixed fcy a bare &quot;majority.The position recommended )iy tho Cave Committee cannot be reaehed without alteration of the existing statutes. The Minister of Labour, however, in confirming rates will bear the recommendations of the? Cavs Committee in this respect in mind and would hope that rates other than general minimum time-rates would be commonly fixed by the Trade Boards by agreement of the two sid^a.     It must not be understood by this that the Minister will necessarily con-firm in every case whsre such agreement has been reached nor that he will necessarily withhold confirmation in every case where it has not been reached.     But it is desired that Trade Boards in fixing rates shall have this recommenda-tion of the Gave Committee in *nind.(5) Miscellaneous.. .ThesR are the principal recommendations of the Gave Committee.     There are, in addition, a certain number of other recommendations of considerable, though less, importance, all of which would require statutory amendment. No action, therefore, can be taken upon these recommendations pending legislation.Finally, attention is called to certain points ofadministration with regard to the relations between theTrade Boards and the Minister of Labour which have beenthe regular Departmental practice for so^e time and whichwill continue to be the practice of the Department -(1) There should be a regular practice of earlyconsultation between the Department and the Trade Boards as to the form in which the determinations of the Boards are to be expressed.(8) The Trade Boards should have facilities for obtaining at any stage legal advice on questions relevant to thoir work, arid should have an opportunity of expressing their views themselves to the Minister&apos;e legal adviser.
while tho Minister is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of the Acts and, subject to the Courts, for the interpretation of scope, arrangements should be made to ensure the closest co-operation between the Depart-ment and the Trade Boards in tho carrying out of these duties.
