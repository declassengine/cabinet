[C 55S8/5588/18] No. 1.Lord D&apos;Abernon to the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. (Received April 18.) (No. 304.)My Lord, Berlin, April 12, 1922.NUMEROUS maps have been drawn to show the geographical conditions which govern the frontier problem between Germany and France. I have not, however, seen any map which appeared to give the essential features as clearly as the enclosed sketches,* which have been prepared by Lieutenant Hume. It may be that this presentment will tell strategical experts only what they already know, but more humble individuals may, with these sketches before them, grasp the position more clearly than, before. The dominating importance, from a strategical standpoint, of certain tracts of impassable country which lie on both sides of the Rhine, is not generally realised, and cannot be easily gathered from the maps usually published.On the left bank of the Rhine, the Aixlennes and Vosges block nearly three-fourths of the frontier where the French and German frontiers are either close or march together. Obstacles prevent any large advance, except along three clearly-defined lines, one of which is extremely cramped.Similar conditions on the right, bank confine a possible advance into Germany to three lines corresponding to those on the French side. The Siegerwald, Westerwald and Taunus correspond to and are geographically opposite the Ardennes and Hunsruck ; the Black Forest lies opposite the Vosges. An aggressive movement from either side is, therefore, restricted to two (or, at most, three) possibilities an advance through the Palatinate, or an advance by the Cologne neck ; the third alternative route, the valley of the Moselle, being too narrow for the operations of a large force.Precisely similar obstacles restrict an eastern move by French troops into Germany.The practical result is that France and Germany have to defend, not a frontier, but two passages or defiles one 70 miles broad, the other 20 miles broad&apos; the Palatinate and the Cologne neck.- These considerations render present French policy comprehensible; they explain the determined efforts made to secure the Palatinate, as well as the persistent occupation of the Rhine ports, Duisburg, Ruhrort and Dlisseldorf. The former is the historical course of invasion the broadest front available to either side, well adapted to an advance in force the latter district separates the Ruhr from the Cologne neck, and at once blocks the Gei-man advance via Cologne and facilitates a French entry into the Ruhr.A further point clearly brought out is the extreme importance of the Dutch frontier, since the tongue of Dutch territory stretching south towards Cologne restricts the passage between the Ardennes and the Dutch frontier to extremely narrow dimensions. The defence of Belgium and Northern France is thus facilitated no less than the defence of the Ruhr in the case of a French advance.I have, &amp;c.D&apos;ABERNON.* The sketch maps have been sent to the Secretary to the Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, where they are available for inspection.   Owing to the large cost involved they have not been reproduced.[8199 S-2]
