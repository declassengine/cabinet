In 1913 and 1914, bills to effect this object were introduced but were withdrawn owing to difficulties in regard to the compensation of officials entitled to fees for registration of writs in the Burgh Registers.     The present Bill, which like its predecessors was drafted under the instructions of a representative committee of members of the legal profession in Scotland, provides for the discontinuance of any Burgh Register only on the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of the Keeper to whom fees for registration are payable.     In this form it has been approved at a meeting of the officials con-cerned of which every such official had been notified. The Bill thus avoids the difficulties which arose in the case of its predecessors and will therefore, I apprehend, be non-contentious.     I accordingly ask leave for its Introduction - which, perhaps, might more conveniently take place in the Lords.(Signed)    ROBERT kUNRO. Scottish Office, .   -31st May, 1922.
Burgh Registers (Scotland) Bill.MEMORANDUM.The-discontinuance of the burgh registers was fore-shadowed in the report by Messrs. Morton and Bannatyne in 1866, when, after an inquiry as to the state of the registers of land rights in the counties and burghs of Scotland, inter alia, they report, &quot; . . . . we expect &quot; that by the establishment of the system of search &quot; sheets it will be ultimately possible without any risk &quot; of hardship to the royal burghs to do away with their &quot; registers and thus put the whole of the country on &quot; the satisfactory basis of one general establishment.&quot; The report by Lord Low&apos;s Committee appointed to inquire into the present system of land registration in Scotland, on 18th October 1897, recommended that the burgh registers should be discontinued as separate registers, and that all writs which, according to the existing practice, are recorded in a burgh register, should hereafter be recorded in the portion of the general register of sasines applicable to the county, or division of the county, within which the burgh is situated.This Bill will ultimately carry into effect the recom-mendations of the two Commissions. It will place the registration of land rights on the basis of one establish-ment, and will ensure all writs affecting lands within the burgh being recorded in the division applicable to the county in which the burgh is situated, as recommended by Lord Low&apos;s Committee.152-1A
