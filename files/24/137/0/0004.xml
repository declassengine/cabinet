U3 DOCUMENT IS jfeg PROflBRTY OB&apos; HB BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.M.H.47.MILK AKD DAIRIES BILL. Memorandum by the Minister&apos;of Health-.It is necessary that there should be legislation on the subject of milk during the pre cent Session.On the one ham the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915, must be brought into operation not later than the first of September, unless other legislative provision is made.     On the other hand there are certain orders made by the Ministry of Food which will, in the absence of legislation, cease to operate on the 1st of September,The Ministry of Pood orders in question are those which (1) give legal authority for the supply of Grade A. and certified milk under specified coduct.itions, (2) prohibit the addition of colouring matter or water, etc. to milk intended for sale.     The policy embodied in these orders is now generally accepted and should be made permanent, with certain modifications explained be lew.The Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, l?15, is a consolidation Act, and it Incorporated inter alia the Milk and Dairies Act, 1914, which was passed in August, 1314, and has since been suspended.     One essential basis of the policy embodied In this legislation is detailed control of the production of milk on the farm.     This control would be an additional burden on the farmer who is at present in difficulties;    it might have the very undesirable result of reducing the total supply of milk.     It would also place new duties on County Councils, involving the appointment by them of a visiting and inspectorial staff estimated roughly to cost not less than three quarters of a million a year. Further, the legislation contains provisions regarding the des-truction of tuberculous cattle, which presuppose the existence of a Tuberculosis 0rder (such as existed in 1914 but not not)
providing for compensation to farmers, shared by the Exchequer, for the slaughter of tuberculous cattle.     The annual cost ofsuch compensation was estimated at  150-000 in 1914, and this figure would tend to increase as inspection develops.     If the legislation came into force on the 1st of September, I should suppose that the cost to local and public funds would in a  err years approach a million a year.     The Exchequer liability could not be limited to compensation under a tuberculosis order, since the County Councils would inevitably demand a grant in aid of the cost of the general administration of the Act,,     For the above reasons I have cone to the conclusion that it is impossible to allow the 1914-15 legislation to come into force at the present time.     But the repeal of it would be opposed by most urban authorities as a retrograde step.I have considered the whole situation carefully in con-sultation with the Board of Agriculture and representatives of the parties interested.     My colleagues will be aware that a good deal of- public attention has been and is being directed to the question of an improved supply of milk.     There are certain practical steps which can be taken to assist that most desirable object, without throwing any material expenditure oti the State, the local authorities or the trade.I append to this memorandum draft clauses of a Bill, . (a) suspending the operation of the Milk and Dairies (Consolida-tion) Act, 1915, for three years from the 1st of Septembernext,(b) giving, generally, the power to revoke the registration of cowkeepers, dairymen and milk sellers (which now exists in London and Scotl&amp;nd) with a right cf appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction,(c) empowering local authorities, subject to conditions approved by the Minister of Health, to issue licenses for the saleof &quot;Certified&quot; &quot;Grade A&quot; milk and &quot;pasteurised&quot; milk, a bacterial test and inspection of cows being substituted for
:g  l\    %        ;g   .: f. &apos;   .    21the present tuberculiti test required for ^rade a whichwould bring the production of this grade within thecompetence of any decent farmer.(d) dealing with one or two points of detail I have reason tothink that proposals on these lines would he welcomed by alarge section of the distributing trade, and the better classof farmers would be glad to have the&apos; chance of getting a higher price for a superior article.     it present, apart from a limitedproduction of graded milk, the good farmer gets no more for hisclean milk than the careless producer gets for dirty milk.In the interests of public health, I am anxious to couplewith these provisions, which are designed to encourage the productionof clean milk, a penal clause to restrict the deliberate sale of milk from a cow with tuberculosis of the udder.     It is already an offence under the^alries Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1899 tosell milk from a cow suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, butin practice this Order is difficult to enforce and the penalty is inadequate.     I propose that the penalty for knowingly selling suchmilk in future shall be a fine not exceeding  20 for the firstoffence and a fine not exceeding  100 and imprisonment up to sixmonths for a subsequent offence.     Milk given by a cow with tuber-culosis of the udder is bound to contain tubercle bacilli in dangerousquantities and the deliberate sale of such milk calls for severepenalties.     The offence would be difficult to prove, but the effectof a clause of this kind would be most salutary.I ask authority for the introduction of a Bill on these linesat the earliest possible date.     If no Bill is passed before the endof August, the 1915 Act must come into operation, and either a heavyliability will be imposed on County Councils or we must be preparedto acquiesce in Important local authorities neglecting or refusing to carry out their statutory obligations.    Either alternative would be deplorable.     I propose that the Bill should be introduced in. the House of Lords as early as possible after Whitsuntide.A. MOND.Ministry of Heaith, 30th May, 1922.
