THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.3sRETC A B I NET.CP, 40?6Proposed Diversion of Government Atlantic Cable from Ireland.In March last I asked the authority of the Cabinet (see memorandum attached) to divert from Ireland to Penzanoe the Atlantic Cable acquired by the Government in 1930 from the Direct United States Company.     The Cabinet deoided that the question 3hould be deferred until after the Irish Eleotions.The Western Union Company, to whom the Oable has been temporarily leased, have since given notice to terminate the lease on the 30th ultimo and arrangements have been made to work the Oable temporarily in Ireland.     But, so long as it remains there, its working is dependant upon the stability of the land lines in Ireland and upon the Oable station being unmolested.     The service cannot he reliable and in the event of an interruption of the Imperial Cable, for which the second oable acts as a standby, the consequences would be extremely serioue.     The clientele of the Imperial Cable, whioh has by active canvassing been detached from the Cable Companies, would revert to the competitive routes.     As a business proposition, the removal of the oable to England is essential; it will save  10,000 per annum and will enable the two cables to be v?worked in conjunction at the Central Telegraph Office. In the present condition of Ireland the Oable station may at any moment be attacked and destroyed, as indeed an attack was made a fortnight ago upon the American Company&apos;s station at Valencia.I therefore ask the Cabinet to agree to the diversion being taken in hand at once.     The manufacture of the additional Oable required will occupy about 2 months and the(Memorandum by the Postmaster-General).laying

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.RET CABINET., 3836.PROVISIONAL G0VER1TMENT OF IRELAND COMMITTEE.I oiroulate this Memorandum (P.G.1.57) to the Cabinet at the request of the Provisional Government of Ireland Committee (P.G.1. 16th Conclusion para. 5)F. KELLAWAY.14 March l?&apos; /3.PROPOSED DIVERSION FROM IRELAND OF CABLE RECENTLY ACQUIRED FROM DIRECT UNITED STATES CABLE COMPANY.(Memorandum by the General Post Offioe).This Cable, whioh runs from Ballin3kelligs (Co.Kerry) to Newfoundland and than to Halifax, Nova Scotia, was bought from the Direct United States Cable Company in November 1?30 for  570,000.     The purchase included about 300 miles of stock oable, valued at  12S.000, leaving  445,000 as the value of the cable in situ.The object of the purchase was (1) to provide an alternative to the Government owned Imperial oable, which runs from Penzanoa via the Azores to Halifax, so as to ensure the continuance of the service in the event of an interruption of the latter Cable, (2) to supply an additional channel for the traffic when the full working capacity of the Imperial Cable is exceeded.On acquiring the D.U.S. Oable, arrangements were made, as a temporary measure, to lease it to the Western UnionTelegraph
Telegraph Company, subject to three months&apos; notice, at a rental of    J  56,875 a year, on condition that whenever the Imperial Cable is interrupted the D.U.3.0able should be used to carry the Imperial traffic.     That traffic is increasing, and it-will 30on be necessary and profitable to terminate the lease.The D.U.3.Cable service has hitherto been worked in two sections, viz., (1) by a telegraph line between London and Ballinakelligs; and (2) by cable worked direct between Ballinskelligs and Halifax.     The Imperial Cable is worked direct between London and Halifax, passing through an automatic relay at Penzanoe: and in order to admit of the two cables being working together in the most economical manner, it is proposed to out the D.U.S. Cable off Ballinskellige and extend it to Penzance,   It would then be possible to work the two cables side by side in London and Halifax and at the Penzance relay station.   If the Cable is to be used as an adjunot to. the Imperial Cable, for which it was originally purchased, it would be essential that the connecting land lines should be under the control of the British Pest Office and that the Cables should be worked side by side.   It has always been the intention, quite apart from the Irish political situation, to remove the Cable from Ireland before the post Office took over its working.Against the oost of the cable extension (about  180,000) there would be a saving in respect of the maintenance and working of the Ballinskelligs station (about  10,000 a year) and the cost of the landline across Ireland,If the servioe were still working through Ireland, the Irish Free State would be entitled, in strictness, to charge a transit rate of about fd. a word, representing about  13,000 a year.   Assuming - as seems not improbable - that they would forego this right, rental would be chargeable for the landline, which at normal rates would amount to about  3,300 a year.The Cable would be cut and prolonged outside Irish Territorial waters, and the strip within those waters would not be disturbed.General Post Office, E.C. 7th Maroh, 1928.
