[This Document is the Property of His-Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!428Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.CONFIDENTIAL.C.P.-4053.CABINET.THE BURNEY AIRSHIP SCHEME.memorandum by the Secretary oe State for the Colonies.I circulate a memorandum on this scheme, which has been submitted to me by a high authority.W. S. C.Colonial Office,June 21, 1922.Memorandum.IT is not easy to regard the Burney airship scheme as more attractive than that proposed by the Imperial Air Communications Committee, which was finally rejected some months ago.It is true, as will be seen from the following approximate figures, that the annual financial liability under the Burney scheme is considerably less during the first few years, but at the same time the Government are to assume under this scheme a very heavy capital liability, with no better prospects of ultimate success.Imperial Communications Committee Scheme.Two-year Period. Capital expenditure Running expenditure . 593,000 ,    746,000 1,339,000I.e.,  670,000 per annum.Further three years. Capital expenditure Running expenditure ,357,000 1,589,000Burney Scheme. 23 3,750 per annum  for ten years tomeet interest. Guarantee of redemption of debenturesamounting to  2,200,000. 6,946,000 1.6.,  2,315,000 per annum.The capital proposed ( 2,200,000 debentures and  1,200,000 shares) appears totally inadequate to prove out the results. It is not surprising that the Shell Company and Messrs. Vickers back the scheme, as they surely stand to gain more than they venture by petrol consumption and airship construction. Consideration of the financial assistance required conclusively proves that the Government are not only running the risk, but they are also handing over assets of realisable break-up value (e.g, Cardington). The Government cannot reasonably hope that the money will ever he repaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it would be reasonable to advocate the expenditure of  213,750 a year for ten years if it could be thought that the sum involved would carry the project through ; but it is difficult to believe this now that experience has done so much to shake the belief which was at one time held in the [8548]
reliability of airships. This point need not be elaborated, as the recent mishaps both here and in America are fresh in peopled memory.Given unlimited money, it might be worth while to try the experiment; but it is improbable that we have the requisite knowledge of stress and strain to advance design to compete with the data possessed by the Zeppelin interests in Germany. If we could arrange to get such knowledge as part payment of reparations, we should advance quicker and towards more satisfactory results than by guaranteeing the losses on this speculative venture.In present circumstances it seems a sounder policy to concentrate such resources as are available on the development of heavier-than-air craft on commercial lines.\
