THE UHKMSLOYED. On June I9th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled approximately 1,434,900, a decrease of 8,188 on the preceding week:   short time workers numbered approximately 103,600 on the same date.Taken as a whole the &quot;week of agitation&quot; arranged . by the national Administrative Council of Unemployed has been a failure:   meetings have been held in London and the provinces but audiences have for the most part been small.   The difference between the plane made and . their execution was well shown in Birmingham, where twenty meetings were held instead of 160.On June 24th some 2,000 people attended an unemployed meeting in Trafalgar Square at which 3. Swain, 1*. Davis, B. Joy, J. Stewart, S. Saklatvala, W. Hanningtoi; Bonar Thompson, Mrs. M. Walker and George Hardy (from America) spoke.     The resolution passed, whioh has been moved at all these unemployed meetings was as follows;  .&quot;That this mass demonstration of unemployed workers most emphatically protest against the latest amendment to the Unemployment Act, which literally and actually reduces the unemployment benefit by half, b-r placing than &quot;five weeks on and five weeks off benefit.   Further, that we consider this is a sinister move to bring the unemployed men and women down to an even lower depth of degradation, and by so doing, hoping to drive them by desperation caused by their economic suffering to undersell the employed workers in their struggle   for existence and competition for employment.   We further pledge ourselves to oarry oh an Incessant agitation against the present Government, and to continue to agitate and strive for the just demands of the unemployed workers&apos; movement, namely, work at Trade Union rates or maintenance at Trade Union rates.&quot;In thecourse of his speooh James Stewart said that:&quot;The unemployed want food, clothing, shelter, and I am going to make this suggestion to the National Unemployed Committee, that la the light ofthe/
the happenings of the past few weeks, we get another banner as big as Trafalgar Square, and instead of the words demanding work or full maintenance we have inscribed on the banner, &quot;To the British Government, we the unemployed of Britain are balmy, send us to Broadmoor besides Ronald True.&apos;   If you can only get an unemployed doctor to certify you insane, to recommend you for Broadmoor, you will be able on Saturday afternoons to play cricket with Ronald True the murderer.   You will also have the privilege of having two servants to clean your slop basics in Broadmoor. You will also be in a position because you have a ; certificate to say you are mad, of having four meals aday0    I put it to you in all seriousness, in all . earnestness-, If you ask for I work and they cannot give it to you, if you ask for full maintenance and they cannot . . give it to you, then 30 balmy.   Kill somebody,   Get certified insane.   Tell the magistrate that you and your wife cannot make both ends meet on the dole, and that would be proof that you were both insane.&quot;On June 27th about 50 of the organised unemployedarrived at the House of Commons in groups of ten:   six wereadmitted and saw their respective members:   no disorderoccurred:   this fact was in accordance with the intentions 0the demonstrators who think that one or two peaceful visitsprocure for them unchallenged admittance to the House on some future occasion.THE OOMMUfllSTSIt is reported that in March of this year the Executive Committee of the Third International was allotted a sum of f million gold roubles for propaganda, particularly in India, Ireland, South Africa and Great Britain.The international character of communist activity is weillustrated in a manifesto issued by the Executive Committeeof the Communist International entitled &quot;Save the Workers ofSouth Africa&quot; and published in the current issue of &quot;the worker&quot;, which is at present receiving a small subsidy fromBritish Section of the Red International of Labour Unions:&quot;The strike of the South African proletariat is ending in a massacr e,   The lor ds of the Wi twat er srand mines were able to. transform a struggle for wages, for daily bread, into a conflict which enabled them to murd hundreds of class-conscious workers and to fling tha flower of the South African proletariat into prison...&quot;Barely/
W    3     M&quot;Barely had the strike been drowned in blood than attacks, were made on the Trade Unions, and the gains achieved by the organised workers after years of struggle were oaken away-   But sven this does not satisfy the bold barons.   New victims are to be added tov those of Pordsburg and Bemonc.   The workers, in the overflowing prisons are being condemned.   The exploiting class are too cowardly to bring them before an open court-martial, and so they have rakod up an old Draconic Dutoh law which enables them to condemn to death hundreds of the best workers on the charge of high treason and murder.&quot;Workers of Great Britain and workers of all countries.1 Hasten to the assistance of your persecuted comrades.   The flower of the South African working class will be destroyed unless you raise your protest in time.   The,methods which are being so brutally employed against tho workers on the Rand will be employed against you in England unless you immediately take action.   Do not permit the South African proletariat to be put into chains.   Make it clear to your bourgeoisie that you will not tolerate the murder of the South African workers.   Set your leaders and organisations in motion, and see to it that they more energetically than hitherto take up the cause, of your class brothers.   Act boldly and resolutely;   otherwise new streams of workers1 blood will flow in the free British Iipire.&quot;Long live the Revolutionary South African proletariati&quot;Down with the terror of the colonial finance magnates I&quot;Long live the solidarity of all the workers irrespective of race and colour.&quot;The Exeoutive Committee of the .. Communist International.&quot;^    The Rosta Hews Agency in Shanghai is in direct touch with the Hands off Russia Committee and has acknowledged the receipt of the committeeTs pamphlet on the Japanese in Siberia, which has been translated into Chinese.   Baranovsky, a member of the agency, stated that the pamphlet had appeared in five Chinese papers which had a combined circulation of half a million and that any pamphlets sent him in the future would receive similar publicity.Jack Tanner sent the. following interesting communication to Dick Beeoh on June 21st:-&quot;I went along to the A.R.C.O.S. this afternoon about getting a job on one of their ships.   Saw the Transport Manager, Jav, Yasvoln, who you will probably be surprised to know was the seoretary to Sverdlov on the boat we meks the trip on the Volga,   He was glad to see ma   I put tho position to him and said I would find him a crew of deceit fellows, who were on the beach.- He fell in wfjh the &apos;idea. To cut a long story short, he reckons it can by done, bub lie would have to get permission of the delegation, he rang up tfothstein and got a reply to say they would let him know in
a couple of days.   I told him I was not a member of the    &apos; Party, he doesn&apos;t give a damn himself, but you know how things are.    I mentioned your name as well and of oourse Ik remembers you.   Well to prevent any sabotage if it could h avoided I called and saw Mao. (MacManus), he said he would send round a note to the Del. telling them that from his point of view we were O.X.    I an to go up again on Friday and should hear definitely then, but you know what the Russians are.   There is a ship leaving about the 1st August for the Diberin River, ris-ht the other side of Archangel, most interesting and unusual trip Y. tells me.   The ship are sailing under the British Flag and carry British Officers, whioh is good.   They had a crowd of Britishers before, but they were booze fighters   and they had to fire them.   They still carry a percentage of Britishers but mom of the crew are Russians - or supposed to be.   They wore elf of work here and they gave them jobs tho&apos; they are none tel sure of them.   Well the point is, if I can fix thiviga up M you prepared to make one of a little bunch I am trying to be together?   I have written to Jim Breslow putting it to hiffiH the fellow Larkin wants to make the trip as well, you cenSl look after him down below.   I don&apos;t know yet how many they will take of us on one ship, but I think there will be a I chance for other reliable fellows on other ships.   If you 1 know of any just mention it without promising too much,   m about Charlie (Beech) and the Apple (ApplebyJ?    Write anil let me know what you think, I believe the money is better 1 than usual.   Of course if I get a job ashore before Aug. m may give it a miss but you others can carry on.   If I do i make it shall hang on and play up the A.M.W.U,&quot;Well have to inform you that George Hardy is back htl He get deported to Canada and came on here. Don*t know vim he is going to do nor does he yet. Have not had a chancel talk to him yet.&quot;Divisional efforts to raise money have, so far, proved unsatisfactory and the organisers are suffering in consequence J it is stated at headquarters that Party administration will be I dependent upon subscriptions and, if this statement be correct! the few remaining paid officials seem likely to become unemplol In this connection interest attaches to a statement made by Hal Webb at the Midlands Divisional Council meeting in Birmingham I June 17th:   he declared that the present financial crisis was partly due to the fact that when the Party was started many people poured in large sums of money &quot;Russia also assisting in large way&quot;:   he continued:&quot;We then set up,a top-heavy machinery, poured money literature and various branches, set up a heavy list of pi officials, out of all proportion to membership dues;   and at definite instructions of the International, set up machinery for ?ihich we were after to be responsible.This,
f I *517&quot;This was to the good lor the time we were financed, but the time came when Russia was faced with feeding its starving millions, and its desire to trade with capitalist countries, to make concessions to peasants, etc., and divert from its purely Soviet aims. Thus Russia was confronted with an abnormal situation, and an intimation came to England that the British Section would have to support itself more than it had done,   Our Chairman then went over to Eussia and on his return stated that, in view of the obligations we .vere placed under in? organising our top-heavy machinery, by the International, satisfactory arrangements would be made to assist us. Unfortunately, however, these never materialised and all the promises were unfulfilled, but all at onoe we were notified that no further assistance was coming;   thiB meant that we were to be self-supporting.&quot;The acting secretary has sent a whip to all branches for a return of exact.membership in order, no doubt, to check subscriptions.&quot;The International Press Correspondence&quot; for June  2ndcontains a letter signed by Bukharin, radek, Frossard, andZetkin and addressed to &quot;Arthur Henderson and James BamsayMcDonald&quot;:   this document is a reply to a telegram regardingthe trial of the Social Revolutionaries in Moscow and covers the usual ground.   The following extracts are typical examples of Bolshevik mentality:&quot;Our position with regard to the Social Revolutionary trial will never be determined by an agreement that you and your friends have reduoed to a worthless scrap of paper.   Our attitude will be dictated by our revolutionary duty to the world proletariat, for whom the Russian Soviet Republic is the foremost and truest fighter, and which you and your friends hate and fear, like your own wicked conscience...&quot;You, Henderson, were in the War Cabinet of the money and power-hungry imperialism of Great Britain.   You, MacBonald, suffered this shame.   On your hands dots the blood of millions and millions of killed and maimed.   Your friends, Vandervelde, Vels, Eenaudel and Co., are as political brothers-in-arms of Joffre and Ludendorff, spattered with blood and filth...&quot;Although we had not forgotten for a moment what an abyss of theory and action separated us from you and your friends, we were ready for the greatest concessions to your hypoorisy, for the sake of the present needs of the proletariat and the urgency of the proletarian united front. Although you have broken the oonditions of our agreement, against all faith and truth, we.will continue to work with all our strength for the proletarian united front, without you and your friends and against you and your friends. Unity with you and your friends will be possible on that day when you and your kind cease to be the lackeys anddefenders/
defenders of the bourgeoisie, of the capitalist order, and when you and your hind begin to. fight for and with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.&quot;Half of the current issue of &quot;The Communist&quot; is devotedto suggestive articles on &quot;previous revolutions in England&quot;.Walton Uewbould deals with &quot;Magna Charts&quot;, &quot;Alexander John&quot;with the &quot;Peasants Revolt in 1381&quot;; T.A. Jackson with the&quot;Puritan Revolution&quot; and Postgate with &quot;The ChartistRising&quot;.Sylvia Pankhurst is making arrangements for a lecture tour in the States under the auspices of the American Defense Committeo of Chicago and Ireinberg is reported to be sending her a draft of  1,000 for expenses.VV, McLaine is much perturbed by the refusal of the Communist Party Executive to allow him to attend the forth-coming Pamine Relief Conference in Berlin and has urged the Berlin Bureau to wire him if they consider his presence essential.   Edgar Whitehead has typhus.Arthur MaoManus attended the communist demonstration in Amsterdam on June 25th and it is reported that he subsequently went to the Hague to visit the Russian delegates.On June  6th Eranci3 Meynell^ creditors met at the Load Bankruptcy Court:   the receiving order was made on the petiti of Mr. J.H. Thomas who claims  2,035 in respect of damages for libel and holds as security a charging order on second mortgage debentures for  3,000 in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; which he values at  50:   it was stated that in 1918 Meynell received a salary of  800 a year as news-editor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and that after editing &quot;The Communist&quot; for a time he resumed his occupation as a printerTs designer.Albert Inkpin was released from Pentonville on June 22nd and is going to Bognor to recuperate.THE/
m COAX MINERS, ,  The ftm?&quot;&apos;1&apos;? Conference of the South Wales Miners1-rftri:i-ye4.e.rat.ip.n was..n5.ia.,;at-.Caraiff from June 22nd - 24th: onthe first day the two following resolutions wore passed:&quot;That the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain be asked to make an immediate application for lnorease to, 60 .per, pent above pre-war wages, and that, if the National Executive fails to secure this from the owners, it shall approach the Government with thisObject.&quot; &apos; *1      &quot;That 14 days&quot; notice &quot;be given by all South Wales colliery workmen on July 10, with the view of com-peiling all workmbtt to join the Miners1 Federation, ,.,  and to deal effectively with tho numerous cases of victimisation practised by tho employers in various , .    parts of the coalfield.&quot;Subsequent sessions somewhat modified these decisions and .. it is not oartain that the threat, of a stoppage was seriously . ,made:   on the other hand there are threats of a dockers1 ..... strike in July and the do legates may have thought that as such a strike would automatically impodo work in the mines they might utilise the opportunity to make a stand against non-unionists. &quot;-\There was muoh . d,i sc us si on regard ing the question of affiliation to the Bed International of Labour Unions, which w  ..; was eventually referred hack to tho lodges for further con-Bideration.    VernonHartshorn,, M.P., Thomas Riohards, A.J.Cook and Noah Ablett were elected Welsh representatives on the Cpiaiiittee of the J^ners1 Federation of Great Britain: Hartshorn disp^ Ablett must be. oonsidorad extremists. .In an Interview published in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; on July-; it a&amp;%!-?ax. to ed&quot; t% or GWOi-f27th Cook, referring to the South Wales conference demand for an Inimedtai.e increase of 60 per cent above standard, said that this would very probably create an early crisis in the coalfield.     It would also raise the question of thefSanotity/
&apos;Sanctity of agreements&apos;. Inasmuch as the present agreement allows only 23 per cent., he and his colleagues had decided that there can be no sanctity to an agreement which forces those working under it to eke out an existence that falls far short of essential human conditions. He anticipates that the general body of workers throughout the country will come to the assistance of the miners in their fight to secure a reasonable living wage.

&apos;Trade Union history&apos;, Cook said, &apos;has taught them to appreciate the fact that not the public, or Government, or the coalowners, lend an ear to the desperate appeals that are frequently made by the miners&apos; leaders, until they are driven to take action by the creation of a crisis.&apos; Then, and not till then, did the grievous impoverishment of the minors command attention. In this instance, he hoped justice would be done to the South Wales miners without recourse being had to industrial action.

THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE

On June l0th the executive of the Young Communist International issued from Moscow a circular to all Leagues regarding "The International Recruiting Week" from August 27th - September 2nd and the "International Day of Youth" on September 3rd&apos;: ten pages of instructions regarding these celebrations have been sent via Berlin to this country but they amount in effect to a detailed repetition of the orders concerning previous "Weeks": the following passage may, however, be of interest:-

"We stress once more the fact that the Day of Youth should not only be a demonstration of the members of our League but that infact all workers must be given the idea that all juveniles in the factories, schools, mines, barracks and other organisations must be included.

&apos;This/
&quot;This means that we undertake an intensified anti-militaristic propaganda.   The participation of soldiers in our Day of Youth must represent the concentrated form of this propaganda.   The preparation of this work must bo made with the groatost possible care in order that the barracks shall remain open on the Day of Youth and shall not be closed for some reason or other.     We will include among the slogans for the Day of Youth speoial anti-militarist slogans.&quot;&quot;DAILY HSRALD&quot;According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society has granted the paper  400.SH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY IK GHEAT BRITAIN.The murder of Sir Henry Wilson caused a considerable amount of surprise end some alarm in Sinn Fein circles in Great Britain:   the extreme section secretly expressed satisfaction at the removal of a man for whom they have not one good word to say and whom they profess to regard as &quot;an organiser of outrage&quot;:   the more moderate section fear a revulsion of feeling on the part of the British public with unpleasant consequences to themselves.Raids have been made on the houses of some thirty persons known to ha%e been actively connected with the extreme section:   these people were searched and detained but, after enquiry, most of them were released. In six cases small quantities of arms or incendiary material were found and proceedings will be taken against the persons concerned:   the raids disclosed the existence of a small band of youthful Sinn Feiners amongst the employees at the General Boat Office Savings Bank Department at Jlythe Road, one at least of whom will probably be proceeded against for disclosing offloial secrets-Sinn Fein in Sootland received the news of theassassination of Sir Henry WilBon with sat is fao tion, theonly/
only regret expressed being for the fate of the murderers. This&apos;was to he expected as many of the extremists in the Glasgow area .oome froir the North of Ireland and are bitterly opposed to the Ulster Parliament.     (Ehe feeling is also dues in great measure, to the number of Belfast Roman Catholic refugees who recently arrived in Glasgow.At a meeting of the Connolly Club committee on June 20th it was decided, on the recommendation of the StandiCommitteo, to send a mossage to de Valera reiterating determination to stand by him notwithstanding the adverse vote at the elections.Employers of labour in Glasgow are up against the employment of Irish and amongst the residents in tenements, quarrels on Irish matters are becoming frequent.
