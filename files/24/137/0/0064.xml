UNIVERSITIES OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE BILL.Note by the President of the Board of Education covering Draft Bill.  .I circulate,, for the information of my Colleagues, the first draft of a Bill designed to give general effect, so far as legislation is needed for this purpose, to the recommendations of the Report of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge. At an early stage I took an opportunity of consulting unofficially and in confidence a few individuals at each University and I think that the general plan of the Bill is likely to commend itself to the main body of reasonable academic opinion,    Since then I have sent copies of the Bill to the two Vice-chancellors, for confidential submission to the Hebdomadal Council at Oxford and the Council of the Senate at Cambridge, in order that they may send in any observations that they may have to make upon it: I have asked that these observations may.be sent in at the earliest possible date.   I have done my best in private conversar tion to impress upon both Universities my conviction that tho present time offers conditions more favourable to a palatable measure of Reform than are ever likely to recur and I hope that no serious opposition will be offered by any responsible sections of opinion.   The only unavoidable difficulty which Will have to be met arises out of the position of women at Cambridge, which I dealt with in my Note (CP. 3973) circulated a little time ago.   In that Note I suggested that if the matter is pressed in the House of Commons, it should be left to a free vote cf the House: this would satisfy the women&apos;s champions, if I can judge from a remark made by Major Hills, M*P*, on the occasion of a Deputation on this subject which I received a week or two ago.(intld.)
