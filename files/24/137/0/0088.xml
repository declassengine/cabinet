DEPARTMENTAL LEVIES. CASE to the LAW OFFICERS of the CROWN to advise.There are sent herewith :-(A) Copy Memorandum for the Cabinet by the Presidentof the Board of Trade with documents annexed thereto (CP.3771)(B) Bundle of Orders Notices Proclamations Licencesreferred to in the above Memorandum(C) Copy transcript of Shorthand Note of the judgment of Lord Buckmaster in the Case of Attorney General v. Wilts United Dairies Limited.This case is submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown for their urgent opinion, by direction of the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet and it arises out of the recent decision of the House of Lords in the case of the Attorney General v. Wilts United Dairies Limited,As Counsel are aware, there were several schemes put into operation by the Ministry of Food and other Departments, under which charges were made whose legality may be called in question as a result of the above mentioned decision.The total sum involved amounts to several millions of pounds practically all of which has been collected.   If the schemes other than the milk scheme could be distinguished in law.from such scheme on the ground that the money has been paid and is irrevocable, there would be no necessity for a Bill.   But it is believed that such a defence is not available, if the money was paid under duress.With reference to the copy Memorandum (Document A) the Schedules to the Memorandum have in some measure been amplified since the Memorandum was originally submitted.
The Government have for some time contemplated the introduction of an Indemnity Bill, to make valid these charges, in the event of the Milk case being decided -agaixisrt. the Crown.On 9th March, 1922, the following question was asked and the following answer given in the House of Commons - Mr. G. Looker-Lamp son (by Private Notice) asked the President of the Board of Trade whether he proposes to take any further action with regard to the case in which the Court of Appeal has given Judgment against the Crown in&apos; proceedings to recover certain moneys claimed to be due from the Wilts United Dairies Limited.Mr* Baldwin:   In the case to which my hon. Friend refers, the decision of the Court of first instance was to the effect that the Crown is entitled to recover certain moneys claimed to be due from the Wilts&apos; United Dairies, Limited, in respeot of charges made by the Ministry of Pood on licences to export milk from one area to another.   This decision has been reversed by the Court of Appeal, and an appeal to the House of Lords has beon lodged.   If Judgment be given by the House of Lords against the Crown, the Governmentwill bring in a Bill to legalise their prooedure in cases of this nature during the period of control. A question arises as to the form which the Bill shouldtake.   The total amount payable undor the Milk Scheme was 264,492., as shown by the following table:-MILK DIFFERENTIAL PRICES SCHEME.2d. per gallon licence fee.Payments made to the Ministry..... 34,121.19.2 105,653.12.7 (Payments set off against ad-( raitted claims for Cheese ( Subsidy....................71,531.Payments withheld158,859. 7.3Total 264,402. 9.10
The question at once arises to what extent (if any) the Bill should affect these milk cases.     This question was considered yesterday at the Home Affairs Committee, and the opinion of Counsel is sought on the point.There appear to be four alternatives:-(1) The Bill might validate all the schemes including the milk scheme.(2) The Bill might validate all the schemes except the milk scheme.(3) The Bill might authorise- the Government to retain all moneys already oolle-selected under all the schemes (including the milk scheme).(4) The Bill might validate all schemes including the milk scheme exeept the actual case of the lilts United Dairies.It is thought that it would be difficult to ask Parliament to adopt the first course, which would involve setting aside the    : decision of the Houso of Lords.     But Counsel will no doubt oon-- . sider how far the judgments would justify such a Bill.If the second course is followed, it Is thought that the money already collected in the Milk case ( 105,000) must be repaid.   But, if so, the question arises how far the repayment will prejudice the passage of a Bill to enable the&apos;Government to retain the moneys which they have collected under the other - schemes.-Tho third course would probably lead to great outcry on the part of milk dealoro who have paid.   But the same argument applied perhaps even more strongly if the second course is adopted.The fourth course might be difficult on the ground that the Wilts case was a test oase.It is suggosted that if the second course is adopted and the Milk Scheme is not included, the refund in that case might be justified on the ground that the oase was a test case and that all the milk charges ought to bo treated alike, and follow the decision.
In this connection Counsel are referred to the following questions asked and answers given in the House of Commons.Q. 76. SIR GILBERT WILLS.    To ask the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Pood, whether he can state the total amount levied on producers of milk in the south-western counties by the operation of the differential rate in last summers milk prices, and to what account the sum so levied has been placed; whether any portion of this money has already been expended; and, if so, for what purpose. (Tuesday 30th March, 1920).A. MR. PARKER. The totaL amount due to theMinistry of Food in respect of milk exported from the South Western area during the summer of 1919, is  252,796.19.3.   A tost case la, .pending as regards part of this sum which Is unpaid, and In the meantime, no part of the money has been expended.Q. 141. LT.  COLONEL SIR GILBERT WILLS;-    To ask the PoodController, whether, with regard to the differential rrate in the milk prices during the summer of 1919, the test case which was pending some months ago as to the amount due to the Ministry of Pood In respect of milk exported from the South-Western area during this period has now been settled; and whether he can give any Information as to the allocation of this fund.    (Thursday 18th November), 1920.A. MR. Mo CURDY.;- The case has been put down forhearing but has not yet come on.    In the circumstances that part of the money which has been received has not been allocated for any purpose.A further question arises as to how far the other schemes can be distinguished from the Milk Scheme andfrom one another.   There appear to be three importantclasses % -Cases in which under an Order (not being a requisition Order) a licence has been Issued; and, in consideration of the issue of such licence a charge has been made, viz-1. The Milk Case. 2. Flour Precluded Purposes. 4. Additional Beer Licenses. 7. Potato Licenses. 8. Export licenses for Wheat. 11. Transfer of Ships. 13. Cotton Control.
These oases do not appear to differ from the milk case in any vital point, although In the case of the Flour precluded Purposes licence the flour in respect of which a oharge was made was, in very many cases, originally the property of the Food Controller, (ii)       The second class of case is that in which a Requisition Order was made although it was either of doubtful validity or was not put into &apos; bona fide&apos; operation, viz;-3. The Bread. Subsidy reduction scheme 5. Imported Meat Soheme (iii)       licences granted under proclamations viz;-12.Export of Steel 14.Import Licences,The Control of Hides (6) presents special features and Counsel may be of the opinion that this Scheme does not fall to be considered.The Law Officers of the Crown are requested to advise (1) Whether a distinction can be drawn between the milk Scheme and the other Schemes. (8) Whether having regard to the general principles laid down in the Wilts United Dairies case the other levies made can be supported on legal grounds. (3) Whether a Bill is necessary or advisable. (4) Whether having regard to the political as well as the legal aspect, such a Bill should (a) validate all the schemes (including the Milk Scheme)or   (b) validate the schemes other than the Milk Scheme or   (o) provide by prohibition of legal proceedings for the retention by the Government of any moneys already paid (or deducted againstcounterclaims) or   (d) validate all schemes other than the levyactually imposed on the Wilts united Dairies Ltd.(5) Generally on the case,
OPINION OP THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN.1.      Except in the case of items Nos. 9 and 13 (Cattle Feeding Stuffs Levy and Licences to Work Cotton Machinery) . none of the   levies mentioned on page 3 of C.p, 3771 differ from each other.     They are all covered by the decision of the House of Lords in the case of the Wilts United Dairies. 2,      The only difference appearing in the oase of items 9 and 13 is that the money that was levied was never collected by the Government, but was put into a fund to be distributed amongst the members of the trade by trustees representing the trade.     But even in these cases the original power to levy the money was never obtained by the Government constitutionally, and the levy is still open to possible attack on the- grounds of the decision in the United Dairies Case.3,       The Government is not in any stronger position in regard to money actually collected than in the case of demands made but not enforced.     Whether the money was collected or not, it could now be recovered on the ground that it was paid under pressure in response to a demand colore officii.     The Indemnity Act 1920 would not, In our opinion, afford an answer to such a claim.4.      There being no legal justification for any of the levies, legislation affords the only protection.     In this context we desire to   point out that some of the levies mentioned in the list above referred to are easier to justify than others.   In some cases the levy was a necessary measure in order to prevent profiteering or to equalise the burden of Government control amongst members of the trade, as in the case of milk.     In the case of item No.2, the levy on the trade was used both for the purpose of equalisation and as a contribution towards the cost of the bread subsidy - in other words, to reduce taxation.
In the case of items Nos. 9 and 13, cattle feeding stuffs and cotton machinery, the arrangement was for the purpose of preventing undue preference and prejudice and apparently met with the approval of the whole of the trade concerned.In the case of Item - No. 11 it is less easy to attribute the levy to the achievement of any object of the type above mentioned.5.       Having regard to the above considerations we advise that the Bill if introduced should be general in character j   should apply, even though a judgment may have been obtained in favour of the subject, as in the case of United Dairies, and should cover the whole of the fourteen heads mentioned on page 3 of CP. 3771.     Where a judgment has been obtained, the Crown ought to pay the full costs incurred as between Solicitor and Client though the return of any money paid may be prevented by the legislation to be introduced.(Intld.)   E.M.P. &quot; L,S.7th July,  1922.
