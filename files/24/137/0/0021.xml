, W-W.....f**r   .110(This Document is the Fropertyef His Britannio Majesty&apos;s Government)SECRET.C. P. 4081*CABINET.Copy NoFINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH NORTHERN IRELAND-Memorandum by the Chancellor of the &apos; Exchequer -1. I think my colleagues should be aware of the extent to nhlch the British Exchequer has already oome to the assistance of the Northern Irish Governmento2.    The schemes of the Government   of Ireland Act 1920 was that Northern Ireland asnumed financial responsibility for all the ordinary local administrative services receiving In return the revenues attributable to Northern Ireland.     She also pays a contribution fixed for two years by   Act and to be revised periodically thereafter towards imperial expenditure.Northern Ireland received as a speoial gift (a)    the cost of a new Parliament and new Government buildings in Ulster.   This will cost at least two millions cid in 1921-22 had already cost over  100,000;     and (b)     The equivalent of the annuities collected from tenants in Northern Ireland, a sum something 9ver  60^3,000 a year *Northern Ireland also receives her proportionate share in the Assets of various comon funds such as the insurance funds, development fund, road fund etc.3.     Included in the services transferred to Northern Ireland was the maintenance of law and   order; and the Government of Ireland Act specifically provided -Section 21 (n)       &quot;that provision should be made by the ParJJifimsnt of Northern Ireland for tho cost within theirJuri sdlo*tir/n
(111Jurisdication of Irish Services and that any charge on the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom for those services should cease.&quot;The financial relations between Great Britain and Northern Ireland are thus definitely laid down by statute *4.   V/e have already gone faiJ beyond what was contemplated in the Act -(1)    aJLFegards 1921-25(a)   We have given Ulster the whole of the revenue attributable to Ulster for the period from 22nd November to 31st March on the basis of the^actua?^ collections within that period *     In view of the fact that the income tax cemes in for the greater part of the last quarter of the 2year 7/hereas expenditure is far more equally spread over the year, this as extremely generous treatmente It would have been quite reasonable to say that the revenue should be divided not on the chance basis of collection but in the proportion of l30/365ths (22nd November to 31st March s 130 days) of the total revenue of the yeart   What we did probably benefited Ulster to the extent of something near a million.   It may be added the total cost of Special Constabulary (some of whom replaced ordinary police force) was only  458,000. (\j)      As Ulster even so wat unable to make her accounts balance for 1921-22 I have undertaken to ask Parliament to vote the difference between her attributable revenue arrived at as above and the sum of  1; 250,000.       This will probably mean a supplementary vote of something between  200,000 and  300,000.(Ii)
112(ii) Ab regards 1952-33*(a) We have already agreed to give Ulster a grant in aid of 1^ million s, of - hi oh  500,000 is in respect of unemployment (an* service^ which under the Act fall a wholly to the Ulster exchequer) and  1,000,000 is in respect of Police expenditure, ^also under the Act an Ulster service.)(b) We have undertaken to consider whether there is a case for reducing the statutory Ulster contribution of  7,920,000 to Imperial expenditure. This matter is now being considered by the Joint Exchequer Board.   It is not improbable that a concession of a million or more may be made on this head.(iii) In addition to the above we have agreed(a) To pay Ulster  1,500,000 ( 750,000 this year and  750,000 next year)   for damages in Ulster during the pre-treaty period.   Some at least of these damages (Balbriggan) were done by Ulster.(b) We have agreed to guarantee the principal and interest of loans up to a total of  3,500,000 to be raised by Ulster, mainly fgr unemployment and development.   A Bill for this purpose is just about to be introduced.5*   I would add that although I have as yet received no official figures from the Northern Irish Government I understand their expenditure   on Special Constables down to the 30th August is not likely to be less than  4,090,000 (to which I have already undertaken to contribute one million).   The British, Treasury have no control whatever over this expenditure and it seems extremely improbable that it is likely to cease by the 30th August-6*   I need not remind my colleagues how jealously supplementary estimates, whether for this or any other purpose, would be regarded by vho House of Co-simons; and how increasingly difficult it is becoming to defend largegrants
113grants in aid of Ulster revenues which are used for expenditure ever which the British Treasury has and can have no effective control&apos;   I regard it as essential in the interests of economical administration that Ulster should have a substantial interest in economy by having to bear a substantial part of the cost herself* This object would of course be defeated if we either contributed the whole of the special expenditure   or allowed the fact that we were not doing so to be brought forward as an argument for    j reducing the Ulster Snperlal contribution.(Initialled) R.S.H.TREASURY,  S.,ftM*9th June   1922*
