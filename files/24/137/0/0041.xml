I have the honour to be with the highest consideration,My Lord, Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient,humble Servant, (Signed)   Hardinge of Penshurst.The Right Honourable,The Earl of Balfour, K.G.,0.M., etc.     etc,   etc
TRANSLATION OF NOTE ADDRESSED BY M. PQINCARE TO LORD HARDLNGE ON...JUNE.. 16th, 1.923.Ministry for Foreign Affaire.   -French Republic.Paris,June 16th, 1922,Sir,The despatch of May 30th last which Your Excellency received from the Earl of Balfour and of which you were good enough to hand me a copy considers the note which I had the honour to address to Sir Milne Cheetham on May 19th as a most unexpected inter-pretation of the undertaking given to the British government by Monsieur, Millerand on April 11th, 1920, in the name of the French government,I will not conceal from Your Excellency that my surprise was not lessened &quot;by noting that it had been possible for a misunderstanding to arise in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government both as to the inter-pretation and the bearing of terms as clear as those ccntained in the notes addressed on April 9th and, 11th 1920, by Monsieur Millerand to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Paris and of which the Earl of Balfour recalls the text at the beginning of his despatch.As Your Excellency is aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government on the occasion of coercive measures being taken by France against Germany on 6th April, 1920, and in instructions addressed to their Ambassador in Paris on the 8th April expressed the opinion that &quot;in no circumstances&quot; shall one of the Allies take action
action &quot;in questions so important&quot; without the other Allies &quot;being informed and giving their consent.To this conniunication Monsieur Millerand had replied on the 9th April by a note in which after having clearly explained the action of the French government and their attitude vis a vis all the Allies, he declared that &quot;in all interallied questions&quot; which are raised &quot;by the execution of the treaty the French government envisaged no case in which they would not be happy to assure -themselves of the assent of their allies before taking action-.On the 10th April, the British government replied in terms which could only be explained by some misunderstanding that they noted with satis-faction the declaration by which the French government did not envisage &quot;any circumstance&quot; in the future in which they would not be happy to assure themselves of the assent of the allies.On the 11th April the President of the Council byfa note which finished this discussion took care to repeat in the same terms as those of his former declaration: &quot;in all interallied questions&quot; raised by the execution of the treaty the French government only contemplate acting in agreement with their allies, letting it be understood in consequence that she retained full liberty of action for the defence of French interests in all other questions that could arise out of the execution of the treaty of peace.The
The British Government now maintains that not only &quot;in interallied questions&quot; the French government could not act individually but also that &quot;in no circumstances&quot; ,they. can without the assent of their allies provide for the defence of the rights which the treaty of peace assures to France.Your Excellency will doubtless recognise, I hope, in referring to the different notes which I have just recalled, that the clear meaning of the undertaking given by the French government is not that which is attributed to it by His Majesty5 s Government, and that the contradiction mentioned in the 13th paragraph of the Earl of Balfour&apos;s despatch cannot be laid at the door of the French government,   I may add that in any case the French government has never been able or willing to renounce the rights which she expressly holds under the treaty in virtue of paragraphs 17 and 18 of annex 2 to part 80   Furthermore, it is with regret that I have noted in this despatch the re-petition of the old argument according to which the coercive measure of April 6th, 1920, against Germany was taken by France &quot;without the knowledge of her allies&quot;.As Monsieur Millerand recalled in his answer of April 9th, 1920, to Lord Derby referred to above, this allegation could not be sustained since on April 3rd, 1920, the French President of the Council had communicated to the British Ambassador and to the other allied Ambassadors in Paris the actual text of the telegram which he had just sent to the French Ambassador in London relative to the measures above-mentioned - a telegram which concluded as follows:-&quot;I
&quot;I have no doubt that the British Government appreciate as I do the necessity for an immediate penalty and are disposed to lend their effective assistance to the government of the Republic, Marshal Foch is studying the military measures which now can no longer be avoided or deferred.&quot;Further, the Eritish Government, in stating that it was in disagreement with the juridical consider-ations which I had explained in my note of May 19th to the Eritish Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires, did not bring forward any argument which contested the value of those considerationsoIn these circumstances, I feel sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able, after further examination, to recognise that the opinion which I had the honour to explain to them is well founded end thus to put an end to a divergence of views which cannot but be prejudicial to the good understanding which the Cabinet in Paris as well as the Cabinet in London are justly anxious to maintain.I em etcu,(Signed)   R. Poincare.
