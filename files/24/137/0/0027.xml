2 0 4&apos;!&quot;(this document is THIS property of his britannic majesty&apos;S government). oohfipektial. copy No.     &amp;n.p. frtfO cabihst.ischool teachers (superannuation) bill.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education on points which will arise in Committee,1, Assuming that the general principle of the Bill is approved, and that it receives a Second Reading, criticism will inevitably arise in Committee on the equity of its provisions as affecting not merely the whole body of teachers but particular classes of teachers or even individual teachers;   and though the temper of the House may now be leas sympathetic to the teachers, the Government may-encounter considerable difficulties and have to make concessions.2. Objection will certainly be taken on three points: (i) that the contribution of five per cent isaltogether excessive in relation to the benefitsreceivable; and(il) [a point already raised by Mrs. Wintringham]that there are a large number of teachers whose salarieshave not improved since 1918 to such an extent, as to constitute a change in conditions existing or contemplatedwhen the Act of 1918 was passed;(iii) that contributions returned should have interestadded to them.3.   As regards the first point, the Government Aotuaryra Report of 12 May is of prime importance and i am apprehensive as to the effect which it will have in the House,   In paragraph 10 he gives the cost of the benefit rights conferred by the Act of 1918 on teachers in elementary aohools, age 21 and 25, at the following percentages of the future salary:-
-    205(i) If withdrawals are taken into account, and are assumed to be the same in the future as in the pastCertificated Unce rtifloat ed Men.             Women. Women,age 21 ..     771 6.8 575age 25 8.4 8,1 6.9(ii)If withdrawals are not taken Into accountage 21 7.8 6,5 7,7age 25 8,6 9.7 9.2He does not give any general average for teachers aged 21 or 25.The ordinary age Of entry for unoertifloated women is under 21, and is between 21 and 25 for all Certificated-teachers.The report rests on the assumptions of the teachers * con-trlbutions being accumulated for an indefinite period at four per cent, compound interest (free of income tax), and being relieved of all charges for management, and of the Burnham Scales being univer-sally adopted and those or other scales(with similar gradients and not widely different figures) being permanently retained, and if the Government rely on this Report, then it is impossible for them to value so highly as 10 per cent, the pension benefits which the Act confers either upon future teachers, or upon existing teachers whose age does not exceed 25.It will undoubtedly be argued on Sir A. Watson*s figures that the effect of a flat 5 per cent, contribution is that among teacherswhose present age does not exceed 25,(1) If withdrawals are taken into account, the Certificatedwomen will be paying for the men, and the Uncertificatedwomen will be paying for the men and also for the Certificated women.(2) If withdrawals are left out of aocount, the men and the Uncertificated women will be paying for the Certificated women.4, The Government Aotuary, it is true, points out that, even with the proposed contribution of five per cent,, &quot;a substantial &quot;burden will remain with the State in respect of its obligations &quot;under the Superannuation Acts&quot;.   This is obviously true taking the pension scheme as a whole, and has great foroe against the older teachers,    the accrued liabilities in respect of whose back service constitute a very heavy burden indeed. But it affords no answer to the young teachers, who will say that, as regards them,   the burden on the State is
very alight, and that if the element of withdrawals is admitted into the calculations it is negligible. ^The younger teachers will in fact argue that they are being asked to pay for the benefits given under the Act of 1.V 19^8 to the cider teachers, and it will no doubt be alleged on behalf of some of the younger teachers that they were attracted into the service by the benefits conferred by the Act of I9I8. 5J7en on the basis of a temporary levy (and I assume that the operation of the Act will be limited to two years) they will argue that it is very unfair to abstract from their relatively small salaries (a considerable number of them being at the minimum or at a point low down on the Burnham Standard Scales) an amount of cash which they nun ill afford, in order that the older teachers, who are receiving larger salaries. may get off with no more than 5 per cent, contribution,,5.   In contributory pension schemes, the cost of which is shared between employer and employee, I imagine it would be rare to find cases in which the employee is called upon to contribute more than half the cost.    I believe there are a considerable number of cases in which the employee and employer in the first instance contribute 5 per cent, and the employer makes up the deficit, if any.    This is the principle of the &quot;Local Government and Other Officers Superannuation&quot; Bill.    It is of course conceivable that in the case of teachers the Departmental Committee might recommend a scheme which shared the cost equally between the three parties - the Teachers, the Local Education Authorities and the Board; but I think it is far more probable that if they report in favour of a contributory scheme they would recommend that the cost should be shared equally between the State on the one hand and the Teachers , or the&quot; Teachers and the Local Education Authorities together, on the other.    However this may be I think it would be very difficult for the Government to argue as a matter of principle or on the merits of this case, that the contributions of any class of teacher should be at a rate representing more than half the.cost of the benefits.
Of course those who espouse the teachers&apos; interests wouldbe very foolish if they did not look forward to the permanentestablishment of the pension system on a contributory basis inthe result of the inquiry of the Departmental Committee.    Theywill probably argue that the equities of a permanezit system demand that no teacher shall have to pay more than half the cost of thebenefits: and if in the permanent scheme that principle is recognised, then the younger tea.chers will for two years have made an excessive contribution.    The Government Actuary gives no &quot;throughrate&quot; for all classes of teachers taken together at age 21, 25 etc.,and his analysis of the rates of benefit for different sexes andgrades of teachers affords material of which the teachers are sureto take advantage.6.   To meet this line of argument the Government might either(a) give a conditional pledge, either in the Bill or otherwise,that if a permanent contributory system is established by a furtherAct excess contributions under the provisional levy should betaken into account and. an equitable adjustment made in relation tothe contributions required under the permanent system.    A demandfor such a concession could not, I think, be refused on principle,itnough it would I imagine not.be easy to give practical and admini-strative effect to it; and if at the end of 2 years no further Act is passed by Parliament the right of adjustment would be. ineffective, and it would be difficult to say what course could be taken to meet the claims or expectations of the Teachers in this respect, or (b) the Government might offer, if the teachers prefer it, to substitute a scheme of contributions graded to some extent, for a flat rate contribution of 5 VGr cent,7.       If it be supposed that Government desired to adopt the second alternative, viz. to vary the percentage rates of con-tribution so that no one should pay more than one-half of the Government Actuary^ estimate of the cost of his benefits (with-withdrawals being disregarded), then these conditions would be satisfied by contributions at the following rates:-

209...... 8... ,    The administrative complication? of a graded contri-bution on the lino? of Table A., differentiating between sex, age, and date of entry, would be very great, and if such differentiation were attempted it is possible that plausible claims for further differentiation would be urged.    Local Education Authorities would certainly protest loudly against the labour imposed upon them in making deductions from salary on such a basis.    If this alternative is to be considered or offered it must I think take quite a simple form such as that suggested in Table 3.    Even this is open to several objections r (i)   It-might prejudice the work of the Departmental Gomi &apos; raiii.ee by suggesting that for entrants into the teaching pro-fession the proper rate corresponding to the benefits is only 3 per cent.    (If all future entrants paid only at the rate of 3 per cent, the contributions would ultimately realize only  1,560,000 instead of  2,600,000.),   It might also prejudice -, the endeavours of other Departments (e.g. the Home Office) to obtain contributions at a higher rate, from other classes. It is indeed in conflict with the recommendations of the. Standing Committee on.the &quot;Local. Government and other Officers Superannuation Bill&quot; ,in which thebasis,of a .5 per cent, contribution has been adopted, ... In offering this alternative it would be necessary to. make it very clear that the arrangement would.be. &quot;only, a pro-visional one and would, in no. way be allowed to affect any arrange-moats, which the Government, my desire to make in the result of the Report of the. Departmental Committoo, ,;..... (ii) It will also of course be. objected to by, the olderteachers, ; . The pensionable teachers over the ago of 35 are abouti half the total number of such teachers, and the toachox*s over 30 are about two-thirds of the total.    It would bo,very difficult to force a 6 per cent, contribution on the older teachers unless the representatives of the Teachers accepted this alternative as preferable to. a flat 5 per cent.
210(iii) It is also open to the objection that it raises a larger sum than the  2:,30CjC0C inserted in the Estimates as the yield of the 5 per cent, flat ratec     The difference of  93,00.0 might be reduced by varying the percentage rate,  though if a loss is to be avoided in the second year it is necessary that a rather larger s&amp;an should be raised in the first year-9.     A variant, and possibly a preferable variant,  of a system of graded contributions oh the basis cf Table B., would be to exempt t; e younger teachers (say teachers under 26) from contributions altogetherfor tae two years cf the levy, making up any loss, if necessary, by an adjustment of the contributions levied from teachers over the age of 25..    This variant has the advantage of exempting from contribution those teachers who claim that&apos; they were attracted into the profession by the prospects cf a non-contributory pension scheme.     It also has the advantage cf relieving the teachers at a time when their salaries are relatively small.     It would of course be very necessary to state explicitly that this concession must be taken as entirely without prejudice to any permanent system which may.be established in the result of the recommendations-cf the Departmental Committee.     we cannot eontemplate either a system under which future entrants should pay no contributions, or a system under which a particular generation of existing teachers should be relieved in perpetuity from contributions.On the whole I suggest that the Government should, adopt the first alternative suggested.in paragraph 6 (though it has obvious disadvantages) and should hold either form of the second alternative in reserve to offer the teachers if they Prefer it.
,   AO rOipu^dir-th^Hj^e^^^ which- Kr^Wlirtrrdn^ha^&quot;wiilIce, that there are still large numbers of teachers who are paid at Latively low rates of salary, - it is the faot that on 31 March 21, 14,000 pensionable Elementary Teachers were still being paid the Provisional Minimum Soale, to which, under the original agrce-it, L,E;As. were allowed ta adhere for a period which in most areas ires in Ootober 1922.   Apart fr&amp;m these teachers there are als? ;ween 2,000 and 3,000 teachers who are being paid on scales above ! Provisional Minimum Soale but below the Burnham Soale allocated the area.    This last olass may perhaps be left out of considera^ in;   but the question remains whether as regards the teachers who i still paid on the Provisional Minimum Scale there has been so ck and so great a change in the conditions of service since the erannuation Act of 1918 was passed, as to justify a reconsider a-o of their position.    The Teachers in question include both tifioated and Uncertifloated Teachers, and it is undoubtedly true t under the Burnham Reports the unoertifioated Teachers, though ir position is improved, came off rather badly as compared with the tificated Teachers. *The general answer to this argument is that even the provisional imurn Scale, which dated in most cases from 1 January 1920, resented a very considerable advance on the pre-War salaries and pre-1919 salaries in the great majority of areas.TE:- The scale for men unoortificated teachers, of whom there are Psome 2,600, ranges from a commencing salary of  100-- 120 to a minimun salary of  180- 255 for teachers with more than 8 years&apos; ser-e and  150- 200 for teachers with less than 8 years&apos; service. The Le for women uncertificated teaehers,of whom there are about 33,000, ?es from a minimum of  90- 112 (according to the scale of the par-ilar area) to a maximum of  150- 204 for teachers of more than 8 re&apos; service and  140- 170 for teaohers of less than 8 years&apos; service, m area where teachers are being paid on the Provisional Minimum la the Uncertif icated woman1 s salary oommences at  90 and rises by fements of  6 to a maximum of  140 or  150. In areas where teachers being paid on Scale I or II the women Unoertif icated Teachers&apos; iry rises from a minimum of  96 by  7.10s. to  150 or  164, In these is where the teachers are near the bottom of their scale there is i^doubt that a deduction from their salaries of a shilling in the   i be severely felt,-ogards Certificated Teachers in the areas where the Provisional LiJium Scale is paid, the salaries run (for men) frcm  160 by  10 to ), and (women) from  150 by  10 to  240,     These are the salaries teachers who have received two years&apos; training in a Training ege. For untrained Teachers the Commencing salary is  150 for men * 140 for women.

21On these figures it appears&apos;to &quot;be difficult, if not impossible, to hold that the teachers in the 39 areas where the P.M.S. is still in force have failed to share substantially in the improvement of salaries which has taken place since the Teachers Superannuation Act was passed.It is remarkable that the average salary in those 39 areas for 1921-22 ( 206) is higher than in the Scale I areas ( 201).12. If any concession has to be made, the only thing Ican think of ..(though I do not now recommend it)   is that no deduction from a teacher&apos;s salary in respect of the levy should be made which would bring the teacher&apos;s salary below the salary properly receivable under the Provisional Kinimum Scale or below the minimum salary of that scale *    If this concession involves a loss to the Exchequer on the total amount of the levy it is difficult to suggest that the loss should be made good, by an increase of the rate of contribution for the older or more highly paid teachers *    The London teacher Would naturally ask why he should pay a higher pension contribution because Cornwall pays meagre salaries to its teachers.It is tempting in some ways to make the Local Education Authorities pay the contribution in the Provisional Kinimum Scale areas, but this would be highly controversial.    It must also be recognised that by giving relief to the teachers we should be putting a premium on retention of the Provisional Minimum Scale, and some Authorities might even lower their salaries oo as to -divert the relief into their own pockets - this we could I hope defeat.13. As regards the third point,-the question whether ccn-tributions should be returned in certain circumstances with interest or compound interest - the Government Actuary point out in paragraph 13 of his Report, that the value of the insurance
21which the teacher hag enjoyed during his tern of service against the current risk of death or disablement is substantial and is not met by the interest on the teacher&apos;s accumulated contributions.   He advises therefore that in the circumstances the fact that the contributions, are returned without interest involves no elsment of forfeiture so far aa the teacher isconcerned.    It i3 true that In the Local Government and Other Officers Superannuation Bill, as it left the Standing Committee, provision is made for return of contributions with compound interest at 3 per cent, by half-year rests.   In certain cases contributions are to be returned without interest only in the event of an officer or employee resigning his offices- or emplcy-ment,  or being dismissed for incapacity before he has become entitled to a superannuation allowance.14. There still remains a further difficulty.   We are advised that teachers will not be able to claim exemption from income tax on the contributions levied raider the Bill.   It is unlikely that this point will not be raiued in the course of debate, and it is necessary that the Government should be prepared with an answer.   To the.teacher and the ordinary man it wouldseem highly inequitable that a statutory deduction from his salary should be levied and that he should have to pay income tax on the amount of this deduction where analogous insurance premiums are exempt.   Presumably this grievance cannot be remedied by this Bill, but it must certainly not be lost sight of.H.A.L. FISHER. 9 June 1922 *
