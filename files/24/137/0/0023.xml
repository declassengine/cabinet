118(This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Ma.1esty&apos;e Government.)S 3 0 R 3 I Cony KTo. C.P. 4023. C A B I N 2 T,AIRSHIPS. Commander Burney&apos;s SchemeiMemorandum by the Chancellor of the TSxohequer..In view of the Air Council&apos;e aseurances that subject to certain modifications the scheme is capable of producing flying results I feel that I ought not to take the responsibility of either rejecting or accepting the scheme without ascertaining the views of the Cabinet,Sven if the view be accepted that the soheme is practicable, i.e., that it will be possible to maintain a regular and reasonably safe service   of Airships flying from Great Britain to Egypt, India and Australia, the finance presents difficulties of an exceedingly eerioue if not insuperable nature.The financial proposals of the Bumoy Soheme are summar-ised by the Air Ministry ae follows&quot;Commander Bumey^s Airship Soheme *      Financial Resume iiCapital.Commander Burney proposes to form a Company with capital as follows
119 2j 200,000 debentures carrying 4h% interesttax free. 1,000,000 shares carrying 6% interest taxfree.It is proposed only to issue  1.200,000 shares at present;   the balance of  600,000 to be reserved until the Company is successful but an option to be taken on them by promoting tors.The amount issued is calculated to cover all capital requirements of the full scheme;   It is not anticipated, however, that more than half the capital will be expended in the first two years.This scheme is bucked by the shell company and Messrs.Vickers.Financial Assistance required.The Government is asked to grant:(1)   a guarantee of interest on thedebentures until redemption and of the sum necessary to redeem them after 10 years.(2) a guarantee of interest for 10 years on the shares:(3) free transfer of all airships and airship material;(4) free transfer of the bases at Cardington and Pulham.In the event of success the Company undertake to float new debentures at the end of 10 years and buy out the guaranteed debentures, thus relieving the Government of the liability for further interest and for redemption.   The Company Jdeo undertake to provide  25,000 per
120annum after redeeming the debentures to repay Government advances.Commander Burney proposes that Australia and India Bhould each guarantee  40^000 per annum, towards the liability under (1) and (2) and is confi-dent that Mr. Hughes will be able to induoe Australia to do its share and even to cover any deficienoy from India in the initial stage.3e.legitimate of financial liabilities, under the Scheme.The tax free arrangement appears impraoti-cable and it is necessary to substitute higher ratesof interest liable to tax.     Assuming income tax at/- in the   the liability works out as follows:-(l) guarantee of interest cn  2,200,000 debentures at 4\% tax free or 5 &amp; 5/8$  132,500  123,750 per annum.(2) guarantee of redemption ofdebentures  2.200,000(3) guarantee of interest on 6% &apos;  1,200,000 shares at 6% 96,000 tax free or 7^   90,000 per annum.The Government is thus asked to provide  228,000        for 10 years a sum of  213,750 annually to meot interest charges.   Towards this a contribution of  80,000 par annum may possibly be received from Australia and India.- 3 -lote.The Air Ministry resume&apos; is based on a 4/- Income Tax.     I have substituted marginally figures on the assumption of a 5/- Income Tax.
121In the event of failure the lose to&quot;be met would be:-1,320 Debenture interest for 10 years  1,237,5002,200 Redemption of debentures 2,200\000960 Share interest for 10 years &apos;900,000 4,480  4,337,500If on the other hand at the end of10 years the Company is completely successfulthe Governments concerned might have paid out  2,280,000Redemption on a anything up to  2,137,500 and the redemption of non-interestbearing basis. this sum at the rate of  25,000 per annum would91. take 85 years .Possibility of reducing commitments..Commander Bumey has been pressed(1) to reduce rate of interest;(2) to reduce the length of guarantee;(3) to reduce the amount of capital Immediately issuable,but contends that he could not get the money subscribed on any less favourable terms.&quot;In the first place I feel the most profound objection to the Government taking an interest whether by way of guaran-teeming Debentures or Share interest or by Subscription of Shares in any Company working for profit.     Experience shows that our ventures in this respect have been almost uniformly unsucoees-ful.   It stands to reason that this must be so.     The private undertaker would never invite Government assistance in the pro-vieion of funds if he could obtain money from the public.
122The investor is never backward in subscribing money even to speculative ventures if there is a reasonable chance of profit, he Government therefore is never invited to intervene except vr;ere the chances of success are so remote as to render it impossible to raise funds in the market.      When the Government has subscribed jointly with the public, it finds itself confronted . with fresh problems .      If the undertaking gets into difficultiae, the public complain that they ware misled by &quot;Hie fact of Government taking an interecrt in it into investing their own money.   This has lately been urged at the meetings of the British Cellulose Company notwithstanding that in that case the Government merely forowent their mortgage rights on money advanced for War purposes and accepted Preference Shares in lieu.     And if the undertaking requires more capital, the Government cannot net as a private capitalist would.     Parliament     rightly controls the expenditure of public funds and any fresh subscription requires Par3iamentary assent with explanations in Parliament and disclosure of facts which from a commercial point of view should be withheld.If emoluments undertaking succeeds, Government is confronted with other difficulties.   Rival undertakings complain that the bottomless purse of the taxpayer is used to finance competition  to their detriment.   Sometimes as in the case of&quot;the Anglo-Persian Oil Company international difficulties are involved by the fact of the Government being ah investor.   An expanding concern requires fresh capital and this involves Government in the dilemma, of either making; further investments in a Company which can look after itBelf or of saerifiolng the opportunities of which a private capitalist would avail himself.     It is significant that the Labour Party appear to approve a policy of Governmentinvee tment
123investment.     But it is fair to say that successful investments are exceedingly rare.   The Suez Canal investment is of course the historic instance.   But in that case the great bulk of the British holding was not purchased until after the Canal was opened,     nor was ihe undertaking a trading Company of the usual kind in competition with rivals. The other exoeption is the Anglo Persian Oil dompariy. Our other investments (i.e. British Dyes, Anglo-Italian Corporation, Home Grflwn Sugar Limited, Flax Cultivation Limited, British America Nickel Corporation etc.) into which in the special circumstances of the War and its consequences we have been drawn show a melancholy record of loss.PerhapB it is stretching analogy too far to say that Government as Trustee for the taxpayer ought not to invest the public money in Ooncerns more speculative that those in which the private Trustee iB entitled to invest those of his certai que trust.     Still, it must be recognised that an undertaking which has reasonable prospects of success does not require Government assistance in the provision of capital;   and those that have no reasonable prospects of success ought not to be assisted at all.The above objections of principle apply both to the investment of public money in such a Company as is proposed, and to the proposal actually before us to guarantee the Debenture, Debenture interest and shares.     It is clear that the second proposal 1b in fact less favourable in some ways than a direct investment.     We can borrow more cheaply than at 5&quot;i %, let alone 7^.     Both forms of assistance would require statutory sanction.
124They do not apply with quite so much force to a drnect subsidy.   A mail subsidy which is only a payment for valuereceived the Company would no doubt earn once it had establishedits power to carry mails to the satisfaction of the Post Office.A direct subsidy without consideration is unsatisfactory.   Such a subsidy is in fact given to the civil aviation companies whichmaintain a cross Channel service, but it was really rendered necessary by the fact that the French Government were subsidizingtheir cross Channel service with the result that the british companies were unable to compete with them.The least objectionable form of assistance seems tome however to be a terminable direct subsidy, and if the indirect advantages to the country of accelerating an airshipscheme were very great I should prefer that method to anyother.   I need not dwell on the objections to any increase in national Expenditure at the present time, but from the civilianpoint of view I remain unconvinced that until \irships can pay their way - when they will come without Government assistance -the advantages outweigh the cost of the subsidy.     summarising the whole matter while I appreciate the reluctance of the AlarMinistry to give up the prospect of a new Air Service for commercial purposes, I do not think we can at the present tim,eadventure upon plans of a speculative character which involve;additional National Expenditure.(Initialled)   R.S.H.TREASURY CHAMBERS.
