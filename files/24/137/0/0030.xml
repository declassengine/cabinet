[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s (government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1922.SECRET.CP. 4030.CABINET.SPECIAL   REPORT   ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.1NT0. 68.    WEEK ENDED  JUNE 9, 1922.THE  SITUATION.The continuance of the dispute in the engineering industry has exercised a marked effect on workers in that industry and those allied thereto. Firms who have received orders are unable to execute them owing to the dispute. Shipbuilding and coal-mining are particularly affected by this disturbing factor.In the coal-mining industry, unemployment in the Bristol, Somerset and Forest of Dean coal-fields is acute. In the Midlands Division the tendency is towards serious depression, while in the North-Western Division the adoption of short-time working is becoming more general. In Scotland, the expected revival in this industry has not materialised; but, while some slight improvement has been recorded in isolated areas in Wales, the general depression continues.The improvement in the iron and steel industry has been maintained in the Midlands, but in Scotland and Wales trade is quiet and prospects of recovery are not bright.In the South-Eastern Division, the revival in the clothing industry has been maintained, but there is still a shortage of machinists and dressmakers. In the South-Western Division the improvements previously recorded in the lace and glove trades continue. In the Midlands Division a slight improvement in the plain net section of the lace industry has occurred.The improvement recorded in the cotton industry has been, maintained. Favourable reports on the position in the hosiery and woollen industries have been received from the Midlands and Scotland Divisions.Although serious unemployment in the boot and shoe trade continues at Bristol, some signs of improvement have been reported from Kingswood.In most Divisions the building trade is quiet, although a fair amount of seasonal decorative and repair work continues.Unemployment in the paper and printing industries in the South-Western Division continues to be acute. In the South-Eastern Division a revival in cabinet-making has been observed.Some activity is reported at the larger docks in the South-Western Division. In Scotland, although home fishing has commenced, operations are still below normal. The revival recently recorded in the jute industry is apparently due to speculative business and may not, therefore, be permanent.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour.
NOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON JUNE 9, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 7-8 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 6 0 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year. : \The figures for 1921 were: To the end of 	Per centJanuary ...    &apos;     ...	6-9February	8-5March     ...         ...	100April	17-6May       ...         ...         ...	22-2June	231July	16-7August	16-3September	14-8October   ...         ...         ...	15-6November	159December	16-5The figures for 1922 are: 	To the end of-	January  ...	16-8February	16-3March    ...         ...	........      16-3April	17 0May	16 note. In some items in the Report the figures given relate to Great Britain and Ireland, in others to Great Britain only. In each instance the scope of the figures shown is clearly stated. Where figures relate to works financed partially by the Government, or to other expenditure from Government funds, they have in all cases been given for the area (Great Britain only, or Great Britain and Ireland together, as the case may be), the expenditure in respect of which is met by tht British Government.

I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT. [From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.. An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to June 2, 1922. (Figures for Northern and Southern Ireland are included up to the 31st December,&apos; 1921, and the 1st April, 1922, respectively.)Unemployment benefit and dependants&apos; benefit paid      84,304,000Contributions from Employers        ....... ... ...      19,517,000Employed persons ... ... ...      17,842,000State       .......... ... ...      11,432,080State (in respect of benefit for ex-regularsailors, soldiers and airmen)   ... ...        1,716,00050,507,080Balance of benefit paid over contributions (pro-vided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions) and advances by the Treasury amounting to  15,400,000 ...      33,796,920(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 115,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).
