UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS- BRITANBLGREPORT BY THE GENERAL- OFPICEF CHIEF OH THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR ENDING 1ST JULY, 1922.-(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War)SOUTHERN IRELAND.&apos; DUBLIN  ,Encouraged by the results of the elections in v/hich the&apos; people of Southern Ireland uraiistakably showed, their approval of the Treaty, and their distrust of the Collins-De Valera pact, the Provisional Government decided early in the&quot;week to stand no further nonsense from the Executive -Republican forces.-     That Mr, Collins cleverly agreed to the pact in order to get a fairly open election and then to find some excuse to declare the agreement null and void on gaining a large pro-treaty majority, ipossiblej but the action of the Pour Courts Executive on June 24th and June 27th certainly gave him the opportunity to break definitely with his political and military opponents.The events which led up to the attack by Free State troops on the Four Courts and Fowler&apos; Memorial Hall early on the 2Sth June are given in an official statement which was published by the Provisional Government on that same day,Oh Saturdayt June 24th; under the pretext that the money was required to carry out the Belfast Boycott, Certain sums were demanded from two-Dublin firms by the Pour   Courts Executivej     The money nag to be paid on Tuesday, June 27th, and on the morning of that date armed raiders from the Pour   Courts arrived at the motor garage of Me s sra * Ferguson in Baggot Street,     The Provisional &quot;Government got warning of the proposed raid) and Free ^tate troops arrived in time to surround the, premises whilst the raiders were insideg and to arrest their leader - Comriandant Leo lender son,   That same evening as a reprisal for the arrest of Henderson, the republicans seizedLAent^General J.T. 0&apos;Conriell. Assistant Chief of Staff) Provisional Government troops, whilst walking in the streets of Dublin^ and took him as a hostage to the Pour Courts.This open flouting of their authority was too much for the Provisional Government) and in the early hours.of Wednesdayf June 2Bth) the Pour&apos;  Courts) the Fowler memorial Hall arid.some.other buildings in Dublin, occupied by Rory 0&apos;Connor&apos;s and Llara -Mellowes1 s followers, v:ere surrounded by armed Free State troops and the surrender of their   : garrisons demanded,.. The time limit given t&apos;o the republican,&apos; garrison at the Four .Courts expired without any signs pf surrender, and at about 4 &apos;a.-m, the attack on these buildings began-with the firing of the first round from one of the four 18 pr, field guns handed over by the British Military forces to the FreeStaters on loan./No
Ho progress was made during the 28th June by the attackers, and though breaches were made by the guns inthesouthern walls of the building the young and inexperienced Free State troops are reported to have been much discouraged at the lack of early success,     The political leaders undoubtedly expected the effect of field guns to be greater and more instantaneous, :Better progress was made at the Fowler Memorial Hall in Rutland Square, where the rebel garrison evacuated the building in the afternoon after the place had caught fire.Fron this date inclusive no passenger trains have been allowed into Dublin except from Kingstown;, and outgoing trains have gradually been reduced, according as reports have arrived of bridges and the permanent way being destroyed by rebels in the Country districts South and West of the oapital.On the 29th June the attack On the Four Courts was renewed with field guns, machine gun and rifle fire, and at dusk assaults by infantry begano     By.midnight the&apos; Provisional Government troops had occupied the greater part of the main building including the Central Hall and Library, Thirty-three prisoners were taken..In these attacks five Free State officers were wounded, and of other ranks three were killed and ten wounded,Major Generals Dalton and Ennis wore in command of these operations.But though   the attack on the Four   Courts was pro- , progressing, affairs were not going too well in other parts of the city.     During the day the republicans commenced to occupy additional buildings in the heart of the town on both banks of the Liffey and ambushes were successfully laid for-Free State patrols both on foot and in lorries and armoured cars.     On this and on the previous day the civilian popu-lation, who would insist on watching the proceedings, suffered a considerable number of casualties, and more than 60 innocent persons were killed and wounded-.About 11-30 a.m. on June 30th fire broke out in one of the wings of the Four &apos; Courts and at 12-30 p.m. a large mine was exploded by the garrison under the Central Hall, Thirty of the Free Staters were injured by this explosion.At 4 p,m. the remains of the garrison, numbering 140, surr ended, headed by Rory 0&apos;Connor, Li am hell owes and Ernest 0&apos;aalley.     The prisoners were later removed to Mount joy Prison; but, on the way, Ernest 0&apos;iialley escaped and Is still at large, engaged in the fighting in Sackville Street,General 0&apos;Connell was released unhurt.It is understood that the rebel garrison of the Four Courts had very few casualtiesA considerable quantity of arms and ammunition was&apos; taken from the rebels, and in the yards of the building were found the damaged remains of more than 20 looted motor cars and of one Rolls Royce armoured car.Since the surrender the Four   Courts have been completely gutted by fire and all the valuable records and documents of centuries have been destroyed./It
I563It is believed that the total strengths of. the. opposing forces in Dublin on Jane..30th were, about 2,500 Free Staters and under 1,000 Kepublican35 but as the majority of t3ae Provisional.-:5oyermhent troops were reap. 1 rod for the attack on the Pour Courts, and for blocking the various approaches Into Dublin, several hundred armed rebels were still at large in the city .011 the -evening of this.day. ; These last profited by. the&apos;exhaustion of -their, opponents.&apos;. ... /&apos;&apos;&quot;&apos; to Seize more buildings In the town during the night of June 30th/July 1st, and by . the morning of:--July,-1st...wore -,. than. 50-buildings, Including several:hotels, in Upper $ack-?.&quot;&apos;&apos; villo Street, were occupied by.republicans, ; -Foodstuffs .&apos;&apos;&apos;; .... have been&apos; commandeered, street barricades of cars and&apos;, vehicles erected,- and road mines.: prepared.-&apos;    The republicans &quot; .  .    concentrated chiefly in the area round Rutland Square&quot;and&apos;&apos; -- ---&apos;.-Sackville Street north-of the&apos; Li f fey j. but :.about .--I5: houses., (including the&apos;United Service Club and.Royal Automobile &apos; Club, in Stephen&apos;s Green) wore garrisoned- in- the central:     &quot;&quot;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; part of &quot;the term south of the river. &apos; ,- :&quot; .; .      -On the night of June 30/July 1st some 50 armed rebels surrendered in the Capel Street area.y 2nd.

ULSTER.On the whole the situation in Belfast, and., the Six Comities, arid Border has been remarkably peaceful during the past week,     The &quot;pacification&quot; of&apos;County. Donegal will, lessen considerably the danger of possible trouble on the&apos; Derry-Belloek portion of the border.The new Belleek-Pettigde-Kesh-Garrison neutral zone arrangement has not yet come into force as the.representative of tho. Provisional Government has not ro-r.ppcared, since tho mooting of Juno 24th at Kosh, to take his part in carrying out the provisidno of tho agreement.     The Chairman of the -. Provisional Government was convnunicated with on 3rd instant regarding this omission.THE ROLE OF THE BRITISH TROOPS IE AED HEAR DUBLIN.-Mr. Collins having declined tho offer of tho assistance of British troops, the only help given to the Free State forces has been in materiel.     In addition to tho four 18pr field guns, two Rolls Royce armoured cars were handed over on the 27th June and early on July 2nd an additional 3 Rolls Royce armoured cars were.transferred. A considerable quantity of arms and ammunition has also been handed over, and-the amounts have only been limited by the necessity of not reducing our own means of protection below the reasonable safe minimum.&apos;-As; soon as the fighting began on the. 28th June, all: officers and men were confined to the &quot;military area&quot; in and near Phoenix Park, and those who were sleeping outside this area were brought in.It was, hov/ever, impossible to stop all movement of men on such duties&apos;as unloading at Forth Hall or proceeding to and from England between the military area (and Collinntown R.A .F. station), and Kingstown Pier.Arrangements have been made for organised convoys between these places, and protection for. personnel has been; afforded by armoured cars mid armoured lorries.In spite of this many cases occurred of our troops being fired at and bombed by the rebels whilst passing  . through the streets -of Dublin and in all nine other ranks have been wounded, of whom one (a driver of the R.A.F.) has since died;     In one case prompt retaliation was taken by one of our Lewis.Gun teams and three rebel snipers were seen to -fall from a window    into the street, &quot;   . &apos;COHCLUSIOES.On the whole,...considering their lack of. good officers,, of discipline, training, experience&apos;and,suitable weapons, the Provisional Government has made good progress in-rounding up its opponents in Dublin.  . If it continues its efforts, with determination, it should very soon be in a position to concentrate its forces against the rebels in the south.
Up to tho capture of the Four Courts neither side appeared to ha.ye much desire to hurt the other.; but the damage done to -the attackers by- the rebel mines In the Four Courts and the explosion .of other nines in the streets of Dublin since that date have put a little more &quot;hate&quot; into the proceedings on the part of the Provisional Goversament troops,.The local newspapers are full of -the most wonderful exaggerati ons.The &quot;terrific firing&quot; and the -&quot;desperate fighting&quot; are born in the imaginations of the -correspondents,     The Irish-people like &quot;sob-stuff&quot;.     The -&quot;hail of bullets&quot; is more likely due to the bad firing discipline of the young Free State soldiers,     The. British Government will be sure to supply more ammunition!(Signed)C.F.N.
