June 1922.     &apos; f/W^C &quot;k^^-v^f, l^^vHSCHEME FOR REFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1. A CABINET Committee was appointed early in 1921 to prepare a scheme for the above object.&apos; Two of its members, Lord Balfour and the then Attorney-General (now Lord Chief Justice) were prevented by other duties from attending. The remaining members, namely, the Lord Chancellor, Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Churchill, Mr. Fisher, and myself (as Chairman), met on several occasions between the months of October and December last, when we explored every aspect of the question and examined the various proposals that had been submitted in recent times.2. We had not had time to draw up a final Report, when the Cannes Conference, the Irish Conferences, and finally the Parliamentary Session supervened. Further, although we had reached a large measure of agreement, more time would undoubtedly have been required to draw up either a single Keport, or a number of separate Reports.On the 1st February we made an oral report of our Proceedings to the Prime Minister.3. The decision having been reached and announced in Parliament that it would be desirable to proceed by way of Resolutions, introduced in the House of Lords, rather than by Bill, I undertook on that occasion to draw up a number of draft Resolutions, which would be the framework of a scheme, rather than a scheme itself. It was felt that the discussion of such a body of Resolutions would be very helpful in eliciting the attitude of the House of Lords and of public opinion in general towards the promised Reform of the Second Chamber; whilst, whatever the differences of opinion revealed, no discredit would attach to the Government if the Resolutions were either modified or even rejected. On the other hand, the defeat or even the serious amendment of a Government Bill might have an unfortunate effect-- 4. The draft Resolutions which I prepared are printed at the end of this paper ; and it is to these that the attention of the Cabinet is now invited. Should they be approved, a promise has been given in the House of Lords that they shall be submitted to that Chamber either at the end of this month or at the beginning of July. If the date is not fixed too early, I may still be able to introduce them myself. The idea would be to take the Resolutions seriatim, preceded, if it were thought desirable, by a general discussion. This has been the procedure adopted on previous occasions. A week&apos;s debate, very likely less, should suffice to obtain the views and votes of the House of Lords on the matter; and the Government would then be in a position to decide whether to proceed by Bill in another session of Parliament, and, if so, in what form.Nevertheless, as the Resolutions, in their necessarily condensed form, can hardly explain, the processes by which they were arrived at, or the arguments by which they may be supported, it seems desirable that I should preface them by a somewhat full explanation. For the reasons which 1 have already given this is not a formal report of the Cabinet Committee. It is only an explanatory statement submitted by its Chairman, with as much impartiality as he can command.5. The Cabinet will doubtless recognise that no scheme can be drawn up which will be accepted with enthusiasm by all parties, or will even satisfy both sections of a Coalition Government. The extreme wing of the Conservative Party hope to recover for a reformed House of Lords all, and very likely more than all, that it lost in .19!.l Advanced Liberals, on the other hand, while relatively indifferent to the composition - of a Second Chamber, may be reluctant to endow it with airy powers substantially greater than tho^e which were, left to it by the Parliament Act. To both, these parties it may be pointed out that the Parliament Act was always avowed by its authors to be a temporary expedient, susceptible of and indeed demanding reform, and was treated as such by the Bryce Conference ; that the present Coalition Govern-ment, apart from the pledges which it has given, is probably the only Government that could, find an agreed solution for the problem; and that, if we do not 929   [8-483] , b    .
2 .:    r$ j Iff;succeed in finding it, either none will be forthcoming, or a later Government will cut the Gordian knot in its own, and that probably^ a very partisan and perhaps reprehensible, way.Extremists on both sides should make every effort, therefore, to arrive at a reasonable compromise which shall have some chance, not merely of acceptance, but. of durability.G. Approaching our task in this spirit, the Committee found themselves in general agreement on the following points: (a.) That the main questions to be decided were those of (a) Powers and (b) Composition ; and, although neither could be considered independently of - tbe other, the question of Powers was on the whole prior in importance, because upon its decision must to a large extent depend the nature, number, and composition of the body to be entrusted with the powers proposed.(6.) That we should as far as possible base our proposals upon those of the Bryce Conference, both as the latest authority to examine the subject and as the most impartial body, drawn from all political parties, by whom concrete proposals have at any time been made.(c ) That, while attaching far more importance to a respected and influential Second Chamber than to a Chamber constituted on any basis of social position or rank, it is yet eminently desirable, so long as a hereditary Monarchy and a hereditary Peerage exist in this country, that representa-tives of that Peerage should be admitted (though nut as at present by right) to a reformed House of Lords. The extent to which and the methods by which they should be so returned are matters for separate consideration.(d.) At the same time it was the feeling, certainly of the majority of our number, that it is of great importance, in reconstituting the House of Lords, to create a Chamber admission to which shall not rest upon rank or wealth, or political or public service alone, but shall be open to wider classes of the community ; so that the future House may not only have prestige and distinction, but may be responsive to public opinion, and, while not attempting to compete with the popular Chamber, may yet possess a representative character which is, perhaps not always quite fairly, denied to the existing Chamber.7. Acting upon these general principles, we came to the following conclusions on the subject of Powrers : (i.) We were unanimously of opinion that a reconstituted House of -Lords should have no power to initiate a Money Bill, or to amend or reject a Money Bill sent up to it by the House of Commons.(ii.) Feeling, however, as did the Bryce Conference, that the provision of the Parliament Act (sec. one (3) ), which leaves it to the Speaker of the House of Commons to decide what is or is not a Money Bill is an unsatisfactory method of dealing with the subject (it has already given rise to serious criticism on more than one occasion), and that it is certain to lead to greater trouble in the future, we decided to recommend the proposal, made in tbe Bryce Report, to leave the final decision as to what is and what is not a Money Bill in every case to a Joint Standing Committee of the two Houses, specially constituted for the purpose, and to be known as the Finance Joint Committee.(iii.) This Committee would consist of fifteen members, seven from the House of Lords appointed by the Committee of Selection of that House, and eight from the House of Commons, similarly appointed. The latter should include the Speaker, who would be Chairman of the Committee, and have a casting vote, in the event of an equality of voting.(iv.) Every Public Bill which contains provisions of a financial character (it may be necessary to define this somewhat more closely when the Bill is drafted) would stand referred to this Committee before it was read a third time in the House of Commons.(v.) The Joint Committee, acting under general instructions, which it should not be difficult to formulate, would report to both Houses of Parliament which provisions of the Bill referred to it were of a strictly financial nature, to
be dealt with by the House of Commons only, and which, if any, might properly be subject to amendment by the House of Lords. They might divide such a Bill if they thought fit into two Bills, one, which the House of Lords could touch and one which it could not.(vi.) If the Joint Committee found that the provisions of any Bill were designed less for financial purposes than for purposes of general policy, they would report that it was not a Money Bill, and was accordingly open to amendment or rejection by the House of Lords, always provided that such amendment  &apos; did not increase any charge on the people or on the public funds.(vii.) The decision of the Joint Committee would be final, and no amendments, other than verbal amendments, could be made to any Bill in the House of Commons after it had been reported by the Committee.(viii.) As regards the definition of a Money Bill, my colleagues and I, while not approving of the definition of a Money Bill contained in the Parliament Act, decided that we would not attempt to frame any new definition ourselves, but that it would be better to leave the Finance Joint Committee to judge every Bill presented to it on its merits, unfettered by any cut-and-dried formula.8. When we came to the procedure to be adopted for the settlement of differences between the two Houses, we found ourselves confronted with the following alternative solutions not of course exclusive of each other : (a.) The usual practice of Parliament, by which a disputed Bill is sent backwards and forwards between the two Houses. This procedure, which ends either in a compromise or in the withdrawal of one or other of the two Houses from its position, or possibly in the loss, temporary or otherwise, of the Bill, is usually sufficient for Bills of minor moment, but is unsatisfactory in the case of measures of a highly controversial character or of first-class importance-(6.) Conference between the two Houses. This procedure, although provided for in the Standing Orders of Parliament, has fallen into desuetude, and, being governed by rules of an inelastic and cumbrous description, is in its present form of little value. I will come presently to its possible revival in another form.(c.) Joint Sitting of the two Houses. This solution, although Frequently discussed and commended, has never hitherto been officially put forward, mainly because of the objection arising from the impracticable size of a united body so constituted an objection which was responsible for its rejection by the Bryce Conference. It is clear however that, if this objection could be removed, there is, as the Bryce Report admitted, a good deal to be said for it.(d.) The Referendum. This plan was much discussed and met with a good deal of support some years ago. It was rejected by the Bryce Conference for the reasons given in paragraph 55 of their Report. Our Cabinet Committee did not favour it for the same reasons, and also because we thought that the multiplication of miniature general elections is not to be desired.9. At this stage we were brought to a consideration of the Bryce proposal (paragraphs 48 to 51 and 56 to 59) of a Free&apos; Conference in a somewhat novel form, and we decided to make this recommendation, although not, as will be seen, as the sole or the final method of extrication from a Parliamentary impasse. Our proposal is that, if a disagreement between the two Houses cannot be settled by the ordinary procedure, the Bill in dispute shall either forthwith or early in the next session (if it be again proceeded with) after being read a second time in the House of Commons be referred, together with any amendments made by the House of Lords, to a Free Conference consisting of 30 members of each House, who should appoint their own Chairman.1.0. The Free Conference should meet as soon as possible after it has been consti-tuted to consider the Bill with the proposed amendments. If it fails to come to an agreement with regard to the points in dispute, it should report the fact to both Houses, and the Bill would not proceed any further that session. But if it arrives at an agreement by a majority of not less than three of those present and voting, the Bill as agreed upon should be presented to both Houses. (Compare Bryce Report, paragraph 56.)11. If both Houses agree with the Bill as reported from the Free Conference, it should be presented in the usual manner for the Royal Assent.
12. I have now come to the point at which, in the event of the failure of the Tree Conference, we decided to advance beyond the Bryce Report and to recommend the procedure of a Joint Sitting. We were convinced that in the last resort this would prove to be the most authoritative and the most effective final solution; for whereas either House might be reluctant or might even decline to accept a settlement suggested by a small fraction of its members, the same objection, presuming that an agreement can be arrived at as regards the equitable constitution of the Joint Sitting, would not apply to the decision of so powerful and representative an authority.13. Accordingly we decided to recommend that, in any case in which the Free Conference might fail to reach an agreement, or in which either House might disagree with the settlement arrived at, the Bill, together with the amendments in dispute, should be referred in the next new session of Parliament held in the year following the Free Conference to a Joint Sitting of the two Houses of Parliament, the decision of which should be final.14. I will here pause to summarise the stages through which, under the plan proposed by our Committee, a Bill with its amendments would in future pass before the final decision was reached.First, there would be the ordinary give-and-take procedure, now adopted and still capable of being applied to any Bills except those which might excite violent controversy or passion.Secondly, there would be the Free Conference, very much in the form proposed in the Bryce Report.Thirdly and lastly, there would be the Joint Sitting.15. I. will next compare the length of time which&apos;might or must elapse between the passing of a violently contested measure by a majority of the House of Commons, and its final appearance on the Statute Book under this procedure, with that which is provided for under the Parliament Act. By sec. two (1) of the latter, a Bill has to be rejected by the House of Lords in three successive sessions before it can be passed over their heads, provided that at least two years shall have elapsed between the second reading in the first of these sessions in the House of Commons, and the date on which it passes the House of Commons in the third of these sessions. In other words, while the operation of the time limit may extend over the greater part of three years, it may and probably in practice would be confined to two years or a little over.16. Under the scheme we have drafted, the price paid by the House of Lords for the additional protection of the Joint Sitting would be a reduction of this time limit. The actual extent of the reduction will depend upon the degree to which the stages above proposed are accelerated or retarded.In the Draft Resolutions I have suggested (No. II) that the Free Conference shall, in the event of a disagreement between the two Houses, be convened &quot;forthwith, or as soon as may be in the next following session of Parliament.&quot; This, in the event of an autumn session, might mean in the latter part of the same year as the first passage of the Bill through the House of Commons.In Resolution No. Ill it is suggested, if the Free Conference fails, that the Joint Sitting shall be held &quot;in the next new session of Parliament in the year following the Free Conference.&quot; This, of course, might mean early in the succeeding year. This point will doubtless be carefully considered in the Cabinet and is certain to be critically debated in the House of Lords. For it may be that some will say that the interval of one year with a Joint Sitting is not much better, from the point, of view of the House of Lords, than the delay of two or possibly three years provided under the Parliament Act. Much will depend upon the composition of the Joint Sitting and the respective contributions to be made to it, by the two Houses ; and in the case of the House of Lords this will again depend to a large extent upon the future composition of that House ; since the Liberalism of the House of Lords contingent will probably be enhanced in proportion as it rests upon an other than hereditary basis. I accordingly turn to this very complex problem which was the source to our Committee, as it has been to all previous Committees and Conferences, of the utmost difficulty.17. The main objection hitherto entertained to a Joint Sitting of the plenum of the two Houses of Parliament has been the unwieldy proportions of such an Assembly. The House of Lords is well over 700 in numbers. The House of Commons is not far below that total. Even assuming that the House of Commons is reduced by the disappearance of the Irish Members, or the majority of them, it is likely that the united body of the two Houses will not be much less than 1,400, a gathering which no-available room at Westminster, except Westminster Hall, could accommodate, and which would be incompatible with business.   Accordingly at an early date I suggested to our
oCommittee that the difficulty might be met by taking one-half of each House, assuming the reformed House of Lords to consist of approximately 350 Members. This would signify a total of 350 (or less) from the House of Commons and 175 (or less) from the House ot Lords, or a total of 5^5 (or less) which could very easily sit in either of the existing Chambers, or, alternately, in each. The respective contingents would be constituted by the two Committees of Selection, in proportions representing the various parties in the two Houses. According to the probable composition and character of the future House of Lords, the suggested contribution from it could of coarse be modified or reduced.18. As to the permanent strength of the reformed Upper Chamber, we were in general agreement that some number in the neighbourhood of 350 would be a reasonable total to work to. When, however, we proceeded to discuss the composition of this number different schemes found favour with different members of the Committee :  (i.) There were some who favoured a Chamber composed entirely of hereditary Peers, elected as their representatives by the whole body of the hereditary Peerage, together with certain ex officio life Peers and (possibly) a nominated element. This would be little more than a legislative committee of the present House, would resemble it in character as well as in origin, and would doubtless reproduce its best features. But there were some, including the Lord Privy Seal and myself:, who held that the formulation of any such scheme would be quite inconsistent with the undertakings that have been given, and would be unhesitatingly rejected by the House of Lords itself.. I certainly could not be responsible for introducing any such measure ; nor, 1 think, would the more influential Peers be found to support it. (ii.) A second alternative was a Senate from which the hereditary element should be entirely eliminated and whose members would be elected either directly or indirectly as representatives of grouped areas throughout the country. There are, 1 believe, members of the Conservative Party who would not be averse from such a solution, but it would only be in return for powers which neither this nor any House of Commons would be likely to concede. Further, the creation of a Senate so completely severed from the associa-tions and traditions of the past would, it was felt, neither satisfy public sentiment nor be in accord with the familiar processes of our constitutional evolution. Anyhow, no member of the Committee exhibited any willing-ness to formulate such a scheme, (iii.) The only remaining alternative was an elected Chamber, composed partly of hereditary Peers elected as their representatives by the entire body of the hereditary Peerage; partly of members elected by some form of indirect election to represent outside constituencies ; partly of ex officio members -t and partly of members nominated by the Crown.19. I submitted to the Committee a scheme for a reconstituted House drawn up on this basis, which, on the assumption that the basis is accepted, met with some favour, and is printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum.   It provides for a House thus composed : Hereditary Peers elected for a term of years by the entirehereditary Peerage ... ... ... ...     100Members elected for a term of years by indirect election as the representatives of large areas, grouped either as recommended in the Bryce  beport or in some other way    ... ... ... ... ... ...    200The two Archbishops (ex officio) and six or eight diocesan Bishops elected as their representatives by the whole body of diocesan Bishops for a term of years ... ... 8 or 10The Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord Chancellors and Lords ofAppeal... ... ... ... ...   (say)    10 or 12Peers nominated by the Crown, not exceeding (ultimately) ... 40 Peers of the Royal Family      ... ... ...   (say) 6Total (excluding the Royal Peers, who do notordinarily vote) ... ...   (circa)      36020. It will be observed that the popularly elected element in this assembly will be double the strength of tbe hereditary element and five-ninths of the whole.   If a [8483] c
larger popular element be required, the number 200 could be raised to 250. A fuller explanation of this scheme, with the implications which our Committee were disposed to attach to it, will be found in Appendix I of this Memorandum. There are also given in Appendix II a sketch of the methods by which the various sections of such a reconstituted House might be returned, and, in Appendix III, suggestions as to the term of office. These are perhaps not of immediate moment for the impending discussion in the Cabinet. But they may suffice to show that the scheme has been thought out in detail, and may be useful later on.21. It will, I think, be generally agreed that at this stage, when we are only proposing tentative. Resolutions, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to place before Parliament anything in the nature of an elaborated scheme. Accordingly the draft Resolutions relating to composition, as distinct from powers, ask the assent of the House of Lords merely to the general principles upon which a Second Chamber so reconstituted might be based. If even these principles are rejected, there will be no use in proceeding further with the scheme. On the other hand, the fact that a scheme has been carefully thought out, and the knowledge of it by those members of the Government who handle our case, may enable them to answer questions and to satisfy legitimate curiosity.22. In drawing up the original draft of these Resolutions, I had proposed to leave to the House of Lords to say whether it would prefer a Chamber reconstituted on the basis explained in paragraph 18 (i) of this Memorandum, or a composite House framed on the lines since more fully worked out. But the Prime Minister pointed out to me that it was the duty of Government to submit one scheme (whether acceptable or the reverse) rather than to leave to Parliament the choice between two schemes. Resolu-. tion VI therefore gives the skeleton of a composite House only. A discussion upon it will not fail to reveal the general sentiment of the House of Lords; while a serious modification of its terms, or even their rejection, would, as I have before pointed out, do the Government no harm, since it would either demonstrate the impossibility of proceeding with any scheme at all, or indicate the lines of a new and more prolitable approach.23. The following are the Draft Resolutions which I now submit, and which attempt to state in the most concise form the general conclusions above recommended in respect both of powers and composition :-Draft Resolutions.I. That while the House of Lords shall not amend or reject Money Bills, the decision as to whether a Bill is or is not a Money Bill, or is partly a Money Bill and partly not a Money Bill, shall be referred to a Joint Standing Committee of the two Houses, the decision of which shall be final. That this Joint Standing Committee shall be appointed at the beginning of each new Parliament, and shall be composed of seven members of each House of Parliament, in addition to the Speaker of the House of Commons, who shall be ex offtcio Chairman of the Committee.II. That in the event of a disagreement arising between the two Houses of Parliament with regard to any Public Bill, other than a Money Bill, which cannot be settled by the ordinary practice of Parliament, the Bill, together with the amend-ments in dispute, shall be referred forthwith, or as soon as may,be in the next following Session of Parliament, to a Free Conference of the two Houses, which shall consist of thirty members of each House of Parliament, who shall appoint their own Chairman. -III. That if the Free Conference fails to come to an agreement, or if either &apos; House of Parliament disagree with the settlement arrived at by the Free Conference,the Bill, together with the amendments which may be in dispute, shall be referred in the next.new Session of Parliament which occurs in the year following the Free Conference to a Joint Sitting of the two Houses of Parliament, the decision of which shall be final.IV. That the two Houses shall be represented in the Joint Sitting by a propor-tion of their members, the quota of the House of Lords, which must depend upon the numerical strength and the composition of that House when reconstituted, to stand in a definite relation to the quota of the House of Commons, the quota in each case being determined by Statute.V. That the reconstituted House of Lords shall consist approximately of 350 members.
VI. That this House shall be composed, in addition to Peers of the Blood Royal, the Lords Spiritual, and the Law Lords, of (a.) Members elected, either directly or indirectly, from the outside. (b.) Hereditary Peers elected by their order. - (c.) Members nominated by the Crown, the numbers in each case to be determined by Statute. -VII. That, with the exception of Peers of the Blood Royal and the Law Lords, every other member of the reconstituted and reduced House of Lords shall hold his seat for a term of years to be fixed by Statute, but shall be eligible for re-election.C. of K.June 14, 1922.APPENDIX I.Scheme of a reconstituted House of Lords of about 350 Members.1. (a.) One hundred hereditary Peers elected for a term of years as their representatives by the whole body of the hereditary Peerage.(b.) Two hundred members elected for a term of years by indirect election as the representatives of large constituencies, e.g., the grouped areas recommended by Lord Bryce&apos;s Conference.(c.) Forty members, of whom not more than four should be nominated in any one year,* appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister to sit and vote in the House of Lords for&apos; a term of years.(d.) The two Archbishops [ex officio)&apos;, and six or eight diocesan Bishops elected as their representatives by the whole body of the diocesan Bishops for a term of years.(e.) The Lord Chancellor and the six Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (ex officio), and any ex-Lord Chancellor, or hereditary Peer who is qualified under the provisions of the Judicature Acts to act as a Lord of Appeal in the House of Lords.(/.) Members of the Royal Family who have been created Peers, provided that they are sons or grandsons of a Sovereign.2. It is suggested that the number of Peers to be elected by the hereditary Peerage (in the manner set out in Appendix (a) (1) to this Report) should never exceed 100, whatever may be the future increase in the total number of hereditary Peers.Some members of the Committee were of opinion that the growth of the hereditary Peerage, which threatens to reach extravagant dimensions, should be arrested by fixing a definite limit to the number of such Peerages which the Crown may be advised to create. If this creation were limited to not more than fourt annually, the danger of the Peerage being increased to unreasonable proportions would be removed, since the creation of new Peerages would be balanced by the extinction of old ones.3. It was thought desirable, under this scheme, that the present independent representation of the Scottish and Irish Peerages in the House of Lords should cease, and that the whole body of hereditary Peers should form one Electoral College for the election of their representatives. By means of the proportional method of voting, the Scottish and Irish Peerages would obtain their due representation in the House of Lords.4. The Bishops would elect their representatives in the same way and for the same length of time as the hereditary Peers elect theirs.We considered whether or not the Bishops of the Church of England in Wales should form part of the Electoral College for the Spiritual Lords of Parliament,* The object of this recommendation is to provide for the presence in the House of Lords of distinguished persons, who might not have been elected to the Assembly or who might become available in the intervals between elections. The Committee did not think that such persons need possess any stated qualifications. The close restriction of numbers and the publicity attaching- to their nomination should prevent any unworthy appointments being made. In the first instance it might be thought desirable to nominate more than four persons at the same time.t It might be desirable not to include in this number Peerages conferred on men who hold or have held high office under the Grown.
and should be eligible for election to the House of Lords. On the whole, however, it was thought that as there is now no Established Church in Wales, it would not be easy to justify the presence of the Welsh Bishops in Parliament unless they were elected to sit in the House of Lords by outside constituencies.This argument does not apply to the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who at the present time is not entitled to a seat in the House of Lords. The holder of this See should be placed in the same position as any other diocesan Bishop in England.5. In view of the fact that women cannow sit in the House of Commons, there was general agreement that Peeresses in their own right should form part of the Electoral College for the hereditary Peerage and should be eligible for election to the House of Lords. In the same way, women should be eligible for election by the outside constituencies.6. The suggested composition of the Electoral Colleges, to which under this scheme would be entrusted the duty of electing 200 members of the House of Commons, was as follows :  (a.) Members of the House of Commons who represent constituencies within the area agreed upon;(b.) Representatives from the County Council or County Councils within the area agreed upon, the number of such representatives being in proportion to the population represented by the Council,(c.) Representatives from the County Borough Councils within the area agreed upon, the number of such representatives being in proportion to the population represented by each County Borough Council; and possibly(d.) Representatives from any University within the area agreed upon.7. The size of these Electoral Colleges would, of course, vary according to the population in different areas, and it might not be possible in all cases to proceed upon a strict numerical basis if due representation is to be given to the less thickly populated parts of the country. But, if the grouped areas recommended in the report of Lord Bryce&apos;s Conference were adopted as a basis for any electoral scheme, a fair and equitable adjustment of representation could probably be devised.Every endeavour should be made to keep the Electoral Colleges within reasonable numerical limits. In Appendix II to this Report an attempt has been made to sketch a possible Electoral College and the electoral procedure to be adopted. Note has also been taken of some of the difficulties which will have to be faced.8. We were agreed that all elections to the House of Lords should be carried out by means of the proportional system of voting, known as the single transfer-able vote.9. All members of the reconstituted House of Lords would be styled Lords of Parliament and would retain that title so long as they remained members of the House.10. It seems desirable that all elected members of the House should be elected for the same length of time preferably for a period of ten years and that they should be eligible for re-election. In order, however, that the changing currents of political opinion may be duly felt in the reconstituted Chamber, it is desirable that a third of its members should vacate their seats every five years. In the case of the first elections, therefore, special arrangements would have to be made, and a scheme has been suggested in Appendix II which might meet the situation.11. It was suggested that any Lord of Parliament should be at liberty to resign his seat, and that a Lord of Parliament who might fail to attend the sittings of the House for a year, except by special leave of the House, should automatically vacate his seat.12. We were of opinion that in ordinary circumstances no salaries should be paid to Lords of Parliament. At the same time it was realised that if no payment were attached to the position of Lord of Parliament, it might seriously imperil one of the main objects of the reform which is to make the future House of Lords more fully representative of all shades of political opinion. We thought, therefore, that in the case of any Lord of Parliament who might apply for such payment, he should be entitled to receive the same salary as that payable at the time to a member of the House of Commons.13. We were agreed that all hereditary Peers should be entitled after the recon-stitution of the House of Lords to offer themselves for election to the House of Commons.
APPENDIX II.Methods of Election. I. Election of the 100 Representatives of the Hereditary Peers.(i.) Every Peer (the term includes Peeresses in their own right) who claims to sit or to vote must prove his right of succession to the Peerage.(ii.) Infants.. insane persons and undischarged bankrupts will be disqualified as now from a seat in the new House of Lords.(iii.) The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, immediately after the receipt of the necessary authorisation from the Lord Chancellor, will give notice, of an election of Representative Peers to sit and vote in the House of Lords, and will cause a list to be prepared of all hereditary Peers and Peeresses qualified to vote at such an election and become members of the House of Lords. This list will be kept in the Office of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.(iv.) The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery will send to every hereditary Peer who is qualified to vote at the election, and to become a member of the House of Lords, a nomination paper on which he shall be entitled to enter the name of any Peer as a candidate for, election, provided that such Peer&apos;s name appears on the official list prepared by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.(v.) Every Peer who is a candidate for electi&amp;n to the House of Lords must be duly proposed and seconded by two Peers and must also be supported by three other Peers whose names appear on the official list issued by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery.(vi.) Every nomination paper, after the name of the candidate has been duly entered upon it, must be signed by the Peers who support his candidature, and must then be returned in a registered letter to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery on or before a date to be fixed by that Officer.(vii.) On the appointed day the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery will prepare a list showing the names of the Peers who have been nominated as candidates for election, together with those of their proposers and seconders and supporters.(viii.) If the number of candidates who have been nominated for election is 100, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery will declare such candidates to be duly elected; but, if their number exceeds 100, he will send a copy of the list of the candidates and their supporters to each Peer who is qualified to vote, together with a ballot paper.(ix.) The voting will be by the proportional system of voting, known as the single transferable vote, and the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery will notify to each elector the appointed day on or before which the ballot paper must be returned to him. He will also inform each elector in writing of the manner in which the ballot paper is to be filled in and endorsed.All ballot papers will be returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery by registered post.[8483] the view was expressed, however, that any Peer who had&apos; once sat in the recon-stituted House of Lords, whether he had been elected by his Peers or by an outside constituency, should be ineligible to sit in the House of Commons. This was the view-taken by Lord Rqsebery&apos;s Committee, who stated in their Reportjdiat it was &quot;contrary to public policy that it should be possible for persons to hover between the two branches of the Legislature.&quot;14. It would follow from the above paragraph that if a member of the House of Commons were to succeed to a hereditary Peerage, he should not thereby lose his seat in the House of Commons unless he decided to stand for election for the other House.15. The question was considered whether or not any special arrangements would be required to secure the representation of the Dominions and of India in the recon-stituted House of Lords. It was thought, however, that the methods above proposed for election and nomination would be adequate for the purpose, and, consequently, that no other machinery was necessary.16. The Question of whether or not it was desirable that Ministers should be at liberty to address both Houses was mooted. The opinion of the Committee was divided on the matter, the majority being unfavourable.
321A more detailed examination of the bodies to be represented in each area will accordingly be required than we had time to make, although it may be said that the over-representation of the urban population in one area will be roughly balanced by the rural predominance in others.We have given a rough sketch above of a possible Electoral College for the largest single area in England (supposing Lancashire to remain undivided). Of course, the numbers of the Electoral College can be diminished, according to the ratio to population which is adopted, or to any alternative plan that may be preferred.(x.) On the appointed day the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, who will be the person appointed by Statute to be the Returning Officer, will go through the ballot papers in the prescribed form and manner and will cause the names of the candidates duly elected to be published in the &quot;London Gazette.&quot; He will also certify the names of the elected candidates to the Clerk of the Parliaments.II. Election of Lords Spiritual.These will be elected in the same way and for the same period as the Lords Temporal.III. Election of Lords of Parliament by outside Constituencies.It is suggested that this section of the future House of Lords, 200 or 250 in number, should be returned by electoral areas; and the following scheme is based upon Lord Bryce&apos;s Report, i.e., upon the grouped areas for England, Scotland and Wales, given on page 24 of that Report.Twelve areas are there constituted for England and Wales, and one for Scotland the population of the areas varying from 2^ millions to 4f- millions. It is, of course, possible that a better distribution may be found, and it may be considered in any case desirable to divide Scotland into two areas, the Highlands and the LowlandsLord Bryce&apos;s scheme wras designed to provide for Electoral Colleges, consisting of Members of Parliament only about 600 in all (Ireland not being included) and it was designed to elect 246 Peers in a ratio proportionate to the population of the areas. If we were to adopt the same areas, but to reduce the number of seats from 250 to 200, i.e., l/5th, we should find that, whereas the number of seats that he proposed for the different areas ranged from 30 to 15, our number (to make up a total of 200) would range from 24 to 12.But it may be doubted whether, if we are to include representatives of County Councils, County Borough Councils, &apos;&amp;c, in our Electoral Colleges, it will be possible to proceed everywhere upon a strict numerical basis. Let us take, for instance, the case of Lancashire. This area is given by Lord Bryce as containing 4,860,000 population (in 1911) with 66 M.P.&apos;s and 27 proposed seats. Now let us suppose that our electors are to be 1. M.P.&apos;s.2. Representatives of the County Councils.3. Representatives of the County Borough Councils.4. And possible representatives of the Universities of Liverpool and Manchester.The population of the County, exclusive of the County Boroughs, and repre-sented therefore by the County Council, was, in 1911, 1,746,418, whereas the population of the 17 County Boroughs was 3,181,941. If we were to adopt a strict ratio of electors to population, the country districts might be overweighted by the towns. For instance, if one representative were given to every 20,000 of the population, the Electoral College for Lancashire would consist of 66 M.P.&apos;s;87 Representatives of the County Council; 160 Representatives of the County Borough Councils; plus, let us say  4 Representatives of the University of Liverpool; 4 Representatives of the University of Manchester.
u .As to the size of the Electoral Colleges, a good deal will depend (a) upon whether ley are to meet together for the purposes of election, and (b) the place that they will ;cupy in public esteem. As regards the former, the following difficulties suggest lemselves : Selection of town or place of meeting, provision of a suitable diall, arrangements 9r journeys to and fro, and, above all, the atmosphere of an election meeting. As 3gards the latter, the smaller the Colleges are made, the more may it be urged that hey are close corporations, and not representative of the people.It seems, therefore, well worthy of consideration whether the same machinery hould not be adopted as in the case of the election of 100 Peers of the hereditary &apos;eerage.   The following is a possible scheme : 1. The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, immediately after the receipt of the necessary authorisation from the Lord Chancellor, will issue writs to the persons appointed by Statute to be the Returning Officers in the various electoral areas laid down in the Act.2. The Returning Officer would possibly be the Clerk of the County Council, or, in cases where more than one county were included in the area, the Clerk of the County with the largest population.3. There are various ways in which he might conduct an election, but the following scheme seems fairly simple : 4. The Returning Officer will send a notice to the appropriate officer of each constituent body, requiring him to send to the Returning Officer, on or before an appointed day, the names of the representatives elected by his Council to be members of the Electoral College.5. As soon as the Returning Officer has obtained the list of elected representa-tives he will give notice to the members of the Electoral College that he is prepared to receive, on or before an appointed day, nominations for candidates for election to the Second Chamber.6. As soon as the list of nominations is complete, the Returning Officer will send by registered post a ballot paper to each voter who forms part of the Electoral College, and the election will then be conducted in the same manner as that already set out for the election of Peers.7. As in the case of the election of Peers, the voting will be by the proportional system of voting known as the single transferable vote.8. At the close of the voting, the returning Officer will go through the ballot papers in the prescribed form and manner and will send the names of the successful candidates to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, who will cause the names to be published in the &quot;London Gazette,&quot; and certify them to the Clerk of the Parliaments.The fear which has been expressed that, if local authorities are entrusted with the task of electing members to Electoral Colleges, party politics will in. some cases be introduced into, in other cases intensified in, local elections, can easily be exaggerated. Those who urge this point seem to shut their eyes to obvious facts. Most&apos; local elections, at any rate in towns, when they are fought at all, are already fought on what are really political issues. In Counties, this may not be so much the&apos; case, but the same considerations which already rob the election of County Councils of any great element of excitement would probably be found to apply in the case where representation in the Electoral College was also involved. The needs and interests of the locality would almost invariably be the deciding factor in any election, and. if more ratepayers could be induced by the introduction of a new element into an election to interest themselves a little more in the affairs of the County, no one would be the worse.APPENDIX III.Term of Office.THERE remains the question of the term for which the members of the reformed House of Lords (with the exception of the Princes and the Law Lords) should serve. If the numbers approved are, as has been suggested, 100 to be elected by the Peers
and 200 by the Electoral Colleges, the simplest plan Avould perhaps be to fix the tenure of a seat as a period of ten years (this also would apply to the Bishops). It would then be quite easy to say that of the first 300 members elected, 150 should only hold their seats for five years. Whether the moiety to retire should be chosen hv ballot or by the constituencies at the time of election or by a standing Committee of the House or by some other method need not now be discussed.If it is considered that a half of the House is too large a proportion to go out at the same time, it would be quite simple to arrange that a third of the members should retire, provided that the total number of the elected members of the House were divisible by 3, as in Lord Bryce&apos;s scheme.  For example : (a.) 102 Peers elected by their Peers.(b.) 201 persons elected by the Electoral Colleges at the first election.(a.) 34 would be elected for   4 years.34 would be elected for   8 years.34 would be elected for 12 years. (&amp;.) 67 would be elected for   4 years.67 would be elected for   8 years.67 would be elected for 12 years.It may perhaps be thought that the election by the hereditary Peers should precede that of the Electoral Colleges, in order to afford an opportunity for a Peer who had failed to secure election by his fellows, to stand for popular election. Other -wise he might lose his opportunity for a number of years. This could be provided for if necessary; although there is no reason why a Peer should not be nominated for election both by his Peers and for one of the constituencies. If he were elected in both cases, he could choose which election to take up, and the other vacancy could be filled.Another question may be raised, viz., whether the elections should take place immediately after the Act is passed, or not until after the dissolution of the Parlia-ment that passes it. It may be argued that members of a moribund House of Commons should not be entitled to vote for the members of the new House. Against this, it must be remembered that in the scheme under consideration the M.P.&apos;s will only constitute a part of each Electoral College, whilst there would be some objection to the first duty of newly-elected members of the House of Commons being that of taking part in elections for the other House. In view, too, of the fact that a third or a half of the members of the Second Chamber would retire in five years, it would seem preferable that the elections for that House should proceed as soon as possible.
