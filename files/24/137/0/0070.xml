1/S E ORET.CABINET.CP.4071.VJIRELS.SS3 .BP.0AD0ASTI1TG.(Memorandum &quot;by the Postmaster General).(1)   Considerable interest i3 being aroused in the vise of Wireless Telephony for broadcasting information, music etc.     This new development of Wireless scienco has attained rsraarkable popularity in the United States, where some 750,000 people possess receiving sets and listen daily to the distribution of Concerts, News, Speeches, market reports, etc, and lto possibilities for the purpose of propaganda, as well as for education and amusement, are obviously enormous.     It may also afford scope for the establishment of a promising industry in this country.     In the United States the distribution has been largely uncontrolled with chaotic results.(.2)    The number of transmitting stations which can operate in this country simultaneously without interference is limited to about 8 or 10, and in view of the number of Manufacturers desiring to take part I invited them to formulate an agreed soheme.     The expense of providing and maintaining the transmitting stations and the 3erAoes emanating from them will be considerable, and one of the principal difficulties has been to secure a reasonable contribution from all the vendors of receiving sets and from the public who use them., towards the expense of the transmission.(o)    The principal features of the soheme submitted by the Kanufacturers are as follows:-(a) One, or more probably two, Broadcasting companies to
to be formed to construct the stations and conduct  and finance the Broadcasting services.(b) Any British Manufacturer to be eligible for membership of whichever Company he may select by tahing a single -qualifying share (probably  1 shares) and the Peat Office to agree that no receiving set will be approved for use under a Post Office lioence unless it is submitted by a member of one or other of the Broad-casting Companies.     The object cf this provision is to secure that no Manufacturer shall place receiving set3 en the market without contributing his fair share in proportion to his sales to the expense of the transmitting stations.(c) The revenue of the Broadcasting Companies to be derived in part from a small percentage on the prices charged by the Manufacturers to the public for receiving sets and paid over by the Manufacturers to the Companies and in part by an addition of 10/- to the annual fee for a licence, which would be collected by the Post Office as part of the licence fee and paid over to the Broadcasting Companies.     Under this proposal the annual licence fee would be  1, of which half would go to tho Exchequer and half to the Broadcasting Companies.(d) The Broadcasting Companies will agree that their divisible profits shall not exceed 7^fo on the oapital;if their income exceeds the amount necessary to give this returnjthe charge upon the annual licence to be reduced.(4)    If %he Broadcasting is to be a success and havo a reasonable prospect of permanency, the cost roust be mainly contributed by the users, who will get the benefit of the service, and the scheme outlined by the Manufacturers seems to me reasonable, but I should prefer
if the Manufacturers can be persuaded to agree, to fix the total fee at 10/- instead of  1, o/- going to the Exchequer and of- to the Companies.(5)   But there is one additional point to which I wish to call the attention of the Cabinet.     The Manufabturers desire to impose as a condition cf membership.cf the Broadcasting Companies tha stipulation that the apparatus sold shall be of Home manufacture.     They ol&apos;aim that this is a&apos; reasonable measure cf protection against an infant industry being strangled by the importation of German apparatus at prioes with which the Home Manufacturers are quite unable to compete, and they allege that the 33$ ad valorem duty to which imported Wireless apparatus is liable under Part 1 of the Safeguarding of Industries Act is quite insufficient protec-tion for this purpose.Inasmuch as, under the scheme submitted, the Post Office will refuse a licence to any Manufacturer or seller who is not a member of the Broadcasting Company, the Post Office will beooms, if this condition is accepted, a party to what, will be tantamount to a prohibition of foreign made apparatus.      I understand that the Manufacturers would be content with a prohibition for two years, subject to reconsideration at the end cf that period.     As this question raises a political issue, I submit it to the Cabinet for decision.     My own opinion is that the difficulties of setting, this new industry on its feet will be seriously aggravated if foreign competition is admitted, and I think a temporary prohibition would,  in the ciroumstanoes, be reasonable and defensible.F. KELLAWAY.28 June, IS22.
