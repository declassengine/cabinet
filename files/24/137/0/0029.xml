DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.II.II. 48.debt.,4029iEPIDililC DISEASES IN RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I desire to bring to the notice of my colleagues the need for prompt measures to combat the epidemic diseases (typhus, relapsing fever, cholera etc.) which are widespread in Russia.   Hitherto this question has been considered primarily in. relation to Poland, and a grant of  50,000 was made in 1921 to a fund raised by the League of Nations, which has been spent mainly on anti-typhus measures in Poland and on the maintenance of sanitary stations and hospitals on the Polish boundary.    The fund raised by the League is now exhausted and the complete breakdown of the frontier zone system is inevitable unless further grants are forthcoming.   The epidemics in question have greatly increased during this winter and spring, and but for the fact that typhus is less prevalent in the summer the disease would by now have spread to western Europe. But Poland is no longer the only point of danger.   Cholera and typhus have spread to the Blaok Sea ports and the sanitary control at Constantinople is wholly inadequate to prevent the spread of these dieease3 to the eastern Mediterranean.    The danger is all tho greater because typhus has a comparatively long period of incubation.In any case negative measures, such as the maintenance of a kind of cordon sanitaire on the Polish frontier or the enforcement of a strict supervision of shipping coming from the Black Sea ports, do nothing to remove the source of the danger,   Until the sanitary -
conditions of Russia and the &quot;Ukraine have^beem Improved any economic recovery is impossible.    The first con-dition of any reconstruction of Russiaj without which there can be no economic recovery of the rest of Europe, Is the adoption of sanitary precautions on a large scale to check the spread of typhus and cholera,    The question was considered from this point of view by en international conference of health experts which met at Warsaw in March. The conference recommended -(a)   Active frontier measures to be taken at appropriatepoints in a broad frontier- zone,    i.e. points within Russia or in Polrnd and the other border States as the case requires;Cb) Preventive measures in any pai*t of Russia on, lines of eornrcunlcation by rail or water from the principal epidemic areas;(c) Preventive measures in a selected famine and epidemic district of industrial importance, e.ge the Donetz basin.These proposals are examined in detail In the technicalmemorandum attached.    The cost of the full Warsaw schemeis estimated at  1,500,000, of which Great Britain&apos;s shareon the basis now adopted by the League would be 131$.   Butthis does not take into account the measures necessary onthe Black Sea littoral.The recommendations of the Warsaw conference were referred to Genoa, end at the third plenary sitting thefollowing resolution was passed&quot;The Conference approves the principle of the anti-epidemic campaign for European hygienic relief adopted at the Warsaw Conference, and recommends the European Governments represented at Genoa to discuss their application Jjamedlately, and for this pur-pose to appeal to their respective Parliaments for the necessary funds&quot;.M. Tchicherin protested vehemently against the proposal that the execution of the Warsaw soheme should be entrusted-2-1
to the League of Nations, but as M, Litvinoff was at the same time concluding an agreement with Dr. Norman White, the League&apos;s chief epidemic commissioner, too much weight need not be attached to M, Tchicherin&apos;s protest.It is clear that the Warsaw proposals cannot be carried out without the co-operation of the European Powers, but I feel strongly that Great Britain shciild take all possible steps to secure that this question is not shelved until it is too late to take effective action.   I therefore propose the following scheme of action:-(a) Great Britain to offer to contribute its share of the l  millions for the Epidemics Fund to be raised by the League of Nations to give effect to the recommendations of the Warsaw Conference; in the specified ratio of 13-1$,    ^hl8 represents a maximum commitment of  202,500.(b) As immediate action is of such great importance, Great Britain might offer a first con-tribution of  100,000 at once If as sirred that the League of Nations can secure double that amount as soon as possible from other GovertJnents.(o) The sums first raised should be devoted to preventive measures on the Western Frontier Zone of Russia and to anti-epidemic measures at the chief Black Sea ports,(d) In view of the time, organisation and large expenditure which are required to cope with the Russian epidemics at their source, particularly in the famine affected areas, enquiry should be made as to the practicability of obtaining money for the development of public health and anti-epidemic measures from the organisations with private capital
which obtain concessions for developing industries in Russia.   This question mlg^t be referred for consideration to the British representative at the forthcoming conference ot the Hague.(e)   Apart from the above measures, action should at once be taken to secure effective observa-tion and quarantine measures\ires In conrection with shipping arriving In the Bosphorous from the Black Sea.   For this purpose the British Government 3hould endeavour to arrange with the French and Italian Governments for the execution of the measures required and the supply of funds which are needed.A. jf.4CS.-TD. 14th June, 1922.Ministry of Health.
MEMORANDUM ON THE RECOMhENDATIONS OF THE WARSAW EUROPEAN HEALTH C0NFER1&amp;CE(Prepared in the Ministry of Health).1.     The Warsaw Conference on March 20 - 25 last was convened by the Polish Government with the aid&quot; of the League of Nations to consider the epidemic situation in Russia and the border States.   It was atteivJed by technical representatives of 29 States.   The main points dealt with were (a.) the protection of Europe by the establishment or strengthening of sanitary defences on the west of Russia, and (b) measures to deal with these epidemics in Russia itself.PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS.2.    As regards typhus (and relapsing fever which often accompanies it) Soviet Russia has suffered very heavily for the last four years at least.   It was estimated that no fewer than 20 million cases of these diseases have occurred in Russia during this period: their share in the disorganisation and calamities of Russia has been very great.   These epidemics were abating in 1920-21, but have notably increased again since November last, mainly as a result of the famine conditions in Eastern and Southern Russia.3.     In 1919 the large western movements of repatriated, persons, refugees etc., from Russia were constantly carrying infection into the border States, particularly Poland.   Steps were then initiated by the
Polish Health Authorities to provide sanitary cleansing stations, hospitals etc. on the main railway lines and elsewhere and these measures have been continued and developed on a large scale,    ihelr execution has been assisted by the League of Nations Epidemics Commission, established in 1920, which gave expert advice, essential material, and international backing and authority to the work.4.     As a result of these and other measures, Poland in 1920-21 was kept relatively free from typhus until last November.    Then, further large invasions from Russia, directly or indirectly associated with its famine, produced infection beyond the strength of the Polish defences, and have resulted in formidable epidemics in the eastern regions of Poland and produced, scattered centres of Infection even on the west of the Vistula. Though the customary fall in typhus cases Is to be expected with the summer months, vigorous efforts need to be made between now and the autumn if further dissemination westward is to be avoided.5.     In Lithuania a somewhat similer state of affairs on a smaller scale has occurred.   The sanitary stations and preventive work in Latvia and Esthonia also require strengthening.   The long frontier of Roumania, which comes between Poland and the Black Sea, has been and is still very strictly guarded by a military cordon as also naturally by the river which forms its boundary, and these have practically kept out the introduction of infection.6.     The movements of population from Russia In mass which have been so closely associated with former epidemics seem certain to continue during the present year owing to the famine conditions and many other circumstances.
7.     The epidemic position has lately been made more serious by the appearance of cholera in many points in Russia, notably in the famine area of the Volga and at certain Black Sea ports including, from latest returns, Odessa. 42 localities in the Ukraine are also reported effected snd the disease is spreading along the lines of railways, and waterways and in the Red Army.   No material spread of cholera to the border States has hitherto taken place, but the conditions require very thorough precautions by the public health organisation of those countries - precautions which in the present circumstances and unaided will almost certainly not be forthcoming.8.     The international effort of the League of Nations Epidemic Commission has never furnished more than s small fraction of the money expended on preventive measures by the border States.   The amount obtained up to August 1921 amounted to  126,000, of which  119,000 had by that time been expended.   This money, however, has been judiciously and economically expended to strengthen weak points and supply essential materials.   The fund over the past winter has been practically exhausted, although the long promised French contribution of  50,000 (earmarked for use in Poland) has just been paid and will enable the Commission to continue    II some of its work. ifFRONTIER WORK AND THE PROTECTION OF EUROPE. land Frontiers.9.     The first recommendation of the Warsaw Conferenoe is that the frontier work of the Epidemic Commission should be continued, but with Important modifications to meet present circumstances.   In place of relying on sanitary stations on the main lines of route whloh are all within the
border States, the future work should be done largely on the Russian side of the frontier;    in some Instances - e*g. Important concentration points - a long distance from the boundary.    This proposal seems a sound one both technically and politically.    Technically, because success depends on regularising the westward flow of the population carrying these Infections and breaking up the masses to be dealt with into manageable units - a process which will be greatly facilitated by sanitary and preventive work before they reach thefrontier;   and politically, since action within Russia- xhrv\d.ifremove the present complaint of the flngft-iA-n fefnmvn,nftiHv&apos; -fcVmt^the work of the Epidemic Commission la only part and parcel ot - j J11the blockade of Russia to which they so strongly object.10,     The work on the Russian side which the Warsaw Conference sug^-ests Is very similar to- that of which we now have j j much practical experience in the border States.   It includes sanitary stations on railways etc for purposes of disinfection,   I cleansing, vaccination, bacteriological work etc. together with mobile &quot;epidemic columns&quot; the supply of soap, drugs, disinfectants, essential reserve clothing, and so forth.   For this work on the Russian side the Warsaw estimate is approximately  400,000, and to this must be added the estimate for continuing and developing the work in the border States themselves.   For the latter separate estimates were given by each of the border States.   In some cases (e.g. Poland which asked for  700,000) the estimates seem excessive, and apparently were made on the assumption that no simultaneous work vould be done on the Russian! side.11.     In Judging the work which can be done and the money which will be required, it would, however, seem safer not to total the requtreuents and estimates submitted at Warsaw by each of the countries, but to rely ixpon the experience already gained by the Epidemic Commission in the last two years,   that experience
has shown that very effective work can be clone with smaller sums than those suggested at Warsaw, provided that the Coraaission loioy/s as soon as possible what it can expend, and regulates its work accordingly.    It may be anticipated that if the Epidemic Commission could within a month or two get to work on the whole of this frontier defence question with the assurance that  200,000 is at its disposal for this main, section of its   work, a very great deal could be done to keep back the further extension of these epidemics and to steady a position which otherwise seems likely to get out of hand altogether.   It ?*ould, in this case, be essential to leave the Coi.oi.uission with a free hand to \itilise their resources for preventive work on one or the other side of the frontier as circumstances require.Sea Frontiers^12.     A further means by which all these epidemics may spread westwards, is by means of shipping traffic from the Black Sea ports.    &apos;Qiis danger requires to be net not only by measures in those ports, but also by the Sanitary Organisation of the Straits and port of Constantinople.    This question did not receive much detailed censidyrwtion from the Warsaw Conference, but its consideration is of first importance in regard to international measures.    On the one hand,  sea traffic in the Black Sea is now increasing, and, on the other, the condition of many of the Black Sea ports is very insanitary and- their situation especially dangerous from the point of view of epidemic cholera.13.     An expert Commission of the League of Nations which recently visited Constantinople reported that the present sanitary statics at the northern entrance to the Bosphorous is dilapidated and objectionable on account of the bad landing
and other causes.-   The report states that if any real attempt is made to control the introduction of epidemic diseases from the Black Sea ports it is most important to provide a properly equipped sanitary station on modern &apos;lines in this neighbourhood, with hospital accoi-imodation and provision for.the.observation of contacts.   The sanitary control of the Straits at present rests with the Inter-Allied Commission and. It y;ould be difficult to regard emergency measures .for its improvement as-^a subject for international subsidy.    It is suggested that, independently, of the League of Nations Fund, the Inter-Allied Commission at Cons tantlhople should be asked to proceed forthwith with all immediate measures necessary to supplement the preventive work which is being done elsewhere.14*     Measures in the Straits, however, to be effective, ought to be linked to preventive work at the principal Black Sea ports themselves.   Expenditure on the latter is proposed by the Warsaw resolutions, and should.-be encouraged&apos;.   No doubt the thorough cleansing of cities like Odessa, Rostov, Sebastopol etc., with the establishment of hospitals, disinfecting plant and other appliances necessary to deal with epidemics on a large scale would be a most costly proceeding,-requiring far more money than the funds asked for by the Warsaw Conference.    On the other hand, it is quite possible that Invaluable preventive work might be done with relatively small sums on such primary matters as temporarily safeguarding water supplies, inoculation against cholera and improvised cleansing and disinfection, together with medical examination of persons leaving the ports,15,     It is suggested, therefore, that the Epidemic Commission, in addition to giving primary attention to the western land frontier zone, should at once Investigate and take measxires of the above order at the Black Sea ports to the extent of their resources, these measures being completed
by whatever is necessary to provide efficient port sanitary work in the Bosphcrous.AHTD^^PlDEIliC mvASURES WITHIN RUSSIA.16.     The second branoh of the Warsaw report relates to measures in Russia itself (apart from its bolder areas and Black Sea ports)v   -Frontier measures, however effective, do nothing to deal with the root- of the mischief and naturally all expert opinion -must favour radical action against the conditions in which these different epidemics arise and continue,,   And the Conference, having in view the international discussion of reconstruction in Russia just beginning at Genoa, emphasised the elementary consideration that a primary condition of any reconstruction schemes must be security against these devastating epidemics.17.       While pressing these arguments, however,  theConference felt it impracticable to-propose internationalmeasures of the enormous a&quot;hd costly character which would benecessary to give real effect to them:- the more so as theareas now principally affected are the great famine strickenareas, !in which it is impossible to make much headway withmerely medical and sanitary measures while all - the famineconditions, themselves so directly associated with diseaseslike typhus, continue unchecked.    The Conference had in viewonly the immediate raising of a fund of 1^ millions, a large part of which must be spent on work on the frontier zone,and advised that the portion of this to be spent within russia should be devoted to:-(a)     comprehensive epidemic measures in a single restricted area in the famine zone, the area suggested being the Donetz basin, the industrial development of which has great importance.    The estimate for sanitary and hospital material for this work is a little over  100,000, but as it was recognised that nothing effective can be done without food supplies and
maintenance, the sum Of  900,000 Is added as an estimate to maintain ,180,000 persons for six months in the hospitals, observation stations etc,(b)     strengthening the present Russian sanitary services on the railways and waterways, -especially such as are in chief relation with the epidemic areas (i.e. railway hospitals, disinfecting stations, baths, soap, clothing, drugs, vaccines etc.).   For this work an estimate of  700,000 Is put forward.   It may be noted&apos; that it includes some supplies etc. to the Black Sea ports.18*     These two plans are to be carried out by the Russian public health &quot;authorities supported by the Epidemic Commission. They will require, therefore, not only the fullest accord with the Russian public health experts (an accord which may probably be assumed from the aotive part taken by..the Russian experts, at the Conference) but else the favour and goodwill of the Russian Government, whieH- the Epidemic Commission anticipates will also be forthcoming,... Both programmes, are bound to. present considerable difficulties, in view especially of the great distances involved and the lack of transport, but they probably represent the promise of the most useful,and fruitful international measures which can be taken with any sum of money, which is at all likely to be made available.    It is Important however that the case for these measures should, not b&apos;e put too high.   Even if the sum available within, Russia could be put as high as one million pounds, it is quite Insufficient to have animmediate and decisive effect on these great Russian epidemics,, at their source, , Their suppression &apos; &apos; must at the1 best be a long and a costly, business extending over a series of years and demanding continuous and progressive sanitary organisation and effort.19.     It is necessary here, as in the case of the- frontier work, to consider,, as a practical question, what can be done if a sum can be obtained at once that is considerably smaller than that contemplated in the Warsaw scheme.    It seems doubtful
whether with a relatively smell sum much good can really be effected in a great famine and epidemic stricken area like the Donetz basino   And. the present operations of the Nansen fund^ and particularly of the American Relief Association In supplying hospital and medical stores In these areas must be remembered. - .        &apos;.20,&apos;    In this connection it maybe asked if It is not possible to arrange for anti-epidemic work in the Donetz basin and similar oreis to be carried out side by side with, or even antecedently to, their industrial reconstruction, at the cost of the industries which are to be developed in these areas.    It is understood that concessions for establishing or re-establishing industries are being free.ly negotiated, and it wo\ild seem reasonable to demand that a determined proportion of money going into Russia for the comj.nere.ial development of particular regions should primarily be earmarked for public health and anti-epidemic measures within those regions.   Such measures will indeed by essential to the success of any industrial development which requires the aggregation of persons in factories, oil fields mines etc.  . In regions in which under present conditions the aggregation can only increase the opportunities of infection and the amount of sickitess&apos;.    Some form of special levy or tax for this purpose might have the advantage hot only of yielding ultima tely a much larger sum thai?, any that is likely to be raised by appeal tc outside nations, but also of supplying an Income sufficiently fixed . to pcrn.it of capital expenditure -on essential works such es pure water supplies.21.     The second scheme for internal work (sanitary service on railways, etc,)&apos;has the advantage from a practical point of view that It could apparently be set going at certain points to *-he extent that fluids allow without being essentially dependent on a very large sum being obtained at the outset.    To undertake
it on such a comprehensive scale that the whole of the main lines of communications in Russia can he controlled by sanitary stations, hospitals etc. would seem in any case to be Impracticable on account of its vastness.    The experience of the Epidemic Commission in Poland, however, shows how much can be done in this direction by minor measures such as the supply of vaccines and syringes, outfits for bacteriologies 1 diagnosis and so forth, that relatively do not entail^large expense, and these at least should be started at once.Conclusion.22,     The foregoing notes Indicate the very great public health and international importance of the measures recommended at Warsaw, and that, broadly speaking,  there is a very strong technical .case for the Warsaw programme, with Its estimate of 1-g millions, being at once taken in hand. It is specially important to emphasise the need, In any case for at once&apos;raising a substantial fund even if considerably less than the 1-1 millions, to be Used now for certain parts or&quot; that programme, the execution of which is critics 1.    The measures of: frontier protection Can thus be continued and developed on more effective lines (Western frontier zone and Black Sea ports) and may be expected, to&apos; save the extension into central and western Europe of diseases that might carry .with them very serious social and political^consequences and introduce a further disturbing element into the settlement of extra-European countries. This point has just been specially emphasised by the Health Co mil ttee of the League of Nations,- Prom the immediate fund, moreover, assistance should be given at once to the Russian public health
authorities in the important minor ways above indicated -eug. strengthening sanitary stations on main lines of communications from the famine areas.
