[This Document is the Property of Kis Britannic M^estyj Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1922.SECRET.CP. 4100.CABINET.SPECIAL   REPORT   ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 70.   WEEK ENDED  JULY 7, 1922.THE   SITUATION.Although there are signs in some Divisions of a slight revival in the engineering industry as the result of the termination of the recent dispute, the recovery is very gradual and employment is still far below normal.Some signs of activity in the shipbuilding industry are evident in the Port of London area, but in the South-Western Division further discharges have been recorded. In the North-Eastern Division activity is confined to repair work, while in the North-Western Division there are signs of improvement at the chief centres. In Scotland there is general depression. The improvement in repair work in Wales continues.From all Divisions come reports of a marked depression in the coal-mining industry, due chiefly to the large supplies of coal on hand, coupled with an extra-ordinarily low demand.In the North-Eastern Division the demand for iron and steel is very low, and, although small quantities of iron are being shipped abroad, home trade is almost at a standstill.Trade is very quiet in the building industry, especially in the South-Western Division. In the South-Western Division some slight seasonal improvement in the boot and shoe industry has been recorded, and is expected to continue.The position in the clothing industry generally remains unchanged, but in the South-Western Division some discharges have occurred in the dressmaking and tailoring trades.The recent improvement recorded in the cotton industry steadily continues. In the North-Eastern Division the improvement in the woollen and worsted trades has been maintained, and it is reported that shoddy manufacturers are busy producing goods for export. In the Midlands the hosiery trade generally remains good, and in the lace trade some activity is reported, coupled with an improvement in the export trade.The Scottish linen industry continues to be active at Kirkcaldy, while the jute industry remains quiet.Depression continues at Bristol in the paper-making industry, but elsewhere there is little change to report.Although the pottery, china and earthenware industries remain depressed in the Midlands Division there are signs of an increased steadiness at certain towns.[P.T.O.
In the South-Eastern Division considerable activity is reported in the seasonal trades of fruit-picking and jam-making.The fishing industry in Scotland shows a slight improvement, but employment is still only intermittent.  In the North-Eastern Division the prospects are very poorowing to the large number of trawlers laid up for repair.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of LabourNOTE ON UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN GREAT BRITAIN ANDIRELAND ON JULY 7, 1922.1. The Trade Union figure of unemployment for July 1914 was 2-8 per cent.The average for the ten years prior to the war, according to Trade Union unemployment figures, was 4-7 per cent. It was as high as 78 per cent, in 1908 and 7-7 per cent, in 1909.During 1919 it ranged between 1-6 per cent, in September and 3-2 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.During 1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent, in April and 60 per cent, in December, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 were : To the end of  Per cent.January ...         ... ... ... ... 6-9February             ... ... ... ... 8-5March     ...         ... ... ... ... 100April      ...         ... ... ...... 17-6May....... ......... 22-2June      ...         ... ......... 231July............ ... 16-7August   ...         ... ... ... ... 16-3September            ... ... ... ... 14-8October   ...         ... ... ... ... 15-6November            ... ... ... ... 15-9December            ... ... ... ... 16-5The figures for 1922 are:  To the end of January ...         ... ... ... ... 16-8February             ... ... ... ... 16-3March    ...         ... ... ... ... 16-3April     ...         . . ... ... ... 170May       ...         ... ... ... ... 16-4June      ...         ... ... ... 15-note. In some items in the Report the figures given relate to Great Britain and Ireland, in others to Great Britain only. In each instance the scope of the figures shown is clearly stated. Where figures relate to works financed partially by the Government, or to other expenditure from Government funds, they have in all cases been given for the area (Great Britain only, or Great Britain and Ireland together, as the case may be), the expenditure in respect of which is met by the British Government.

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.I.-SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the &apos;8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot;uncovenanted&quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to June 30, 1922. (Figures for Northern and Southern Ireland are included up to the 31st December, 1921, and the 1st April, 1922, respectively.)Unemployment benefit and dependants&apos; benefit paid      86,862,000Contributions from Employers        ... ... ... ...      20,912,000Employed persons ... ... ...      19,098,000State       ... ...... ... ...      12,381,000State (in respect of benefit for ex-regularsailors, soldiers and airmen)   ... ...       1,736,00054,127,000Balance of benefit paid over contributions (pro-vided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions) and advances by the Treasury amounting to  14,750,000 ...      32,735,000
(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 103,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR, EMPLOYED IN GREAT BRITAIN ,   AT JUNE 30, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.
