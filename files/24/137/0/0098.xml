OABIIIB?. PEP ARTI.!E FTAL. LEVIES . Ijcincu by the Solicitor-General. fO.P. 4C96)The above paper is circulated with reference to Item 1 on the Agenda paper for to-day!s meeting of the Home Affairs Committee.2, Whitehall Carders, s.T., July llth. 1982.
ENT IS THE PROPERTY OP EIS BRIOkilWIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT^CABINET.DEPARTMENTAL LEVIES Memorandum by the Solicitor General. w1.      It is plain that the Treasury cannot sacrifice the fifteen million sterling involved In the levies mentioned in CP. 3771 unless their retention or enforcement would in the eye of Parliament be contra bonos mores. 2.      The two objections which v/ill be urged are(a) That the necessary legislation will be retrospectiveIn character; and(b) That retrospective taxation is the worst form ofretrospective legislation.3.     The Government of the day, whether the present government or its predecessor, which was responsible for the impositionof the levies, obviously was of opinion that the levies wereright and proper.     To satisfy Parliament to-day it willbe necessary to show that had the Executive Government gone to Parliament at the time It would have been able to show good grounds for the legislation that levy was In eachcase merely machinery for carrying out a policy already approved by Parliament and that to rescind the levy to-day,(aa would be done If the decision of the House of lords in Wilts United Dairies case were allowed to operate),would result in greater political injustice than if the levies were made retrospectively valid.4.     Some of the levies are less in the nature of taxationthan others and might even conceivably stand the test oflitigation in the Courts.    One type is instanced by theCotton Excess Spindles Scheme and the Cattle Feeding StuffsScheme (Items 13 and 9), in which no money was received bythe Government although the original levy was in the natureof a Government Edict to pay.     Another type is afforded-1-
by Item No. 5 (Imported Meat), whereby although the Government did not purport to impose a tax, It achieved a comparable result by a general requisition of all supplies and an Order that twopence per lb. should be remitted in certain cases to the Ministry of Pood by the Selling agent.    On the other hand, the 25/- a barrel for a licence to brew extra beer, (Item No.4) or the 15 per cent, for licences to transfer British Ships to foreign flags   (.Item No. 11), seem to be mere taxation with even less disguise than the twopence in the milk case.    Yet in both these cases the levy had the political justification of being an attempt to prevent excessive profiteering and of being apparently the only available method of achieving that object.      The  7,000,000 Involved in the licences to use flour for precluded purposes (Item No. 2) had not only the justification of an anti-profiteering measure but also was the result of the general scheme for the control of bread and the sale of the loaf at a moderate price.    If the charge for the licence had not been made the buyers so licensed would have made a large personal profit at the expense of the general taxpayer, who would have been called upon to:provide  7,000,000 more by way of bread subsidy.5.&apos;    Even if a legal distinction could be drawn In regard to the validity of certain of the levies, I submit that it Is better House of Commons tactics to include the whole of the levies in the one Bill for the express purpose of shewing the House that there is a common characteristic running through them all,    namely,    the desire of the Government to mete out equality of treatment under the regime of control in order to prevent individuals profiting unduly either in comparison with other members of the same
trade or at the expense of the community as a whole.    If this characteristic be borne in mind it should, I think, bo possible to satisfy the EouEe that although legally the levies may have been in a technical sense taxation, they were in a truer sense merely machinery- for carrying out the policy so often and so expressly endorsed by Parliament, that the exigencies of the-war and Government control should not be used unduly by individuals for their private profit.In conclusion I would suggest that stress should be laid in the Second Reading Speech in support of the Bill(a) on the difficulty, even to-day, of devising bettermachinery for achieving the Government&apos;s purpose at the time:(b) on the exceptional measure of discretion accorded byparliament to the Executive by the Defence of the Realm Acts, and Hew Hinistriee and Secretaries Act, 1916, whereby as a matter of doliberate policy parliament entrusted to the Executive legislative powers which in normal times belonged to parliament and not to the Executive;    and(c) on the fact that Parliament, even after the armistice and down to late in the year 1920,  intentionally left in the hands of the Executive the greater part of those discretionary powers for the purpose of getting through the abnormal times which followed the war and were more like a time of war than a time of peace.LESLIE SCOTT.
