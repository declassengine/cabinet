JLjO^Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]T.       7&amp;JSECRET.Printed for the War Cabinet:&apos; December 11)18.A  GROWING  AND  GRAVE  DIFFICULTY.I CIRCULATE a memorandum which has been prepared by Sir Thomas Munro.                                            WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.December 3, 1918.       During the past week it has been made abundantly clear that  there is  very deep  resentment on the part of workers on two main  points.   All  classes of workers are  united, but the strongest expressions of opinion reach the Department from discharged  sailors and soldiers.  The points are :        1. Too  rapid  discharges, especially at National Factories. The arguments need  not be elaborated, but it may be said that  it is  bluntly put that  the Government have  used and praised the workers while the war was still to win, and now that it  is won no  consideration is being shown.   Strong  criticism is  also directed against the policy of  using certain well-equipped factories as storehouses, instead  of adapting them to Peace  industries.   All  arguments as to  the  expediency  of  the course the Government is  forced to pursue have  been put before  the several deputations that have been received,  but little impression has been made.       2. The inadequacy of the out-of-work Benefit Scheme and the guaranteed  minimum  earnings  of  24s. and rl()s. respectively are  strongly animadverted  on. It is pointed out  that neither gives a living wage, and the demand is made for an increase to 50s. and  60s. respectively.       Here again argument and explanations make no impression.       The  risk that exists, and which cannot be overlooked, is that a dangerous situation  may arise at any moment if large numbers of workers are thrown out of employment  during the next few  weeks without  adequate provision to tide over  the  period of  transition to Peace industry.  The workers say the Government were spending millions  per day to win the war, and, now that  the war  has  been won through the exertions of  the people,  they grudge the much smaller expenditure that would keep the workers in  comfort!       I am bound to point out that the situation requires consideration.  I am  especially  apprehensive of the attitude of discharged sailors and soldiers, who are banded together  in an association which is insistent on its demands and somewhat aggressive.       Two solutions, both of which are full of difficulty, suggest themselves :        1. To slow down materially the rate of discharges to carry over the critical period,             to  say  1st  January,  when the  possibilities  of employment  on Peace             industries may  be more clear ;  or,       2. To raise the rate of unemployment benefit and the guaranteed minimum wage.       The  former proposal would be a  matter for your determination, while  the latter  would be for the Minister of Labour.   But as both  are relative  to each other, I thinkj  the problem is  one for consultation, and ultimately, in view of what  appears to meI  the seriousness of the situation, for Cabinet decision.                                                            THOMAS MUNRO.       December 1st, .1918.
