OFFICERS AMD MEN:  AND TUB QUESTION OF NAVALfoiralty Memorandum for tho War Cabinet by tho Financial           Secretary to the Adairalty.u.L/.lS,          Under existing Army regulations,  gratuities are payable to temporary Army Officers,   Gratuities to&quot;&quot;!! on-coramissioned officers and mon&apos; of the Array were announced by the Leader of  the House on November 20th, 1918*          As regards Temporary Naval  Officers,  for many many months the Admiralty/ which has been pressed in the  House of Commons, has endeavoured to secure gratuities on precisely similar lines to those awarded under Army  Reflation 497 to  Temporary  Amy Officers.   It has so far failed to  seai.ro Treasury agreement, though in the last resort, at the instance of  the Treasury and in order to get something done, it has  proposed  to the Treasury  a scale of gratuities for Temporary Naval Officers lower in amount than the Army scale.        -  Whilst taking this  course,  the Admiralty has consistently rcsistdd the suggestion that gratuity has-anything to do whatever with Prize.  It has met the  invitation to suggest&apos;a lower scale because, whilst the Army has a vested right in Article 4.97 (which prescribes the gratuity to temporary Array officers), the Navy has nothing of the kind, and therefore the Board of Admiralty failing to get a. scale on  that basis had been prepared  - altogether without reference, I must insist once again,  to the fact that certain officers and men of tho Navy vail receive Prize money - to prepare a scheme for temporary Naval officers upon a, lower basis.  That scheme, as I have said,  is not yet agreed.          When announcing the gratuities to the non-commissioned officers and men of the Army and Air Force on November 20, the Leader of the House added -   &quot;A further announcement will be made with regard to the Royal      Navy, as well as to the gratuity to be paid to Regular      officers of the Royal Navy and  the Army&quot;.          The Barnes&apos; War Cabinet Committee on Soldiers&apos;  and .Sailors&apos; Pay has adopted a scale of gratuities for the Lower DeckOf the Navy corresponding to  that announced by  the Leader of theHouse on November 20th, 1918, for the Army and Air Force,          But it is the contention of the War  Office, supported-by the Treasury and Air Ministry, that as regards not only thoscales for the men, but the scales for officers, temporary and permanent, in the case of the Navy throughout  regard Jaust M..          It is with the view of contesting that contention that the following arguments  are adduced &apos;:-                                                (1) Naval.......
(1)  Naval Prize,  &quot;by.ancient custom and grace of  the  Crown,      is older than the Navy as at present established.      It is first  mentioned&quot; in the Black Book of  the  Admiralty,      which goes hack to the days  of Richard the  First,(8)  It has been deliberately agreed to continue  it for     . this war.  Royal Proclamation has been made awarding      Droits of  the Crown (Naval Prize) to the Fleet.  This      being so,  Prize Money cannot be tampered with in any      way.  It now it is proposed  to grant Prize  in lieu of      gratuity:  or to abate Prize  by the amount of gratuity:      or if the  gratuity be the greater to abate  gratuity by      the amount of Prize:  any one of these courses is      undoubtedly  an improper interference with the definite      declaration  of the pleasure  of the Crown in the Royal      Proclamation of August 15th.  1918.(ft)  I need not  say that any attempt to tamper with Prize      in any way would not  only cause the greatest possible      bad feeling  in the Fleet, but I am convinced would       cause no  less indignation in the country,  whose sense      of the  .  ^dominating influence exercised by  the      jJleet in this war is  perfectly clear and pronounced,(4)  The War Office proposition is that if the Navy is to      get a gratuity similar to that announced by the Leader      of the&quot;House for the  Army on Wednesday,  20th November,      the amount of. that gratuity,  must Jbe.jtbatejLJfaL.tM      amount of  prjlfle, few L received.&apos;(5)  The answer  which  Mr. Bonar Law gave implied  - and it 70s      clearly the  intention of the War Cabinet Committee      at that moment that the Navy gratuity should be the      same as the  Army, without abatement in respect  of      Prize Money.(&apos;6)  The War Office proposition therefore is a re-opening      in effect  of a&apos;question already determined.(7)  The War Office contention is        (a) That in the past the Army got loot; the Navy             got Prize Money.  The one balanced the other.        (b) That loot  being abolished,  the gratuity takes             its place,        (c) Prize  Money is.  the counterpoise of the Army  in             lieu  of lootI U 9(8)  If I accept  the War Office contention that  so  far as      the Army is concerned gratuity  takes the place of loot.,      then the contention that  in fixing a Navy  gratuity      regard must be had to the award of Prize,,  falls.      Because,  prior to  the abolition of loot, the  Navy got      Prize Money and were also entitled to share in any loot      captured by them on shore.   Therefore the  claim of      the Navy to gratuity in lieu of loot rests upon the      same ground as the claim of the Army,(9)  After the abolition of loot,  the Army got a gratuity  as      in the case of the South  African war,&quot; The Navy got      both gratuity  and  Prize Money.                            (10)....
(1Q) I therefore contend - and this  is  the moat  emphatic      view of the Board of Admiralty -  that Prise  Money      must stand by itself as the unique) perquisite  of      the Navy gained by their efforts  at sea.(11) Prize Money does not involve a  grant of money by      Parliament.(12) The amounts of Prize Money to those who will  get it      vail probably be at least  5,  and may be more, to the      Able Seaman up to  2,000 or more  to the CoiTimander-in-      Chief of the Grand Fleet,(13) It certainly will not be paid for  tho next  twelve      months.(14) To tell these officers and men  now that when  the time      for the distribution of Prize  Money comes, they will      only receive the difference between their  share of      prize Money and the gratuity if the former is  larger      than the latter,  is a proposal which the Board of      Admiralty would&apos;view with the  greatest possible regret,      both on the grounds of equity  and expediency.(15) Finally, $avy and Recruiting advertisements for men      issued under authority held out the prospect of Prize.      I vd 11 bring to the War Cabinet a copy of  the  poster      issued in 19020 in which reference is made to  Prize under      the heading of &quot;Privileges&quot;.(16) Prize Money under the King&apos;s Regulations is distributable      to the Ship\s Companies and Marines under  a  scale;  so      much is this regarded as part  of  the emoluments  of  a      Naval  rating that in Appendix XV, Part I  of the      King&apos;s Regulations and Admiralty  Instructions  is  set      forth tbe&apos;number of Prize shares  which is  assigned  to      each, rating.
