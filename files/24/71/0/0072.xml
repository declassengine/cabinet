FLAX.

Scutching Operations.

Scutching operations are still somewhat retarded owing to the epidemic of influenza, which, however, appears to be abating.

Labour Disputes.

The strike of scutchers in the mill in Co. Antrim, referred to in last week&apos;s report, has been amicably settled. Reports have been received of strikes in several mills in districts in Counties Down, Mayo and Wicklow. It appears that in Co. Down the scutchers on strike were being paid on piece rate terms, and are now  demanding to be paid on time rates. In Mayo and Wicklow the strikes are due to the scutchers demanding to be paid full wages in the event of a suspension of work through a breakdown of machinery.

The Secretary of the Ulster Flax Scutchers&apos; Union has submitted a claim to the Department for an advance of scutchers&apos; wages to 2s. per stone (the present rate, fixed by the Wages Court, being 1s. 7d. per stone). He has also informed the Department that many of the scutchers are considering the stopping of work unless they are better paid. The Department will have this claim considered at the next meeting of their Flax Advisory Committee.

Disposal of Tow.

Reports have been received by the Department of millowners contravening the Scutch Mills (Ireland) Order, 1918, by retaining their customers&apos; tow in part payment of their scutching charges, and of buying the tow by bulk instead of by weight. Those irregulatities have been referred to the Flax Supplies Committee, who have control of the administration of the above Order.

The Department have been informed that millowners in some districts have been buying the unscutchee tow from  their customers at prices much under its value. With a view to checking this abuse, the Department have arranged to publish each week in the local papers the current prices of tow in various markets and centres.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 3rd to 9th instant, inclusive, 256 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 80 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks and 150 applications for licences to export milch cows were received.
