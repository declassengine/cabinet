                 Mil t -  .....----                 INPREASE IN THE OUTPUT OK BEER*?                 INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE GRAVITY.                     REVISION CP RETAIL PRICES...                 MEMORANDUM BY THE POOD CONTROLLER.     I desire again to bring to the notico of the War Cabinet the pressing question of Beer, its output,-its gravity and its price.There Is much discontent at the present time owing to the smallquantity, tho poor quality and tho high price of Beer and I am convinced of the urgent need of an immediate amendment of the presentposition with a view to allaying unroote     In a memorandum to the War Cabinet (G.T.6262) dated November12th, last I pressed for an increased output.  The matter was, however,postponed by the Oabinot mainly because there 30cmed some doubt asto there being an adequate supply of cereals to permit of theproposed Increase.     Since then careful investigation has satisfied me that anadequate supply of cereals exists to permit of the proposed increasewithout detriment to the requirements for human food or animal feeding stuffs.     The increase proposed is 25$ or 3,060,000 bulk barrels whichwould make a total output of 25,320,000 bulk barrels.   This quantityis less than half tho pre-war standard barrelage.     I understand that the Liquor Control Board arc strongly,in favourof an increased output.     With regard to quality I-propose to permit an increased averagestrength of 2 degrees ^ yfoich  Brewers may brew their total permittedoutput-   This would make.tho Boer more palatable Jat present thereare many complaints on this score) and at the same timQ hardly affectits  intoxicating capacity,     The revision of prices is  perhaps the most pressing  consideration.At present, although prices aro fixed for certain beers sold In  thopublic bar, unlimited prices  can bo and are charged for boers sold  \in other placesa  Tho attitude  taken  by the  Brewers is that no                                                     alteration/
     alteration  of  the  present  prices  is  necessary  but  I  am satisfied  that     it  is  essential  and that the  scale suggested would prove  equitable  to     all parties.   It is most important for commercial  and administrative     reasons  that any revision  of  prices  should take  effect as ^rom the     beginning of the quarter.   I  should  like  to.be able  to announce that     tho change  will  take effect as  from  January 1st  next^ and it  is only     fair to  the Trade  that  at  least a fortnight f.a  notice should be given, j6,        The  above  recommendations do hot conflict  in any respect  with the [     &quot;nine  points&quot;  programme recently put forward by  the  Temperance Council     with which  the Prime Minister has expressed general  agreement,7,       The attached schedule shows  the proposed revision of prices.C,       I ask the War Cabinet to approve  the recommendations made  in     paragraphs  3,  4, and 5 hereof,                                                 J.R.
