SHIPS TO ASSIST IN R3-7I0TO\LLINGN^i^/yfev     GERMANY DURING THE ARMISTICE.I        V\        -------------8 I Mj^I^J L^fopiralty Memoranda for the War OaMnot.s^sssssss^    The  Admiralty have had under consideration tho Terms upon which Gentian Merchant Ships  should be taken over and used for  the purpose  of re-victualling Germany during the Armistice, or for any other purpose for which the Allied Maritime Transport Council may require to employ thorn.           It is thought that in any arrangements which are made the  following principles should be givon effect to    (a) That tho  ships should be handed over unconditionally         by Germany to the Associated Governments :    (b) That it is most undesirable that the ships should be         manned by Germans, and that,therefore, they should be         manned by the Allies and  the United States,   It is         obvious  that Groat Britain alone cannot provide the         number of Officers and men required to man the ships:    (c) That the  crews provided should bo under naval discipline         and employed under much the same conditions as in British         armed merchant cruisers.           If the  foregoing principles be adopted, it is suggested that the  following Terms should be made applicable :-    (1) The ships to be handed over unconditionally to tho         Associated Governments but without prejudice to their        , ultimate disposal in accordance with the Terms of Peace.    (2) The ships to be handed over in Allied Ports by German         crews who will bo repatriated, and to be in a complete         and efficient state in all respects.    (3) The ships on leaving German Ports in tho first instance,         and on each subsequent occasion, to have complete bunkers,         steaming stores and equipment generally.    (4) The Flag  to be hoistod to  depend on tho nationality of         the crew manning the ship... the Allied Maritime Transport         Council  Flag to be flown  as a House Flag.    (5) The ships to be manned by  British, Allied or TJ*S. A.Naval         Crews, those manned by British crews  being controlled         similarly to British armed merchant cruisers.           . (The  crows required for this purpose may amount to            4,000 Officers, 4,000  Engineers&quot;, 50,000 ratings  of            which rather moro  are  firemen   than dock hands.)     (6)  The  foregoing Terms to apply also to German ships in         Neutral  Ports, Germany making, all  necessary arrangements          for  the  purpose.           The  above-mentioned proposals are put before the War  Cabinet with a view to obtaining  the  concurrence of the; Allied and  Associated G-governments, and the detailed application of the Terms  -  oan  be  subsequently discussed between the  Allied Maritime Transport  Council,  the  Ministry  of  Shipping and the  Admiralty, together  with  Naval representatives  of  any  of the other Allies who undertake &apos;  to provide  crews.1/12/18.(Signed)  ERIC GEDDES
