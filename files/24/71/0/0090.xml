Intelligence Division.     Education Branoh.    Land hunger is still the inspiration of alarge number of the letters reaching the Education Branch, and the taking over of this correspondence by the new Officers&apos; Training Branchwill afford relief for  attention to the normal work of the Branch,whish is especially pressing at this period of the year,  when theestimates for educational and research work during the coming yearhave to be prepared for submission to the Development commissioners and( the Treasury.          Efforts are being made to secure the early release ofagricultural teachers from the Forces and the evacuation of the collegebuildings in military occupation.

Horses and additional labour have been employed  onpotato-lifting  during the week.   With fine weather  it  is hoped  tocomplete  this work  next week, the persistent ruin  having  seriouslyimpeded  operations.   In  the circumstances,  the  storage  of thepotatoes  in  a very  damp  condition has  been unavoidable.           The  settlers  are  making good progress  and  livestock  are  onthe  whole  doing well.   HeathJHill.   Manure  carting  has  been oarried  on all  the week.   Asthe  soil  is  still too wet  for corn-drilling, it  is not  proposed todrill any more  before February  next.    The  exact aoreages drilledwill be  furnished next  week.      Tithe,  Commons,  Copyhold and  Survey Branch.   During the  past week the  number of applications for information regarding titheredemption procedure  have increased to 400  and indicate the  ...probability  of a considerable  increase in the  near future in both the size and the number of  applications  for redemption.   It is understood that among other public bodies, the Great Western Railway, the London and Worth Western Railway,  the  Hertfordshire County Council, and theLondon County.Council are considering the question of redeeming titherentcharge on their properties.   There is reason to believe that inmany instances the redomptioners will, under the recent Act, apply to the  Board to determine that  the redemption  money be discharged by an annuity.           At the outbreak of war the consideration of eortain applications for the Board1s consent to the taking ef portions ofcommon
common land for public undertakings under various Acts of parliament were postponed,   Among these was an application under the light railways Acts, 169G and 1912, by the promoters cf the Gower PeninsulaLight Railway for permission to take 27 acres of common land situatedGlamorganshire.   The promoters are now urging that the matter  should proceed.   In addition to other arguments in favcur of their proposalsthey say that the undertaking will benefit agriculture, and in  thisconnection it may be noted that the Glamorganshire AgriculturalExecutive Committee have recommended that a Light Railway should  be constructed in the District.   The Board are in communication with theLight Railway Commissioners in the matter.inKelham Estate  In view of the shortage af housing accommodationEstate, it has been deoided to increase the number                                             Thesefor labour upon thesf cottages to be built in the first instance  from two  to  six.are to be built from reinforoed concrete,  and  prices are being obtained.

Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture                  and  .  Fisheries and Ministry cf Pood.          Prom letters received during the  past  week it  appearsevident that the distribution of feeding stuffs  to  priority  olassesof stock is not working as efficiently as. is  desirable,  and  the Ministryof Pood have been advised withregard to this.Conferences
respectively.   At the Kent and E. Sussex meeting,  representatives ofthe Ministry of Food were present and many points of difficultyraised by the Representatives were satisfactorily dealt with.          Arising out of the Kent oonferenoe,  it appears that considerable stocks of threshed corn are at present being refused &quot;bymillers, and much irritation is expressed at the inability of  farmers to obtain the maximum controlled price of first quality corn.This state of affairs seems general, and correspondents in Suffolkstate that rye in particular  is at present unsaleable.                            Ordnance Survey.

The proposed accommodation of a  section  of the Board&apos;staff in Norfolk  Street, Strand,  has not been  proceeded with.   the distance of  the premises from headquarters  is  considered too greatto admit of  satisfactory arrangements  being made for the particularwork of this section  to be  carried  on, and  it  will be  necessary tomake other arrangements.          The  concentration of  the  Board&apos;s  staff including the slaffof the  Food  Production Department and  other Sub-Departments recommended!by the  Treasury Committee  on Organisation  and  Staffing of government offices follows the recommendation  of  previous Committeen.   Nething,however, ean be done  to  give effect to it  whilst the Ministry  ofMunitions retain  possession of  Armanent Building which was specially designed and built  for  the  Board&apos;s  accommodation,  - unless anotherbuilding of  sufficient  size and suitability oan be provided.          Meamvhile  the  difficulties of the Board  in regard to accommodation must  increase and will very seriously  impede the important operations  connected  with several large  schemes of agricultural development which the  Board  are  oalled upon to undertake immediately.   The  matter  cannot be too strongly urged.Statistical
                     Statistical Division.     Statistical Branch *   Tho staff have been engaged mainly r,n the monthly live stock returns, the tabulation of stocks of potatoeson the 1st December, and tho preparation of f oxmfc  pr farmers&apos;stocks for next season.          Work on arranging districts for the agricultural returnshas also be*n in progress, and draft instructions to the Reportersare being drawn up.          The return of sea fish landed last month shows-aconsiderable increase  over November, 1917, viz, 682,000, as against357,000 cwts, the increase being in herrings,   The value of theseherring3 (per owt.) io lower than last year, and - mainly as aresult of the inclusion of the oheaper class of fish, the averagevalue of all fish per  cwt* shows a considerable reduction from ayear ago.     Agricultural&quot;frages Bpard.   During last week 84 new oapes of complaint were received, the&quot;^largest number from any single countybeing 19 in the case of Hampshire;  13 cases were sent to the inspectors for visit:  enquiries by correspondence were made  inG6 cases, and 13 cases were oompleteda   Reports were receivedfrom Inspectors in 16  cases.
