&apos;i[This Documeai;js^the  Property of His Britannic Majestyj GoveramemJ               Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1918.SECRET.G.T-6411.OUR  ATTITUDE  TOWARDS  THE EX-KAISER.     Statement by the Attorney-General at Meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on                          Thursday, November 28, 1918.     THE  PRIME  MINISTER:  I  want, to get  a decision  from the Imperial WarCabinet on the  question of the prosecution of the ex-Kaiser..  We must come to a conclusion  in view  of the fact that M. Clemenceau  is  coming over here at the end ofthis  week.   The French jurists have advised the prosecution of  the ex-Kaiser by theAllies, and  I understand the French  are strongly in favour of it.   We decided to refer the matter  to  the Law Officers  of the Crown, and I  invited them to be present hereto-day to  express  their views.  They  appointed a  very powerful Committee-aspowerful a body of legal advisers  as you  can call together to advise on this andother matters, and  they have been, considering this question for  some time.  I under-stand that  they have come to a conclusion which is a perfectly unanimous one, and Ithink the Attorney-General had better explain to the Cabinet what the position is.     SIR FREDERICK SMITH: Prime Minister, Lord Curzon conveyed to the LawOfficers of the Crown some days ago the  desire of  the Cabinet that they should give their opinion  on  this matter.  The Law Officers pointed out  the  extreme importance,delicacy, and difficulty  of the matter submitted to  them, and the fact that they  them-selves were very much  engaged in other matters, and  asked what period of time could resonably  be allowed them to produce a written opinion adequate to the gravity  of thetopic.   Lord  Curzon  at  that  time took  the view  that they  might  be  allowedten  days.   Well,  of these ten days, only, I think,  four or  five have elapsed, andtherefore the  Cabinet  will excuse any  imperfection of form  in the statement Iam  about  to make.   We have, however, arrived  at a  clear  conclusion,  other-wise  we should have  informed the Cabinet that  we  were not yet  in a  positionto give definite  and final advice.  The matters involved here  are partly legal andpartly matters of  policy.   So  far as  they  are matters of policy, the Cabinet will ofcourse merely treat our views as the opinions of  colleagues. who are not  entitled  to,and  who are not claiming, any special weight.  The  main question here which  we, in common with our Allies, have to consider is whether the taking of proceedings against,or any punitive treatment in relation to, the Kaiser should become the declared  policyof the Government.   The Law Officers of the Crown answer  this question in the affirmative.  They  point out to the Cabinet that the choice now to be taken is  between two diametrically opposed courses, and that no half-way house is possible in the matter.The first is a decision in favour of complete impunity, an impunity which will be described as luxurious and  wealthy ;  the second is in favour of punishment.   We wish the Cabinetto consider very  carefully how it will be possible for them to justify a decision in favourof impunity.   The  ex-Kaiser&apos;s personal  responsibility and  supreme  authority  inGermany have  been  constantly asserted  by himself,  and  his  assertions are fullywarranted by the constitution of Germany.  Accepting, as we must, this  view, we are bound to take  notice  of the conclusion which follows : namely, that  the  ex-Kaiser is primarily and personally responsible for the death of millions of  young men ; for thedestruction in four  years of 200 times as much material wealth as Napoleon destroyed in twenty years ; and he is responsible and this is  not  the least  grave part of theindictment for  the most daring  and  dangerous  challenge  to  the  fundamental principles of public law which  that  indispensable charter of international right  hassustained since its foundations were  laid centuries  ago by  Grotius.  These things arevery  easy  to understand, and  ordinary  people  all  over  the  world  understandthem  very  well.    How  then,  I  ask,   are  we  to  justify impunity ?   Underwhat   pretext,   and with what degree  of  consistence, are  we to  try  smaller       [1043]                                                             B
 criminals?    Is   it   still   proposed it  has   been   repeatedly  threatened  by the responsible representatives of  every Allied country-to  try, in  appropriate  cases, submarine  commanders and to bring to justice  the  governors  of  prisons ?  Is it proposed to indict the murderers of Captain Fryatt ?   In my view, you must answer all these questions in the affirmative.   I  am at least  sure that the democracies  of the world will take that view, and among them I  have no doubt that the American people will be numbered.   How can you do this if, to use the title claimed  by himself, and in itself illustrative of my argument, &quot; the All Highest &quot; is given impunity ?  Must we not, at the moment of our triumph, avoid the sarcasm : &quot; Dat veniam corvis vexat censura columbas ? &quot;  In order  to illustrate the  point which  is in my mind I will read  to the Imperial  War Cabinet a very short extract, which represents our view with admirable eloquence, from Burke&apos;s speech in the trial of Warren Hastings :-          &quot; We have not brought before you an obscure offender,  who,  when his     insignificance and weakness are weighed against the power of the prosecution,     gives even to public  justice something of the appearance of oppression ; no, my     Lords, we have brought before you the first man of India in rank, authority, and     station.   We have  brought before you the  chief of the tribe, the head of the     whole body of  eastern offenders; a captain-general of  iniquity, under whom all     the fraud, all the peculation, all the  tyranny in  India  are embodied, disciplined,     arrayed, and paid.  This is the person, my Lords, that we bring before you.   We     have brought  before you such a person, that, if you strike at him with the firm     and  decided arm  of justice, you will  not  have need of a  great  many  more     examples.  You strike at the Avhole corps if you strike at the head.&quot;     Prime  Minister, in my  judgment, if this ma^n  escapes, common people will say everywhere that he has escaped because he is an Emperor.   In my judgment they will be right.   They will say that august influence lias  been exerted to save him.  It is not  desirable  that  such  things  should  be said,  especially in these days.  It is necessary for all time  to  teach the lesson that failure is not the only risk which a man  possessing at  the  moment in any country despotic powers, and taking the  awful decision between Peace and  War, has to fear.   If ever again that  decision should be suspended in nicely balanced equipoise, at the disposition of an individual, let the ruler who decides upon war know that he is gambling,  amongst other hazards, with his own personal safety.     For these reasons we think the ex-Kaiser should be punished. If this view is accepted, the question arises : How is his person to be secured ?  And the question has been asked, and will  be asked,  whether  or  not he can be extradited.  Now, Sir, the French have apparently expressed  the view that he can. My own  clear opinion is that that view is wrong, and  I  think my colleague, the Solicitor-General, is, on the  whole, of the same opinion; but it is not necessary to argue  that  question,  because we do not propose to involve ourselves in a doubtful technical argument when we have more powerful weapons at our disposal.   Infinite vistas of litigious disputations are opened by an argument whether according to the law of Holland he can be extradited or not.  And if, contraryto my opinion, he could be extradited, he could  only be charged for the very offence(possibly  a limited one) which had been  successfully alleged as the  ground in law of  his  extradition.   I think it is  unnecessary  to  ask whether  in  law  we canextradite  him, because  it seems  to  me that Holland must, in effect, give him up.   The League  of  Nations,  or  the  Conference  of   the  Allies which  willprecede   the   formation  of   the  League   of  Nations,  has,   or  will   have,powerful  arguments  to  address to Holland, and  the internal condition of Hollandseems to  me to be  such that it would be very difficult for her to reject  arguments of the kind indicated.  This  is not a point of  law, but my own conclusion is that thedifficulty of obtaining control of the person of  the ex-Kaiser from Holland will not bean insuperable one, though I  should naturally defer to the views of the Foreign Officeupon such a point.   It may perhaps be assumed that the difficulty will not arise whichwould be  occasioned in this  connection by the ex-Kaiser&apos;s return  to Germany.   the taking of  unnecessary risks has not up to the present been a distinguishing feature ofhis career.   Different considerations  might arise if  the reconstitution of  germany should really bring with it an honest desire to deal with the Kaiser themselves.     The few observations, therefore, which I have still to make will be made upon theassumption that it will be possible to obtain control of his person.  1 have made it clearthat in our judgment control should not be sought through the machinery of extradition.Supposing control of his person has been obtained, how is he to be dealt with ?  Thereare two alternative courses.  In  the first&apos; place, he might be  treated  by the Allies as
 Napoleon was treated, that is to say, by a high assertion of responsibility on the part of the  conquering nations.  The Allies might say :  We are prepared, before the bar of history, to take upon ourselves the responsibility for saying that this  man has been guilty of  high crimes and misdemeanours, that  he has broken the peace of the world, and that he ought either to be exiled or  otherwise punished in his own person.   That course may be recommended by powerful argument, and I do not myself exclude  it, Prime Minister.  I do not say more of it at this stage than this, that by its adoption we should avoid the risks  of infinite delays  and of a long drawn out impeachment. We should carry with  us  the  sanction  and support  of the overwhelming  mass of civilisation.  And we are bold enough to  feel that we  have nothing to  fear from  the judgment of  the future.   It is even  possible-as Austria  and  Germany will he reconstituted that there will  be  few dissentients in the governing classes  of  these countries.     The second alternative is that he should be  tried by a Court  which must evidently be international in  its composition.   There  are obvious advantages  in this method upon the  moral side if this method of  dealing with the situation be carried to a logical Conclusion.  It is, of course, very desirable that  we should be able to say that this man received fair-play, and  that he  has had a fair  trial, but grave  difficulties beset this course in its  complete application.  In  this connection,  how  is the Court  to be constituted &apos;?  Are neutrals to be members of the Court ?  Are  Germans to be members of the Court ?     The  only. advantage of judicial procedure  over  the  other alternative a high exercise  of executive and  conquering  force submitting itself  to the judgment  of history lies in the fact that for all time it may claim the sanction of legal forms and the  protection-in favour of the prisoner of a  tribunal whose impartiality can be established in the face of any challenge.   This advantage, it must be observed, largely disappears  if the fairness, of the  tribunal can be  plausibly  impeached.  The Law Officers are not, indeed,1 of opinion  that before a tribunal which consisted in part even of Germans, as Germany  appears to be developing to-day, an indictment would neces- sarilyfail.  But it is unwise to ignore the  difficulties.  German and neutral represen- tation would  undoubtedly he  claimed  by  the Kaiser.  We  can only  qualify  the consequent risk  by  saying that  the  German representatives  would  certainly be less German than they were, and the neutral representatives less neutral.     On  the whole,  if a  court  be  constituted,  I  confess that I  myself  incline on  the whole to the view that the members of the court should consist only of citizens of  the Allied countries.  Grave judges should be appointed, but we should, as it seems to me at present, take the risk of saying  that in this  quarrel we, the Allies,  taking our stand  upon  the universally  admitted principles of  the moral law, take our  own standards of right and commit the trial of  them to our own tribunals.     I cannot,  because  time is short,  develop the matter as  I should like now, and therefore  I merely place it on record that I am well aware that the opposite view may- be supported by formidable arguments.     The great question which I shall probably be asked and here again  inter-Allied discussion will be necessary is :  For  what offences, in your  view (assuming the adoption  of judicial  proceedings),  should the ex-Kaiser  be made justiciable?   The first  charge which  will occur  to  many  persons  is one which  raises in limine the question of his responsibility for the  origin of the war.  Well, Sir, I can only say, without giving a decision,  that the  trial of such  a charge would  involve infinite . disputation.  We do not wish  to  become involved  in  a trial  like that  of  Warren Hastings  in its infinite duration.  We do not wish to be confronted by a meticulous examination of the history of European politics for  the past twenty years.  It is very easy to see that no German advocate of the ex-Kaiser would find  it difficult to enlarge the area of discussion,  carrying  it to what would Be described  in Germany as the &quot; ringing round &quot; system, and discursively spreading from the question  of the origin of the war to a close  discussion of the military significance of the Russian  strategic railways.   The view which I have at present is that  it would  not be wise to add so general a charge, but this provisional view might easily be modified if new and decisive documents were produced, like those recently disclosed by the Bavarian  Minister, who was in Berlin in. August 1914.  Such revelations are very likely to be made. ,    The second charge  is extremely clear, and it is, in  my judgment, a  decisive one.A  count  should  certainly be inserted in  the indictment charging the Kaiser  with.responsibility for the invasion of Belgium in breach of International Law and for all the consequent criminal acts which took place.  That is an absolutely  clear issue, and upon it I do not think that any honest tribunal could hesitate.   It is even possible, obscure as      [1043]                                                   &quot;         B i
the present position  in  Germany is, that  a  partly German tribunal  convened under existing circumstances in Germany would reach the same conclusion    The next charge, in my judgment, which should be brought against him is that heis responsible in the matter of  unrestricted submarine  warfare.  It may  be necessaryto associate other defendants in  this  charge.   But it will,  in my judgment, be absoulutely impossible for us to charge  or punish  any subordinate  if  the ex-Kaiserescapes with impunity all responsibility for the submarine warfare.   I wish to  pressmost strongly  upon my colleagues certain fundamental  considerations  in  regard tosubmarine   warfare, as   it  has   been  carried  on   since  the  incident   of   the&quot; Lusitania.&quot;    Since then thousands of  women  and  children, in our clear and frequently  expressed view, have  been brutally  murdered.   I  am  dealing  withthe  case where  a  ship is  torpedoed   carrying  no   munitions   of war,   but which  it is  known  must  or  may  be  carrying  women  and children, and  whereit is equally known that such passengers had no possible means  of escape, and  I donot in this connection deal  with the vile cases  of assassination when  helpless boats,vainly attempting to  escape, have been  fired on and  destroyed.  Excluding the lastclass of cases, it is our view, and the view of the whole civilised world, that those actsamount to murder.  It is surely vital that if  ever there is another war, whether in tenor fifteen years, or however distant it may be, those responsible on both  sides for theconduct of that war should be  made to  feel  that unrestricted submarine warfare hasbeen so branded with the  punitive censure of the whole civilised world that  it hasdefinitely passed into the category of international crime.  &quot;If  1 do it  and fail,&quot; theTirpitz of the next war must say, &quot; I too shall pay for it in my own person.&quot;  How can we best secure that no one  in future will dream of  resorting to submarine warfare ofthis kind ?   You can best  secure  it by letting  the whole world know  that, by the unanimous  consent  of  the   whole of that   part  of  the  civilised   world  whichhas conquered  in this  war,  the man  responsible  for those  acts is responsible inhis own person for that which he has done.  To us of  all people it is not possible to exaggerate the  weight and  force of  these considerations.   Nothing   more  vitallyconcerns these islands than that it should be recognised that these acts are crimes.   Thecommission of  such  crimes, and their  possible future development, menace us  more directly than any other nation  in the world.    The above are suggestions, and not  necessarily exhaustive suggestions, in regard tothe offences for which the Kaiser should be tried.   There are other  individual  caseswith which I do not think it necessary to trouble the Cabinet at this stage:    It is true  that the Prime  Minister  authorised me to form a Committee to report upon these matters, but the Law Officers obviously cannot place their responsibility for advising the Government in legal matters in the hands of anybody else, and they havearrived at their  conclusions independently of the conclusions of this Committee, and,indeed, before they were informed  of them.  I think I ought to point out who are themembers who  compose  this Committee, which is  the Sub-Committee on Law of theMain Committee.  They are as follows :          Professor .T. H. Morgan (Chairman).         Sir John Macdonnell  (Chairman of the Main  Committee).  *         Sir Frederick Pollock.         Sir Alfred Hopkinson, K.C.         Mr. C. A. Russell, K.C.         Dr. Pearce Higgins.         Mr. Justice Peterson.         Mr. C. F. Gill, K.C.         Mr. J. F. More (of the War Office).Of these, Sir John Macdonnell, Mr. Justice Peterson, and Mr.  Gill are not members ofthe Sub-Committee on Law, but were called  in for the special  purpose  of discussing the new issue  as regards the ex-Kaiser.     THE PRIME MINISTER : That is a very strong Committee.     SIR FREDERICK SMITH:  I think the Lord  Chief Justice  will  agree  that itwould  not be possible  in this country to form a stronger  Committee for the purposeof arriving at a sound conclusion upon  such matters.   It is a source  of  satisfaction tothe Law Officers that this Committee has unanimously and  independently of themreached the conclusion that the ex-Kaiser ought to be punished, either  by way of trialor as Napoleon  was punished.   The Committee inclines  to the first of those courses,namely, that  he should be tried.   I am not  at present  wholly  convinced upon this
point, and, in the written opinion which the Solicitor-General and myself contemplate,we propose to discuss this matter in  greater  detail.  Probably I have said enough tomake the Cabinet aware of  the views held by the Law Officers.  I could, and would,have said  much more if I were not concerned to be economical of your time.  as chief Law Officer of the  Crown, I say quite plainly that I should feel  the greatest difficulty in being responsible in any way for  the trial of subordinate criminals if theex-Kaiser is allowed to escape.    THE  PRIME MINISTER: Have you anything to add, Solicitor-General?    SIR GORDON HE WART: No, Sir, I agree  with the Attorney-General.    THE  PRIME  MINISTER:  Unless someone has  anything  to say upon it, i suggest that we accept the Report of the Law Officers of the Crown.  The case hasbeen very ably stated  by the Attorney-General, and his views are  supported  by the strongest legal body that you can possibly summon together  in a matter of this kindin this country.  Does anyone dissent ?    MR. BARNES :  We are not committing  ourselves to the method, are  we?    THE  PRIME MINISTER: No,  we shall get a reasoned opinion on that point.I should like  to get it, if  I may say so, in  time for M. Clemenceaus arrival here.He  will be here on Sunday, if we could  get it before then  it would be a great advantage.    SIR FREDERICK SMITH: We will do our best.    THE  PRIME MINISTER: M.  Clemenceau  will  have the  views of the Frenchjurists as to the best method of  procedure.  Unfortunately they themselves will not be over here, otherwise it would be of great advantage if you could meet them and discussthe question.    SIR FREDERICK SMITH: Some of us have engagements in the provinces, butwe will do our best to let you have it.    LORD READING : Will you make any public statement in regard to this untilyou have had consultation with  the Allied Governments ?    THE  PRIME MINISTER: I  think we must leave that for consideration.    LORD READING: The only thing  that occurs to government  is that it might  createdifficulty with America ; that is all.    THE  PRIME MINISTER: America  must  paddle her own canoe.  We haveresponsibilities in this matter greater than hers.   Our sufferings have been very muchgreater.    SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I should like to make one observation;  I  have been much impressed by what the Attorney-General said as to the  undesirability of a long-drawn-out trial.  It may be, if judgment of some kind is  to be  passed upon theex-Kaiser, that it could be done more effectively by a resolution at the Peace Conferencethan by any trial.  I am not quite  sure that that would not be the best way.    SIR FREDERICK SMITH :  That is the point I tried to make-that I incline tothat view.    THE PRIME MINISTER :  That would require very careful examination with our allies.  I should like to await the report of the Law Officers, and also to know whetherthis Committee has gone into that point.    SiR FREDERICK SMITH : They have discussed it in great detail.  -    THE PRIME MINISTER: We will wait until we get those reports until  we make up our own minds.    SIR ROBERT BORDEN : I entirely agree.    SIR FREDERICK  SMITH: I will have the report of the Committee printed  assoon as we have our own report done.    MR.  BONAR  LAW :  Then  I  understand  the  decision of  the Imperial WarCabinet is that, so far as we have the power,  we intend to punish the ex-Kaiser.
    THE PRIME MINISTER : As the person responsible for these offences againstinternational law and against humanity.    SIR FREDERICK SMITH : As I shall myself be going to my constituency very soon, is one at liberty to say anything in that strain ?    THE  PRIME  MINISTER : I propose to say something to-morrow.  (To theChief of the Imperial General Staff): Have you any objection ?    GENERAL WILSON:  No, Sir.    2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,        November 28, 1918.
