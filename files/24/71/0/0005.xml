PROGRESS OF F? WORK.

Fine weather throughout the past week enabled much progress to be made with farm work, and reports state that considerable areas of winter wheat and oats were sown under exceptionally favourable circumstances.  The storage of root crops is proceeding satisfactorily, a sharp frost during the week serving as a reminder that no time should be lost in affording protection in exposed districts. Reports as to disease among potatoes stored in pits have become more numerous, particularly with regard to the old Champion variety.

At the mills winter wheat is still showing its superiority over that sown in spring, and this fact, coupled with the concession as to milling recently announced, is encouraging farmers to give greater attention to this crop.  From Dublin it is reported that early sown fields of winter whoat are now well brairded.  The ploughing of stubbles is now general throughout the country, farmers being anxious to take advantage of the present soil and weather conditions before a change occurs.

FLAX.

An Order is being prepared by the Ministry of Munitions, on the advice of the Department, fixing the charges for soutching flax and tow  at 4s.10½d. and 4s. per stone, respectively, in accordance with the recommendations of the Departmental Committee which recently made inquiries in the matter. Nor the purpose of their business, millownerns  were particularly anxious to ascertain immediately the rates of charges, and the Department have accordingly issued press notices announcing the charges recommended by the Committee.

Labour Disputes. Reports have been received by the Department that in several mills in C.J. Monaghan the  scutchers are threatening to strike unless they receive a considerable advance in their wages above the rates  fixed by the Wages Arbitration Court. It appears that in most districts scutchers are paid on piece rate terms as fixed by the Arbitration Court, and that the earnings of most of  these scutchers range from £2 to ?3 per  week, the average rate for the entire country being about £2.10. per week. The question of recommanding an advance in scutchers&apos; wages was considered at a  meeting of the Department&apos;s Flax Advisory Committee held on  the 22nd inst., and it was unanimously decided to take no action in the matter.

Trading of Flax:  Numerous complaints were received from farmers that an excessive proportion of the flax was  being put in the low grades, and that in consequence the average pri?  promised by the Government was not  being realised. In the past week markets the flax appeals to have been graded on a higher basic, and farmers now appear to be less dissatisfied.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

263 During  the period  from the 19th to 25th instant, inclusive, ? applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 80 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks and 165 applications for licences to export milch cows were received.

One licence was granted permitting of the exportation of three in-oalf Kerry heifers.
