Colonel  W. Dally Jones.SECRET.ocument  Is the Property ofMINISTRY   OF   FOOlr-AU S^ort for  Week  ending Wednesday,  December  11,  1918,    Mr. Clynes has addressed  a  letter  to the Chairmen of Pood Control Committeesthroughout the country.   In this letter Mr. Clynes expresses the confident hope thathis successor, whoever lie may be, will  not  maintain the present  restrictions  a daylonger than the public  interest  demands.   At the same time he reminds the Com-mittees that the worlds food supply must still for a time give  ground for anxiety,and that.in large territories  of  Europe  there is  a danger of famine this winter.  Itwill, therefore, clearly be  necessary at least  during  the coming winter and  spring tocontinue the main safeguards for  a just and equal distribution of our food supplies which the necessities of the  war have led  us  to  establish.  Mr. Clynes appealsthrough  the  Committees to the  public to show as willing  a  spirit in supportingthese necessary safeguards as they have  shown in their maintenance during the yearsof war.    The Food Council. At  their meeting on December 5th, the  Food Council passed a hearty vote of congratulation  to the Chairman, Mr. Clynes, on his unopposed returnto Parliament.    After receiving  the report of the Sub-Committee appointed to consider  thequestion of differential rates for milk production the Council have recommended andMr. Clynes has approved that a travelling Commission should  be appointed with thefollowing terms of reference :            &quot; To report upon the costs  of milk production in various areas of Great       Britain during winter and summer periods  and upon  the  different methods of       production prevalent in  different  areas, and upon the approximate  quantities       of milk produced at different times of the year in those areas  by each method       of production.&quot;    In view of  representations made by the Milk Control  Board the Council haveagreed that Messrs. Nestle&apos;s use of liquid milk must be subordinated to  the  liquid milk requirements of London and other  parts of the country in  the event  of serious shortage.    The Council received a report from Sir Alan Anderson that he had  consultedwith the Treasury and found that they attached very great importance to starting our export trade in tea at the earliest possible moment.    It has been decided that customers may have an opportunity of changing theirretailers during the second fortnight in January.    After considering a memorandum  by  the Chairman of the Royal&apos; Commissionon  the Sugar Supply the Council agreed to an  increased  distribution  of sugar asfollows:     (1) Manufacturers to be allowed 50 per cent, of their 1915  sugar  allowance as           from December 29th (an increase of 74,000 tons).    (2) The allowance of  sugar in catering establishments to be  raised from l/7th to          3/l4ths oz. per meal as from December 29th.  By an amendment of  the          Rationing Order caterers to be entitled to  use their stocks to provide this          amount for their customers for Christmas (an increase of 5,000 tons).    (3) The domestic ration to  he raised from 8 ozs. to 12 ozs., as from February 1st           (an increase of 232,000 tons).    (4) 90,000 tons of sugar to be provided for jam-making between January 1st and           May 31st.  This amount is to be taken  as  an instalment of the 180,000           tons estimated as the jam allotment for the year, the amount  of  the issue          for the period after  May 31st to  be reconsidered if an increase appeared           necessary.    The Imports Board. The Chairman reported he had been instructed by the FoodCouncil to inform the Imports Board that  the present arrangements for  obtainingcredit from the &quot;United States for purchases would cease on the conclusion of peace.    A  (33)7008-2 Pk9 145 12/18  I&amp;S                                          A.PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.
    Negotiations are taking place with the Trade Commissioner for the Union ofSouth. Africa as to the purchase of the available supplies  of  eggs, estimated at 12,500long cases.    An application has been forwarded  to  the Treasury for sanction for the purchaseof 25,000 tons of cotton cake from Egypt.     The Board have agreed (a) that the Foreign Of nee should be  pressed for a freemarket to be allowed to the  trade for the purchase of lemons from Italy; (b) that thepurchase  of 10,000 tons of oranges  by the Orange Commission on  behalf  of theMinistry,  be proceeded with;  (c) that  the Ministry should  press  for the removal of import restrictions on oranges from all sources.     The  Board have decided  -that in  view of the cold storage position  they aredebarred from purchasing Canadian frozen fish.     The Consumers Council. The Council considered  and approved the proposal to renew this country&apos;s tea export trade.     The  draft interim  report  of the  Legalisation of Improvements Sub-Committeerecently appointed by the Council was  considered.   It  was decided that the report should go forward at once with the exception  of resolutions 5 and 6 (relating respec-tively  to the exhibition of prices in shops and  national kitchens) which were referred back to the Sub-Committee.     The  following  resolutions put forward  in  the  report were accepted  by theCouncil:            Resolution 1. We strongly request that the Food Controller impress  upon       the Government and  Parliament  the necessity of continuing, in  the form of       permanent legislation, the regulations made by him relating to the sale by nett       weight of the following articles :                Tea, bread, jam,  beans, peas  and pulse, wheat, rye, oats and  barley,         potatoes, canned  meat, horse mixtures  and poultry  mixtures and cattle         feeding-stuffs (other than wet brewers&apos; and distillers&apos; grains).           Resolution 2. (a) The Sub-Committee  approves of  the  regulations laid       down by the Food Controller prescribing certain  standards of  quality for the       following articles :-Compound lard, vegetable butter, vegetable lard, shredded       suet, dripping, jam, cocoa powder,  and margarine.   The  Sub-Committee are       of  opinion, that  such  regulations  be maintained in the form of permanent       legislation.           (6) With regard to  margarine  the Sub-Committee suggest that the first       and second standard  of margarine should be certified by Government analysis       and imprimatur and  no other margarine should be allowed to be sold.           (c) With regard  to sausages  the  existing  standards  are:  (i) Sausages       containing not less than 67 per cent,  of meat or  pork; and (ii) Sausages con-       taining not  less than 50  per  cent,  meat  or pork ;  and the Sub-Committee       suggest that no other sausages should be allowed to be sold.           Resolution 3. We approve of the work (in relation to milk  control) being       done by the Food Controller, and are of  opinion that it is absolutely necessary       to  exercise national  and municipal  control over the supply  and distribution       of milk,           Resolution 4.-In the opinion  of this Sub-Committee it is desirable that       the testing process embodied in the Testing of Seeds Order be made  part of       the permanent legislation of the country, and, if possible,  extended.           Resolution  7. (a)  The effectiveness and beneficial  results of  control       (including control of transport)  have been manifest in  keeping  the price of       commodities at a reasonable level to the consumer, and the Sub-Committee       will accordingly go more fully into  the  whole matter with a view to bringing       definite proposals before the Consumers&apos; Council for the co-ordination of the       different departments affecting the well-being of the people.            (b) That this  Sub-Committee,  while strongly  in favour  of abrogating       forthwith all the measures which have been enacted under  the Defence of the       Realm  Act  in restriction of personal  freedom of  every kind,  expresses  its       opinion that  it  would be a great misfortune to  the  country if  the admirable       service rendered by  the Ministry of Food and its various  committees were put       an end to, the  Sub-Committee being firmly convinced  that co-ordination in       production and  distribution under  central  control has proved exceedingly       advantageous to the whole community during the war, and will prove  equally       to their advantage in time of peace.   This policy should therefore  be continued       and developed as part of the national interest.
SUPPLIES.    Bacon and Hams. The demand  for bacon and hams is still  reduced, and  thereare clear  indications  that the  stocks  available  are more than  ample to  meet requirements.    It is  proposed to  make arrangements for the export to Ireland of the surplusstocks of fat backs and bellies  in the hands of wholesalers and retailers in this country,as there is a good market in Ireland for fat  bacon.   The shipments of bacon and hamsfrom Ireland are larger than was expected, but the quality is  excellent  and there is a ready market for everything that arrives.   It will be necessary to  provide a profit forthe English wholesaler if these shipments continue after the 1st January 1919.    Cereals. In response to  a  question raised at a  conference of Divisional  FoodCommissioners as to how long the  bread subsidy  would be  necessary, Sir  AlanAnderson said that it would, he thought, be  required until the reduction in the price ofwheat allowed of the production by  bakers of the quartern loaf at 9d.  At present when made with Australian wheat, which is the cheapest in the market, the loaf worksout at $\d., while if &quot;made with American wheat it costs Is. 6d    Dried Fruits. Further purchases of Indian sultanas are being made to secure the900 tons required to complete  the quantity  sanctioned by the Treasury.    On account of the lateness  of the season, the  Persian dates will not arrive until january or February 1919.    Feeding Stuff&apos;s.-It appears from the reports received by  the Live Stock Commis-sioners that, generally speaking, farmers are  now  receiving feeding-stuffs under theDistribution Scheme.   The delay still experienced in  certain localities is due in somecases to difficulties with railway companies;  in other cases the problem has beensolved by the transfer of orders from one Port Committee to another.    Difficulties have also arisen, especially in  the Hull area, with regard to the distri-bution of millers&apos; offals, although it is reported that practically  all the farmers arein fact obtaining the supplies  they need.  Interviews have been held with representa-tives of the millers, and it is expected that the various local  millers&apos; associations will undertake, when occasion arises, to secure that supplies are provided for  all personsentitled to receive them under the Order.    Meat. The  situation with regard  to meat  supplies  has  developed  in a way that  was  not  anticipated.    The  effect  of  the   increased  price  for   cattle  whichoperated from the first of the month has been most marked, and it appears that  aconsiderable quantity of beasts were  held  back in order to derive the benefit of this increase.   Concurrently with this, the arrivals of imported meat have been extremelyheavy, and, as the demand continnes to be  satisfied to a very large extent with home-killed meat, the output of frozen meat has been less than was desired,  and a positionof acute pressure on the cold storage space has arisen.  The Live Stock Commissionershave been placed in a difficult position.  On the one hand, they have been requestedto make the largest issue possible  of frozen meat  in order to relieve the  stores, andon the other hand, the farmers continue  to  pour in large  quantities  of  stock andresent any restrictions being placed upon their offerings.  The measure of restrictionwhich has been placed upon  the  shipments from  Ireland has  not  been sufficient to relieve the situation.   As an instance of this, it may be  mentioned that 2,000  cattlewere  awaiting slaughter  at  Birkenhead  at  the  end of last week, and  it  became necessary to  order that this meat should be sent to London.  The arrangements forthe issue of frozen meat were  therefore dislocated to a certain extent.  At the presentmoment the stores are absolutely full, and vessels are in port awaiting discharge.Considerable doubt is expressed  by the  Commissioners as to  whether the  extraration about to be issued will  be taken by  the public.   It is reported from  many partsof  the country that prices are  still  too high for  the industrial  classes to take full advantage of this concession, and it appears probable that the public demand will bein  the direction  of requiring  lower prices  before  there  is any  strong appeal forincreased  rations.     It is intended to release canned meats from coupon restrictions.                ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.     (1)  The Canned Fish (Retail Prices and Distribution) Order, 1918, dated 5thDecember  1918,  fixes maximum  retail prices for  certain kinds of canned fish.Norwegian brisling, mausse or sild, and canned salmon are at present  included in the
schedule, but other varieties may be added.  The Order requires the containers to belabelled, aud prices to be exhibited.    (2) The Seed Potatoes Order, dated 5th December 1918. provides that on a saleof seed potatoes, a written declaration shall be furnished to the buyer stating the class,variety, and dressing of the potatoes sold.  Tlie price is not fixed.    (3) An Order dated 1th December 1918, revokes the Cake and Pastry Order, 1917,and  clause  2 of the Sugar  (Confectionery) Order,  1917,  thereby abolishing  therestrictions  on the  making of  fancy  pastry, crumpets,  muffins, and tea-cakes, andalso  the rules as to the materials  which may be  used  in  cakes, buns,  scones, andbiscuits.                            ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.    The total number of prosecutions recorded in  the past week is  762 with  695convictions.    The greatest number of summonses were issued  under the following Orders :  the rationing Order 1918 with 178 cases; the Flour (Restriction) Order (Ireland) with63 cases ;  the Bacon, Ham and Lard (Prices) Order with 55 cases ; the Flour andBread (Prices) Order 1917 with  49 cases.    It is noticeable that the Orders quoted above appear regularly in the list of orders under which the greatest number  of  summonses  have been issued, indicating thatthere is comparatively little variation in the class of offence prevalent from week to week.             PART  II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    In the week ended December 7th the imports of  the principal foods and feeding-stuffs (182,400 tons) again barely reached the weekly average  of the first 49 weeks of 1918 (181,600 tons) or of the first 14 weeks of the cereal year (181,800 tons).    Wheat imports were good  (111,400  tons as equivalent  grain) as also were theimports of oats (15,900 tons), meat (15,700 tons), bacon (12,200 tons), condensed milk(3,700 tons), butter (1,800 tons), eggs (1,900 tons), and onions (2,600 tons).  Importsof maize (3,600 tons) and barley (700 tons) were again low.  Imports of sugar fell to,700 tons,  but the  stocks  (381,000  tons) are  high.   Another large  import of tea(5,400 tons) is recorded and the  stocks are rising rapidly ; on 30th November teastocks in  bond (61,600 tons) were the highest  during the  past six years, and thenet imports  in November  (27,200  tons) were  exceeded  only  in the month  ofDecember 1914.    The November  imports  of oilseeds (125,700 tons) and vegetable oil (23,000 tons)show a substantial improvement on the monthly averages in 1918 or in 1917, and areabove the average monthly imports before the  war ; but only  100 tons of  oilseed cakearrived.    The  total  imports  for  the  first 14  weeks of  the cereal years 1917-18  and1918-19 are compared in the following table : Total Imports for the first 14 weeks of cereal years. 	1917.	1918.&apos;	Increase or Decrease.	- -	1917.	1918.

                                 CONSUMPTION.    Meat. Ou present information there was a decrease of  about 400 tons in civilian consumption in Great Britain in the  last week of November.   Issues of refrigeratedmeat rose from 1,100 tons in the preceding week to  3,000 tons, so that the decreasefalls on home-grown meat.   The decrease of home supplies is explained partly by the exhaustion of  surplus supplies on grazing areas, partly by the general  anticipation ofthe increased  prices to farmers on  December  1st, and partly by the force  of  thetradition which leads producers to reserve their  best stock for  the Christmas markets.During the week  there was a net addition of 200 tons to the  home-grown beef andmutton placed in cold storage.    Flour. The figures of millers deliveries and releases of imported flour continue toshow a steady  decrease (Table B (1)).   The index given in Table C (2) shows that this movement is  the reverse of that of  a year ago, and that the present level is nowconsiderably below that of November 1917.    Fish. The improvement of supplies  of fresh fish at the chief inland marketscontinued up to the 23rd November, but fell away in the last week of  the month byabout  20 per  cent.  The  same movement appeared  at Billingsgate market, where,however, supplies over the month  were still  about 40 per  cent,  above those  ofNovember 1916 and 1917.    Jam. The ration  (which was instituted on  the 3rd November) necessitates  a supply of 23,500 tons a month for civilian consumption.  The  output by licensed jammanufacturers in November  amounted to about 23,200 tons, as compared with 24,300tons in October.  The quantity was less  than was  anticipated owing to  the non-arrival of any considerable  cargoes of  oranges until the end of the month.  Stocks were reduced  from  26,200 tons on 31st October to about 22,300 tons on 30th November or4 weeks&apos; requirements.  Pulp  stocks were  reduced, by 9,500 tons, but the remainingstocks of jam  and pulp expressed as equivalent jam were still equal to about 13 weeks&apos;ration requirements, and the position should improve with the increasing imports oforanges which, amounted to 3,500 tons in the week ended  November 30th, and to4,800 tons in the week ended December  7th.                                    STOCKS.    Compared with the stocks a year  ago those on the 1st December 1918 showsubstantial increases with very few exceptions, notably oilseeds (29 per cent, decrease)and oil cake (19 per cent, decrease).  There have also been decreases in the  stocks of coffee  (40 per cent, decrease)  and  cocoa  (60  per cent, decrease), but they are stillgreatly in excess of the pre-war stocks.  Wheat stocks are higher than those of a yearago by 25 per cent., and other cereals and pulses by 11 per  cent.   Stocks  of butter(8,500 tons)  and  cheese  (26,600 tons)  which have been  subjected  to  a seasonaldecrease are  66  per cent,  and 45 per cent., respectively,  above those of last year.Stocks of bacon and lard, of which there was a shortage last year, have been increasedfive or six fold.     Compared with the stocks on 1st November substantial additions were made tothe stocks of meat (30,100 tons increase), tea (11,100 tons increase), and oilseeds(37,500  tons  increase).  Stocks which were drawn  upon heavily during Novemberinclude  sugar (33,000  tons decrease), bacon (19,200 tons  decrease), and condensed milk (6,100 tons decrease).  The quantity of bacon stored by the Ministry of Food onDecember  7th amounted  to only 20,000  tons,  the maximum quantity stored havingbeen 82,100 tons in August.  On the other hand the  storage  of lard by the Ministry(29,400 tons on 7th December) stands at its maximum.
