THE MINUTES of the previous Meeting,  as revised,                    were accepted.McManus ON DISABLE-2.   THE CHAIRMAN explained that the Meeting had beenNT PENSIONS.   called by reason of a letter from Mr. Bonar Law to  Sir               A.Bosoawen,  whioh the latter had communicated to him.               He read the  letter to the Meeting;-                    &quot;With reference to the suggestion for a War bonus               of 20$ on pensions, I recently asked Mr.  Hodge to arrange               for this matter to be considered by the Soldiers &amp;               Sailors&apos; Pay Committee.   In ray opinion a question  of               this importance is essentially a matter which ought to               be considered by that Committee with a view to its  being               subsequently brought before the War Cabinet&quot;.                    &quot;I hope that,this is being done, for I agree with               you that something must be done&quot;.                    THE CHAIRMAN said that&quot;he had boen under the im-               pression that the proposed 20 per cent, increase of               pensions was being discussed between the Ministry of               Pensions and the Treasury.   It now appeared that the               Chancellor wished, to have it settled by the Soldiers1  &amp;               Sailcjrs1 Pay Committee&apos;.   Mr. Bonar Law was making.a               speech on the following day, and wished to have the               opportunity of making a statement on this subject.    In               other words, he would like to be able to say that the
!                    - 2 -matter was settled.   Hence it was desirable to put upa recommendation to tho War Cabinet at once.     DR MACNAMARA said that he had attended a Meetingat the Ministry of Pensions as Statutory Adviser.   Atthat Meeting it had. been decided to recommend a 20 percent, increase on all pensions.     MR-. UPCOTT pointed out that the pensions Warranthad been revised in March, and issued in April.   In the revision adequate provision had boen made for the increasein the coat of living.   The Treasury was not aware whya  0 per cent, increase was now recommended.     DR. MAClIAMAEA&apos;sai&amp; that the revision made in the spring had not made full allowance for the increase inthe cost of living.   Only children&quot;s allowances had boen.raised.     MR. FLYNN agreed with this view, and stated thatthe Ministry of Pensions had pointed this out, and drawnthe attention of the Treasury in a le-tter of the 20thinst a nt to tho fact that l/8d added to the children&apos;allowance did not 000 with the general increase in living expanses.     MR. UPCOTT said that a draft reply to that letter&apos;had been made in the Treasury, but had not been sent,as tho Chancellor wished the question to be settled bythis Committee.   Ho would draw attention to the report made by the Committee on the Cost of Living.   This Re-port showed that the increase was by no moans as great as was supposed.   SIR CHARLES HARRIS agreed with this view, and said  -that the figures formerly published in the&quot;Labour Gazette&quot;were most misleading.   At an earlier stage tho questionof pairing part of tho present pensions a temporarypercentage increase had been considered, but had been rejected.     MR. F1YNH admitted that this was the case.     TUB CHAIRMAN expressed the view that&apos; the bonus waslong overdue.   50/- had boen carried through almost tothe end, and had only failed to be  adopted in the final stages.     MR. UPCOTT stated that the annual oost of the pro^posal now made by the Ministry of Pensions was estimatedat nine and a /--aif millions.   He suggested that hisspring figures should be  taken as a basis, and in  view  . --of the relativoly small increased oost of living in thattime., that tho increase now under consideration  shouldaoi; exceed 10 per cent.   He failed to understand how the Ministry of Penoions  arrived  at 20 per cent.     MR-. FLYM said that:  ho did not attempt to justify20 per cent,  on those lines.   He regarded it as a  longoverdue War Bonijs.     DR. MACflAMAlU said that he was prepared to  recommendan increase of 25 per oent. to the  War Cabinet,  unless thexowere &amp;reat administrative difficulties in working  this out,and unless that would mean delay.     MR, FLYNH&quot; said that  the administrative difficulties -
                                    in would be  oonsidorV.blo,  but th,.t  should  not  bo  an  obstacle to  the aoceptanoo  )f tho  scheme.      SIR  oaARLSS -HARRIS asked whether the proposal  concern- ed  officers !;nd their widows: he  pointed out  that  in tho case  of officers it might be very h-..rd  to  apply. Some received a penci::n for disablement Cvccording to schedule,  and some  received retired pay, which was  a compound  service  and disability  pension.    It  would be very hard to draw the line betv/een those two categories.      THE  CHAIRMAN  suggested that the case of officers should be set aside for the moment,  and ho  proposed that 20 per cent i.should  be recommended for N.0.0&apos;s and men.      MR.  PLYNN said that  he was  ready,  in spite of  admin- istrative difficulties, to recommend the higher scale.      DR.  Mi.CNAMA.iiA aaia that if  a  20 per cent, increase was lively to pass  the  War Cabinet,  he  was  prepared to accept it in preference to 25 per  cent., which might be. attended  with delay.   Bis flat jui ^to dat.      SIR  CHARLES  ILiRRlS pointed  out that this  increase would alter the relative  positions ;*f wives separated from their husbands, and  widows.    It would almost  equalise their lot,  at any rato  from tho  fourth  child  onwards. This was  directly contrary to the  policy deli&quot;herately adopted throughout, of  giving higher allowances to  the wife.   He could  see no special  reason  for,20  per cent. $his was.an arbitrary increase,  and a  smaller  increase,  sa^r 10  per cent., would preserve the relative positions of the separated wife and the widow..   Separation allowances wore not  about to cease,  as the  Army were taking  men now foj? four years with the promise  of the  same separation allowances as had prevailed during the  War.      MR.  UPCOTT,  on behalf of the  Treasury, also  supported the lesser increase of  10 per cent.      THE CHAIRMAN,  summing&apos; up, said that the  Committee      as a whole (  tho War Office and the Treasury dissent-      ing) agreed  to recommend an increase of 20 per cent.      on all pensions granted to  or in  respect  of  disabled      N.C.0&apos;3 and  men and  their children, widows of do-      ceased men and their children and  dependents of de-      ceased men in res*pect of servioes  in  the  present War.      Ho would attempt to  have this matter placed  before      the  War Cabinet on tho following  day,  and to give     ,      ;tho  War Office and the Treasury an opportunity of      expressing *hoir views.   It was  not proposed to      j      increase alternative pensions.      Tho next question  to leal with was the period during  which the  increase should  be granted.     SIR CHAKI.ES HARRIS  pointed out that the Governmenthad given a six months&apos;  guarantee of the maintenance ofwages.   He proposed that  this bonus on pensions should come under review at the same time as wages.     MR. UPCOTT suggested that, to avoid arrears,  theperiod should begin/uo run on the 1st December  and closeon the 31st May.
                 - 4 -     MR. PLYlIil pointed out that this would not avoid thodifficulty of arrears, and that, considerable as this difficult:; was,  his Ministry would prefer to begin theperiod on November 1st, the date from vfcioh tho increase inseparation allowance had begun.   The pciplo had been ledto expect thin.     November 1st was then adopted as the initial date.      It was further docidol that the increase should last      until June 30th, at which date the question should bo      reviewed in the light of abnormal conditions, if any,      existing at that tamo.      THE CHAIRMAN said that the question of officers ro- remained unsettled.   This was a difficult matter, as officers1 pensions wero awarded for service in conjunction with dis- ablement.   Officers1 widows wore relatively woll-cff.      DR. M/lCNAMAPA pointed out that the case was not so strong for tho widows and dependents of officers as in the case of men and N.0*0*8.   The margin of existence was not approached in the same way.      SIR CHARLES HARRIS pointed out that oven tho highost pensions for the dependents of officers came within tho . p:?ese3.t limits for Civil Service War bonus.   It would bo ojctremoly difficult  to draw any line between senior and junior ranks.      It was therefore decided  that no increase  should for      tho moment bo made to tho pensions of widows and depend      onus of officers, though tho question might at a future:      date be reviewed. .  No public statement, however,      should be made  that the case of officers was to be      re-considered.  .War Cabinet,  2, Whitehall Gardens.
