Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.India  and German East Africa.sss^F^nonld like to oiler some further remarks on this question with special referenceto the Notes which Lord Curzon and Mr. Long have recorded.     I do not feel that either of the Notes attaches sufficient weight to Indian sentimentin the matter of Colonial emigration.  India feels profoundly the restrictions whichSelf-Governing Dominions have thought fit to impose.  She recognises her poweiiess-ness to resist the main principle.   But if any sympathy can  be shown to her feelingsby definite action it would  make a deep impression throughout India.  German  EastAfrica presents  the opportunity, and if  India  could be permitted to colonise  it as sir Theodore Morison suggested, she would  have the satisfaction of knowing that atany rate in one  substantial territory she was  being given  the same opportunity of colonial enterprise as the European enjoys elsewhere.     Lord Ourzon remarks that there are large tracts in India which are undeveloped,and he  suggests that  the  proper policy for Indians  is closer  settlement and  moreintense  development   in   India.   But  closer   settlement,  though  economicallyadvantageous in certain cases, is not a very inspiring policy.  It does not appeal tothe imagination as does colonial enterprise.  We, by our literature and example,  havetaught Indians to admire the spirit which leads young men out of their  own  countryto seek adventure, to conquer the world and found new homes in foreign lands, but wedeny them the opportunity of doing likewise.  Europe without Russia is approximately the size of India and has a slightly smaller  population.  When  the  next census istaken Europe will probably have a less dense population per  square mile than India.Would Western Europe accept closer settlement as  an  alternative  to her claim, notmerely to colonisation over seas, but to reserve for her  own exclusive  colonisation thewhole  of the new world ?   Her claim goes beyond this.  She  also  demands  the firstplace in colonising those patches  of Africa which have a tolerable climate,  and sherefuses to allow India, with its vast population,  any specially favourable position, evenin this one area.     It  is  quite true  that the available land. in India will be  increased  in  areaultimately by irrigation and possibly at a later date still by geological process.   ButI am afraid that it will  not meet  the  difficulties of the situation to  suggest to thereturned Indian soldier that land will be his when irrigation works not yet engineeredor sanctioned are complete, or when the rivers have deposited  fresh alluvium for thebenefit of his grandchildren.     Those who attend meetings of Imperial Conferences are faini liarwith the  depth of feeling questions of this kind have  aroused  in India, and, speaking for  myself,  I amcomvinced that it would be politically  wise to take the opportunity that  German EastAfrica offers of  making an offer to India which would not trench upon any Europeanrights  which ought  to be respected.     A second  point  made by  Lord Ourzon and also by Mr.  Walter  Long is thatIndian immigration would  prejudice the interest of the native races who have thefirst right to the soil.   With regard to that I wish to point out that the alternativesopen to us are not Indian immigration or no immigration,.but Indian immigration orEuropean  immigration, and Sir Theodore Morison&apos;s contention is, I understand, thatthe Indian is likely to prove a better teacher to the primitive Bantu than the European.The reason given is not that he is a sort of physiological half-way house, but that hewill carry with him  a civilization which  is far more  easily comprehensible to thenegro than the highly complicated civilization of the white man.   History appears tome to justify this contention.  The Bantu native of the coast has assimilated a  gooddeal of the civilization of the Arabs ; he has adopted Arab fashions in  dress and modeof life,  and  something of  the  great Arab  monotheism.  In  this he has shown anadaptability  to  at least one side  of the  civilization of India.   On the other  handEuropean  civilization, though it  has had a chance on almost  every shore of Africa,has so far achieved  but  unsatisfactory results.   The record of the white man&apos;s  dealings with the  negro is,  it must  be confessed, a  rather  melancholy one.   In  the  belgian congo and in  Portuguese Africa it is a record  from which we gladly turn our  eyes.     JO  SS 17  45  11/18
The atrocities of German rule  in  South-West Africa are fresh in all our minds.   Inthe Union of South Africa the  coloured population presents a very grave problem ofwhich nobody pretends to have a  solution.  I find it hard&apos;to  mention any part of:Afirca in  which the presence of the white man holds out any promise of elevating orcivilizing the indigenous races.     In East Africa there is a  special  reason for thinking that Indian immigrationwould be  more advantageous to the native? than European immigration.  In that partof the world the European settler is a  large farmer  or  planter.   He takes  up largetracts of  land, and necessarily  cultivates it with native labour.   He must by the veryreason of his industrial methods have land in the tracts which are already populated.His presence  is a two-fold burden to the native.  He takes the land which they need,and he forces them to labour for him.  The German Government recognised this veryfrankly, and compelled the natives to produce evidence  that they  had worked for acertain number of days with an European.  This is not, of course, tolerated in  BritishEast Africa, and the  English  official  is advised to  rely upon  moral persuasion to induce the natives to labour.   How this  is applied J cannot say, but all accountsagree that the native is an unwilling labourer, but yet the White Man&apos;s  farms arecultivated.     On  the  other hand, the Indian immigrant is a smallholder;  he cultivates hisland in the Indian way with his own labour  and that of his family.  The  land thatwould be assigned to him in East Africa would be  the  uninhabited  tracts  where  hewould dispossess no native occupant, and for whicli he would have to find  the  labourhimself.     Mr. Long states that he has  reason to  believe that the scheme for  associatingIndia with the  colonization of German East Africa is causing great uneasiness  amongthe white community in British East Africa.  I should be  the  last to  underrate theimportance  of the British  settlers  in East Africa, but  if we seriously  mean todevelop those tracts where backward races live, in the interests  of the inhabitants, weshall have to face  the problem whether the views of the white  settler are to  prevailagainst the interests  of the natives.   The opposition of the white  settlers is easilyunderstood.  They want the land for themselves.   They want the German coffeeplantations. They want cheap  labour.  They  object to any policy of &quot; pampering &quot; the natives,  for that  makes  it harder to obtain concessions  and  puts up the  cost oflabour.  This  is all very natural ; for the settler  is  there for business and not fromphilanthropic motives.  But it is impossible to regard  him as a disinterested  adviser on these  questions, and  the co-operation with the native which he favours, is one inwhich the black man  does the  work and the  white  man takes the profit.  The settlerof course  dislikes the Indian, and tries, usually with success, to prevent him  acquiringland.  He has, I am informed,  frozen him out  of all the good highlands, in which itis impossible for an Indian to acquire a plantation.     The  same sort of policy  has,  I am told, inspired  the  allocation  of sites toEuropeans and Indians in town areas.  This is a matter to which Mr. Long refers inthe  concluding paragraph  of his Note, and I  am  in  communication  with  his Department on the subject, and I hope it will not be necessary to trouble the Cabinet with a discussion of  this.&apos;  But since he deals with it in his Note,T  am bound to say that I do not question Professor  Simpson&apos;s  recommendations as quoted by  Mr. Long.What he  said was that the mode  of life of the Asiatic does not &quot;ordinarily &quot;  consort with the European.   It so often happens that we put forward pleas  of  sanitation, of health and various other forms of  camouflage for what is really a sordid  motive. Is  there no intrinsic  superiority in the area which on grounds of &quot; sanitation &quot; has been allotted to Europeans ?   Is  there no  real difference in the quality of the sites assigned  to the different races ?      We have recognised in India again and again that ordinarily the standard modes of  life of the Asiatic do not consort Avith those of  the  European, but we have neverhad to indulge in racial  discrimination as a consequence.  W7e have laid  down and made obligatory strict adherence to rules of building and of sanitation and  of lay out,and then  allowed Indians or Europeans, if they would conform  to these rules, to live in  the resulting areas.  We have excluded the ordinary run without racial discrimination - nation against the exception.   If this had been done  in Mombasa, I should not have complained, but to prohibit Indians as such from  buying sites even when they  are willing to do^everything required by the principles of sanitation, seems  to me  to havebeen an act of misgovernment.     Mr. Long quotes from a former Governor of the British East African Protectorate,a statement that tho Indian coolies imported in connection with the construction of
 the Uganda Railway have had the worst of influences on  the vast native populations with which they came in contact.  I do not wisli to draw invidious comparisons, but the reference I have already made to the influence of  Europeans in East Africa may&quot;be supplemented  by their  moral attitude  towards  the  natives.  There  have  been numerous  unpleasant incidents in  connection  with  East  Africa.  There  was a scandalous case of an official in East Africa a few years ago which found its way into the Press,  and the existence of Circular B. is  a  fair indication  of the position.  But the Indian coolie,  to whom  reference is  made above, is not a typo of Indian whom I should hope to see colonising East Africa.  It is the  soldier who has fought  for the Empire to whom I want to give facilities for colonisation.  Even the Khoja community referred to by Lord Curzon  and  Mr. Long, is by no means typical of the  best that India  produces.   The Jat and Punjabi Mussaiman whose  qualities have been tested. in the war are fine upstanding types of man who would be a revelation to East Africa. The Punjabis we know have an adventurous spirit which carries them, not over all India  only, but to America  as well.  There  is  no reason to think  that people  with this kind of spirit and daring would make any but the best of colonists.     If German East Africa is made  over to the Government of India for adminis- tration and for the regulation of  Indian  colonisation,  it would be a cardinal principle that this colonisation should be regulated  in  the interests  of  the original native population.   The Government of  India are proved  by the high example that has been set in India and by the traditions that have characterised British rule in India to be fully qualified for this new  trust, and by employing the Government of India as their .agency, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a position to  assert their superior authority  and vindicate  their responsibilities.   There would  be no question of an Indian monopoly  in East African colonisation.   There would be no question of India&apos;s imitating  the  policy of exclusion adopted by the Dominions.   Our policy Avoukl be one \vhich defined the position of the European settler, recognised the special claims of the Indian colonist and subordinated  all to the interest of the African native. But when it is a  question of  giving special privileges to  the European to whom the whole world is free, and of  opening to the restricted Indian a  corner for  expansion, then I feel I  should not be  doing my duty to the part of  the  Empire for which I am responsible, if I  were not  to press  this proposal with  all the force that is  at my command.     I do not necessarily press Sir Theodore  Morison&apos;s actual suggestion that German East  Africa should be given to India as a Colony I shall be quite  content if special facilities are given to Indian soldiers for colonisation there.  But if  we do not do this at least, I am afraid there will be many who might argue : &quot; Is not the cruelty of the  &quot; German towards the native population, is not the danger of submarine bases, a new &quot; form  of the old sanitation dodge ?   The Australians want to keep  the islands in the &quot; Pacific  that  they  have conquered.   The  South African wants   to keep  German &quot; South-West Africa, and the East African trader wants the rich lands of German East &quot; Africa.  Under various disguises and pretexts this is our real motive for annexation. &quot; Because India cannot speak with the same authority, despite her  hundred thousand &quot; casualties and  her million and a quarter  soldiers, she  cannot obtain in  any of the &quot; new territories  conditions comparable to those that are going to  be given  to sons   of the Empire of European descent.      I do not want this to be said, and that is why, despite the forceful arguments of my colleagues, I  ask those who  represent the  Empire  at the Peace  Conference  to remember the Indian soldiers when they are considering the claims  of the rest of the  Empire, and to remember  them whatever  may be  the  actual form of Government  agreed upon for  the conquered  territory of German East  Africa.                                                                      E.S.M.      28th November 1918.
