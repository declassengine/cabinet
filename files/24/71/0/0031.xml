//a.WAR  CABIM.          Welfare of Disabled Officers.Memorandum by the Secretary of State  for Warv          I circulate for the information of tho cabinet a letter from Field Marshal Sir Douglas  Haig,  of whioha copy has been forwarded to the Ministry of tensions.MILNER.4th December, .1918.
  f1                                         &apos;                                                                 91(J R G E NT.                              14127  (Q.D*a,) From The Field Marshal        Commanding-in-Chief,             British Armies  in Franco, To   The Secretary,        War  Office, London,  S*W*1*                                         Gonoral Headquarters,                                             26th November, 1918, Sir,     1,   1 have  tho honour to  represent that the question of the  future  welfare of officers  disabled in the war has now &quot;become  a matter of particular urgency in view of the armistice and  the probable  termination of hostilities at an early date and  to  urge that  it may  receive immediate consideration.          It is appreciated thateftepp save already been taken to meet the case  of disabled N.COs. and mon, but the problem presented by large numbers  of officers unable through their injuries to support themselves  in  circumstances appropriate to their  standing in the Army  is thought to be one which has not yet  received ftie, attention  that it  deserves.          Great importance  attaches to an early decision in this matter, in order that  not  only the officers mainly concerned, together with their relatives,  but  also the Nation a3 a whole may be made acquainted with  the arrangements to be made on behalf of a large nunfoer of men deserving of  every consideration by the State.     2.   The present assistance available for officers who have been disabled is, it is  understood, limited to a wound gratuity and a wound pension in addition to  the  war bounty given under the Royal Warrant to  those who  were not in the Permanent Forces. Though the  scale on which these grants are made is relatively generous they do not yet meet the problem of the officer who, without private means,  is called, to face life handicapped by total or partial disablement.  liven the maximum  wound pension given to the totally disabled would not permit a retired officer to live in a manner befitting the position he has filled in the Army, particularly in the  numerous oases in which  he  will be unable to supplement the  pension by his own exertions.     3,.  Broadly speaking, disabled officers will fall into four classes;-     jaj  Regular rofficers  of the  permanent Regular Army,      b  Temporary officers of the Regular Army.      c  Officers of the Territorial Force.     (d)  Officers of the Special  Reserve, The  claim of all  on the  sympathetic consideration of tho State is beyond  dispute.  Those of the permanent Regular Army who have-become  incapacitated have lost  tile chance of promotion in the profession  which  they adopted,  and, having given many of the best years  of their life to the  Service, will find themselves through thoir  disablement without prospects in the future.          temporary officers, and  those who were in the ^errit(prial Forcoand Special Reserve,  in many cases relinquished good positions to join the Array  for the war, and  now, owing to their injuries, are  unable  to taico up work  in th&amp;ir previous professions.  Tho younger officers  have lost  good prospects in the careers which they had chosen and for  which they had studied, while older ones are  deprived by the same cause  of  the substantial positions they previously  held.
     4.   in quite an appreciable, number of oases it in recognisedthat tho-;e who have had the misiortune to be disabled in theircountry&apos; 3 -service have private incomes which should enable them tofend for-themselves, but a considerable number of those who havereceived Commissions during the war have been drawn from a socialstratum in which the possession of private means is rare and arehence dependent for their living on their own earnings.  Allthese, however, have held a position in the Army in which t^royhave been encouraged to feel a pride.  They have been chosen fortheir abilities and qualities of command and leadership from among large numbers of candidates, and have undergone a test of capacity and endurance,, the severity of which it is difficult to exaggerate.  They have accepted, and have held with success.positions of great responsibility in the face of danger and difficulty.          But as all the four classes mentioned hold or have heldCommissions in His Majesty&apos;s Army it is hence inequitable for any scheme which is decided on to be based on any. other consideration and the previous social standing of individuals must hence be disregarded.     5t   It would be most undesirable that the form in whichassistance is given should be in the nature of a charity, as beingboth\ distasteful and humiliating to natural feelings of personalrespect, pride and independence.  Moreover, the State cannot divestitself of the responsibility for&apos; securing the future of theofficers maimed, disabled and injured in its service, it is henceessential that an official scheme ensuring this should be quicklyprepared and put into operation.          The problem is complicated by the varying degrees ofhelplessness of those disabled, and i3 one which does not readilylend itself to uniform treatment, as in dealing with the individual case, several considerations would have to be taken into account -apart from any private income - the extent of an officers incapacityof his helplessness and the nature of his qualifications for such employment as his incapacity would enable him to undertake.          Cases may well occur where an officer, so seriously injured as to.&apos;be considered totally disabled, might, be able, if hishelplessness were neutral!ered, to find some fitting employment,while it may be hoped that in nearly all cases some form ofusefulness, however small, may be brought within the reach of eventhose most seriously afflicted, though some, it is evident, will behardly more than invalids or convalescents to the end of their days.          These considerations particularly affect single officers,especially those without friends or relations in a position togive them the care and attention which ttjoy need, and this willbe both costly, and difficult to obtain unless some arrangements are made in anticipation of this need.  In this connection it isobvious that the provision of adequate medical treatment is a factor which enters into every consideration of the problem.          The delicate state of health of many injured officers will necessitate constant medical and sttrgical supervision, andit is considered that some attempt to tope with this must be anadjunct of any scheme which is ultimately agreed upon, as, unless some arrangement is made, many disabled officers will find thatthey are financially handicapped by the regular necessity of paying a large annual sum for essential medical treatment. .          For these reasons a uniform policy and fixed standard  oftreatment would not appear to be practicable, and it is I thinkclear that any arrangement made must allow scope for a widediscretionary power to interpret the policy as the personal factordictates *                                                          Advantage&apos;
!          Advantage should ho and possibly had been taken as much,as possible of the services of those officers in Governmentemployment, and posts suitable for the more seriously injuredshould be reserved for this class.  At the same time, officers with any special qualifications might have an opportunity of earning in the service of the State the maximum that theirincapacity renders possible.     6.   It is difficult for me to outline any scheme whioh would prove applicable to all the varying circumstances,  the first and chief point obviously is thsrsupply of sufficient funds, and until a detailed statement can be procured of the calls in this conneotionjto bo made on tho public purse I would advocate the allocation, asa preliminary measure,  to some public trustee of the interest at b% of, say,set aside for the purposes indicated.expenses would bo necessary, while theofficial organization to be charged with the settlement of the futureof the disabled offioors and to administer the fund set apart is amatter that should be proceeded with without any delay,  whateverscheme may ultimately be arranged, an integral part of it should, i feel convinced, be the provision of residential club3, primarilyperhaps for the use of unmarried disabled officers, in which at.a moderate cost the comforts of home life together with medical  -attention shoiild be assured.          But it is essential that some temporary scheme be initiatedat once, there has been so much suffering already and there will beso much more avoidable misery unless immediate steps are taken thatno delay in establishing a workable - if merely temporary -  scheme can possibly be justified, and it is this special point of view thatI do wish forcibly to emphasise,official such as the Public 10,000,000 to be invested anA further sum to meet initialestablialiment of a permanent     7.   Finally, I would urge most seriously that the question ofthe future welfare of our disabled officers is one that calls forimmediate settlement on a broad and liberal basis,  I feijl convinced.that the Nation at large, self-governing Dominions and Crown Coloniesalike, will regard nob only as a duty but also as a  sacred charge the provision from the public puree of the funds necessary to assureto each and every disabled officer, in comnon with other rankssimilarly situated, -che certainty of a comfortable and pleasant future and to remsva - now and at once - any impression that the sacrificesmade in this long, flaree and arduous struggle, now happily at anend, will for the disabled officer result only in privation and wantI have the honour to be,        Sir,     Your obedient Servant,          (Sgd)   D* Haig.
