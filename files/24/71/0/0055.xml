ass  (This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government),                            war &quot;Cabinet.Secret.    AA -    &quot;financial requirements for Agricultural EducationG.T. b4oo.            an(i -Research in ^gland &amp; Vales&quot;.r:enorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Pisheries.          Agricultural Education and Research have hithertonotoriously been starved in this country on which point the three departments of Agriculture have already submitted their opinions inthe Joint Kemorandua (EDDC 76).  The provisions of the corn production Act, the influx of new cultivators under the Land Settle-aent Sahene. in themselves tall for a great extension of theprovision cf education.  All the education authorities are nowashing what the future position will be and a bold definite policyis called for in order to set the work of reconstruction in motion.Expenditure must be increased not only to make good deficiencies butin ox-der to pay proper salaries to the teachers and scientificworkers.          Prior to the war the annual expenditure amounted to about 142,000 exclusive of special grants for capital equipment.  the grants were provided from the Development Pund.  As the experimental period  for which these grants were made has now been passed and theservioes are now essential functions of the Board of Agriculture, Iconsider that they should now be placed upon the board&apos;s Vote,relieving the Development Pund of recurring expenditure which is nolonger  new but has become a normal part of the Board&apos;s administration.          I estimate the essential requirements during the next fiveyears ought to rise to -          Research and investigation              130,000 per annum.Grants to agricultural colleges          80,000Grants to CountyiCouncils for Farm  Institutes, Demonstration Parms.  Training Schools and Organisers       300,000Various Special Schemes                  80,000n    it. 590,000          These figures include Capital charges as well aa income and include the pre-war expenditure of about  142,000 per. annum.          This alone will enable me to announce to the authorities concerned, the County Councils, the Universities and Governors ofthe Agricultural Colleges and Research Institutes, the conditions onwhich they may proceed to organise and develop the education and research with which they are charged.  The Board are being pressed  -on all sides to declare the procedure they propose to follow andthe assistance they can give, especially in view of the Primei;inister!s speeches.
          I ask therefore for the allocation  of    ,500,000 to theEoard for the next five years to include  &quot;both the  recurringcharges and the new capital expenditure;   this sum to be in replacement of the present annual receipts under these heads from both the Treasury and the Development  Fund,          The annual expenditure of Canada on similar services isabout  840,000 and of the U.S.A.  4,000,000.                                         R.E, PROTHERO.10th December,  1918.
