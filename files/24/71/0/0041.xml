XCUlCTT  ISTKE  PROPERTY  OF  Ill G  BRI TAHITI C ME STY&apos;3  GQVTiiRKllEITT,)3 C R E To,T. 6440.A.WAR CABINET,UTOIPLOYt^NT BENEFI! SUPPLE- 7&apos;1&apos;&quot;TARY &apos; T T)nC&quot;DUft BY THE FIRSTCOl^ISSIOllR OF DORICS TO PAPER &apos;G&apos;,T.  6440,        A defect&apos; in tho present scheme has been pointedout to no to which I v,ich to draw attention.   By treatingthe male and ferxle worker as separate individuals for benefit with a grant to one of 24/- and a grant to thefemale worker of 20/- &quot;hen unemployed, it frequentlyhappens that there may be one family in which the man and wife are receiving 44/-, or the family in which the nan,not being a munition worker, is receiving his regular work,and the &quot;if e, being a munition worker, and now being out ofwork, is getting 20/- ;  whereas a married man, who has beena munition worker, and whose wife has not been employed assuch only receives 24/-.   As what is important, is thencney that comes into the house, that is to say, the familyunit, rather than the individual unit, the sane people haveto be kept,  in both cases grave inequality, and therefore,discontent,  is caused.   Provision should be made for increasing the amount of married men ,now unemployed, who weremunition workers, and whose wives are receiving nothing inthe way of unemployment benefit.   Ky proposal for anadditional 10/- to 15&quot;/- per week would help to meet thesituation.(Signed)  ALFRED TOED.Office of Works.    6th December, 1918.
