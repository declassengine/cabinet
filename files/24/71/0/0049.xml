Confidential.No. 37I?a.)ALLIED  MARITIME  TRANSPORT  COUNCIL.Report of Executive, October 16th to  November 15th, 1918,  and      General  Survey of Work of Executive up to Cessation                               of Hostilities.    In continuation of the last Report, the Allied Maritime Transport Executive issue the following report of action :     The Executive are glad to report that on the cessation of hostilities, which ,markedat any rate the conclusion of the first stage  of their work, they have  satisfactorilyexecuted the specific tasks entrusted to them by the Council.  The services for whichthe Council accepted special responsibility were the following:  (a) Italian Coal,(b) French Coal,(c) Belgian Relief,(d) Allied Food Programme,(e) Allied Munitions Programme,(/) Management of Neutral Pool Tonnage.    The general position  of  these services on-the cessation of  hostilities  was asfollows :     (a) Italian Coal. The programme agreed upon on March 15th was  a shipment of600,000 tons a month.  The  total despatched in the eight months since the decision was^i75B,325  tons, .so that there was a small  deficit of 41,675.  tons on  the eight months&apos; programme.   Approximately 78,494 tons  of this total was lost at sea.  Aspecial military reserve of 150,000 tons was provided outside this programme.    (6) French  Coal. No definite programme was arranged.   The capacity of theFrench ports to receive and evacuate, and the output  of  the British mines (both ofwhich are, of course, outside the scope of the Council),  were  in  general the limitingfactors,  and  rendered  the provisional programme of  1,740,000 tons  per monthimpracticable.   The average, in fact, has only amounted to 1,431,909 tons over the seven months ending November 15th.  From March until at least September, however, all thetonnage which could  be dealt with at the ports  was allotted ; since then there  havebeen occasions when the ports could have received larger quantities had extra prompttonnage been available at precisely the right moment.  But, in  general, the tonnagehas been supplied so far as the coal was available and the  ports could receive it.    (c) Belgian Relief.-Until the spring of this year the  Belgian Relief Commissionsecured transport  partly by the use of Belgian vessels, and  partly  by charteringneutral vessels.  The  control  of neutral ships by America and Great Britain then,however, became so complete as to make it  impossible  for the Commission to obtainvessels in this  way. The Council, therefore, decided to accept direct responsibility forthe provision of the necessary tonnage.    The Executive arranged  for the  responsibility to be  shared equally betweenAmerica and Great Britain.  This arrangement has worked smoothly and satisfactorily,and  the Belgian  Relief programme has  since  then  been  fully supplied, about120,p00 tons a month being regularly shipped, mainly from the North Atlantic, but tosome extent from the United Kingdom (see detailed figures on page 4).    (d) Allied Food Programme. Until the end of the last cereal year, August 31st, 1918,the Cereal Programme was dealt with as an Allied Programme, and by  the end of thatyear tonnage had been arranged so as to secure delivery approximately in accordancewith the agreed repartition programme.  The Council then accepted the responsibilityfor dealing with the whole Allied Food Programme, covering meat, sugar, oilseeds, &amp;c,on the same repartition  basis.   Arrangements have since been  made  in accordancewith this programme.   The exact results are shown in  Appendix C. It will  be seen    O  AS 6734 Pk40  250 12/18  E&amp;S                                          A
that every country had tonnage arranged for its full  cereal programme, and tonnagewas also arranged in very close conformity with the  programme for other foodstuffs,the maximum deficiency  on any  total national  food programme being  less  than6 per cent.    (e) Allied Munitions Programme. At the meeting of 30th September the Councilaccepted a similar responsibility for the Allied  Munitions programme for the  yearOctober 1918  to September 1919.  Insufficient time had elapsed before the conclusionof hostilities to get this  programme into full working order, but  the Executive hadbeen able to arrange for all the tonnage asked for by the  Tonnage Committee of the munitions Council (see correspondence in Appendix A and B).    (/) Allocation of  Pool Neutral  Tonnage. On  the  cessation  of hostilities  nearly200 vessels with over 500,000 tons deadweight  had come into the pool  and been allocated.   The general working plan arranged by the Executive in May has workedquite smoothly, and no difficulties of importance  have been experienced in arranging the  allocation of these vessels  as between  the different countries and  different services.  A detailed account of this service is given on pp. 5 and 0.American Military Programme.    The Council authorised the allocation  of  tonnage to supplement the  american military Supply  Programme.   The  quantity provisionally indicated was 200,000 tons for loading in October, and 300,000 tons in the two months of November and Decembertogether, this&apos;quantity, however, being subject to variation according to circumstances.The quantity actually allotted in October was 204,000 tons.  Arrangements had beenmade to allot 150,000 tons in November, but in view  of the changed military situationthese have by agreement been modified so that about 70,000 tons  of cargo space will,in fact, have been allocated in November.General Tonnage  Position.    The general tonnage position has been  entirely changed by the  cessation  ofhostilities.  The substitution of independent sailings for  convoys, the termination ofmunitions requirements, and  the  cessation of war losses, which, apart from a fewunimportant  exceptions,  ceased on October 18th, have  substantially increased  thetonnage available.  On the other hand, the need for feeding liberated&apos;are&apos;as, &amp;c, andpossibly enemy countries, and the repatriation of troops, will make the new demandsat present difficult to estimate, and will  involve the  allocation  of a  large amount oftonnage to more distant routes.    In the meantime, steps  are being taken to use  the tonnage space  liberated toincrease full cargoes of grain  and flour  afloat, and  to arrange that  the vessels areavailable for diversion to any destination at short notice.    A statement of the present disposition of world tonnage is given  in Appendix (d)m                                                          J. A. SALTER.       Lancaster House,           S.W. 1.

Special Allocations among Allies.    (a)  During October 183,533 American troops were embarked, of whom 100,861were carried in British tonnage, 70,536 in American, 4,042 in French, and  8,094  in italian.    (6)  The shortage of Greek coasting tonnage, which seriously threatened the trans-port of civilian requirements, and was due to military exigencies, was brought up forattention.   It was agreed that as there were  seven small Greek vessels  in Frenchservice  and three  in Italian service  which ,were suitable  for coasting work, theFrench  should release two  steamers and the Italians one  in order to  relieve theshortage.     (c) The six Italian liners which have been employed in American  trooping  toFrance  since April  have been returned to Italian service.   They have  transportedapproximately  58,216 men.                   V. Allocations of British Vessels to Allies.     (d) Serbian Eelief. An urgent appeal was received for the diversion of  a WheatExecutive boat to Salonika with cereals to meet the first relief measures necessary forthe  freed inhabitants of  Serbia,  pending  the settlement of  the larger  question  ofthe re-victualling of the country.   The Tonnage Committee agreed to the diversion of a prompt vessel, and  arrangements were made  for  the s.s.  &quot;Porsanger,&quot; with,446 tons of wheat, to proceed to Salonika.     (e) Arrangements are being made to provide transport for 800 Serb  invalids,women and children, from Vladivostock, for repatriation.     (/) Allocations for the American army supply programme in November amountedto 69,893 tons.     (g) Liner Services, U.S. A./France. Tonnage loading on this service in Novemberwill amount to 38,000  tons.   The situation  renders  any forecast for Decemberimpossible.     (h) Liner Services, U.S.A./Italy. The November loading amounts to 29,198 tons.No programme has been compiled for December.     *     (i) Cereals. In October 191,763 tons  were  diverted to France, making a total for the seven months April-October of 1,104,000 tons, or an average of  157,714 tonsa month.     The diversions of cereals for Italy in October amounted to 216,268 tons, makinga total of 989,000 tons for the seven months April-October, an. average of 141,285 tonsa month.     (j) Wagons.-A total number of 7,792 railway wagons have been despatched upto date out of the 10,000 to be specially allocated by this country to Italy.                               VI. Pool Tonnage.     By the end of October 192 vessels of approximately 518,223 deadweight tons,over two-thirds of the total expected to come into the Pool, had been allocated.  Ninevessels  of  27,090 deadweight  tons  had been  sunk, and 180 vessels of 480,337 dead-weight tons were in active service under the allocations made.     Of this tonnage 43 per cent, was Norwegian, 42 per cent.  Swedish, and 15 percent. Danish.  Approximately 23 per cent, of the deadweight  tonnage was employedin the French coal trade, 28 per cent. in. the  Italian, coal trade,  21 per  cent, in theservice of the Wheat Executive, 21 per cent, (all Swedish) in Belgian relief,  and 7 percent, in the Swedish ore trade and miscellaneous assignments.     Tables showing (1) the deadweight tonnage operating in the different services atthe end of each month from May to  October, and (2) showing the classification by flagfor the same period are appended.

Congestion of Ports in France.   -    The question of the congestion of French ports had for long been causing anxietyand has gradually become one of the most urgent problems in the shipping situation.Towards the end of October it was stated that the American authorities were  contem-plating  the withdrawal of certain American vessels from French service until thedelay in the discharge of  vessels in general was remedied.  The British Ministry ofShipping was considering similar action in order to relieve the  situation.   A proposal has been made  and agreed to  by both the French Authorities and the U.S. ArmyAuthorities that Allied Commissions of a consultative or advisory character should heestablished at the principal French ports, consisting normally of a representative eachof France, Great Britain,  and the  United States.  These  commissions would send inweekly reports to :       (a) Paris,      (b)  the Allied Maritime Transport Council in London,      (c)  the American headquarters at Tours,      (d)  the British representative at Tours.     The weekly report at each port would be based on the statement of the working ofthe port prepared  by the French Chef d&apos;Exploitation,  the other&apos; members of theCommission making such observations on this  statement  as  they think  fit  and inparticular indicating their views as to the amount.     The  information  obtained  by  these  reports, together with other information regarding the prospective movements of British and French  controlled ships, will bebrought together by the Port Section of  the Allied Maritime.Transport  Council, whichshould  thus  be in a position to  decide what amount of tonnage should properly bedirected to each port during the following weeks.     This scheme is now being reconsidered in view of the cessation of hostilities.

(a) LETTER FIIOM  SHIPPING  TONNAGE  COMMITTEE OP INTEU-ALLIED MUNITIONS                                    COUNCIL.SIR,                                                        5th November 1918.      I  AM  directed  by the  Shipping Tonnage  Committee  of  the  Inter-AlliedMunitions Council to forward copies* of the Monthly Imports requirements of Franceand Italy from all parts of the world.    As regards shipments from North America, the figures of  the French programmediffer slightly from those already put forward in Mr. Birkett&apos;s  letter of October 15th,and  in  this  connection  I am  to say that, owing to the late date  at  which  the munitions Programme was established, it will be impossible for the programme to becarried  out equally  over the winter  months, since it  will take some time for the deliveries  on the  orders that  have now been placed to be  made.   The figures ofshipments  are  not yet available for  the month of October, but it is anticipated thatthey will be  between  200,000  and 250,000 tons.  It  is believed that in view of the stocks already at port,  or on  the way to port, this figure can be increased in november to a  minimum of 300,000  tons and  a maximum  of 350,000  tons the latter figurebeing attained if  the  supply of rails, which is receiving high priority in the UnitedStates, actually reaches  port in large quantities  during the next few days.   I, am therefore to ask that an allocation of ships  may be made on this basis,  on the under-standing that provided  that the general situation calls for  the  carrying out of theprogramme as now arranged,  it will be  necessary to make  good the deficiency inOctober and  November shipments by a still further increase in the allocation of shipsduring December.     As regards Italy, the  Committee has not  yet received  information as  to theItalian ships available for  munitions  traffic from North America, and is not yet in aposition to present a specific demand for  the allocation of tonnage.     As regards  Great  Britain,  it is understood that shipping has already  been allocated,  in accordance with  the  programme  put forward by my  Committee onOctober 15th.                                                          J. GEE,                                                              Acting Secretary.                   (6) REPLY OF TRANSPORT  COUNCIL EXECUTIVE.SIR,                                                        7th November 1918.      WITH  reference to your letter of the 5th instant,  I  have to inform you, onbehalf of the Allied Maritime Transport Executive, that they note that  the ShippingTonnage Committee of  the Inter-Allied Munitions Council anticipate that the ship-ments of French munitions  available for  loading in  the month of  November will reach a minimum of 300,000 tons and a maximum of 350,000 tons, the latter figurebeing conditional upon large supplies of rails reaching the port in the next few days.    The Executive  understand that if tonnage is allocated for shipments so becoming available in November, the Munitions Programme  authorised  by the Transport council at its  last session will have been carried out up to date so far as its execution depends upon  the allocation  of ships.    I have to inform you that an arrangement was recently  made with the AmericanGovernment  to ship 150,000 tons of French  munitions in American  vessels, british ships  being  allotted  to  America to compensate for  loss  of carrying capacity soinvolved.   The French representatives estimate that French ships  will load 120,000tons in November  and  the British  Government  are prepared to  provide a further50,000 tons, making a total of 320,000 tons, which would appear to be likely to besufficient in view of the information you gave as to shipments probably available.             *  It has not heen thought necessary to print these in detail in this report.                                                                         A 4APPENDICES.
    The Executive  note that your Committee is not yet  in a  position to present a specific demand for the allocation of tonnage for the shipment of munitions from theNorth Atlantic to Italy, and  that the allocation already  made for  the  shipment ofBritish munitions from the same source is adequate.    With reference to your warning that it  may be necessary to make  good the deficiency in the supplies available for loading in October and November by increasedallocations in December, I am to remind your Committee of the proviso  made by theTransport Council  in  connection with  the Munitions  Programme, viz.,. that theallocation  of tonnage must be conditional upon the capacity of the ports.    I am  to state that present indications render it probable that this limiting factorwill prove to be a serious one.                                                                 J.. A.

TANKERS,  EXCLUDED ABOVETOT AT.  TONNAGE,  INCLUDING TAKKEKSNOTES ON  TABLE I.     The provisional nature of the above table is to be emphasized.  Due to the impossibility of obtaining fulld information promptly, the figures given in this table for &quot; Other Allies &quot; and &quot; Neutrals &quot; are substantially  the revised figures as of  30th September, and figures for  Italy and the United States are adapted from^ those for 30th September.C3 Mc.Kenna   American figures do not include certain purely passenger vessels in coasting service and certain vessels** of merchant type built or converted for and owned by the Navy, of  whose movements the U.S. Shipping  iBoard does not keep itself informed.  A similar  qualification as  to vessels in naval service applies in  the  case of the other principal Allies, although  probably in lesser degree.     The basis of this table  is actual  service, not control or allocation.   Thus,  some tonnage of u Other  Allies &quot; and &quot; Neutrals&quot; which  is controlled by the principal Allies is here shown as  in the  service of  &quot; Other Allies &quot; or &quot; Neutrals,&quot; since it is at the moment carrying cargo to them,   Also, the tonnage shown  as in the service of the principal xillies includes some not under their control.   Import Service. The tonnage shown as in  the import service of a country or  countries is in general that which at the time is carrying cargo to that country or countries, or going out largely or wholly in ballast to obtain cargo for such countries.   Of about  1,000,000 tons of British liners in the North Atlantic approximately 40 per cent, of the cargo space proves to be sacrificed to  the carriage of troops.  Accordingly, GO per cent, of this tonnage is accounted in  ;&apos; Import Service of the United  Kingdom &quot; and 40 per cent, in &quot; Other Military or naval service.&apos;    Coasting Service. Italian  tonnage indicated as in coasting service includes certain  vessels employedin local service in the Mediterranean.  As noted above, not all American coasting tonnage is included.    Tonnage :t Unemployed, or Employment  Unknown&quot;  includes,  for  the United  States, new vesselscompleted but not yet assigned to Service  (chiefly vessels built  on the Great Lakes), and for &quot; other allies &quot; some 525,000 tons of Russian vessels locked up in the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea.(PROVISIONAL.)Table II.

In  both cases the amount of tonnageexcluded is relatively small.  Slight discrepancies in figures are accounted for by the fact that except for completions the tonnage figures are merely estimates.  Differences between the figures at the end of one month andthe beginning of the next are due partly to inaccuracies in Reports which could not be corrected in the time available, and partly to removals of vessels from stocks before launching.CO
