12.v     1174s  Telegram is the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government and should bereturned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for transmission to the Colonial Officewhen done with unless required for official use.)TtiLUGRAM from the Governor  General of the Union ofSouth Africa to the [Secretary of State for the Colonies.             (Dated 7th  December)(Koceired Colonial Of floe 5,55 p.m. 7 th December, 1918)          Your telegram 3rd December  Ministers express appreciation of consideration given  to  this matter by Imperial Government and request me to bring following points which are considered very important to your notice.   Ministers fear that if any offer which Imperial Government may make is subjected  to the condition that it may be withdrawn should  registered quantity not reach a minirausi of 200.000 bales the registrations under such offer would he adversely affected.   farmers would be ?discauraged  by this condition from registering their ?wool owing to  un- certainty which would ?prevail whether registrations would  actually ?lead to a gale.   Ministers  are  not in position to judge to what extent  the armistice which  has been signed is likely to effect  the  open market and cannot therefore give any indication  of quantity  of wool that is likely to be registered.Registration will undoubtedly be -affected by extent of operations on open market for /American  or Japanese account and such other competition as may now result from altered conditions.   Owing to delay  in aubmis- eion of a definite offer of purchase and fact thatpurchases are  being made for Japan Ministers fear that
that a portion of tho 80.000 mentioned my telegram10th October may have been disposed of in open market.On the other hand owin&amp; to influenza epidemic it isquite possible that when registrations take placequantity of 60,000 balea may be considerably exceeded.Fear expressed by Imperial Government that unless atleafi (?)200.000 bales are registered a larjsa pereen-tage of low (irade wools would bo offered is not shared by Ministers seeing that it is intended to make it acondition that each farrier who registers must reglflterthe whole of his clip.   Ministers earnestly hope thatImperial (tovernraeni will agree to accept whateverquantity of wool is offered (?) which would greatlyassist those farmers who re sister and the country asa whole.   It is also suggested that period fixed for registration of acceptance of the offer be extended to31st December as it will be practically impossible forgrowers in outlying districts to register by December20th.
