DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL AND TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION FOR IRELAND.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 4th December, 1918.

The following is a brief statemont on the work of the ?epartment during the past week in furtherance of increased Food ?roduction in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Fourteen applications for loans for agricultural implements are received by the Department during the past week. The total ?alue of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to ?ate, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£103,088.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE.

PROGRESS OF FARM WORK

The sowing of winter wheat was fairly general during ? past week. Much of the crop sown early in autumn is already in? , and looks uniform and healthy. Ploughing of subbles and ? proceeding rapidly, this work having been taken in hand considerably ? than usual. Farmers re?dent along the seaboard were busy ? seawe?.

???


The work of lifting potatoes is practically completed.                                      Potates in pits are increasingly showing disease, and the warning issued some weeks since regarding the necessity for careful sorting and ventilation of clamps has been repeated.

In many districts turnips are being pulled and stored, the yield on most farms being nearly average. Early sown crops gave the heaviest yields.

Threshing mills are still fully occupied and will be for some time. Some millers are booking orders which cannot be executed until next March. High speed mills worked by tractors and horse-power threshers for farmers&apos; own use are still being purchased. An increase in the number of Chill ploughs purchased is noted.

FLAX.

Soutching operations are being considerably retarded owing to the prevalence of influenza among soutchmill workers. The soutchers have struck work in one mill in Co. Antrim, having refused to soutch the flax to the standard required by the Flax Supplies Committee&apos;s Graders and Inspector. With a view to taking suitable action, the Department are making enquiries to ascertain all the facts of the case. It appears that in many cases millowners are unable to get the flax scutched to a satisfactory standard.

Twenty-two flax Instructors are now at work - most of them being engaged in giving instruction in Soutchmills. They are, in some districts, experiencing considerable difficulty in making their influence felt in improving the soutching owing to the apathy of millowners and the disinclination of scutchers to change their accustomed methods of doing the work.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK

During the period from 26th November to 2nd December, inclusive, 250 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 82 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks, and 160 applications for licences to export milch cows are received.
