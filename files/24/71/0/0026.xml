Concerning point (C), tho question was as Iced v/hethorj                      .  similar provision had been made for the Army.                             SIR CHARLES; HARRIS said tk.t.-discrimination                        had only been made in&quot; the ease of deserters.   The                        Admiralty proposal, howoYor, he regarded as reason-                        able f ;   As it was a disciplinary question, con-                        cerning which the-.Adjutant-General should be con-                        suited, he proposed that harmony&apos; should be obtained                        between the Army and the i-Iavy practice under this                        heading by joint settlement of the Admiralty, WarI                        Office  and AirABoard. .                                  This was agreed to.                        Points  (1;) and (E) were accepted.   After some dis-r                        cussion, exception (F) was struck out.
     tPiio &quot;remainder of tho sealos nroposod  in. too paper wore .v.oooptod  as being substantially the same as those approved for the Army.     DR.. MACiUvlai^ drew $tention to tfoto VII, at the end of the paper, defining tho period  on which gratuity should be assessed.     SIR CHARLES KARRIS  said that ho had no  ob- ^ection to this paragraph if it wore not inoon- sistent with Mri Bonar Law1s announcement.     It was decided that there was no inconsist-     ency, \and the paragraph was adopted.  .     disclosure OEAKLES-HARRIS  then raised the  question of Prize Honey.   Ho said-that there was a strong fooling in the Army that the Havy was&quot;unduly favoured by receiving Prize Honey in addition to gratuity.   Gratuity  in tho Army took the place of Prize Money.   Gratuity in the Navy  was a novelty, and should not logically be paid  in addition to Prize Money.   Mr, Forster&apos;s agree-&apos; raent had boon contingent on hr. Macnamara&apos;s making out his case.     hilt MACiLOlARA said  the ho had sent Mr. Porster $wo precedents,  and that he had not  had a reply, and therefore inferred that Mr. Porster- consented, ,     disclosure CHARLho HARRIS  saia that Mr.-Forster had intended to reply at this mooting:  in his view the &quot;precedents&quot; did not establish the Ad- miralty case t ,     Mil. B^RSTO&apos;&quot;&apos;; said that the Treasury had  con- sidered tho proposal, but had not as yet agreed. Mr. Bonar Lav/had asked how the allotment  would work out as between the Army and the navy.   . The proportion was very hard to work out, but  on  a rough estimate it would  seem tfcat a naval  offic- or, though receiving about 20 per.cent,, loss than the Army officer as gratuity, would,  if  he got Prize Money, be handsomely in.pocketV  -     SIR .CHARL7JS HARRIS then suggested a reduc- tion of the scale of gratuities in all cases  of receipt of Prize Money,.     BE. MACILLMAL. said thut, aftor endeavouring for many months to got the,Article 497 scale, in order to got&quot; something done in response to the pressure, of the House of Commons they had  agreed to a lower so.,le for Temporary Naval Officers, &quot;but&quot;this had nothing to do with Prize.   More- over,: a great number of naval ratings and  offio- ors would not get Priao Money,, as thirty months of! servico atr.soa wore required to qualify for it...   In any case he could not accede to Sir Charles Harris&apos;  proposal without referring to the Board of tho Admiralty...  .     MR&apos;.. 3Iai&apos;D said that,^ho same question arose in the Air Porce.    Some would get Prize Money  - and: some would not.&apos;   It.was  possible that two men.engaged, in the destruction of one submarinemight, not. f-^re alike.   One might get Prize
                                                                    76 i                          DR. M0.NAM.A2A asked what Sir Char lee Harris                     would say if the old plan of attributing tho                     prize to the captor wore maintained.                          SIR CHARLES HARRIS replied that the captor                     should get no gratuity if his share of Prize                     exceeded gratuity, whilst the loss fortunate mem-                     bore of the service should.   Tho custom of Prize                     Money had boon abolished in the Amy, and gratuitous-                     tieo substituted for it.   It was clearly in-                     equitable that the Kavy should have both.   If                     the Wavy wore to get their own special privileges                     and Army rewards in addition, what would stopifec                     Army from claiming its own rewards and the Havy-s                     as well?   Dr-- Maonaoara was precluded from dis-                     cussing tho point: of principle at the Committee;                     the First Lord and the So ore tar;; of State must                     fight it out .at the War Cabinet.                          THE COMMITTEE finally adopted the scheme,                          with the reservations previously mentioned,                          leaving open tho question whether the Navy                          should receive Prize Money as well as gratu-                          ity.   It was agreed that due notice should                          be given by the Admiralty for the War office                          to place their views before the War Cabinet.JLAR OFFICERS1        3.   THE COMMITTEE considered paper Ho,  105,LB 03? GRATUITIES *         giving the scale suggested by the War Office.                          DR. MACNAMARA ashed why a discrimination                     was made in the first year between officers who                     had served at home and those who had served in a                     thoatro of war.  This discrimination had not                     been made in the case of men and N.C-0,s.                          After some discussion,&apos;it was decided                          to adopt tho lower scale as a basis in both                          cases.    It was further agreed that a eon-                          dition should be inserted depriving an offic-                          er discharged as inefficient in the first                          six months of any gratuity.                          It was pointed out by SIR CHARLES HARRIS                     that the regular officers1  scale was lower than                   .  that for temporary officers,  as there was no ncod                     to assist the former to start again in an inter-                     rupted profession.    Men who had joined during                     the War,  but who had received permanent  commis-                     sions,  would be treated as regular officers.                          ICR.  BLAND pointed out that the Air  Force                     was almost  entirely staffed by temporary officers,                     and that in consequence of this difference of  &apos;                     treatment a premium was offered to good  officers                     for leading the Force rather than staying in it,                          ADMIRAL T0THILL asked whether the figure                     for the  first year was  not  an arbitrary ono.                          SIR  CHARLES  HARRIS replied that it  boro                    . about the same  relation to  the  daily scale  of                     pay as  5 in the  case of a private.                          ADMIRAL TOTHILL  thon  pointed out that  very                   .  little  advantage  was  given  by the scheme to                     senior  officers.    Their gratuity did not
- 4 -                         increase,  as  WAS  the  case  with  emergency  and                         retired  officers  in the  Navy, in relation to                         their ranks and responsibilities.   On  the                         lines of this  scale,  a midshipman or  a  captain&amp;                       in the fifth  year would  receive sums  which did                         not differ in proportion to  their respective                         ranks.                              SIR CHARLbiS  HARRIS  explained that  this was                         a  pure gratuity,  and  was not intended to  set                         up men in civil life.    On the  principle  adopted                         for the  men by the Cabinet,  a colonel remained                         throughout an equal distance ahead  of a lieuten-                         ant,  whatever the length of  service,                              The question was then asked why  the  scale                         stopped  at the rank of colonel.                              SIR CHARLES  HARRIS  explained that  as all                         military members  of the  Array Council  were inter-                         ested, it had been thought bettor to  leavb the                         scale of general  officers&apos; gratuities to  ih*a                         Committee.                              It  was decided that the representatives of                              the Viler  Office,  the Admiralty  and  the Air                              Board should meet and propose  a  scheme to                              the Committee for the gratuities to senior                              officers.  SERVICE  &quot;OVERSEAS&quot;  OR   4.   THE CHAIRMAN then drew  attention to  the &quot;IN A  THEATRE  OB1 WAR&quot;.   unsettled controversy concerning the  vise  of the                         term &quot;theatre of  ?,-ar&quot; or ot  the expession &quot;over-                         sea si&quot; .                              SIR CHARIi-S  HARRIS  said that the War Office                         had accepted  the  latter  regretfully,  but  re-                         garded&apos; the point  as settled  by  Mr.  Bonar  Lawfs                         announcement  in Parliament,   The objection                         was that it would be  Impossible to  settle all                         claims promptly.   He had  warned the  Committee                         of that.                                   .                              MR. BARSEOW  said that he had informed the                         Chancellor that the W??r  Office  would  not  be                         able to  pay in a  lump sum.   The Chancellor                         had been much impressed  by this difficulty, and                         had suggested that the Committee should review                         the subject.                              SIR CKARIkS HARRIS explained thai whenever                         a  man could show  that he had drawn  pay  on an                         Acquittance Roll, which  was  the system  for pay                         in a theatre  of war,  he  would receive his grat-                         uity without  delay.   Men  in garrisons  overseas,                         hcwever; were not so  paid.   There  vfould  in- ,                         inevitably be delay in  some  of their  cases.                         Thin, dcubtlosb;  would lead  to  complaints, but                         it was unavoidable.   Ho v;as instituting  a Com-                         plaints  office in the War  Office, and every                         effort would  be made  to  deal with each  case                         promptly.                              MR. BLAND suggested that the annoyance                         could be mitigated by announcing the  ci ff iolty,*                         This 7^ould prepare the minds of those interested                         for the  delay.
                  It was therefore decided that the higher scale                  of gratuity should apply to service &quot;overseas&quot;SPECIAL CONDITIONS 5.  MR. BLAND eald that there were special diffi-OP AIR VORCE. culties connected with the Air Force,                  It was agreed after discussing them with the repre-                  sentatives of the War Office and of the Admiralty,                  that he would communicate his suggestions to the                  Secretary.War Cabinet,    2, Whitehall Gardens, S*W.l.* $&apos; -
