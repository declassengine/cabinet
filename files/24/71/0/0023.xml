(This Document  is the property his Britannic Ma)e$ty&apos;8 GovernorrPROVISION Or&apos; jiuP^OYuErandum by the minister of Pensions and   -Linister of Labour.1^  Reports from the local representatives of the ministries ofLabour and Pensions show that during the recent months an increas-ing difficulty has been experienced in nearly all districts in finding suitable employment for the large number of discharged &apos;men whose physical condition is such that they aro fit only forwork of a light character, and the petition is;already acute inarea3 such as South .*ales and parts of the i^orth of England wheremost of the employment e.g. mining, available involvos heavy work.The records of the Employment Exchanges at *vhich some 7,000 menapply each month upon their discharge from tne Forces, show thatduring the past year there has been a steady increase in thoaverage time elapsing before the men&apos;s names  are removed from the books.  The Local war Pensions Committees report an increasing number of cases in which the man is incapable of doing anythingbut light work, and for whom they are unable  to find suitable employment, and their reports show that the numbor of such cases is considerably higher in districts of the class above referred to.2.  Employers throughout the country have readily engaged disabledmen as opportunity has offered, and we propose to continue by every possible means to urge the claims of such men to employment.Opportunities for employment of a light character, especiallyupon unskilled work, are however, unfortunately limited.  .3, v*e consider that the difficulties of finding suitable employment for men fit for light work only, must increase very greatlywith the conclusion of the war.  The number of discharged disabledmen is already over 5C0,0C0 and we fear that a considerable pro-portion, of this number will be fit for light work only.   We seevery little prospect that the whole number cf men who are fit only for light work, can be absorbed into industrial and cchmercialemployments through the ordinary operation of the demand for labour,notwithstanding the fact that in the cases of these men, that demand should be reinforced by every consideration of patrioticsentiment.4. We have considered various proposals for dealing with thismatter, and we&quot;are anxious to avoid resort to any measure of compulsion.   We prefer for the present, to rely upon tho  volun-tary action of employers, reinforced by the measures  of restrictionwhich are outlined below, upon the number of persons  who willcompeto for certain types of employment.   It will be seen that our proposal is to reserve to disabled men the right to take up for thefirst time, employment in certain occupations,5. vie suggest that -when employers wish to engage an employee forwork in any one of a number of  scheduled occupations, they shouldbe free from any restriction in so doing, if they wish to engageeither a person who was engaged in tho occupation for a prescribed period before an appointed date, or a person suffering from aminimum d-i-;re-; of pn;^xo&amp;i axsaoility, whether such disabilityhas arisen from war service, industrial accident, or  otherwise aThis would involve the registration of all engagements and of opportunities for employment, xn ine  scheduled occupations;  the recognition of a local body to  settle cases of dispute as to the suitability of Individuals for  specific employment and the use ofmachinery for  suggesting  suitable disabled men for employment.
Li. DEC 1918 We believe that tne Local Advisory Comutitte^a of the Ministry of Labour with the Employment Exchanges provide the necessary machinery for all these purposes. 6, We propose th*t  the Local Advisory Committees should determine the Conditions, under which disabled men would be employed in tho scheduled occupations,   In so doing the Committees would adept tho principle that a man1s pension is  not to be taken into account in fixing the wages which he is to receive and the Local Advisory Committees would, where necessary, act in. consultation with the Ministry of Labour.  Powers should probably be given to the Local Advisory Committees to enforce the payment, of a wage considered by them to be the proper ono, when disabled men are employed in any of the scheduled occupations, within the area of the CPmmitt.ee. 7. He propose that in tne first instance entry into a small number of occupations only should be restricted in the manner indicated and that the schedule should be extended only in  .&apos; response to a widespread public demand.  As examples of the occupations which we consider might be scheduled, the following may be mentioned:-      Lift Attendant,      Attendant (idisoellaneous for both public and private offices)      Commissionaire,      Watchman,      Timekeeper,      Gatekeeper,      Lockkeeper,      Billiard karker,      Messenger,      Caretaker,                                              v      Park-Keeper, 8. This  list  can no doubt  be  extended  without difficulty  and should be so  extended  particularly  In  respect of occupations within organised industries,  after  consultation with Associations of employers  and workpeople,  within the  industries, 9. vYe are. convinced that  if  action  on-these  lines  is  to  be  taken it must  be  taken before  the  conclusion of  peace.  At  present there is everywhere a  strong  sympathy  for  and desire  to assist I disabled men,  and  it  is,  we  consider,  essential  to  take  advantage of this  sympathy,  while  it is 3trong,  to put  into operation the  limited restrictive  measures  which we  advocate.                                (Signed)  JOHN  HODGE.                                         GL0.H.R0BLRTS.
