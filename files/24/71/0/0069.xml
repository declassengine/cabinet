(1).11th December, 1918.Sir,          I beg to submit the following Report on the work of  thePood Production Department for the week ended 10th December                  The Weather and Condition  of Crops.          Mild, dull weather has been experienced throughout  thecountry during the past week and rain has  fallen on  several days  inmost districts.          The rain has rendered heavy land unworkable,  but on lightland the weather has not hindered cultivation operations, the sowingof corn and general farm work to any great extent.          The  growth of winter corn has been considerably assisted by the mild v;eather.                     LOCAL  ORGANISATION DIVISION.               Work of Agricultural Executive Committees.Growth of Mustard Seed  in 1919.   The policy to  be  adopted  for nextyear in regard to the growing of mustard  for seed has been under theconsideration  of the Department.  The  acreage  under mustard  inEngland and Wales in 1916 was 51*907  acres and this was reduced in1918 to 9,999  acres  In  order  that an  additional  acreage might be madeavailable  for  more essential  food crops.   The  Department have now,.however,  come  to the conclusion  that  it  is possible to allow some relaxation of  the restrictions  in  force  and it has  been decided thatan area of 20,000 acres  under mustard should be alloved for the harvest of 1919, but that half  this  area  should be land ploughed out
of grass for the purpose.Determination of Tenancies,  During the week 4 Orders have been madby the Board determining tenancies on account of bad farming inrespect of 334 acres.Banks of the Yorkshire Ouse.  The river banks at Hook were serious]breached in September last and the repairs immediately necessary m\carried out at that time.  It is, however, imperative that the bank!should be put into a condition to resist any floods that may come ithe river at the spring tides In the-middle of February, and theExecutive Committee, with the co-operation of the Aire and Calder  INavigation Trustees, have arranged to carry out the work forthwith,jThe bushes and grass will be cleared and the banks will be raised tla height of 20 feet a,o.d, with a corresponding width and silt,  Ttlength to be dealt with is 94 chains and the estimated cost is alittle under  5,000.   This sum will be recoverable in part under fLocal Inclosure Act and Award, and the balance from the DrainageBoard which is in process of formation for the Ouse-AIre area,  Thework will in the meantime be carried out under the Defence of the realm Regulations and the Committee have been authorised to act aaagents of the Board for that purpose under Paragraph (1) of       jRegulation 2M.Provision of Land for Allotments. ,  Reports received from 1,193districts show that 300,410 plots containing 21,689 acres have beenprovided under the Cultivation of Lands (Allotments) Order 1918, anprevious Orders. .          During the week, in addition to the area mentioned above,29 local authorities have, agreed to acquire a total area of 298 acrDrainage of Land.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.(3,686 allotments),  including 54 acres at Barkingat Northampton,
Preservation of Fruit and Vegetables.   In ^connection with the  dtmon-strations which have been held during-the past  season.  It is interesting to note that a letter has been received by  the  Department  from  alady who attended one of the demonstrations, and who now states  thatafter learning the process of canning  she managed to can last  season2,900 tins of fruit on a farm.   The tins have  been sold at very satifactory prices to two of the large London Stores.market in% Section   The Department have made arrangements withthe Ministry of Food for the withdrawal of restrictions imposed on County Societies in regard to the distribution of seed potatoeswhereby these Societies were only allowed to sell to their own memberSocieties will now be able to supply the small  producer withoutrestriction.          The Staffordshire County Society has  market stalls atStafford, Longton and Lichfield to which produce has been sent fromthe Village Collecting Stations.   The produce  so collected, mostof which would have been  *sasted but for the County Organisation, hasbeen disposed of at ordinary market rates.   It Is reported that asa result of the operations of the County Society the &quot;higgler&quot; isnow offering much better prices to the local grower.Bees.  Up to the present  17 counties have now agreed to form BeeCommittees on the lines suggested by the Department for the purposeof carrying out the scheme for registration and re-stocking.                      TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land* (1)  An inspection was made of four farmsin Herefordshire in connection with a proposal of the AgriculturalExecutive Committee to enter  into possession on account of badfarming.   The farms, which extend to 636 acres in all, areowned and occupied by one  individual, who has allowed them to fall  into a deplorable condition.   Excellent orchards haverun wild, good pastures arc a mass of perennial weeds, andfallen  timber  lies  almost  untouched.   The  tillage land  is  &apos;os foul  as  it  can be, ditches are unopened, hedges are overgrownand the  gates broken through.   There  is no question that,
In the Intenee-ta -of the. nation, the land.should he taken  outof the hands of the present  owner without delay,                   g     (2)   Allercolt Farm, Timberscombe, which was taken over by theSomerset  Agricultural Executive Committee in August 1917, has recent:been inspected.   The total area of the farm is 286 acres, and whentaken over the land was in a derelict condition.   The farm has b^enused as a training centre for soldiers, 70 or 80 of whom had been trained and sent out during the six months previous to the inspectiotThe crops obtained this year, from 39 acres of cereals and 29 acres of potatoes, form a valuable addition to the food supplies of thedistrict, and great credit is due to the management for the way inwhich, with quite unskilled labour, the condition of the farm hasbeen so much improved.Slugs on Allotments,   At the request of a group of allotment holders in South Lancashire, an inspection of their land was made inorder to investigate losses alleged to have been sustained from attack by slugs.   This pest was stated to have destroyed fully 3C$of the potato crop on the allotments last season.   The soil isheavy, tenacious clay, apparently badly drained,,and it Is the custoilto manure very heavily with organic manures - stable manures in most cases, but made with a variety of litter, peat, chips, sawdust, etc,The usual heap of decaying cabbage leaves, stalks, slug-eatenpotatoes, etc, was present,   Taking into consideration the wet statjof the soil and the amount of decaying vegetable matter both above and below ground it would be difficult to find a more ideal spot forslugs.   Experiments are being arranged but in the first instance asoil analysis will be made.                         LABOUR DIVISION.Demobilisation.   It has now been decided to increase, the totalnumber of &quot;pivotal&quot; men to be released by the military authoritiesIn advance of general demobilisation.   The quota of men to be soreleased allotted to agriculture has accordingly been raised from
0  10,000 to 15,000, which number will be made available from the Army    and Royal Air Force.   An additional number of officers and men of    the Navy will be available for early release and all applications    for such men are being sent forward and rill not be included in the    above quota.   Up to the present tho names of 1,100 agriculturists    have been forwarded to tho Department of Demobilisation and    Resettlement for early release.              A conference is being held vith the Ministry of Labour    with regard to the question of utilising the services of the    Agricultural Executive Committees  in connection with the resettlement    of men on the land.   Trade Sub-Committees are being appointed for    each of the larger and well organised industries in the locality of    each Employment Exchange in order  that they may advise the Exchange    and undertake the work of finding  employment for men and women in    the industries concerned.   In the case of agriculture, these    Committees 3hould be the Agricultural Executive Committees.              A  joint application from the board of&quot;Agriculture and the    Ministry of Food has been made to  the Ministry of Labour asking for    the immediate demobilisation, under the &quot;pivotal men&quot; scheme, of    10,000 farm hands skilled in potato dressing.    Harvest Labour.  1,866 soldiers aro still out on farms assisting    in the gathering of the remainder  of the harvest.   The number of    prisoners still out under the migratory gang system is 5,629.   fcost    of these men are engaged in potato lifting.    Soidi---r Labour.   Tho ftar Office have b^en asked to extend    indefinitely the furlough of the soldier ploughmen who are still out    on the land and who were originally granted agricultural furlough    for a period of two months.   rhoye men number 3,576.              The number of men released to assist with threshing under    the general order for the release  on agricultural furlough of men    of special skill in this work is 429,   A difficulty has occurred
in Kent, owing to the efficient organisation of the threshing v:cin that county by the Agricultural Executive Committee.   The wois so well advanced that the accommodation at the mills is alltaken up and millers are refusing to accept further consignments of threshed corn.   The ministry of Food have been asked to take immediate action, as it would be disastrous to the county shoulcthreshing work be stopped                         Women&apos;s Branch.Supply of Labour,    The supply of women in the Land Army istemporarily in excess of the demand, but it is anticipated thatthe surplus supply will be absorbed during the next two weeks itthe Timber Cutting Section.   The Office of Woods have applied itwelve women to assist in tree planting in Surrey..   Demands ha\also been received for women to undertake the pruning of fruittrees.   The supply of really experienced milkers is still leasthan the demand.&apos;          The Women&apos;a Land Army held a stall at the recentexhibition in aid of the Oarrett Anderson Hospital for women, atwhich over  200 was obtained for the purpose of endowing a landworkers&apos; bed in the hospital.women&apos;s Institutes.
