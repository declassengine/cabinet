MEDICAL OFFICERS.A/, fr30 Memorandum by the Minister of National Service,7: if/,f.*. The -present  situation as  regards the medical service of the civil  community in  this country is everywhere one of acute danger, and  in many  areas one  of actual breakdown.   In order to provide medical  officers  for the Armed Forces, the medical profession in Great  Britain  had to be depleted during the War to an extreme extent,  involving risk even  in normal circumstances; and the severity and length of the present epidemic of influenza and pneumonia has  practically broken down the best defences which the remnant  of the  profession  in civil practice have been able to oppose,     While throughout  the country the process of depletion has been adjusted  so  aS to equalise (so far as possible) the burden as between district and district, a level had been reached well over a year  ago which  afforded no margin for risks.   Since then, the  process  of recruiting has  nevertheless continued, though slowly,  and  in part by a method of exchange which extracted the younger  and  more, active men  for military service and returned the  older and  less  active to civil life,   Moreover, it must be remembered  that, since the  outbreak of War, the Armed Forces have claimed practically all the newly-qualified men who are normally available  to  restore  the civil wastage in the profession due  to death and  necessary retirement.   The net result is that the  level above-mentioned had  been still further reduced by direct recruitment, by the disadvantageous process of exchange and by the civil wastage from death and physical breakdown, this last mentioned cause being  specially aggravated by the heavy extra strain imposed upon the older  men.   Even prior to  the epidemic, a week rarely  passed without some instances occurring in which some district  had become wholly unprovided for by reason of the  death or breakdown of the  sole remaining practitioner,     Upon the  outbreak of the  epidemic this autumn, these cases were enormously  increased in number; and special efforts were made by  my Department  to cope  with the worst emergencies with the  limited  resources  at its disposal.   These resources were, however, rapidly  exhausted;-  and when an armistice seemed imminent the  Department took up with  the Army Medical Department the question of  the  immediate release of a considerable number of medical  officers  from  the R.A.M.C.     Upon signature of the armistice, the previously agreed plans were rapidly put  into  execution, and the Army Medical Department has  co-operated most willingly in every way,   An arrangement has  been instituted whereby  the names of the most urgently needed practitioners  are put  forward  by my Department to the Army Medical Department;  and  the Army Medical Department, on its part, is understood to  have  arranged  a  process of exchange or substitution whereby, upon  any medical officer becoming redundant ih any Army Command  one  of the  specially nominated medical officers can be released for civil  practice.     But it  will  be seen that  the efforts of the Army Hedieal Department to  meet  the requests of my Department for the demobilisa- tion of  specified men  are limited to the extent of the number of medical  officers  released es redundant by the several Commands;i.i
and the present position in this  respect  is gravely unsatis-factory.    Under 250 men are,  at  the  present time, understood to be in process of release for civil practice;  and there appears to be some doubt as to whether any further releasescan be expected during the  next few weeks.     This number is wholly  insufficient to meet  the very serious situation which at present  exists;  and I cannot, upon my own responsibility, acquiesce in the  position as to  the present rateof demobilisation from the  R,afin,C,   While recognising  that thefurther release of R.A.1LC. officers  may involve military  con-siderations of some complexity, I find it difficult to  believethat, if both classes of consideration wero  to be balanced bythe Government, with their responsibility for  the civil, as wellas the military, aspects of the matter, the former would not  befound to  justify greater efforts  by the military authorities.The epidemic is by no means at an end: on the  contrary, it ison the increase in some areas, while  it is breaking  out for thefirst time in others; and my Department is constantly receivingappeals for assistance from localities in which a state existsapproximating, or even amounting, to disaster.   Some typicalexamples  (by no means exceptional) are appended.     It is indeed a matter of surprise that no grave publicscandal has already arisen], and  there  are circumstances notcalculated to repress an outcry  should it arise.   The ratio of R,A.M.C. medical personnel to the strength of the Army chal-lenges unfavourable comparison (all  things being considered)with the  ratio  of the number of  practitioners left in civilpractice  to the civil population.    Moreover, allegations (neversatisfactorily  disposed of) have throughout the War been madeby the medical  profession  as to  the  failure of  the &quot;MilitaryAuthorities  to  use  R.A.M.C. medical  officers to the full extentof their  time  and  capacity; and  the  allegations are  still beingmade with the  added force  that the cessation  of hostilities hasdried  up  the source  of  the very  considerable volume  of R.A.M.C.work which arises  out of casualties.   The Medical profession itself,  through its  local  and  central  organisations, has givenmy Department  the  clearest warnings  as to the gravity  of the civil  situation;  and in all these circumstances  I am convinced that unless  the present  need  can be  alleviated  by the  immediate demobilisation of  many more medical  officers, a public  outcry may  arise,  not only with a solid basis of justification, but also with very strong support  from many quarters, particularly in view  of the reaction in mental attitude on the part of the public which has followed  the  cessation of hostilities.      I feel it imperative, therefore, to ask  that steps may be taken by the War Cabinet to ensure the immediate demobilisation of additional medical officers at  a  rate which will  release for civil practice and public  health work a further five or six hundred within the next fortnight,                                              A.

APPENDIX.TYPICAL CASES INDICATING THE EXTREME CHARACTER OF THEEMERGENCY CREATED BY THE DEPLETED STATE OF THE MEDICAL        PROFESSION AND THE PRESENT EPIDEMIC.BIRMINGHAM.            A general practitioner, finding himself totallyunable to keep pace with the work&apos;,-, and having found the  patientdead on three consecutive occasions upon Which he visited,inevitably some trims after the summons, was so moved that he calledat the Local Insurance Committee Office and implored to be  relieved of a responsibility which he could no longer endure.LITTLEPORT (ISLE OF ELY)            Message from the Police to the effect that threecorpses could not be interred on the ground that, though  theydied from natural causes, they could not be certified, no medical practitioner having been in attendance.NOTTINGHAM.            Extract from letter from general practitioner:    &quot;I beg to represent,  as a matter of the gravest and    &quot;most immediate urgency the necessity for the demobilisation    &quot;of men from the Army to help the Local Profession -  otherwise    &quot;a serious scandal is almost certain to arise.   We at  the    &quot;Clinic are carrying over 40 and 50 patients, and even  more,    &quot;from one day&apos;s waiting list to the next.   Cases are being    &quot;left for days unvisited after the messages are just  recieved,    &quot;and other cases of pneumonia etc. have to be left for  days    &quot;between visits, and the unvisited cases may any of them be    &quot;pneumonia or even of more urgent consequence, yet it is    &quot;physically impossible to cover the ground.&quot;   I am personally    &quot;extremely near the limit of my physical endurance, after    &quot;working for a long period from 14 to 18 hours (or    &quot;more occasionally) Sundays and week-days.   Meantime,  we are    &quot;being grossly misused and our patients are literally  being    &quot;neglected and unattended.   Other less serious consequences    &quot;l do not name or dwell upon, though they are many and  serious.&quot;            This is confirmed from other reliable quarters  fromwhich the recent information Is that in some districts many  hundredsare going wholly without  any attention.ROTHERHAM.            A district formerly served by 8 doctors;  of  these,4 are on military service; and of the remaining 4, one died recently,two others have fallen ill, one seriously, and the last doctor ison the point of physical  breakdown.   The epidemic is very  heavy.
WOOLSTON, near COVENTRY.          A practice of 10 miles by 15 miles, comprising 21villages;  until recently worked by 2 doctors, one of whom  died&quot;while the other was simultaneously prostrated with influenza.Women and children were reported to be dying with pneumonia.BURTON-ON-TRENT *          This  area was considered in the early part of the yearto have  reached the limits of possible depiction.   Notwithstanding,two  doctors have since  died, while a Medical Association, responsiblefor  the  treatment of a  thousand insured  persons and their dependants,has  closed down, owing  to the breakdown  of their doctor.   Epidemic Is very  heavy.RYE, SUSSEX.          Population of 4,000  in  Rye, together with 5,000  in  the surrounding  country, which  is marshland, sometimes inaccessible through  floods.   The practice  is normally worked by three doctors, one  of whom   is on military  service.   The remaining two were both in bed with  influenza;   and  while a  doctor  in the R.A.M.C. happened to be on leave  and gave assistance for a few days, for some time there was no one  whatever to give medical assistance  to the population.    During this period there were  at least  8 serious cases of pneumonia  in the town without any  attention. KIDDERMINSTER.           xtract  from letter from M.0,R.  :      &quot;I am afraid there will be some trouble.   Our  Town Council      &quot;which contains  some working men members,  is already  angry      &quot;and I cannot  defend a course which compels men to remain in      H.&apos;a position where  they have practically no work to do (there      &quot;are no hostilities now) while the  poor people  here are dying      &quot;like  flies without medical attendance,  - 41 deaths  out of      &quot;27,000 in one week.&quot;g.8th November, 1918,
