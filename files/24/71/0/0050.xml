IffilS  DOCmiSNT IS THB PROPERTY OP VIS B3ITAKNIC lHJSSlfi*3 OOVBBKSRST.)ISECRET.G.T .6448.0)              WAR CABINET  POST-WAR RXLICY FOR DEFENSIVE ARMAMENT     gF ^RCHANT&quot; VESSELS AND.TjRl\raRS^Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet     The Board of Admiralty have had under consideration thepost-war policy which should be adopted in regard to the defensive arming of Merchant. Vessels in view of the possibilityat some futur? time of an intensive warfare being wagedagainst the mercantile marine; whether by surface or submarineccaft.   It is not suggested  that, in time of peace,  merchantvessels should be defenisvely armed or^that space should be reserved in them for magazines, but in/view of th-&quot; Board ofAdmiralty, the vital necessity for adequately protecting the mercantile marine and the desirability of securing thatmerchant ships are capable of being defensively armed withina reasonably short period after the outbreak of hostilitiesrender it desirable that all future ocean-going merchantvessels of 3? 5*00 to-5,000 tons should be constructed withthe necessary stiffening to carry one gun and all new merchant ship construction of 5;000 tons and above, two guns.     The following appear- to be the relative advantages and disadvantages which would result from the adoption ofthe course proposed,    ADVANTAGES.fe)   Economy of Cost.  The average cost  of preparing a     Ship when building to  receive a Defensive Armament,     is  200 for two 4.7&quot; or  400 for two 6&quot;  as against      1200 and  2000 respectively if work has to &quot;be done     later.    If preparation be made for only one gun,     the cost is approximately half these figures..(b)   Economy of Material. *If the work of stiffening and     other preparation is carried out after the Ship is     built,  a.certain amount of material is bound to be     wasted in breaking down existing fitting in order     to introduce the new stiffening;  also the hand-     steering arrangements., leads to bollards and wire-     loss must often be seriously interfered with.&apos;     Eurth-r, if the work is left till the emergency     actually arises,, a heavy strain is thrown suddenly     cn the resources-of the Country at the very time     when demands for material from-numerous sources are     heaviest.(o)  Economy of Labour;  To fit one ship after-&quot;building     necessitates the services of from 30 to 60 men     (according to degree of urgency,  weather conditions,     &amp;c)i  which would be almost entirely saved if the     work were done while the vessel is building.,,
December,  1918.        /Experience has shown that about ICO ships can be in hand    frr stiffening at any one time,  the average period of fitting    per ship being ten days for 4.7&quot; guns ana 14 days for 6&apos;&apos; guns.    Thus,  if the work is left till the emergency actually arises,    about 4000 men would &quot;be required continuously,  at the very time    that demands for manpower would &quot;be heaviest.d)  Rapidity In Arming when the emergency arises.  If the ships are    prepared beforehand 1p mount&quot;gunsT&apos; and the gUns are stored at    strategic &quot;bases at Home and Abroad, it is estimated that vessels    could &quot;be armed practically as fast as they become available    all oversea ships should &quot;be armed in from two to three months    from the date the order was given.  If stiffening has to &quot;be    oarried out concurrently with arming,  only about 100 ships    oould be armed every ten days,  and it would take from 1? to 18    months before the whole Overseas Mercantile Marine oould &quot;be    armed.e)  Reduced delays to sailings.  If ships are prepared &quot;before-    hand,  delays to sailing&quot;when the emergency arises should he    negligible, whereas if ifttmg has to be done after the out-    break of hostilities,  not only will the sailing of ships &quot;be    delayed, in almost every case for several days,  but large    numbers ef them will have to continue at sea wither&apos;-, guns for    many months.                        II.____DISASVA! TAPES.,a)  possible waste of ^expenoiture^  There will be a small initial    cost  &quot;which, may uTiimately &quot;prove to have been unnecessary, but    the charge could be spread over the life of the ship and    regarded in the nature of an insurance premium.b)  Reduction of carrying capacity^  The wei,^ht of the stiffening    of the gun&quot; se&quot;atings&quot;would  ^&quot;vary&quot;&quot;*f rom 10 to 15 tons, and should    a heavy cargo of small bulk &quot;be carried the carrying capacity    of the ship would be reduced to that extent.  This, however,    would make little difference in a ship of over 3,56o gross tons.    The proposal now put forward ha3 been considered by theChamher of shipping of the United Kingdom, who have resolved thatthey are not in favour of continuing the arming of Merchant shipsafter peace has been settled.  But if it should be laid down byKis Majesty&apos;s Government that Merchant Vessels are to be armed theythink that the cost of emplacements -and any other expense resulting .from such a provision should1be borne by the Government and that the guns and gun crews should be kept ashore.    The Liverpool Steamship Owners&apos; Association have also consideredthe proposal and they take the view that no great difficulty in arranging for the provision of gun emplacements in new constructionneed be anticipated but that in certain types of&apos; Fargo ships the strengthening of the gun platforms might seriously interfere withthe carriage of&apos;the cargo in the poop..  They are of opinion thatthe extra cost of emplacements should be borne by the Government.    It is desired that the question c-f policy should now &quot;be con-sidered and determined by the v;ar Cabinet with a vie?; to any necessary legislation &quot;being obtained.&apos; if it be decided that forthe future the larger merchant vessels should be constructed t-.ooarry an armament, it is recommended that provision should also bemade for requiring that stiffening to mount a gun of 12 pdr. calibreshall be an integral part of future Trawler designs.
