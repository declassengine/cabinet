Nil.                              II-PRESS COMMENTS.                                  (A.)-MILITARY.     The papers are so much engrossed with the subject of the General Election that most other subjects have received scant notice during the week.   On the question of the peace settlement, the &quot; Herald &quot; points out that, though the Coalition is asking for a mandateon the subject of its terms, these will in fact be decided by the preliminary peace conference with  President Wilson in Paris.   The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; on the other  hand,  considersthat a democratic  peace settlement is still possible  as a result of  the election, and that,unless such a democratic settlement is obtained,  all idea of carrying on schemes of nationalreconstruction will have to be abandoned.  The paper concludes that no blank chequeshould be given to Mr. Lloyd George for the peace  settlement.    Certain of the papers animadvert on the use of the starvation weapon against Germany,the &quot;Labour Leader &quot; printing a  protest letter on this subject  from Mr. Charles RoclenBuxton.   &quot; Justice &quot; comments on the same problem from a different  standpoint, andconsiders that the internal settlement of Germany is largely dependent  upon food supply,which, again, depends upon sufficiency of transport.  On this ground, the paper thinks that the Allied Council should reconsider that clause of the Armistice which demands the surrender of locomotives and railway trucks.                              (B.) Foreign  Affairs.The Revolutions.    All the  papers continue  to agitate  against any  action  on the part of  the Allieswhich  is  likely to interfere with   the  success  of the  socialist  revolutions.  The    (C 1560)
&quot; Workers&apos;  Dreadnought&quot; for instance,  quotes a  report  that  President  Wilson  hasthreatened to recommence the war if Russian representatives are allowed in Berlin.  It alsoalleges that the starvation weapon is to be used to prevent the formation of a SocialistRepublic in Germany, and to  obstruct revolution in Holland.   It concludes  that  theAllied Governments are deliberately setting out to  fight the socialist revolution  whereverit appears.   The &quot; Call &quot;  asks whether the working-class and the soldiers will lend them-selves to the job of strangling two  promising socialist revolutions on the bidding of theirmasters, whose sole desire is to  prevent revolution  on the Continent in order more firmlyto lay their yoke upon their own slaves at home.Russia.     Agitation  on the subject  of  intervention in  Russia continues to be  acute.  The&quot; Labour Leader &quot;  prints a letter from Mr.  Joseph  King,  M.P.,  describing this inter-vention  as  a capitalist reactionary war.   The &quot; Herald &quot; points out  that the  Northernexpedition,  is demanding  large reinforcements and  considers that the  policy actuallyadopted, is that  of smashing the Bolsheviks and collaring the spoil.  The paper suggeststhat the Censor is hiding the truth about Russia.  The &quot; Call &quot; asks whether the  slaughterof our boys is to continue so that the Russian  Socialist Republic may  be crushed, and inorder that the  gold fields, oil  wells, and  grain-lands of Russia may be stolen for  theenrichment of the capitalist.Finland.     The &quot; Herald &quot; says that as Germans are now leaving Finland, the Finnish bourgeoisare turning to England for help, and that unless Labour starts straight talk we shall soon be freeing the Finns from  socialism.                                (C.) Home  Affairs.The General Election.     General hostility  to  the Coalition is manifest  which  expresses  itself  in  criticism of the manifesto issued  by Mr. Lloyd George  and  Mr. Bonar  Law,  in an examina-tion  of  Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s claims to  success in  the past, which are  held  to   be entirely  unjustified by the facts, and in a laudation of the  Labour Party&apos;s  programme.It is generally  implied, and is specifically alleged by the  &quot; Labour Leader,&quot;  that in thisElection the clear  issue is that between autocracy and democracy, between plutocracyand Labour.     Elsewhere  the  &quot; Labour Leader &quot; says that while a free Parliament  is the only safe-guard against wild  revolution, Mr. Lloyd George  wants puppets to vote as they  are told,and to offer  no opposition or  criticism.   The same  line is taken by the &quot; Herald,&quot; whichconcludes that &quot; to entrust our freedom and the freedom of the world to a gang of greedyreactionaries who understand nothing but their own interests, is not to  prevent revolutionof the other sort violent  revolution, bloody revolution but to promote it.&quot;    The same paper points out at  another place that no guarantee has been given that-military  service will end with peace, while the protection of the key industries, which  aresimply essentials for purposes  of war, proves that war is anticipated in the future.    One of the features of this week&apos;s papers is the appeal which  is made to soldier andsailor electors, the  &quot; Herald &quot; being at pains to establish that the treatment of soldiers,while admittedly rotten, is the fault of the Government, notwithstanding the fight whichthe Labour Party has put up on their behalf.   The  &quot; Call &quot; asks soldiers and sailors to fall into  step and march  shoulder to shoulder with their fellow-workers in all lands  forthe accomplishment of the international socialist  revolution, while the  &quot; Labour  Leader &quot;says that Mr. Lloyd George is immorally exploiting the work of the soldiers and sailorsfor his own personal aims, but is apparently afraid to wait until those men  can express their  views  about him by their votes.  Even &quot; Justice &quot;  is hostile to  the Coalition, andthinks that the general sympathies and vague sentiments expressed by the Prime Ministerare unaccompanied by the slightest suggestion of how these sympathies and sentimentsare to be translated into action.The Labour Ministers.    The withdrawal of the Labour Ministers is generally approved upon the ground, asthe &quot; Labour Leader &quot; expresses it, that  solidarity is secured by their falling into line.&quot; Justice,&quot; however, is not so well satisfied, talks about Mr. Clynes abandoning  the Ministryof Food  when he was most needed,  and thinks that too much can be sacrificed for unity,which in this case is more apparent  than real.
 The Albert Hall Meeting.     The &quot; Herald &quot; regards the action of the Electrical Trades Union as a sign of Labour &apos;s resource and efficiency, as an education to the workers themselves, and as a  symbol of the  coming bloodless revolution and the  beginning of the end.  W. F. Watson in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; considers it a splendid example of solidarity and direct action, and points out that the possibility of developing the  industrial weapon is limitless in all directions.  The  &quot; Call &quot;  compares this case with  that of the Seamen&apos;s and  Firemen&apos;s Union.  The difference  is said to be that one was  in defence of free speech and in the interests of the working class against their masters, while the other was against free speech and in the interests of the masters against the working class. Merchant Service Conditions.     According to the &quot; Herald,&quot; the United States Government has stated that, before it can agree to schemes of tonnage rationing after the war, it must insist on a drastic im- provement in the conditions  under which the British seamen have to work.   This, in the  paper&apos;s opinion, is a  cause  of  shame to the  country, to  the  shipowners, and to-Mr.  Havelock Wilson. Political Prisoners.     Agitation for the release  of John McLean, the Conscientious Objectors,  and other so-called political prisoners, is continued in all the papers.  The &quot; Call &quot; asks  whether the  Labour  Party is prepared to allow the  unanimous resolution of the special Labour Conference on this subject to be treated as a scrap of  paper.                             III.-DISTRICT KEPORTS.London and South Eastern.     The discharge of workers from the aircraft factories has continued during the week,but this is causing little disturbance at present.  On the other hand, at Hendon and atWkitehead&apos;s, Richmond and Feltham, considerable unrest is reported to have been arousedowing to the non-payment for time lost during the armistice holiday.     At a recent meeting of  the London  shop  stewards, a resolution was passed that noskilled workers should be discharged from  any shop while diluted labour was still employed,and that all payments by result should cease.   The shop stewards in this district are alsodetermined to secure a 44-hour week.     The engineers are said to be suspicious that Government &quot; Reconstruction &quot; schemes will bring no benefits to the working people, owing to the  fact that the governing classes are determined to avoid any drastic change which would endanger the existing industrialsystem.     It is reported that the plumbers and joiners employed by the Brompton and KensingtonElectrical Supply Company are demanding an increase in wages, and are trying to induce the lower grades of labour to support their claim.Yorkshire and East Midlands.     This district appears to be tranquil at present.     There  is a rumour among the engineers that the Government intend to use theirunemployment benefit scheme in order to  conscript labour  for restoring the devastatedregions of France and Belgium ; the implication being, that if the men refuse work abroad.they will forfeit their right to the unemployment grant.North Western.     There is a good  deal of agitation in  various centres over the question of wages and hours.  It  is reported that  the  Barrow  Shop Stewards are endeavouring  to  rouse  theworkers to demand a 40-hour week for day shifts, and  a  30-hour week for night shifts.There is also a movement on foot to secure the abolition of Premium Bonus systems.     At a National Conference of the M.F.G.B., it was agreed to accept the offer of a 49hours&apos; week for  surface workers.   It is stated  that this agitation with regard to surface workers&apos; hours, was merely undertaken to  pave the way for a further reduction in the hoursof  the  miners  themselves.   At  this conference, Robert  Smillie  suggested that  theGovernment should be asked to allow  the Labour  Party to  appoint their own repiesen-tatives to the Peace Conference ;  and thus avoid, the danger  of seeing Labour representedmerely by Government nominees.    (C 1560)                                                                  A 2
    An important mass meeting of engineers and shipbuilders is reported to have beenheld at Liverpool on December 1st, under the auspices of the  Mersey Engineering and shipbuilding Trades&apos; Federation.  Considerable dissatisfaction was expressed at the recent55. advance awarded by the C.O.P., and in this connection a resolution was passed refusing to submit future wage  claims  to  any  Government  tribunal, unless Trade Unionistsand  Government  officials  were equally represented thereon,  in view of this resolutionit is reported that the men will refuse to submit their claims  to the new tribunal set upin place of  the O.O.P., because there  are no  Trade Union representatives on  it.  It wasalso decided to declare a general holiday on December 14th. (polling day).    The weavers in Manchester are stated to be in favour of agitating for a shorter working week,  the suggestion being  made that mills should be shut  down on Saturdays.   Thisproposal has  met with strong  opposition from  the spinners and  cardroom  operatives,however, who are anxious to obtain a settlement of the pending wages  dispute before turningtheir attention to another question.Northern.    Some unrest  is reported among the workers at Newcastle  owing to the restrictionagainst the  purchase of small quantities of spirit.   Otherwise this area remains quiet.South  Wales.    There is a continued agitation especially  in the Khondda district, in connection withthe food supply ;   and the local agitators are making use of this grievance to stir up unrest and propagate their own revolutionary doctrines.                 *Scotland.    In spite of the discharge of about  25,000 munition workers, the unrest in the Glasgowarea is not as  serious as was expected.   Nevertheless, it is reported that the revolutionaryelement are endeavouring  to stir up. the workers to  demand full wages for all dismissedfrom work.    The Scottish  builders  are  determined to hold out against piece  work and premiumbonus  systems, and demand their abolition wherever they are already in existence.                                    IV. DISPUTES.    The general situation remains surprisingly quiet when it  is remembered  that the demobilisation of munitions Avorkers is in progress.  The most serious dispute is that ofthe cotton operatives in Lancashire where both the spinners and weavers are asking forwages advances.(a)  Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The Admiralty Labour Department reports  two minor stoppages; in both cases work was speedily resumed.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that only 30 workers were on strike on November27th,  compared with 18,090 at the end of the previous week.           A temporary strike occurred at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, Parkhead, because certain traffic men        demanded a special allowance for working in the rain. They finally agreed to accept 6s. a        week until the end of February when the matter will  be reconsidered.   As they are pivotal        men, 10,000 other workers would have been rendered idle by a continuance of the strike.    The Coal Controller reports five fresh stoppages for the week ending December 3rd.A stoppage has occurred at Rothervale Company&apos;s Orgreave Colliery (Yorkshire), contraryto the advice of the men&apos;s leaders.            The Bedwas  Colliery (Monmouthshire) is still idle  owing to  the alleged unsafe condition      of the mine.    The War  Office Contracts Department states that since the signing of the  armisticethere has  been very little disturbance in firms engaged on War Office  Contracts., Nostrikes,are reported.Replied from Other Sources.            Several stokers and enginemen employed at. the  Hudclersfield Corporation^  Electricity        Works are on strike because they claim that a  3s. 6d. wages advance awarded by the Committee        on Production should be retrospective to August, while the Corporation are only willing to        pay it from October.
G.  H.  ROBERTS.(b)  Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.     No cases are reported by the Admiralty Labour Department.     The Ministry of Munitions reports that a number of men employed by Messrs. R. G.Pickering (Wishaw)  handed in notices to leave because  they were  dissatisfied with anarbitrators award.   Negotiations are proceeding.     The Coal Controller reports that the Surface-Workers Council, as well as the Miners&apos;Federation, has accepted the owners&apos; offer of a 49 hours&apos; week lor Surface-Workers.            Considerable difficulty has arisen at the Collieries because the Ministry of Munitions has        sanctioned the payment of three days&apos; wage in connection with the armistice holiday, while the        Coal Controller refuses to  enforce more  than one day&apos;s payment, as he alleges that the great        cost of the former award would fall largely on public funds.Reported from Other Sources.            With regard to the wages dispute of the Lancashire Cotton Operatives, there is no change        in the situation and a strike is threatened to begin on 7th December,  unless the Government       &apos; intervenes.  It is suggested by some of the cotton operatives, that if the  Government threatened        to investigate the employees excess profits returns, the employers would give way at once rather        than face such an investigation.            About 2,000 coal miners employed by Messrs. William Baird  Company, South Ayrshire,        have tendered a week&apos;s notice to strike unless the firm either discharges 17 non-union men        or causes them to join the miner&apos;s union.     The Court of Arbitration  heard 28  cases  in  London during  the past week.   these included a claim by the twisters, drawers and dressers of the Woollen and Worsted trades in the Yorkshire district, for an increase in the basic rates equivalent to the recent advances in other sections  of the textile  trade.
