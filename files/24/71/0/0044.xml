(HIS DOCHIiEI^ IS THg PI^OPgRTY OF HIS BRITAEC HAjgSTY^S GOVERNMENT.)BBC R 5 T.&amp;.T.-6443.W A R  CABINET.W^E in LI TAR Y rOLICY IK RUSSIA,   !&apos;omo: by Dr. H.A.L. Fisher,     I am much impressed with the evidence which flows in from many sides of a general feeling of uneasiness with respectto the character and design of our Military-Commitments in theRussian Empire.  There is no doubt whatever that the continu-ance of military operations in Russia,  now that an Armistice  *has been signed with the central rowers and their Allies, is extremely unpopular with the working men and women cf thisCountry, themoro so since rumours are  circulating to theeffect that feritish soldiers serving in Russia are starvingfor lack of food.    Working people do  not understand why wearo fighting in Russia at all unless it be, as they are in-formed &quot;by the Independent Labour Party, to assist in therestoration of Autocracyregime, but aver-jProbably only a small minority of                         hewart :                         theworking men in this Country sympathies with the Bolshevik                   jiuch larger number consider thatconstitution of the Russian Government is an affair to theRussians themselves paid that Russia should bo left to stewin her own juice.     I think, therefore, that it would be desirable for theGovernment to take some early opportunity of defining its position on the Russian question.   I am myself so ill-informed with respect to the course of recent events inRussia and tho measures which we have takon, in conjunctionwith our Allies, to deal with the many vast and complicatedproblems which have arisen in the Russian Empire during thopast two years, that I cannot presume to offer a considered opinion as to the proper course to be pursued.    I take it,how5ver, that I am correct in assuming that our originalmilitary intervention in the Russian Empire was.prompted bythroe motives       1st, - The restq? ation of the Eastern Front against the -                 German powersj       2nd, - The protection of the Czecho-Slovaks; and       3rd, - The deliverance of tho Russian people from the                 tyranny of a Government of It evolutionary                 malefactors.Of these motives,  the first has now disappeared with the signature of the Armistice and the second is not,  I take it,any longer an operative consideration in view of the factthat the Czecho-Slovaks can now be returned to the Czecho-Slovak Republic.which has recently been constituted,  Tothis extent then,  the problem has been simplified by thecourse of events,  and we can now confine our enquiry to theextent to which the continued presence of the Allied forces on the soil of the Russian Empire is likely to contribute toa better order of things, in Russia.    This is a largeproblem but it will have to be faced and I suggest that thereare two ways of facing it - either the Allies may perseverein, what I.understand, to be their present purpose, and continue the struggle until they have overthrown the Bolshevik                                                regime
regime and nelpo^iie Russians to establish another Government inits place, or they may determine to refer the whole question&apos;ofthe future settlement of the Russian Empire to the Peace Con-ferenoo,   I have not the materials for a judgment as to whetherthe most recent incarnation of the Bolshevik Government is as &apos;bad as it is painted or as to whether it ha3 succeed din secur-ing a large measure of accoptanco in Russia and I cannot, therefore,offer ZD. opinion as to whether it would be right to carry on an allied V/ar for the overthrow of the BoSshovik power.  All I can say is that the continuance- of -tho \;ar for such an object wouldbo most unpopular in this&apos; Country and would become more and more *unpopular the longer the operations were protracted.                                *      If, however, the Government should decide upon the second course, if it should take tho view that the opening of the PeaceConference at Paris offers a convenient opportunity for settling the affairs of the Russian Empire, then I would suggest as amatter for consideration whether, side by side with the mainConference, there should hot bo established a subsidiary conference for the purpose of handling the large number of very special and complicated problems which ariso in connection with thesettlement of the Russian Empire.  Such a Conference would doubtless be attended by representatives from the various Govern-ments which have been established in Russia and its environs,from Esthonia, from Georgia, from the Ukraine, from Omsjc, from finland, and, in the hypothesis which I am considering, fromthe Bolshevik Government as well.   I believe that if theGovernment were in a position to inform the Country that it    and intended, in conjunction with the Allies with the Armenian Republic/with Delegates from  all parts of the Russian Empire, to framesuch an adjustment between the relations of the new States whichhave been formed within the Russian Empire and the government at Moscow as would restore Peace to Russia and enable the allied troops to return home and that the settlement of the Russianquestion would be entrusted to a special Congress sitting atthe same time and, to some extent, identical in personnel withthe peace Congress for the settlement of the affairs of theCentral powers, the Turkish Empire and the German Colonies&apos;,a great step would be taken towards the alleviation of thatfeeling of anxiety to which I have, a lidded-                          (Sd.)
