MEMORANDUM BY THE  PRESIDENT OF  THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD.     I  HAVE come to the conclusion that, if the declared policy of the Government inregard to the housing question is to be fully realised, the proposals hitherto put forward,both in  regard to the terms  of financial  assistance  to the  local authorities and inregard to the  methods by  which the Governments  policy is to  be directed  by theCentral Department, will need considerable modification.  Although I have no doubtthat the existing proposals  would  lead to the provision of  a substantial number ofhouses, I am  not satisfied  that  they would ensure the  erection of such a number or at a sufficiently early date to be regarded as a  reasonable fulfilment of the Govern-ment programme.     The Association  of Municipal Corporations, which may be taken to represent thelarger and more progressive urban authorities,  have intimated to the Government their intention  of pressing that, if  financial assistance  from the State is to follow thepresent lines, the loss falling upon the rates should be  limited in all cases to the produce of a penny rate.  If this is not conceded, we are bound to anticipate that many even ofthese authorities will be unwilling to accept the Government terms.     As regards the  less  progressive urban  authorities and the  rural districts, theevidence, I am afraid, clearly points to the conclusion that more drastic methods will berequired  if an adequate number of houses are  to be erected in these areas.   Finally, inthe  case of the  rural areas it  seems to me to be  essential  that the Governmentshousing scheme should be assimilated  as nearly as may be to the  scheme approved bythe Government for land settlement.     The  proposals which I now desire to submit for consideration may ,be summarised asfollows:           I. Financial Assistance to Local Authorities from Public Funds.     In view of the additional cost of providing houses for the working classes which isdue to war  conditions, I suggest  that the Government should accept the proposition that the whole of the burden in  excess of an amount which  would be produced by a penny rate should be borne by the Exchequer.  Owing, however, to the strain on our national finances, I understand that the  Treasury take the view that the Exchequer-subsidy should take the form of a  contribution to the annual expenditure in preference to the payment  of  a capital grant  and that the larger local authorities should be encouraged to borrow on their own credit from sources other than the State.     I propose therefore :      1.  That the annual charge to be borne by a local authority in  respect  of a housing           scheme carried out  by them within a period approved by the Local Govern-           ment  Board should not  exceed the amount  of the produce of a rate of a           penny in  the   on the area chargeable.    2.  That the State should bear any charge in respect of the scheme in excess of that           amount,  but  should  not contribute towards  the cost where the  annual           charge would not, so,far as can he estimated, exceed that amount.    8.  That where  the local authority  borrows from State  sources, the Exchequer          subsidy should take the  form of a reduction  of the loan charges, and that           where the local authority borrows  from other  sources,  the  Exchequer           subsidy should take the form  of an annual-grant.    4.  That the  Exchequer subsidy should continue  to  be paid during what maybe          termed the transitional period of, say, seven years, and that at the end of           that  period there should he  a final adjustment such  as would enable the,          liability  of the State to be finally  discharged  on the basis of the principles          set out in 1 and 2 above.    5.  That for the  purposes of this  final adjustment the amount  of estimated annual          expenditure should be compared with the  amount of the estimated annual
           income, and that if as a result of this comparison it appears that the future           annual charge to be borne by the local authority would exceed the produce of           \d, rate, the excess should be met by the State, by writing off a portion of           the outstanding liability (if the  money was borrowed from State sources) or           by the  payment  of a capital sum (if the money was  burrowed from other           sources).     In  putting the above principles  into  actual operation it is proposed that thereshould be three stages :      (a.) The  first stage will  be that at which the local authority submit their estimates           to the  Local  Government Board.   While,  owing  to  the difference in  the           amount of rents obtainable in different localities lor the same class of house,           differences in building costs, and varying rates of interest, it would appear           to be impracticable to insist upon  a flat rate for the State contribution, the           Local Government Board  Avill  at this preliminary stage endeavour to fix           standard  rates of contribution, and to persuade  the  local authority to           accept the appropriate standard as a provisional working basis on the clear           understanding  that  it will be adjusted at  the second stage as  described           below.     (/).) In order to avoid  any delay at the  outset in disputing with the local authority           as to the rate of contribution, it  is proposed that the provisional rate adopted           for the  purposes of the estimates should be adjusted, as soon as practicable           after the houses have been built  and let, on  the  basis of the actual expen-           diture incurred and the actual rents obtained.     (c.) The third stage will be the final adjustment, at  the end of  the seven years&apos;           transitional period, as indicated  in  paragraph 5 above.,     It  is evident that under this scheme it  will be  necessary for the Local GovernmentBoard to exercise effective  supervision at all stages, involving (l)  the closest scrutiny ofthe plans, specifications, and  contracts;  (2)  test inspections during the actual  building-operations; and (3) investigation of the amount  of the rents charged.     In this connection two points seem to require  special mention.   (1)  In the eventof the actual cost of building exceeding the estimated expenditure, the reason for the excess will have to be carefully examined, and in any case in which the. Local  Govern-ment Board  were not satisfied that the whole or any  part  of  the excess  had been properly or reasonably incurred, such excess or portion thereof would  not rank forState assistance.   (2)  With regard to the amount of the rents, it  is inteuded that the ideal to be aimed at should be the charging  of economic&apos; rents, and  in cases  in whichthe Local Government Board regarded the rents obtained by the  local authority as too low, they should have power to insist upon  the  raising of  the rents to the  economiclevel, or, failing that, to  make a proportionate  reduction in the amount of the state assistance.  In the event of Rent Courts being  established, any  dispute on this point might be referred to the  Court.     In the event  of such tribunals  not being established it might be necessary toprovide  for the  reference of any case  in  which  the  local authority and  the LocalGovernment Board were unable to agree to  an independent  arbitrator appointed by theLocal Government Board with the local authority&apos;s concurrence, or failing concurrenceappointed by the President of the Institute of Surveyors.     The principal advantage which may be  claimed for  the present scheme as comparedwith the Governments previous proposals is that  it entirely  removes the element of uncertainty which was the chief obstacle to the acceptance of the  previous  proposals by the  local authorities.   The pressure exercised by the local authorities was such thattlie  Government  would in  practice,  have found  it  almost  impossible  in the vast majority of cases to resist  the claim that the burden on the  locality should be limited tothe  produce of a Id. rate.   If the charge on the rates had  been so limited, the cost tothe  Treasury would have been as great as under the new proposals.     It may be admitted that the new scheme is open to the criticism that  it does not provide the local authority with a direct incentive  to economy.  In  answer to this  itmay be  pointed Out  (1) that  the former  scheme could not  have escaped similarcriticism  if in fact the  limit to the Id. rate had been  made universal  in  practice;and   (2)  that under the machinery  now proposed  economy  can be  enforced bythe  central  authority  at every stage,  and  that  if effective supervision  by ibecentral authority is  thus secured, the  risk of loss to  the State will be reduced to  aminimum.
                   II, Financial Assistance to Public Utility Societies,      Subject to certain necessary modifications, and  to  the provision of adequate safe- guards, I suggest  that the  Government should  proceed  on similar lines  in granting financial assistance to public utility societies.0  But, whereas in the case of the local-authorities I  propose that, during the emergency period,  the  State should come to their assistance whenever the charge on the district exceeds the  produce of a Id. rate, I suggest that the State should  assist the Public Utility Societies where the abnormal cost of erecting houses brings  the  return  on  money  borrowed   by them  from other sources than the State to more than 2 per cent, below  the statutory limitation on  the interest or dividend payable.  Thus the extent of the State  subsidy would  be  limited to the amount required to enable  them  to pay interest or dividend on their  outside capital within 2 per cent, of the statutory limitation.   The  proposed subsidy would, of course, be in addition to the assistance which would he  afforded  to the  society  by  the advance,  by  way  of loan, of  a  considerable  proportion  of the capital  cost.  This proportion I suggest should be 75  per cent, of the cost.      I believe that these terms, while preserving the principle of partnership between the  State and the locality, would provide  a sufficient inducement to the Public Utility Societies to erect a considerable  number  of houses, even  under the conditions produced by the war.   The  scheme would not afford the societies an absolute guarantee  against loss, biit,  apart from the normal  owners&apos;  risks which they are quite willing to face, they would see the prospect of a reasonable return on the capital  invested by them.      I need  not emphasise  the importance of enlisting the help of these societies in solving the housing problem.      As pointed out  in the Interim Keport of  the  Housing  (Financial  Assistance) Committee on Public Utility Societies  [Cd. 9223], the post-war operations of these societies  might be out of  all proportion  to their  pre-war  efforts  if they  are given substantial assistance, and  if  employers  and  landowners,  as   well  as  co-operative societies, can be encouraged  to take advantage of the movement.      It would of course be  necessary to make the giving  of the financial  assistance proposed  conditional upon the observance of certain safeguards, such as those indicated in the Keport of the Committee just referred to.                          III. Central Department Machinery.      In order to enable the  Local  Government Board to perform the dual function  of expediting the erection  of houses  and of protecting the  Treasury  from uneconomical construction  or management, a considerable extension of the  machinery  of  the Central Department and a large measure of decentralisation will be needed.      For the  purpose of expediting the provision of houses I propose  to appoint a Chief Commissioner of Housing, who will be in charge of a separate Department which will devote its whole energies to the rapid erection of houses during the resettlement period.      This Department will deal  with both  administrative and technical  questions, will secure uniformity in  the  procedure of the required Housing Commissioners, and will constitute  a  central bureau  of  information and advice in regard  to provision of houses,    * The following&apos;description of Public  Utility Societies is given in the Interim  Report of the  Housing (Financial Assistance) Committee [Od. 9223] (paragraphs 12 and 13) :-    A Public Utility Society was first defined in &quot; The  Housing, Town  Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1909,&quot; section 4 (2), as-follows:--         For the purposes of this section, a Public Utility  Society means  a society registered under    &apos;The Industrial  and  Provident Societies Act, 1893,&apos; or any amendment  thereof, the  rules  whereof    prohibit the payment of any interest or dividend at a. rate exceeding 57. per centum per annum.&quot;    The  Industrial and Provident Societies  Acts are  the  Acts under which  the ordinary Co-operative Industrial Society is registered.   Under these Acts, societies, their rules, and any amendment of their rules are registered by the  liegiftrar of Friendly Societies.  No person can hold more than 200/. in shares,  but there is no statutory limitation to borrowing powers, which may  be exercised within the limit fixed by  the rules,  and certain societies have conferred voting powers on members  in respect  of loan stock.   Its capital need  not be fixed in amount, and the rules  of a society may provide for  capital being withdrawable,  la general, the  societies registered under these Acts aim  at co-operation and the promotion of individual thrift for the purposes of mutual  helpfulness.    At the present time Public  Utility Societies, properly so-called, number approximately 128. Of these, 22 have as yet done no business, their operations having been held up owing to the war.  Of the remaining 101!,.(59  have received  loans from  the  Public Works Loan  Hoard.   In addition to these, there are many co-operative societies  and  other bodies registered  under the Acts who do not in fact pay  interest  or dividend in  excess of 5 per cent., and  who could, by inserting a provision to  that effect in  their rules, become Public Utility Societies.   These  societies have built a considerable number of houses, though they have not borrowed moneys  from the Public Works Loan Hoard.        [1066]                                                                B 2
laying out of sites, types of cottage  design and their  construction, building materials,and standardisation of fittings.   In this connection I may say that my expert  staff isalready engaged upon the preparation  of suggested types of designs and is negotiating with manufacturers with a view to the production of standardised fittings  which wouldbe available for the houses which are to be built.   I propose further to appoint, eight, or perhaps nine, Housing Commissioners whose respective  districts will correspond with the districts assigned to the divisional officers of the Employment Department of the Ministryof Labour.  Each Commissioner  will  have  his own local office  and his   own  stall&apos; of expert advisers  and clerks.    The Commissioner  will   consider and  discuss with thelocal authorities  the needs of their districts in regard to housing, and will advise and assisteach local authority in his district  on questions of the  provision of houses and planning of sites (including  minor  public  works subsidiary  thereto).   He  will  conduct  allpreliminary discussions and will submit sufficient information and sketch plans to enablethe Central Department to give an immediate decision  as to whether the scheme shouldbe allowed to proceed.  If, after any local inquiry  that may be necessary lias been held,the scheme receives approval, the Commissioner will assist and advise the local authority in completing the scheme, and in fact bringing it up to  the point at which it is ready forsanction by the Central Department.     By this machinery I hope it will be possible, while maintaining such  control as isnecessary to secure economy, to allow full scope to local individuality and  talent.   Thelocal authorities will be encouraged  in every  possible  way  to  employ the  services  ofcompetent architects, by competition or otherwise, and thus obtain the utmost  possibleoriginality and diversity of design.                              IV. Local Authorities.           . t              ....               -                     .     . :     The exising local authorities for housing purposes  are  the London County  Council,the metropolitan borough councils, the town councils, and  the urban  and   rural  district councils.  I do not think  it is either  necessary  or desirable to deprive  any of these authorities of their existing powers, but it is clearly essential to  have requisite  powersto secure the erection of houses in  cases of default not  only by the  smaller but  also byany  authority.   With &quot;this end in  view I propose :      (a.) That the Local Government Board should have power  to  replace the  existing            minor local  authorities by the  county  council without formal proof of            default where the local authority have not taken adequate steps to  exercise            their powers of providing houses.   (A Bill  to this effect was  introduced in            the  last Parliament hut was not proceeded with.)     (6.) That in case of default by any  local authority the  Local Government Board            should have power to provide [?and  manage! the houses and recover  the            cost from the defaulting authority, in  which case the State would withhold            either the whole or a part  of the financial assistance promised to the willing            authorities.                              V. New Powers needed.     In order to facilitate and expedite  the  erection  of houses  during the emergencyperiod certain amendments of the  existing statutes will be needed and some new powers will be  required.  1 append a summary  of the  principal points in regard to which legislation appears to me to be necessary.                                   *     As the fresh powers for which I  propose  to  seek legislation are in many  respectsidentical with, or similar to, those which I understand will be required by the Board ofAgriculture in  connection  with  the  scheme  of  land  settlement, it  is  a  matter forconsideration whether the Governments proposals in regard to both housing and landsettlement might not be included  in a single Bill.
