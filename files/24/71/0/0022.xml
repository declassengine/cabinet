4  y^p^S       \i  iT^^u^JUce^  65     (This telegram is the property of His Britannic felestyj^s Governmenti0   and  should be  returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for trans-     mission  to the Colonial Office when done with unless required for     official use).     PARAPHRASE TELECKM from the Governor General of the Commonwealth     of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.          (Received Colonial Office 5.35 a.m. 30ih November, 1918)        Acting Prime Minister sends following mo a sage  begins  -Secret.   Earnest consideration has been given to  your telegramsNovember 12th and November 16th.   It is necessary to  recapitulatethe Wool negotiations from their initiation in order that you mayrealist the position of the Coraaonwrealth Government.    In response to a telegram from your Office the prims Minister  during November1916 convened a Conference of wool growers and others  interested  .in the Australian Wool Industry, and a telegram-was despatched  tothe effect that the Wool growers of Australia ware prepared to dispose of the balance of that season^ clip at 15  pence per pound -   *on greasy basis plus &amp;0% of profits if any over and above the flat rate, 48 hours after the first meeting.   Share was no necessity to .requisition, there was no bargaining or haggling:   the wool growersfreely stated that they would offer no opposition if BritishGovernment required the wool.   The terms for the  New  Zealand cliphaving been fixed at 65% above the 1913-1914 prices plus 50ft of profits, such terms and coaditiaaa would bo accepted,  by theAustralian Wool growers.        At that date the United Stater  was a neutral  country andwool growers considered that any sirplue wools sold in america would return a substantial profit to both Australia and GreatBritain.   There was every justification in the assumption boththen and since, because the United States were purchasers of SouthAfrican and South American Wools above- the Australian parity.                                                       -  The
        The situation m&amp; altered souBvvnat when the UnitedStates joined the Allies as a (?oo)-belligerent,  but the  UnitedStates still continued buying South African and Argentine, woolsat prioes exceeding the Australian parity, and what is more  tothe point frhey paid more than Australian parity for home  grownUnited States wool, thus placing the Commonwealth Governmentin a difficult position, creating unrest among Australian woolgrowers, and imposing an exceedingly heavy task upon the  Centralfool Committee who control the. wool scheme in Australia.        Prior to the last wool contract being finalised theChairman of the Commonwealth Central Wool Committee and theSurveyor General of Supply London exchanged several, private  and confidential cables regarding the details and although for good reasons these details have never been disclosed they were .important factors in recommendation of the. Chairman of theCentral Wool Committee to Australian Wool Growers that theywould be well advised to accept the Imperial Governments offer for the purchase of the wool clips for the period of the  war andfor one full wool year after.  It is necessary also to refer to your cable of the 12th of Ifovember regarding South Africanwool.  In order to satisfy Australian wool growers the advance on the prices during 1313 and 1914 of 55 per cent in the  case ofAustralia and 70 per cent in the case of South Africa willrequire muoh explanation by the Central Wool Committee.  Thereis no doubt that had no difficulty arisen 55$  plus participation of profits would be in favour of the Australian grower, but  theUnited States demands throw considerable doubt on the result&apos;particularly as the United States allocations for the 1917-1918clip were  large.        In.addition to  (?quantity) there  is also the fact that both for United States military and naval requirements wools ofthe highest, grades were allotted  leaving avbalance of  inferiorwool on which prospects of profits over and above the flat  rateare greatly reduced.                                                    It
          It is neither  sound nor  equitable for the United states to request terms and conditions  for the highest grades of woolson a parity basis for the whole  Australian clip.   As regards1918-1919 wool allocation to the United States, vide telegram 3rdNovember 375, from Dirawmat to Central Wool Committee, are we tounderstand that the terms contained therein are to be cancelled?          On the advice  of the Central Wool Committee theConrnonwealth Government  desire you to ask the United States repre-sentatives to reconsider matter  with the foregoing facts beforethem, which it is believed have  not been taken into account bythem, which the Australian wool  growers are warranted in  submittingand which are essential factors  in price for their wool clip.The United States Government representatives must realise thattheir request amounts practically  to  a  demand that Australian woolgrowers shall accept lower prices  than  those paid to United Stateswool growers.          Whatever terms may  be  finally arranged, it  is suggested ,1.   that absolute aoosecv  be  observed.2.   that only wool for navy  and military purposes be included,3.   that wool for civilian purposes  to all Allies be on  civilianissue prices which should be mutually  determined  as between theCommonwealth Central Wool Committee  and your Wool Commission,4.   that arrangements be made to  draw an  absolutely  distinct  line between wool for military use and civilian purposes.          Until we as trustees for Australian wool growers knowhow  their interests may be affected by the prices  to  be paid for australian wool, by the United States and Allied  Governments,  wedo not feel justified in making definite  replies  to your  telegramsof the 12th re South African wool  and 18th relative to UnitedStates wool.    The Commonwealth Government have  no  desire to  in-crease your troubles but they are compelled to  submit the caseof the Australian wool growers .          Please advise as negotiations proceeding.   End ofActing Prime Minister&apos;^ message.                                           MUNRO  FERGUSON .
