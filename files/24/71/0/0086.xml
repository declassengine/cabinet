v324S ICC^TT IS Tim PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)      Sir Joseph Haday and I have discussed with M,Clement el,M. Boret, Signor Cr*spi, Mr.  Hoover and Mr.  Hurley thequestion remitted to us as a result of the Allied Conversationon the 3rd instant.      Mr. Hoover was unable formally to agree to any variation of the Presidents proposal,  but in thff main ho expressed general  concurrence with the view of the Allies, subject, ofcourse,  to the Presidents approval and to the adjustment of details.   Mr. Hoover had to leave for Prance on the 11thinstant, and was therefore prevented from assisting in thepreparation of the attached document (Appendix A) which was subsequently agreed upon by the British, French and Italianrepresentatives.      Briefly stated, the plan now proposed givss the control,both  political and administrative, to a Council of the Alliesspecially  constituted for this purpose and acting in conjunctionwith  the United  States.   The actual administration, subject to the   control and  direction of the Allies, will be  entrusted toMr. Hoover, who  will act  as the mandatory of the  Allies, sothat  it  may appear and  be known that the relief  is the resultof the  efforts of  the Allies in conjunction with  the UnitedStates  and not of  the United States  alone.   The  details of theproposal will be found  in the attached  document. &quot;       It was  thought right,  before  submitting  this document,  to  consult the representatives  of  Canada,Australia, New  Zealand  and Newfoundland.on  the  scheme generally,  and  with  particular  reference  to  Clause  8,&apos; which relates to tho disposal  of  exportable  surpluses  of                                             foodE C RET,IMPERIAL WAR CABINET.T, 6484.VICTUALLING MB SUPPLY OF APPLIED NEUTRAL           AND ENEMY COUNTRIES.

food in exporting countries.  It was explained to themthat this clause was intended to safeguard Britishinterests against the unlikely,  but not impossible,  risk(^particularly if the scheme:  remains in operation after thepresent cereal year) that the United States surplus  offood might be disposed of,. while Imperial surplusOF-werenot utilised.  The Dominion representatives assented tothe clause on this understanding,  but from another pointof view were disposed to think that the clause might beinjurious to Dominion interests  if it involved any controlof their freedom to dispose of their surplus.   they suggested that the Council  should consider the fixing ofprices and should devote attention to the problem ofsecuring that differences of freight rates should not operate to the disadvantage of the Dominions.   I  observedthat the British representatives on the proposed  new council would no doubt bear these points in mind,  butthat it must be understood that  the United States Govern-ment had not yet assented to the clause as new presentedand that we were awaiting Mr. Hoover&apos;a reply after con-sidering the document with the president.N.B.    The function of the Committee appointed at theAllied Conversation was not to conclude a definite agreementbut to report to the four Governments.     Recommendation  :- Sir Joseph Maclay and I, after con-sultation with our various experts, recommend that the coursproposed in the attached document should be adopted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government leaving the details to be adjusted.  Ifthe United States Government will not accept the substance of this proposal the matter presumably will have to bediscussed again between the /                                      representative n
      representatives  of the four - Governments and. another&quot;pian      prepared, but  I  am hopeful  of the aoceptance by the U.S.      Government  of  the present proposal.            At the  sitting of the Committee matters of urgency      such as the immediate provision of cereals  for Finland and      of foodstuffs  for Serbia were decided in order that no time      should be lost and that immediate practical stepB should      be taken where necessary.  As a consequence relief is now      proceeding both for Finland and Serbia.            The needs of the liberated territories,  neutral                               yet      and enemy countries have cabinet/be^n ascertained and there&quot;      fore cannot be stated with any approach to accuracy.     nevertheless,  and assuming that the requirements are  on a     high scale,  it is the opinion of the Committee  that *,hero      is sufficient exportable surplus of cereals in  the world&apos;s      supply to provide necessary relief,  subject however to  due      care and economy of consumption.  It ia not possible  at     the moment to be more precise.             Enemy Ships^     Steps  are being taken to obtain     the German ships  upon the lines indicated in the  two tslegr     attaohed.  (Appendices B and C).    Since these telegrams wore     sent a statement has  appeared  in the Press that Marshal Foch *     has demanded delivery of 2i million tens of mercantile     shipping on behalf of Mr.  Hoover for the Allies,  and  I  have     seen it reported that Erzberger had consented,  but there     is so far no official information available.  In any  event     no time is being lost in striving to obtain the use of  tho     mercantile marine of  Germary as  well as that of Austria,                                        (Sd).

APPENDIX "A".

VICTUALLING AND SUPPLY OF ALLIED NEUTRAL AND ? COUNTRIES

At the Allied Conversations in London on December 3rd the British, French and Italian Governments remitted to M. Clementel, M. ?. Lord Reading, Sir Joseph Maclay, Signor Crespi and Signor Villa, with M. Hoover and Mr. Hurley, if available, the examination of the question of the Victualling and supply of Allied, Neutral and Enemy countries, in its economic, financial and other aspects as well as the connected question of the handing over to the Allies of enemy merchant ships, with a view to the preparation of a full report for the consideration of the four Governments.

(2) In pursuance of this resolution the representatives named in the ? paragrah of the British, French, Italian and United  States Governments (with the exception of M. ?ouisson, whose place was taken by M. Beret and of ? nor Villa) have met and examined with the greatest care President Wilson&apos; s memorandum hich was transmitted to the respective Governments by Colonel House.

Before considering the memorandum in detail, the representatives of the British, French and Italian Governments desire to state that they are in complete accord with the expressed wish of the Government of the United States, that the populations of Neutral countries and even of enemy countries shall not have to endure  unnecessary privation and danger of ?.

The Allied Governments are anxious to maintain in its integrity the principle of co-operation with the United States Government which has hitherto regulated the action they have taken in ? They must earnestly
wish to associate themselves, so far aa their resources.enahthem, with  the organisation and general policy of supplyv/hich the United States Government has proposed to them forthe freed territories and neutral and enemy countries,  andthey have reason to believe that, after arranging for theheeds cf the invaded regions and the allied countries,  the exportable  surplus will prove sufficient to meet the needsof neutral  and. of enemy countries in addition.     There  are, however, certain general principles v/hichmust govern the supply of food and which may be stated a3follows :-(a)  It is important to avoid the establishment of twoparallel and independent organisations,  one supplying theneeds of the Allies and the other the needs of liberatedpeoples, neutrals and enemies.  If the associated Govern-ments were  to establish such parallel and independentorganisations they might give the ene.f;y the impression thatthe unanimity of view v/hich has marked inter-allied organisations during the War has undergone a change which the enemymight think he could, exploit.(b)  It is equally important that this impression of closeunanimity and association should be maintained in each ofthe associated countries throughout the period when peacenegotiations will be taking place and when the unanimity ofNational feeling ought to be a guarantee of united action.(c)  It is also important that the peoples who havebenefited by a relief in which all the associated countriestake part should not consider it as furnished by the UnitedStates Government contrary to the intentions of the AlliedGovernments, who would thus appear to be solely responsiblefor a policy of prolonging the Blockade.     The proposed organisation for the relief of liberated,neutral and enemy territories should be conceived in sucha way that during the specially troubled period through
&apos;hich we are passing it will be a means- of. safe guarding and organising peoples menaced &quot;by social disruption.   The supplies which ere allocated to then ought to appear to them as the first beneficent application of the great principles which govern the policies of the associated ^Governments,       It is in the light of the foregoing principles, which are in agreement with those expressed by the President    tr,3 United States, that the Allied Governments have examined the proposal that he has submitted to them and have elaborated it with a view to united action. (3)   A Council should be formed composed of two representatives of each Government, either Ministers or representatives armed with ministerial powers. (4)   The Council to be &quot;set up under the foregoing proposal WM MA  &apos; IT  ut a.   * (a)  consider and determine questions of general policy, and arrange the general programmes( (b)  consider and determine th** need for importation or relief in Vne various countries, taking into account the exportable  surplus of food availably (c)    consider and determine the Governments or bodies to which  allocations of food shall ba made in any  case, (d)    consider and determine ths use  of stocks  of food held by ths enemy  in Neutral countries; (e.)    lay down generally ths principles on which the administration of relief should proceed. (5)    To  enable them to  carry-  out the foregoing duties the Council  shall receive reports  from the  existing Inter-Allied organisations of the Allied programmes  and of their  execution- These  programmes shall  not bo  reduced for&apos; the purpose of supplying Neutrals and  enemies.  The  execution  of the Allied                                            programmes
programmes shall continue to he carried on as in-thajpaet^without any oharne by the existing organisations.                                          -/Hied        The Council shall receive from the/BlockadeCommittee proposed allocations for the supply of eachof the Neutral countries..  It shall receive from theNeutral oountries their proposals as to the oountries of origin from which they desire to receive their allocation.(6)     The         Council shall if necessary determineby Inter-Alliea-experts appointed by it the needs,  internalsupplies, means of distribution, in short, the food posi-tion of the liberated and enemy countries.(7)     The         Council shall establish as Inter-Allied staff to gather information on questions needingdecision.  The staff shall supply the necessary- otatistiesand transmit the instructions of the Council to tho differentorganisations concerned.(8)     The Supreme  Council shall decide the allocations to be made to each of the liberated, Neutral or enemyoountries,titmcountries of origin where there is a surplus  .at disposal after provision for tha-Allied needs^--ad-detersmined by  the existing Inter-Allied&apos; Committees.                       finance,  iEnemy Countries.                /        It would fall to the Council to consider thevarious financial problems involved.  It was stated bythe United States representative that as regards products from the  United States  there would probably be no diffi-culty in  the United States finding the necessary working capital.  It is olear,  however, that having  regard to theother very large financial claims upon enemy  countries,political questions will arise  in relation to  the pay-ment for  food  supplied  to  enemy populations.
     Neutrals,           **s regards Neutrals no difficulty noedbo anticipated : s to payment,   Generally speakingthe Neutrals have an abundance of gold and credits *Indeed from the point of vie;/ of the Exchanges itwould appear to bq rather an advantage than a burden to supply them with foods     Itiberated Oountrieg.           There remains tho question of tho supplyof food to liberated peoples who aro not able to&apos;)oy*  This question with other financial problemsinvolves will have  to JO considered by thsCouncil in conjunction with the Treasuries of the associated Governments *           The         Oourioil shall determine thocompensations to be obtained from Neutrals orenemies, whether in credits or in materials, andshall propose their distribution amongst the fourassociated countries in proportions  to be  determined.                    AjginriSTMTIpH,           o           It is most important  that  tne european allies shall not appear to  stand aloof from the workof  relieving-distress in Europe.  This, however, wouldbe  tho consequence  if the,administration  of reliefshould be solely by the United  States and  not by  the United States and the Allies  jointly,  Tho answer thatthere will be  .h Allied Council laying down theprinciples of relief  does not most  tho difficulty...s  the suffering populations  would  know nothing ofthe existence  of tho  Allied Council and would  think thatthe Allies had  refused  to co-operate in relieving thesuffering populations.    This  aspect of  the  matter is  of special  importance/
to the European Allies - France and Italy more particularly - who are contiguous to the distressed populations in Europe, and therefore the work of relief should be recognised everywhere as being joint in character.

There was general agreement on these views among members of the Committee.

With these considerations in mind and having regard to the high degree of confidence placed by the Allied Governments in the United States Food Administrator, the British, French and Italian Governments recommend that the present United States Food Administrator should act as a mandatory of the Allied and United States Governments in the actual administration of relief in accordance with the Council&apos;s directions, so that it may be known to the relieved populations that the Allies and the United States are engaged jointly in the assistance given.

A representative of Great Britain, France and Italy, respectively, shall be appointed who shall be kept informed by the United States Food Administrator of the progressive execution of the relief programme for each country.

The supplies of food allocated to liberated peoples and to neutral or enemy countries shall be placed upon arrival for disposal as directed by the Council.

The distributions shall be watched by a representative of the United States Food Administrator as mandatory of the Allies and he shall maintain communication with the diplomatic or official representatives in these countries of the Allied Governments, and keep them fully informed.

11. ? TONNAGE.

The necessity of bringing all enemy ocean-going tonnage into operation at the earliest moment was emphasised at the conference and the members of the Committee were in general
agreement upon this )Oint,   It was suggested  that  the mostexpeditious method of.  obtaining the German tonnage wouldprobably be to convey  a masstgo to the enemy  through theArmistice Committee or Marshal Foch.   Hhe suggestion v.asaccepted and, in order to save time,  stops have boontaken to bring the nt.ttv.-r to the notice of the proper authorities *     It will be tho duty of the proposed Council to  lay down the.principles on which enemy tonnage should  be employed.(18) All decisions of  tho Council are subject in the last resort to tho approval oi the respective Governments re-presented thereon, etch Government retaining  the final  rightto withhold assent.2, nhitehall Gardens,  1$..;-.10         December 12th,  1918,

Thequestion then immediately arises as to tho terms upon ^hichGermany would be willing to act as desired.  Jjpubtless  thefour Governments would agree that it is  out of the question to mess eny arrangement whereby the Allies undertake to pro-vide food and supplies to the extent of  the carrying capacityof German ships.     The best tGrms for the Allies would  obviously be thatthe ships should be placer unconditionally at their disposaluntil some further rirran^oment can be effected.     Germany ^ould doubtless refuse such a deriEnd, unlessaccompanied by some  iromiso  of relief which would  justifythem in the eyes of their public in followlnn the  Allies toobtain the ships.
