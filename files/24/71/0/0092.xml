Spain  /006.. .  I , Hf^^j     KBMORAHMMThe Situation in spain, with special reference to the Republicanagitation and the Regionalist Question.   Tne Spanish political situation hasbeen steadily growing worseduring the last two months.   Sneor Kaura^s cabinet of ex-PrimeMinisters gradually lost ground, chiefly for three reasons -First there was the international situation and especially the questionof the losses by German submarines and the measures to be taken todefend Spain,   It appeared in August that the Government was at lastgoing to act with vigour..   This was certainly the desire and intentionof Senor Dato, the Foreign Minister, who was strongly supported bySenor Besada, bv4? Count Romanones and, more important still, by tiiePrime Minister himself.   Senor Cambo, Sen*r Alba and the Llarquis f ftlhucemas were either  doubtful or more or less in opposition.   Butthey acquiesced and the Cabinet was,at least nominally, unanimous.There *ras considerable public excitement of course as soon as it wasknownthat action was contemplated and the pro-German press tried towork up a campaign about the Allies dragging Spain into the war.   Toquiet the country the  Government issued a statement cn August 20th.-The language was  exceedingly timid  or polite, whichever word be prefer-red;  but it did  state that a note  had been seat  to.Germany informing the German Government  that if further sinkings occurred spain would be compelled to replace the lost tonnage out of German ships in -Spanishharbours.   However, in soite of the  strong language used by Dato in private, discussions and delays took  the place of action while  ships                                                       or were still sunk.   The truth was that the nervousness *f .pro-Germanism  x
                                 2.^rfcwywrb9juv^jx^tmb^ra of the Cab:Ltte1^cKmttjmally &quot;blocked any real deci-sion.   Meanwhile&quot; of -^u^&quot;Germany made continued efforts to whittledown the demands of Spain and prevent action.   Another cause of delaywas the hope,of Spain that  in return for action she might get somethingout of the Allies,   But  the Allies had no particular desire to bringSpain into the war:  and the only result of  the Spanish attitude wasto make Prance very luke-warm about the whole business lest she shouldbe asked to  pay the Spanish bill by the concession of Tangier, while Mr. Balfour  evaded a discussion  of Morocco with the Spanish ambassador and contented himself with  general promises  of swJnort in. the event ofa break with Germany,.   There was  a futther  cause of delay in the  fesrsof the Spanish Government that military and  reactionary circles in spain, or revolutionaries in German pay,  as  some were known to be,might provoke a civil war if relations with  Germany were  broken off.   The result of  this was that action, which appeared imminent early in August,  had still  not  been  taken When  on  October  2nd Alba  suddenly resigned and caused  the resignation of the whole  Cabinet, which how- ever  resumed office .nest  day without Alba.    His  nominal  motive was a question about teachers&apos;  salaries, but  it  was believed  that he was sivre  influenced by a desire to be  free  to  conduct  intrigues with  a view to  forming a party  of  his  own.   He  may also  have  been affected by his knowledge  &quot;that actionagainst Germany  could  not be  delayed  much  ocger.    In any  case it  is believed  that Homanones  made  it a condi-  ion of  his resuming office that German  vessels  should  be seised  at  nee.    And this  was done after  a  fashion within  a few,days,  a public  nnouncemont being made  on  Oct.  14th  that after  &quot;friendly discussion&quot;  nd &quot;without prejudice  to rights,  titles and legal awards&quot;,  seven  erman vessels  of a total of 21,000  tons,:  were at once  to be  delivered  o the  Spanish Government,    The delivery of the  ships  followed the   sxt day.                                                           -  -
r   This is assuredly much less than Do to a ad Jtom&amp;nones had intendedand led  pooolo to expect.   The number of ships taken was o very poorcompensation for- the number lost and the method seemed one chosen notto vindicate Spanish Tights but to save Germany&apos;e face,  por were theAllies at all satisfied of the validity of the transfer, which appearedto. reserve German rights of ultimate recovery.   Besides., the action,even if it had been of a stronger character, came too late to win theCabinet any credit either at home or abroad.   If Itato had forced im-mediate action in August, as we had wished,  it would havo been differentBut the timidity of some of his colleagues,  and cf the King, shrank froma breach with Germany for fear of domestic disturbances and postponedaction till action could no longer bring them any credit.   If theyhad acted in August, especially if thoy had broken off relations withGermany, as the stronger  members of tho Cabinet exoected, they wouldhave had a share in the prestige of the Allied Victories of september and October.   But by October 14-th Germany was already defeated and tthe poor business of the seven ships could not then bring credit to anyone,  Instead of being carried along by the stream of victory as theymight have been the Haura Cabinet was left high and dry.   The conse-quence was that before the final German collapse came on Hovember 11th,Maura was no longer Prime Minister.  His fall Was by no means whollydue, as will be seen presently, to his failure in foreign policy.   Butthe pro-Ally wave of feeling which naturally grew stronger with everyAllied victory, could not be&apos;favourable to a Government which had onthe whole lost an obvious opportunity of dealing boldly with german aggression.   The truth is that both for national and international reasons &amp;move to the Left was obviously indicated.   This was indeed so: plain that.even before the debate in tho Chamber which was the immediatecause of Maura&apos;s resignation, the King was consulting with Alhuoemasand Alba.  The crisis only lasted&apos;a few days, and on nov., 9th a
 iberal Cabinet took office with Alhucemas as Prime Minister, Romanonc-s 3 Poreign Minister and Alba as Minister of Finance.   Romanonos had een offered the Premiership and had tried to secure the assistance of anor Helchiades Alvarez and the Reformists who are again  ready to work ith a democratoed Monarchy.   But negotiations  failed, as Alvarez ide a Constituent Assembly a condition of his suooort.  The result was   combination already given.  It seems a strange course  to entrust  the ate of Spain at such a time of crisis to the weakest of Soanish leaders,. But perhaps for that reason Alhucemas provoked loss person;J jealousy, B important point whore personal ambitions play  so large  a part as thoy 3 in Spain.   Still a triumvirate consisting of  a Prime Minister who a par and a half ago intrigued his present Foreign Secretary out of thepremiership, a Finance Minister who took part in  that intrigue andlortky afterwards played the same part against his successful colleague,Iid had sinco upset the Coalition Government of which all  three were ambers, and a foreign Minister who has 1 een the  victim of both his *1 leagues was not likely to be a very happy family.   \nd, in fact,drifter provoking a few stormy debates in the Chamber, the new CabinetLAS collapsed without surviving a month and at the moment  fDec.5)I                            &apos;                   &apos; *\ &apos;\mX Romanones is again charged with the task of trying to form a1&apos;nistry,   If anyone can do so ii the present oo ndition of SpanishIclitics he can.   Por he is the only Monarchist  politician who from  thefirst and quite openly had championed the cause of the Allies^  andJMurally he now shines with their reflected glory, and in in a veryIosition from such men as Alhuoemas and Alba, whose tardy  protesta-I ions oi pro-Ally sympathies are receive! with general derision.1 But, as wo said at the outset, the International situation and &apos;tonish foreign policy are only tho first of three causes  of  the presentLIVE political situation of that country.   The  second indeed isposely allied to the first for it is the spread  of Republicanism andI0oialist views which have of course been generally stimulated by&quot; tho
 fall  of tho German Empire&apos;,  and its constituent monarchies  and other sovereignties.    The  &quot;bloc&apos; of the Extreme  Left was not very success- ful  in the General Election last j&apos;cbrua,ru.    In fact,  both Reoubli- cans  and Reformists came back weaker thrn in ,the previous  Parliament. with  the- result that though the Socialists  got six seats instead of  o one  the whole &apos;bloc&apos;  lost rather than gained ground and held only about 30 seats.    But throughout the lif^ of the  liaura liinistry this small group carried on a v  ry  ctive campaign  against  the  Government: - nd  though in September !Vlouiad&apos;-s Alvares,  the Reformist  leader,  so f r  broke u?Ky from the grouo , s to return  publicly to his old policy oi willingness to serve under the Monarchy,  that has not modified the attitude either of Lerroux  and the Republicans or of Besteiro, Prieto and other Socialists.    These have made extremely violent attacks on the King in the  Chamber itself,  causing disorderly scenes. The  Republican Domingo openly demanded the  i:ing&apos;s abdication.    The Labour Committees have passed resolutions oiiering their eympathy to&quot; Russian, German and Austrian peoples  in their revolutionary move- ments and declaring the Spanish Monarchy  an insuperable obstacle to the  progress and prosperity of the nation.    The Republican Deputies and  ex-Deputies have held a meeting and  resolved that a Republic                                        Directorate should immediately be proclaimed with a  2toUH!&amp;BX$ oi five, two of whom are Lerroux and Domingo.  This Directorate has issued a maniies- to declaring that spain cannot continue  to exist as a monarchy and setting forth a lengthy programme of political, Social and economic reform, the most interesting points in which are perhaps a repudiation of Bolshevism and anarchy  (its first three provisions being devoted to the preservation of Ofcder, military discipline and political continuity) and a curious abandonment of the former party&apos;policy ofIan entire withdrawal from Morocco.   The protectorate is,  according to their programme, to be administered in a &quot;civilian spirit&quot; and its  policy &quot;framed in the orbit of Spain&apos;s natural allies, the
                    IIm*GtettiiAmocrcwi0e?^^               to  &quot;sympathise with the moral position of  spain&quot;, not :rYom&apos;^rU^^aWttJ^^fppresses  Spanish hearts&quot;, hut from Tangier.  This is obviously a note addressed  to the Allies and  the Peace Congress.   The Republicans used to wish to be rid of the whole Horocco business.   Mow they  think Spain may find her opportunity to  make a bargain:  keeping the Protectorate but surrendering the disputed claim to Tangier  in the hope of obtaining Gibraltar  in exchange,   As, however, the  British Admiralty  has quite[recently declared against a  suggestion of  the Army Council that Gibraltar might be exchanged  to Ceuta, nothing seems very likely to oome of this.   The policy which the Republicans might  follow if they come into power is, however, not the present point, which  is the probability of their doigg so.   As  to  this, it is extremely difficult to judge.   On the one hand, it is  certain that there is a great  deal  of unrest - stimulated, of  course, by revolutions abroad - and that some well-informed judges regard the fall of  the monarchy as inevitable.   Certainly the open attacks on the  King in and outside Parliament are ominous, and Russian i Bolshevists  in  Barcelona are making as much mischief as they can.    On the  other hand,  the strength of  revolutionary  elements can never be safely  judged from  the noise they make.   It is their  business to make as much poise as they can,  and elections frequently prove them to be stronger in poise than in numbers, as has been the- case in  the only two  recent jJeneral Elections,  those of  Norway and the United States.    And though [revolutions  are generally made by minorities, it seems doubtful whether I the complete politioal ignorance and apathy of  the mass of the Spanish  people provides a  very favourable ground for revolutionary action.   Nor Man such memories  as survive of the Republican  chaos from whioh Alfonso  III delivered the  country be very favourable to its  revival.  un  the Uole, there would  still seem to be a fair chance for the Konarohy if we Monarchical politicians, and in  particular  Romanones, who  has Uveeeded  in forming a Cabinet  (Dec6), will have the honesty  and  courage  &apos;o embark  on a  real course of reform.    It is a great  pity that  the
ii . ^rmists have again refused to join the Hinistry,. owing to their emand for a Constitutional Assembly.   It would seem that most ofthe rest of. their programme, such as the reform of the- Senate,  the modification of  the  powers of  tho Executive Government, general  self-                                                 wellgovernment and autonomy  in Catalonia  could *uite Kit be carried  outby the oresent Parliament.   Indeed,  both the  late and presentCabinets have put several of these items in their  programme ofnolicy.   But no doubt it is a difficulty that  their leaderAlvarez, has no  seat in  the present Chamber^ and that they believe                                              this-they would gain  by a new Election.-    Possibly/ may prove necessary,but a new Chamber is not the same thing as a Constituent Assembly.   The choice really lies there.   Either a Parliamentary and Cortstitu-tional course of reform; or,  at the least, an attempt at violent change.For in spite of-what is said in certain ouarters it seems improbable that a change of regime would be produced by a  General Election.  To-     as ten months ago, though no doubt to a less extent,  the majorityof voters would either not vote at all or would return deputies ofthe old sort.   The 1&apos;onarehy,  if it falls, will fall not by a parliamentary vote or even by the desire of the majority of Spaniards;but by the failure of the Monarchical statesmen to satisfy the demands,many of them quite reasonable,  of a politically self-consaiousminority,   There remains the third cause of this difficult and dangerous sit-ua-tion.    This is what is known as Regional ism.-  . .S a in is. the mostRegionalist Country  in the world as Prance is  the least.-   3ven inFrance Regionalism,  that is&apos;,, less centralisation,  begins to be de-manded.    But in Spain the old provincial feeling has never died ason the whole it has in Prance.    And it has of  late shown a marked re-vival,  especially in Catalonia, the most advanced and the leastSpanish of the  provinces.    It  will be remembered that a year or moreago,  this  policy culminated in  the holding,  or in the attempt to hold,what, was  called an unofficial  Parliament at Barcelona,  which besides
  astic political reforms in other matters, demanded autonomy  for^[ lonia.   Kadrid and the bulk of the official and political world  s always-been, and no doubt still is, onposed to this demand-.  But  ready a year ago the Regional is ts vrere a. force who had to be reckoned  th and the Alhucemas Cabinet which followed on.the fall of Dato and  Id the &quot;free&quot; general election last February, contained two nominees   Senor Cambo, the Regional!st leader, Senor Ventnsa and Senor Rodes.  en the grave crisis of Ilarch occurred and Kaura formed his Coalition  Inistry of all the leaders, Cambo himself took office and hela it till  iura resigned.   The Coalition could of course take no action on so Introversial a question,  but Cambo has always made it clear that he las no  retracted any of his views or claims.    He is a strong and able  an,  a man of business and Real-Politik rather than of ideas,  and  ooked upon even by many who hold more liberal&apos; Mew than he, as the most  likely of the statesmen to promote and develop the economic life of Spain.   Considering the differences of opinion among them on other subjects,  arabo has held the Catalans together on the Regional1st issue  with remarkable success.    There were signs of suspicion among them when  irst his henchmen Ventosa and Rodes,  and then he  himselftbecame  ministers of the Crown;   but as he said after  taking  office, oil he had sacrificed was his immediate liberty of action,  hot his convictions,  and he reasserted in Parliament his adherence to the programme  of  the    * unofficial  Parliament&apos;.   More recently,  indeed just before the fall oiff the $fiaura Cabinet,  in reply to  an attack by Alba,  he  went so far as tc claim for Catalonia  the  same powers as were possessed by the small  States in the  German Confederation.    He spoke at  the same, time,  and  has spoken since,  of the current now  running throughout the world in favour of ocal  autonomy.    And no  doubt  :?egionalists, like  Republicans,  are Inding the  events of the  last  few weeks in their  favour generally, thoughrin point  of $act;, the  actual  solution of the difficulties which !o Russia, Austria,  and Turkey  were&apos;more or less parallel  to those  of
9,359   atalonia.  has not been local autonomy but independence.   And inde-pen-^ju^oe or annexation to France is an idea which has at times boon played   1th. in Catalonia us Alba reminded Combo in the course of the debate.     There is no. doubt&apos; that tot; problem is one for which some solution   ust be found in the near future.    It was the immediate cause of tho   ast crisis and Romanones in taking office is said to have -announced that  fcis programme was one of autonomy for Gatlonia, as well as of a good  [understanding with the Allies abroad and constitutional reform at homo.  [The first announcement is probably the most important of the three.  The  [question is not purely Catalan. .   It is there that it is most urgent  [because Catalonia is the richest province in Spain, because the agitation  [there is older and stronger than elsewhere,- and baaause it starts with  [the advantage &apos; that;there and there only are the,provincial Councils, of  which there are four in Catalonia,  welded int? a single body, the  pan or muni dad.,  as it  is called,  of Catalonia.    This was authorised in  1913 during&apos; the Ministry of the  Sonservativo loader,  Senor Duto,   It. is  obvious that all these circumstances give. Catalonia a, special position.  If  Catalonia gets nothing,  no other province will get anything.   But the lagii^/iion is not confined.&quot;to Catalonia and the Catalan -policy includes  [autonomy fo.- other provinces,  though only-if they ask for it.   Through-  out Spain there&apos;has  long been plenty of impatience with the incompe-  tence and corruption of the Government but the demand for autonomy does&apos;  not appear  to be very active- -except In :Catalonia and the Basque province,  though one  Andalusian and two Asturian Regional 1sts. wore elected in  February,    There- were seven Basque nationalists and some 25 or 26  Catalans..    There is ujso some agitation in Oalicia.    But the principal  Movement outside Catalonia  is that ofotho Basque people.    They are in.  I the habit of making  a protest against the loss of their f&amp;rmer special  .      ;s every October 25: . and this year,  stimulated by the.Allied&apos;  [victories and the general awakening, of the spirit of nationality, the  kemonstration,  expecially that of- the Bilbao Town. Council and that
                                io.                                   ;J60 of the Nationalist  Senators  and Deputies was  more  authoratative  and much mare nearly unanimous  than usual.    They sent telegrams  to  President filson and to  the Cseoho-Slovak Committee  in  Paris  and a protest to Madrid against  the  destruction  of  Basque independence in 1036.   But the Basnue problem is  subsiduary to  the Catalan.   This  latter has taken a rapid advance towards  the  forcing of a  solution in  the last few weeks..   On Nov. 26th a  great  meeting  was held  at Barcelona  and pas ajtc-ndfid bv every  Catalan Senator  and  Deputy -  whatever party they            -  .   -  ....           - be longed: to - byrs preqentatlvcs-. of ever?  Cut&amp;l  n municipality and of the great commercial interests  of  the  provnee.   It was  the more impres- sive because quite  orderly..   The  result was  a deputation to the Prime Minister, the Harquis  of  Alhuoemas,  in the  last  we):): of  November.    It consisted of 26 Regionalists, 7 Republicans,  2 Reformists,   2 Conserva- tives, 1 Liberal and 4 car lists, and was headed  by  Senor ^this y  Cadal- fach, the President of the ilancomunidad, who  in  introducing it,  said that 98 $ of the intni c i pal i ties of Catalonia  had declared themselves in f wour of autonomy,.    He  insisted that the desire for a  restoration of the political liberties of Catalonia had been continuous ever slice they were lost  two  hundred years ago after  the Peace of  Utrecht,  when Croat Britain and her  Allies  abandoned the  Catalans to the  vengeance ofuMlip V.   The desire was shared  by all sections  of opinion in  one form or another, from  the car lists  who would  revive the  ancient  privi- loge.s,. to the Republicans who desired  v. modern federal system,.    He then submitted the message  and the prime Minister,  made a guarded reply.    The Republican members  of  the Deputation added  a  resolution  of  their own saying that the message did  not express all their views, dcolaring their desire for a  general scheme  of autonomy for  all Snain,  and asserts ing the difficulty  of  carrying  out  such a  scheme without a  Republic.   The message  of the  1&apos;ancomunidyd contains a regular plan  of autonomy ior Catalonia,  that is for the  four provinces of Barcelona,. Verona, Lorida and Tarragona..   The  Regional Government  is  to consist of (1) a Parliament of two Chambers,  the upper  being elected by the  Corporations;.
(2) an Executive responsible to the Parliament.  The Regional Governmentwill have &quot;full sovereignty&quot;in the internal Government of Catalonia&quot; cx-cept in steh matters as are reserved to the state of -hioh a long list isgiven, including International, relations, Army &amp; Navy, Custons Service,Railways &amp; Canals of general interest, the Postal Service, Weights &amp;reasures, and what is desoribed as &quot;social legislation&quot;.  Disputes be-tween the State and the Regional Government s ^11 be referred to a mixedTribunal with pawer to declare null and void any encroaching action on thepart of either^  It will be observed that this plan follows - perhapsnaturally as its aim is decentralisation - the American and Australian oprecedents and not the Canadian and South African:  that is, all powersnot expressly given to the Central Government are reserved to the provin-cial.   There follow proposals as to the provision for the finance bothQf the Region and cf the State, the State depending chief; on f e Customs  Iand income from Postal and other monopolies.  It is finally suggested thattill tho Regional Parliament can be eleoted, which should be within a year, its duties should be carried out by the present Catalan Deputies and Senators in the Uanoomunidad.   The scheme is elaborated further in con- iiderable detail but its authors declare that they d*5 not mean it for a [project of lav/ but merely for an outline which may be useful to the Govern- tent in preparing a Constitution.  They oenolude their message by a ref- irenfte to the &quot;triumph of the principle of the collective right ef people- I                                                        !    ;  - lies to be ruled by institutions to which  they have giveh their assent&quot;. 1                     *                   4                             i 1   What will come of this it is  impossible to prophecy.  It seems certain pat the history of the question has  entered on a new stage and almost  cer- i&amp;in that sons steps  in the direction of  satisfying  the Catalan aspira- ions will fyrve to be taken.  It is true that a very  large  demonstration, Ittended, it is said, by 100,000 people, has been he&amp;d  at Madrid to pro- Bet against the Regionalist pretensions.  But it is  unde  stood that  the lent crisis was a recogmtlon  of  the necessity  of  facing  them: and tobably before many months are out,  with  or without  a  preliminary Incral Election, some  steps in that  direction will have  te  be taken;&apos; 9
