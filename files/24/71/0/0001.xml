There were 65 applications during the  previous week  so  that if the number continues  at anything like  the same figure licences will  have to be  - refused owing  to  there being no  accommodation  for  quarantining the! dogs *   The position is complicated by  so much  of  the  accommodation being at present  taken up by dogs from  Devon and Cornwall *   If soldierrs pets have to be left behind when their owners  embark for home it is not unlikely that there will be an  outcry  on  the  part of the public , but what will be worse in respect  to the  prevention  of rabies  will be that smuggling  of dogs will be  rife unless facilities are given for landing in accordance  with  the  Importation of Dogs Order.

A Conference has been held at Chatham     between&quot;the&quot;Haval&quot;and*Military Authorities and Officers of the     Board to consider what restrictions on fishing in &apos;;he Thames Estuary     could be withdrawn in view of the changed situation-)   The withdrawal     of restrictions on night fishing throughout the area was the most     important outcome *Installation of Motor power in Pishing Vessels^   The Committee have     lately been asked to make arrangements for the installation of     engines in a fleet of five large trawlers at a west coast porfco   The     work is now in hand.   It is practically impossible at the present     time to get motor installations of such size efficiently carried     out except by having recourse to the experienced staff of the     Committee.               There is reason to hope that the conversion of these     trawlers into motor boats will lead to the development of a port     which before the war was little used for fishing except at certain     seasons of  the year*Demobilisations        la) fumerous applications for priority of release from Naval     Service are Btill being received, but no definite arrangements for     release have yet been communicated by the Admiralty*        (b) 7ish Trade and Military Service^   The work in connection with     demobilisation of pivotal men in the fish trades is being pressed     forward.

With the view of bringing up-to-date the information     given in Leaflet No. 197 as to the facilities available for     institional training, the Universities and Colleges have been asked     to supply revised particulars of their coursesoI&apos;              Applications for provisional sanction to expenditure on     Agricultural Research at the various Institutes during  the year     1918-19 have been considered and grants amounting to  22,000 have     been provisionally approved, in addition to which  3,200 has been     sanctioned  for the new Phytopathological Institute which is being     established at Rothamsted.

The work of the Branch during the week has consisted of enquiries and correspondence as to the improvement of ruraltransport and extended commercial oontrol after the war and on matters&apos; arising in connection with the Sale of Pood and DrugsActB and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act.          The number of applications for ordinary  issues ofthe leaflets was 548, in response to which 2,165 copies were despatched.          In addition 14 ,-600 copies of the leaflets were despatched to applicants for supplies in bulk for distribution.         Applications were received for 212 copies of the ThreeBound Volumes of Leaflets, and 157 copies of the pamphlet &quot;How to manage an Allotment&quot; were sent out.   104 colics of the pamphletMRats:  How to Exterminate them, and the Taking of Wild Rabbits&quot;were sold.          A revised edition of a poster drawing attention to theBoardfs publications lias been prepared, with special referenceto the requirements of allotment holders, and arrangements havebeen made, through the courtesy of the Postmaster General, for,000 copies to be exhibited at Head Post Offices and TownSub-Offices in England and Wales.   The previous exhibition ofthis poster (intended primarily for farmers) took place inJuly last.          The usual enquiries bearing directly and indirectly on Agricultural publications have been received and dealt with by this Branch.                       Flax Production Branch.          It has been  arranged  for samples of the seed of each crojto be sent to the Food Production Department for testing beforepassing into the bulk  for re-dressing.   All seed is  being re-dressedso as to ensure the quality of  the seed handed  over to the FlaxControl Board.   To this end Central Dressing Stations are being arranged for.          The proposed Hosta^ for deseeding labour at Selby forwhich the premises at  4Jonnen&apos;s Shipyard  were being taken ever hasbeen abandoned in view of the cost and the difficulty in adaptingthese premises within a short period.          It is thought-that the cessation of hostilities and therelease of Munition workers will ease the labour situation at Selby.          The programme for breaking machinery has been revisedfollowing the original tests with the Feuillette breaker, which isnot found to give the output represented by the patentees.          The modified programme involves the substitution of anumber of &quot;smaller machines of the F;uillette type with a number of machines of the Kennedy type, and these have been ordered. It is not expected that thiB altered programme will delay the delivery ofthese machines beyond the date when the premises are ready to receive them.drawn up on a war-basis it is proposed to  ask the  Treasury  toset aside an additonal sum of  10,000 to m:et possible developments contingent on the return of research  workersabsent on military service.          The examination of County claims for grants foragricultural education for last year and of estimates forthe current year is being proceeded with.
Small Holding Colonies.              Holboach.   Farming  operation a,   The lifting  of potatoesr\    is  progressing  rather  slowly owing  to  th^ frosty weather which      prevents a  start b ing made  in  the  early mornings.   There is a      good  staff  of pickers  on  the Colony when all are at work, but a      great many  are  laid up with  influenza.              Heath Hill.    58  acres  of wheat have been drilled during      the weik making ISO acres of autumn corn sown up to date.   The      nulk  of  the mangolds are  &quot;pulled&quot; but  so far none have been   carted.              Owing to the near prospect  of  peace it is felt that the      whole of the operations on the  Colony  should, as soon  as possible,      be  conducted by ex-Service men;  it has, therefore, been  &apos;  -d      decided  to  &quot;wind up&quot; the  Hostel in  Uaroh, which, if it is not then      possible to convert into  holdings,     can be utilised  for housing      single prospective settlers.              34 bullocks have  now been sold off the grass without any      extra food  stuffs, at  an  average price of  36. 2. 1$.   As they      cost . 31. 5,  (home) it is considered  that they will leave a      satisfactory return.              During  the week 8 young pigs,  born on the premises, have      been  divided amongst the  settlers,  the bare cost only  being charged      for them, as an inducement and  to give them a fair start.              Patrington.    Farming  operations during the week consisted      of  steam ploughing and potato lifting, also thatching.   In      consequence of  the good weather wheat  sowing is being  pushed      forward  with all speed.    The crops, produce and stock disposed of      during the week included  100 qrs. wheat, 15 st. oats and 229 eggs.Tithe, Copyhold. Commons and Survey  Branch.              Judging from correspondence received and enquiries made      personally at this Office, it would seem that a considerable      proportion of the persons interested in tithe rentcharge are      unaware  of the passing of the recent Tithe Act.   Steps are, however,      being taken to make the provisions  of&quot;the Act more widely known.              In conformity  with their policy of encouraging and      facilitating redemption the  Board have approved the extension of      the time  for inspecting Tithe Maps,  Tithe Apportionments, etc. in      the Public Inspection  Room at this  Office from 10 a.m. to 1 p.ra. to      10  a.m.  to 4 p.m. each day except on Saturday when 1 p.m. will      still be  the closing time.    The fee for( inspection has been      reduced  to Is. for each document inspected on each day*a attendance.              The Board have also  authorised the resumption, as soon as      the necessary arrangements&apos;can  be made, of the work, which has      been  suspended for the past  two years, of supplying to the public,      on  payment of the cost, tracings from  Tithe Maps and extracts from      other documents.   The revival  of this work will assist solicitors      and others who require particulars  neoessary for making applications      for redemption.              In response to representations received from various      quarters, the Board have  approved the  resumption at the earliest      practicable date of proceedings for compulsory redemption, which,I     with  a view to economy in staff, have  been discontinued since the      outbreak of War.Land Division.                              w

There are still two returns to bereceived of the production of roots and potatoes this year;  andtb/5 results should be ready in the course of a very few days.   Thetabulation of these returns has been the principal work Of the branch during the week.        At the request of the Ministry of Pood a apeaial meetingof the Departmental Committee on Live Stock and Heat Production washeld, at short notice, on the 26th instant, to consider thesralculations of home meat supplies for the ensuing twelve months,which had been made by the Director of Heat Supplies of the Ministry.Mr. Boys, Kr. Wells and Mr. Fisher attended from the Ministry, anda full discussion took place of the probable number and weight of cattle and sheep foming forward at different periods up to 1stOctober, 1919.   In the end Hr. Boys substantially modified hisestimates.   as regards beef production, the calculations set outin the Committee1s last report were slightly readjusted, and theprobable home supplies of meat for the twelve months October, 1918,to September, 1919, were agreed at 531,000 tons of beef and 200,000tons of mutton.   It was further agreed that in making arrangementsfor imported supplies, a &quot;margin of safety&quot; 3hould be allowed by deducting, say, 10 per cent from these figures.

During  the  last  week  97 cases of complaint  of non-payment        of  the minimum  rates were received, of which 24 were from        Hampshire;  7  cases of complaint were sent to the Inspectors for        visit; enquiries by correspondence were made in 63 cases, and 5        cases  were  completed;  reports were received from Inspectors in        31  cases.               Mr. Pike, who as Secretary of the  Hampshire District Wages        Committee is a  part-time officer of the  Board, has  been appointed        as  an  Inspector in  addition to his post  as Secretary of the        District  Committee, and  he entered on his  new duties on the 25th        instant.

Among agriculturists  there is at present a  considerable        fueling of  anxiety  as to the  agricultural  labour situation, and        farmers are very anxious that the  present  labour have^iVoly should        not  be withdrawn until steps  have  been taken to repl&amp;.cfc such labour  I        by  demobilised  men.   A  very  general  desire is ex-H-et^ed tV- the        early  release  of pivotal men  at present  in the army, necessary for        the  agricultural industry.               The potato  situation  still remains very acute, and it is        feared that unless  the weather keeps  favourable for the next two        or  three  weeks, there will be a considerable loss of food, to theI        country,  owing  to deterioration of potatoes still in the ground.

Among agriculturists there is at present a considerablefueling of anxiety as to the agricultural labour oitutuitou, andfarmers are very anxious that the present labour available shouldnot be withdrawn until steps have been taken to replace such labour by demobilised men.   A very general desire is expressed for theearly release of pivotal men at present in the army, necessary forthe agricultural industry-        The potato situation still remains very acute, and it  isfeared that unless the weather keeps favourable for the.next twoor three weeks,  there will be a considerable loss of food, to the  &apos;country, owing to deterioration of potatoes still in the ground.        The Deputy Director was present at a meeting of Wiltshirefarmers addressed by Mv. Anker Simmons, Agricultural Advisor tothe Ministry of Pootf, on November 25th at Swindon..

The urgent and important work, which the Board are now engaged upon, not only in connection with food production.,  but fordealing with the many land problems arising out of the war, isbeing seriously hampered J)y the present distribution of the Board&apos;staff in a number of offices distant from each other, which rendersit impossible for Headquarters staff to keep closely in touch withthe business going on in the various departments of the Board.Efforts are being made to secure the early restoration of theBoard1 s new building in \7hitehall Place  (Armament building) whichwas lent to the Ministry of Munitions at the outbreak of wareIt is of the utmost importance that the Board should becomepossessed or be provided with accommodation which will enable thestaff to be concentrated at the earliest possible date.
