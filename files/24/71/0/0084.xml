(This Document is the Prooert    His Britannic Malesty&apos;8  OovernmeiSTRY DP SHIPPING1    320te by^the^Bhlpplng; Controller as  to future  shipbuilding folio?.      With the release of pressure of war vessels,  a  considerableumber of men have been added to those engaged in mercantile  ship-uilding and good deliveries of suitable tonnage  are hoped for.      The amount of shipping built or building for  the Britishovernment is as followsompleted;,000  tons deadweight  and  over 000   &quot;       M,000  - 4,900  tons  deadweightider  3,000      *      &quot;lildinp;000 tone deadweight and over000  11       n       &quot;000 - 4,900 tons deadweightder 3,000    &quot;      &quot;Ships 126  28   2  19 175 319  68  29  94 510TonnageApproximate  &quot;  .  &quot;Cost1,039,154   18,989,000  144,000    2,910,000 7,72056,430  196,0001,669,0001,247,304   23,764,0002,045,660   60,000,000  362,640    7,500,000111,640127,7002,800,0004,500,0003,447,640   74,300,000     Ships  included under the  heading &quot;Building&quot;  cover vessels  which8  either under construction or contracted for.    Steps, are  however,tng taken to cancel the  contracts  of ships which  are  either  not laidm or have  only a small  amount of  work done on  them.     An effort has been  made to dispose of a number of ships toltish shipowners in exchange for the vessels lost an* this has  beencomplished  to a small extent.    Shipowners naturally hang back  bothom purchase and building because of lack of confidence as to theture.   The aim of the Shipping Ministry has been to encourage  asi&quot; as could  be done without guarantees of an? kind, the placing  ofiers so as  to keep large numbers of men employed  during the  comingfra.   To enable otmere  generally  to replace their fleets, negotiations                                                               are/
are going on for the sale to shipowning interests of vessels builtor building to Government account, and if this is done promptlyit is hoped that there may be little loss to the Government.             also         It is/proposed to dispose of a limited amount of tonnage to Allies and neutrals to whom we  are under obligation.   Thegeneral commitments  so far entered into are as follows.:-         A definite agreement has been made with France underwhich a total of 500,000 gross tons of shipping may be obtained in this country during the next two years by purchasers approvedby the French Government.   Approximately one third will consistof standard ships, delivered as promptly as practicable and theremainder will take the form either of standard ships or ofbuilding facilities, divided equally over the two years.         No definite agreements have been made with the other allies, but It is very probable that we shall have to assist bothBelgium and Italy with tonnage.As regards neutrals, we have entered  into an agreement with Norway,in return for valuable financial assistance rendered during theWar, to facilitate the laying down of about 360,000 gross tonsin each of the three years after the cessation of hostilities.And in addition the Tonnage Agreement binds us to allow them toreplace 35 ships lost while under requisition to H.M.Government.         Some part of our obligations under these agreements, is covered by contracts already placed in British yards and we have indicated that we are prepared to consider offers from Norwegianowners to purchase standard steamers in liquidation of these rights..         No definite agreements have been made with other Neutrals,but it is only right that we should be prepared to extend some consideration to those neutral owners&apos;who have rendered usvaluable shipping services during the War.   It may also be pointedout that the sale of ships to Neutrals is extremely useful to uson financial grounds and the Treasury have indicated their strong                                                        support/
support of this policy.         So far as the Shipping Controller is aware, there is                              4nothing in the procedure outlined above which la in any wayInconsistent with the Policy of the Government,  the schema ofcontrol hitherto in force having been adopted solely as a war policy.   He thinks it right, however, before proceeding further on the lines indicated, to seek the covering authority of theWar Cabinet to the steps which he proposes to take with regardto the disposal of Government mips and the use  of our ship-building resources.th dieomber,  181$,
