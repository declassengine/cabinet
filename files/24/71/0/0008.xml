               17 iiliCABI N E T,iCLE^SE OF DOCTORS FROM THE AP1&apos;:Y FOR URGE NT CIVIL I-JEDS..             MEMOHAIOTi.: DY SIR       CORNWALL,       I foci it ny duty to ask tho immediate considerationof the War Cabinet to the serious state of things prevailing asregards the depletion of doctors in tho oivil community whilst the serious epidemic of influenza is still occasioning greathavoc in many parts of the country.       The civilian doctors in many places have broken downunder tho strain, and my Department reoelve daily appeals from many parte of the country* that particular doctors conversant                                    be with the needs of the district should/immediately released fromthe army, even If only on a few weeks&apos; leave, to help to cope with the situation.   The clatter has been thoroughly considered for mahlr weeks past by the Central Professional Committee, thefcinistr1^ of National Service, and thic Department, together withthe Army Iledical Service,   On November 11th a specific sohemewas agreed to, under which a certain stated number doctors,Belected specially for the partioular needs of the time, shouldbe promptly released by the War Office week by week upon a statedplan.   My Department has today been informed by the Ministry ofNational Service, after eighteen days have passed, that the WarOffice io not going to implement that arrangement..   It is under-stood that the Ministry of National Service is taking up thesubject with the War Offioe;  but the&apos;state, of things as regardsoivil needs in some parts .of the Country is so grave that I feeloompUlod to ask the War Cabinet immediately to call upon theWar Office to release the dootors in the manner arranged onNovember, 11th, without any din^inittion vrhether in speed or in numbers.
           I append a Qanplo letter (one out of a-largc- number -of    similar cases) to show the- real gravity of the Bituation,^*hloh*    tho Government  cannot possibly afford to negleot.   An    important point (it will bo soon) 1B indicated In the latter,    to which I an in any case bound to draw the attention of  the    War Gv.binjt, vis., that the number of doctors possessed by  the    Army  ?or attending to the n:ode of the troops is on a vastly    greater Bcal;^ of dootor to men than anything obtainable in  the                            are    civil population.   There/plates at this ntnent In England    whore the oivil population, suffering greatly under the stress    of influenza, has, through  the continued withdrawal of its    dootors to military service during the past four retro* had its    medical Bervioee bo depleted  as to have no wore than two  dootow    to aoveral thousando of the population?  whilst in soae of  the    camps in this country, whore  the soldiers are normally healthy    and,  being under discipline,  ban ouch more easily be attended    medically than oan the oivil  population, there are twice  and    three times  ao many dootors being retained as are available in    a civil community of like numbers, and the military doctors    thus  greatly underworked.           Whilst this state of things has been put up with    during the stress of aotive hOsti&apos; litles, it appears  that  it    cannot be  justified at all  events to  anything like  the came    extent, now  that the military pressure is 00 greatly relaxed    and  the civil needs so grievously enhanced by the prevailing    epidemic, as well as by  the usual extra heaviness of oivil    medical requirements in  the winter months.           I am  bound,, therefore, to request  the; War  Cabinet  to    require from the War Office the  inncdiatc release of the    requisite numbers of doctors, suitably chosen for the  particular    purpose,  to  meet  the insistent needs  of  the civil community5    these are  so grave that  a publie  ooandal may  at  any moment    occur of &amp;***at ^magnitude,  and  1 cannot be  answerable for  the    harm that  is being occasioned to  the  civil-^-spulation without     adequate  cause.,                         (Sgd.)

The N.H.I.Commissioners for England.

Gentlemen,

As one of the doctors at the Hyson Green Clinic here, I beg to represent as a matter of the gravest and most immediate urgency, the necessity for the demobilisation of men from the Army to help the local profession, otherwise a serious scandal is almost certain to arise. We at this Clinic are carrying over 40 and 50 patients, and even more, from one day&apos;s waiting list to the next. Cases are being left for days unvisited after the mesenges are just received, and other cases of pneumonia, etc. have to be left several days between visits and the unvisited cases may any of them be pneumonia, or even of mere urgent consequence, yet it is physically impossible to cover the ground. I am personally extremely near the limit of my physical endurance after working for a long period for from 14 to 16 hours (or more occasionally) Sundays and weekdays.

The men to help were appealed for a week or two ago when it was evident influenza would impose a breaking strain on our arrangements, and it is within our knowledge that some, if not all the six men asked for by the Local War (Medical) Committee of this district, are not anything like fully employed by the Army and could easily be spared while nothing has been done to deliver us from the perfectly intolerable strain. I suppose the War Office may some day take action when there is no longer any emergency, but meanwhile we are being grossly misused and our patients are literally dying neglected and insufficiently tended. Other less serious consequences I do not name or dwell upon, though they are many and serious.

I am writing this after 1 a.m. on the 26th. November, after a very long and exhausting day&apos;s work, and must ask for lenient judgment on the mannor of my letter, the matter of it being of such extreme urgency.
