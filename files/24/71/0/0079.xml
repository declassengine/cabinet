GKNERA1  CONS IPERATIONS AND RECO^IETTDATTOrTS.General             In writing this paper I am faced vrith theConsiders,   fundamental question as to whether armaments more or lesstionft.      on pre-war lines will continue or whether the future forces            of sea, land and air will have a semi-polioe semi-            commercial basis.                    It seems improbable that for some years there            will be a great war between first-clcss powers.   It seems            equally unlikely that there will be a satisfactory league            of nations ether than that which perhaps may be possible            between the British Empire,America and France.   In any            case there will be a period of deep-seated disturbance            throughout the world,   The Commonwealth, which has carried            the greater share of the responsibilities of civilisation            during the war, must oontinue to bear them into more stable            times.   we wish to turn our sword3 into ploughshares, but            it is in the best interests of the world that we should            do so - especially in regard, to Che Air Force - not so fast            ab merely to shatter a wonderful machine nor so slowly as            to allow other nations to usurp our place.                    The following paper has therefore been written            with a view to securing a really efficient Air Service,            and a sound basis for commercial expansion.                    Highly specialised air forces are now essential            components of all fighting efficiency, and aviation also            provides a distinct and separate striking force of            tremendous potentiality.   Before a formal declaration of            war  It  may be possible to deal a paralysing blow at some            vital nerve centrej  the Air Force must be the first line         -  of defence of the British Empire, and in the next war,           - however near or distant, the existence of tho nation will            depend largely upon air power,   In peace and in war the            nation which thinks in three dimensions will lead those            still thinking in two.                    The imperial aspects of the question cannot be &apos;            overrated and must be considered equally with those per-            talning to purely national requirements? the foundations            of the air power of the British Empire must be well and            truly laid.                    The mobility and Increasing range of aircraft will            alter the relative position of tho constituent portions of            the Empire in respect of possible attack; geographical            boundaries and. the barriers of the sea will no longer            constitute security,   Air warfare in the future may be            so rapidly commenced and decisive results so quickly ob-            tained that it is essential that the separate portions of            the Empire should be placed in a state of readiness to            protect themselves from attack, and to render immediate            mutual assistance.                    The advantages to be derived from the chain of            British possessions throughout tho world - refuelling            bases, repair bases, meteorological and wireless stations -            must be utilised to the full.   From the commorcial stand-            point these advantages are no less Important, and            preparations must be made for the day when &quot;all-red&quot; air            routes will play a highly important part in tho mainten-            ance of the commercial supremacy of the British Empire,taking part   I,                           x
in          2.        Taking the  above principles as a basis, it is            still a matter of great difficulty to forecast in detail            the air requirements involved, but in this memorandum it            is endeavoured to trace an outline upon which a broad            policy may be formulated.  Chief amongst various considers- I            tions which  render  a forecast difficult are:-               (a)  The strength of the Naval and Military forces                     of the principal powers, coupled with the                     probable  extent to which the strength of these         &apos;            forces may economically be modified by the                     substitution  of air power*               (b)  The Air Force  strengths, inoluding commercial                     air fleets, likely to be maintained by the                     various nations.               (c)  The assistance whioh the Dominions will give                     towards the establishment of an Imperial Air                     Force.               (d)  The si2e of tho Imperial commercial air fleet                     and the powers of  control over it to be exercised                     by the Government *               (e)  The future limitation  of frontiers and  if spheres                     of political  and military control.                (f)  The strategic  and  commercial air routes to  be                      established after  the war.Recommen- 3*        The  following recommendations are put  forward:-dations.    (a) The  Royal Air Force. This  should be  reconstituted            so as uo emeoay                (I)   A Home  Defence Force  on  a  cadre basis,               (ii)   A  striking force  &quot;Men should  be utilised when                      possible  for  Imperial  police  work, mail carrying                      and other public  duties.              (ill)   A specialised  force to cooperate with sea  forces.               (iv;   A specialised  force to cooperate with land  forces.                (v)   A cadre of kite balloon services.               (vi)   A cadre of airship services  (as  recommended in                      Appendix E),              (vii)   Units  to undertake such coastguard duties  as may                      be assigned.             (viii)   Units  to undertake such aerial services a3  may bt                      required by other government  departments,  c.g.,                      Surveying.               (ix)   Seotlons for anti-aircraft,  searchlight and                    v  sound-locating duties.            Note:   The Commercial aerial service should.be suggested            below, be so organised as to constitute a general reserve.            (b) The Air Forces of the Dominions.  The recommendations            under this heading will be found in Part II,Section (d)            of this paper.            (c) Commercial Aviation,  A period of intense international            competition is evident and no time should be lost in            securing to Great Britain the position of vantage which            she has won                 (I)  The future of commercial aviation must largely                      depend on the Royal Air Foroe for the provision                      of the necessary pilots and technioal workers.               (ii)  On the conclusion of peace all available aircraft                      material should be utilised to supply the                      Dominions and India on liberal terms with what is                      necessary to create their sections of the Imperial                      Air Force and on similar lines to meet the demands                      of civil and commercial enterprises throughout                      the Empire.(ill)
Part II.   (iii)  The embargo on the private development of           commercial aircraft undertakings  should now           he removed and facilities given to private           enterprise to obtain foreign contracts.    (iv)  The existing State propaganda organisation           should conduct a campaign with a  view to           gbtaining British supremacy in civil aerial           transport and supporting our aircraft industry.           In order to forestall capital being diverted           elsewhere the proposed State policy of           supporting commercial aviation should be  made           public at an early date.(d) General Developmont and Organisation. The following recommendations are maoTe on Uie general&quot;basis that thereshould be a form of State control of aviation,  and thatsuch control should be centred in the Air Minlstrys  whichshould be reorganised at an early date so that it mayefficiently carry out the additional functions which the care and control of commercial aviation will entail,    (i)   The Dominions should be approached with a  view           to assistance in reconstituting the air staff           into an Imperial Air Staff on the lines of the           Imperial General Staff;  civil and commercial           aviation should be represented upon this  staff.               The Air Ministry should:-   (11)   Provide and operate such necessary air mail           servioes in the United Kingdom, Dominions,           Colonies and foreign countries as may not           otherwise be operated to the satisfaction of           the Government.  (iii)   Own, control and maintain all aerodromes in           the United Kingdom and Crown Colonies required           for war purposes, Government training and           aerial routes, and undertake tho marking,           lighting and mapping of such air routes.   (iv)   Undertake all technical research requisite for           the development of aeronautics so far as  this           is not provided for by outside institutions.    (v)   Undertake the inauguration of a meteorological           service as far as possible on an Imperial basis.   (vi)   Initiate such steps as may be necessary to           secure rights in International air routes,           and to establish a definite intornational           law of the air.
STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS AND EMPIRE REQUIREMENTS              FOR AIR *ORg .POWER.  (a) strategic Considerations, defence and Offence,4.           ftiflng  o tfie&quot; comparatively shoH&quot;&quot;ra3Iu8  of  action of contemporary aircraft air strategy has not entered  very widely into our considerations during the present war,  though, by means of the Independent Force, we have  carried  out a modified form of strategic interception.  In  future  wars, when air fleets have an action-radius of several  thousands of miles, air strategy will rank as a more exact  science, the actual practice of which must depend on  communications.  Our most pressing needs are to obtain a  stepping stone for trans-atlantic traffic in the Azores,  and to establish a route across France and Italy so as to  maintain aerial touch with the Mediterranean and the .  territories East and South of that sea.             In air power we possess a rapid and economical  instrument by which to ensure peace and good government In  our outer Empire, and more particularly upon its Asian and  African frontiers.  Given the communications and certain  previously prepared bases,a striking force could be brought  to bear swiftly in Palestine, Mesopotamia. Persia,  Afghanistan, Egypt, the Sudan and further South.             Although aircraft at the present day are able to  reach the above localities, air routes must be established  before such long range action can be considered really  practicable.             (The main air routes which it  is considered  should be developed are given in Appendix &quot;D&quot;)5,           Future wars between civilised nations will be  struggles for life in which entire populations, together  with their industrial resources,  will be thrown into the  scale.  Evolution has brought about the creation of air  fleets to meet the demands of such warfare. These will  consist of home defence units and striking forces.  The  objectives of striking forces will be nerve centres, the  armies and navies  of the opponent, the population as a  whole, his national moral and the industries, without which  he cannot wage war.  In computing the strength necessary  for  our air fleets it must be remembered  that England is  more vulnerable to attack by air than her neighbours owing  to the geographical position of London and the fact that  our  population and our industries are crowded together in  comparatively small areas.  The immunity  of our industries  from aircraft attack is henceforward as vital to our  existence as the  security of our sea communications.             Our air fleets must therefore  consist of both  offensive and defensive craft, for, to guard  against  surprise attack,  it will be  essential to  include home  defence squadrons  in addition to  squadrons of day  and  night  bombing types which will form the offensive  or  striking force.6.           The above are the factors which must govern  the  strength of air fleets.  On the basis  that 15 squadrons  have been  found to be necessary for Home  Defence,  and in  view of the increasing range of aircraft  which  will  shortly  make the West  of  England and Ireland open to  attack, it is  considered that 20 squadrons on a cadre basis will be  required to defend the coast and  industrial  centres  of the  British Isles.  As regards  offence it  is  suggested that thestrikingPART  II,
   striking  force, which can be utilised  in  peace  on   government  civil  duties,  should  consist of  about 0   squadrons  of  day  bombers,  9 squadrons  of  night  bombers   and  Z  squadrons of flying boats.   (b)  Strength  of Air Force required  to  cooperate with       Sea  Forces, 7.       &quot;    On &quot;approaching the  subject  of  the  immediate   post-war  Air  Force requirements  of  the Navy we  are  faced   with two  questions :-,       (a)   To what  extent  substitution of aircraft for             surface craft  is now desirable  and  possible?       (b)   &apos;/hat the post-war strength of the  Navy is  to be?, 0*            In the near future  much  of  the work  now  done   by surface  vessels will  be performed by the Air Force,e,g*,   patrol duties,  the protection  of mine  sweepers  by torpedo   carrying  and  fighting aeroplanes, etc              It is  within vision that certain types of   aircraft  will be  able to carry out  cruises  of long  duration   and  perform the functions of surface craft  with greater   speed  and radius  of action, The  future will also see  a   surface ship  possessing  the speed of a modern battle  cruiser   carrying  40 to 50 torpedo planes and bombers, the radius of   action of which would be at least 150 miles,thus securing  a   great  advantage over vessel,? of  present day armament. Ships   of this description will afford  the means of  concentrating   air  force at  points beyond the direct  working range of  large   day  bombers. 9*           The types of  aircraft suitable for replacing  some   of the auxiliary  surface craft at present in  use are  now   emerging  from the experimental stage.  Such types of aircraft   are: -       (i)  Large flying boats which have reached  a stage  of             development warranting their adoption as  substitutes             for a certain percentage  of auxiliary surface  craft.      (ii)  Large Day Bombing aeroplanes, the development  of             which warrants their consideration  for substitution             purposes in the near future *     (iii)  Torpedo  Planes, the utility of which it is anticipated            -will shortly be solved.              The successful employment of the  above  types  should   ensure a  great increase in the efficiency of  auxiliary  Naval   operations with a corresponding  decrease  in expenditure,10.           On the basis of past  experience, and  in  the absence   of data as to the post war strength of the Navy, the   following suggestions are put  forward for cooperation:-           Grand Fleet and Home Waters.     (a)   4  squadrons          Ships Fighters and  Fighter                                 Reconnaissance.          4  squadrons in cadre.Day  Bombers.     (b)   4  squadrons.        Torpedo Planes ccc  Ships  Bombers.     &apos;c)   5  squadrons in cadre,Large Flying  Boats.      d)   6  squadrons in cadre.Large Day Bombers.     (e)   Kite Balloons. See Appendix  &quot;3&quot; Fara.8.11.           For the effective maintenance  and utilisation of  -   these  squadrons,  provision must  bo  made  for the establishment   of certain permanent bases which can be  used as storage and   repair depots and training centres.              During peace time  it  may be expected that the   practice  of carrying aircraft  in H.P.Ships will be widely   extended. Such ships will no  longer be concentrated as  at   present;  but  will visit a number of ports in the United   Kingdom and abroad.  They will probably  desire  to  carry   their aircraft frequently so  that these may participate in
   in the ships gunnery and other exercises  and this must   be provided for as far as possible.              It is suggested therefore that for these   purposes  ports which ships are likely to  visit should   be divided into two categoriesv              In the first will probably come the principal   naval port3 and anchorages where  there will be storage   and repair depots with a testing  ground and. facilities   for embarking and disembarking aircraft,  There will  also   be a conveniently situated aerodrome with aircraft for   practice  purposes and personnel for maintenance,.              In the second category may be  placed ports of   less importance which ships of the fleet  visit periodically.   In such places it should be sufficient to provide small   landing grounds (if none such are existing in the   neighbourhood) with a care and maintenance party. It is   considered that the work in these ports could be largely   carried out by aircraft carriers,  which could supply the   ships with aircraft and personnel necessary to enable   exercises to be carried out)              In addition, in order  to provide for manoeuvres   and exercises on a large scalo which necessitate the use  of   ports where there are no aircraft facilities, two or  more   mobile depots, which will be kept in readiness for   establishment at short notice, will be required.              Similar arrangements could be  made in regard to   balloons  operating with the fleet. At first class ports   there would be a station capable  of maintaining 6 working   balloons; at second class ports one capable of maintaining   3 working balloons, while there could be  one mobile  unit   in readiness for establishing a balloon station as required   for special exercises or manoeuvres.              In the event of the Admiralty agreeing these   suggestions in principle,details  can be worked out in   cooperation with them.  .Morth Atlantic. Bases will be required for (a),(b),(c)   arid (d) In the Azores, where an island or islands  is   an urgent necessity, in Newfoundland or Nova Scotia, and   In the Gulf of St Lawrence.  These bases  must ccmprise-   a harbour for large flying boats,  an aerodrome for large   day bombing aeroplanes and facilities for the maintenance   of these and of ships aeroplanes  operating in mid-Atlantic.              The subject of the Canadian bases is discussed   in Part II (d) of this memorandum.              The Iceland and Greenland route has not been   considered owing to the severe weather conditions  and fogs,   which would probably make it impracticable for the greater   part of the year.              It will also be necessary to consider aircraft   bases for naval and commercial purposes at Bermuda and the   West Indies *13s?^ed.it:er^ranean, Naval predominance in these waters will be   aa^e^soiiLlal as hitherto and probably more difficult to   maintain owing to  the development of submarine craft. The   following air strength  is suggested:-         * c.^co9 ?rayi?n with the Naval. Squadron     1 squadron.  *Ships&quot;&quot;FIgliter&quot;ftec^onnaii&quot;sa:Ioe&apos; and Ships Fighters.     2 squadrons. Torpedo Planes and Ships Bombers,     1 squadron.  Large Plying Boats. &apos;  Bases,., A base at Malta comprising small aircraft repair   baseT boat harbour and aerodrome.  Subsidiary bases  at -   Gibraltar, Suda Bay, Mudros, Cyprus, Port Said, Alexandria   and Sollum.,
14+The Pacifio.   It is not  improbable  that  after th*  storm   in Europe the centre of  pressure of unrest  will  move   Eastwards and that the future will  find  It  located In   China and Japan,  There  would appear,  therefore,  to be   grounds for an increase  of our Naval strength in the   Pacific and pari passu for the building  up  of a  suitable   air force,              These considerations have already been weighed   In Australia and New Zealand, and both dominions have   intimated their desire for air services.  Suggestions for   the strength and composition of these services will be   found in Part II of this paper.              Assuming that these proposals are adopted, the   strength of the Royal Air Force in the Pacific would be:-      1 squadron.  Ships Fighters and Fighter Reconnaissance.      2 squadrons. Torpedo Planes and Ships Bombers,      2 squadrons.. Large Flying Boats,              In addition to the above it is considered that   Hong Kong, Singapore and North Borneo should each be   provided with their quota of aircraft protection;  owing to   the strategic Importance of these places and on  account of   their isolated position.  It should be noted that North   Borneo is also one of the most important sources of oil   supply.  It is suggested therefore that  the allocation of   squadrons should be:-   BaseSfHong Kong,           1 squadron Large Day  Bombers.         Singapore,           1     l!       &quot;    &quot;      &quot;         North Borneo Area.   1     &quot;     Day Bombers,.              The following squadrons are also allocated for   general duties in connection with Eastern Imperial bases:-         1 squadron.   Day Bombers,         2 squadrons.  Large Day Bombers.   (o) Specialised Air Force to cooperate with land forces,15tBrltTah Tsle*s&quot;7^x&quot;perience shews that i,n the post-war   organTsa^uxon^the propr *tion of offensive squadrons should   be high-!  Defence against  aircraft by night will continue   to develop and improve so that night bombing squadrons must   be composed of fast, machines with  a high ceiling.              With this in view, and on the assumption that   there will be a peace strength of 6 regular and 20 other   divisions in the British Isles, the proposed strength of   squadrons in cadre is :-      21 squadrons.     Day and Night Fighters.       8  -   &quot;          Low Fighters.       4     11          Fighter Reconnaissance.       8     &quot;          Corps and Fighter Reconnaissance.       8     &quot;          Day Bombers.       8     &quot;          Night Bombers,   Note,: In addition, the development of tank warfare may   make  it advisable to have a proportion of squadrons   available for cooperation with tanks.16.5gypt, the Sudan, Palestine .and Mesopotamia.  This group   of countries&quot;Ts one of very great political, strategic and   commercial importance to the Empire,  It includes many   strategic points d&apos;appui and contains great reservoirs of   oil fuel, upon which commodity both our air power and sea   power will depend.              The Air Force requirements In this group will   be dependent upon many factors - the  strength of the land   forces we shall have to maintain there; the political  state   of Russia; the  attitude of Persia; the  internal conditions   of Mesopotamia  and generally whether Germany will  be in  a   position  to pursue her well  known designs In the East.              The group also  offers considerable scope  for  Air   Force police  work.  Owing  to its vast extent, its  climate,its
   movements of land forces are much hampered.  On the other   hand good landing grounds are frequent and it IT HI be   practicable rapidly to reinforce the air strength in any   of the groups from the others *             The suggested Air Force strength is       Egypt.;        I squadron  Fighters .        1&apos;   &quot;      Composite Corps c. Fighter Reconnaissance,        1    &quot;      Day bombers.        1    &quot;      Large Lay Bombers,       Mesopotamia,        1 squadron  Fighters.        1    &quot;      Composite Corps &amp; Fighter Reconnaissance.        1    &quot;      Day Bombers-        1    &quot;      Large Lay Bombers.17,India.    Considerations governing; ,nir Force requirements   In India are:-        (i)  A possible attack by a foreign power.       (ii)  A rising of frontier tribes.      (iii)  Internal trouble.             The pre-war garrison of India was 8 cavalry   brigades, 9 infantry divisions supported by divisional   artillery plus 3 heavy batteries, 3 siege batteries and   some mountain artillery.  On this basis Air Force   requirements would be:-        4 squadrons  Fighters and Fighter Reconnaissance.        4    &quot;       Corps Reconnaissance for cooperation                      with infantry,cavalry and artillery,        2    &quot;       Day Bombers.        2    &quot;       Large Day Bombers.   A decision is urgent as to whether the supply of aircraft   to Indian subjects should be permitted.*8*i&apos;:r-5*&apos; \Lripj1 * Uganda and ijyasaland,  Aircraft should prove   invaluable In the administration/ development and general   police work in these countries.  A weight carrying machine   with long, radius of action would probably be the most   suitable type, and landing grounds must be organised to   facilitate its employment,  Tho initial Air Force strength   in these countries would therefore be:-        1 squadron   Large Day Bombers,19,T&apos;est Africa,  The British possessions in -Vest Africa are   spread over a wiclo area and aircraft should prove of the   greatest service in dealing with native risings and   carrying out general police work.   It is suggested that   the force available should be stationed normally in   Northern Nigeria,  Present requirements would appear to   be met by:-        1 squadron   Large Day Bombers,   (d) Dominion Organisation.20.          7s TtlreaHy &quot;indicated, the Possibilities of air   warfare, render it vitally important that the several portions   of the British Empire should bo In a state of readiness,   not only to protect themselves from sudden aerial attack,   but also to render immediate mutual assistance.  For this   purpose air fleets will require to be maintained by the   Dominions in a state of constant efficiency, and provision   made for the rapid expansion and mobilisation of their   aerial resources.             Too much stress cannot be laid on the importance   of unity and the necessity for organising these aerial   resources on similar lines,  During the war the Dominions   have generously responded to the call of the Mother Country   and their forces have worked in the closest cooperation                                                     with   lack of communications f.nd its numerous rivers the
9-   279   with those  from the  British  Isles.  A bond  of union   has  been established which both  sides must  make  every   effort  to strengthen until a state  of perfect and   efficient cooperation exists between the  various   components  of  the  British Empire.            The first essential is  that methods of  training   and  organisation;  and types  of machines and equipment.   should  be standardised.  Each Dominion would require a   Central School at  which flying,  navigation, aerial   gunnery and bomb dropping, cooperation with land and   sea  forces, meteorology and  photography would be taught   on similar  lines.   As types  of machines improve,   replacements should be made  on a proportionate scale,   and  interchange of personnel should take  place so that   training and operational methods,  Improvements due to   innovations, etc,  may be co-ordinated throughout the   whole of the Imperial Air Force.   Thus, if  necessity   arises, reinforcements can be transferred from one   quarter of  the globe to another,and on  arrival at their   destination will fit automatically into their appointed   places  and  carry out their appointed duties.  This   work of co-ordination and standardisation can best bo   done by an  Imperial Air Staff, upon tfiich should be   representatives of all the Dominions, preserving the   closest possible liaison with the Air Staff in each   particular  Dominion, through whom alone component  states   or provinces should deal.            By such means only  can  the unity which  Is so   vital be secured.            The following suggestions, based on the above   general line of policy, are  made as to the organisation   of the  respective  Dominion  services:-21.Canada.  The main problems to be faced by Canada in   establishing her air service are involved in the extent   and varied nature  of the territory to be  served. The   distances to be travelled are very great  and there  is,   therefore,  an excellent opening  for commercial aviation   both for rapid passenger and mail services and for the   transport of goods. For this purpose the  large day bombing   type of machine should be particularly  suitable.            As it seems improbable  that Canada will maintain   a large land force in peace  time, it  should be possible   profitably  to employ a proportion of her  service squadrons   for government purposes, such as police work,  aerial  mail   work and surveys,-            Taking into consideration the  geographical   features and the main centres of population in the Dominion,   it is considered that aerodromes and  seaplane  bases  should be   established throughout the   southern limits of Canada and   should, with one exception,  not  be situated more than 400   miles north of the Canada -  United States boundary.  A   list cf stations with the purposes for which they should   be employed is shewn in Appendix &quot;F&quot;.22.         It is considered that  the squadrons  on a cadre   basis should bet-        2 squadrons   Fighter &amp; Corps Reconnaissance.        2 squadrons   Fighters.        2 squadrons large Day Bombers.-            For coastal patrol work, flying over the   inland lakes and cooperation with the  Naval forces,  the   following  squadrons in cadre seem advisable:-        2 squadrons   ShipB Fighter Reconnaissance  and                       Ships Fighters.        2 squadrons   Large Flying Boats.        2 squadrons   Large Day Bombers,   Lighter-than-Air Service. A small experimental  station   rs*sugges&apos;red&quot;w ich&quot;miglit also be used to maintain the   cadre of an airship unit.
23.         It is also essential that the Dominion   should possess an up-to-date and well equipped aircraft   depot to receive and 44-rect machines, carry out   rebuilds and repairs, and hold stocks of spares for   redistribution to the aircraft parks. This depot   should also be capable of handling seaplanes and   lighter-then-air craft and the most convenient   situation would appear to be at Ottawa or Quebec,            As already indicated, the maintenance of   reliable and up-to-date meteorological and wireless   stations Is most important.  The Canadian Air Service   3hould pay special attention to both these questions   in view of the long distance flights which have to be   made.  Meteorological stations should be established   throughout the Dominion.24.Australia.            While it Is not desired in any way to   accentuate Eastern political complexities, the pressure   of unrest in this sphere must be faced.  In the past   the fears of Australia resulted in the formation of   the nucleus of the Australian Navft and Australia has   already inaugurated her own Air Service which her   distance from the Mother Country renders all important,25*Aircraft Depots and Parks. It is presumed that for a   time &quot;aT&quot;Teast&quot;Tne majority of machines will be supplied   by England, hence it will be essential that Australia   should possess an up-to-date and well equipped aircraft   depot to receive and erect machines, etc. This depot   should be also capable of handling seaplanes and lighter   than air craft, and it is suggested the most convenient   situation would be at Sydney. It will also supply the   Aircraft Parks, a li3t of which is shewn in Appendix &quot;P&quot;,            The remarks already made under the heading of   Canada as to the importance of meteorological and   wireless stations apply with equal force to the   Commonwealth of Australia. It is suggested that wireless   stations may be conveniently    placed at Palmerstonl,   and Cape York.26,         The general organisation of the Australian   Air Force should be the maintenance on a cadre basis of:-       (a)  A proportion of long distance bombing and             reconnaissance squadrons with squadrons of             fighting and bombing aeroplanes and corps             reconnaissance squadrons, all capable of rapid             expansion into fully mobilised service units,             In times of peace these squadrons should form             the training units for the pilots and personnel             of the whole force and for the commercial air             fleet.       (b)  A civil transport service for mail and passenger             work, the transport of goods and police and             survey duties. This service would form the             general reserve of pilots and personnel, all             such as are willing to serve when called upon             being earmarked for that purpose and required             to go through a periodical refresher course with             a service squadron.  The machines employed             should be specially constructed so thst they             could rapidly be transformed into service             machines in case of need. It is to fee observed             that, owing to the great distances in Australia             and the comparative lack of railways, the most valuable
   valuable and economical machines will be the large day   bombing type and these, should be concentrated upon.27,            Attention must be paid to the establishment   and maintenance of air routes.- It is proposed to establish   an air route to Australia via India, the Kalay Peninsula   and the bunda Islands, and this will necessitate a landing   ground in the vicinity of 7/yndham. Prom there an air route   should be establidhed to&apos;Normanton and thence following the   line of railway through Queensland and New South Wales to   Melbourne,  From Melbourne a service should be established   through South and west Australia to Perth, from which place   the route could travel northwards to the neighbourhood of   the De Grey river and thence on a north-easterly course   through the Kimbcrley District to 7/yndham.               Suggested localities for the principal aerodromes   and seaplane stations are shewn in Appendix &quot;F&quot;. Minor   aerodromes and landing grounds on the main routes will also   have to be established.28,            It is suggested that the squadrons of service   types which should be maintained on a cadre basis are as   follows  :-        2 squadronB   Fighter &amp; Corps&quot; Reconnaissance.        2    &quot;        Fighters.        2    &quot;        Large Day Bombing.               Equipment to carry out night work with 2 Fighter   squadrons would be required,e.g., anti-aircraft guns,   searchlights, sound locators and the necessary personnel.               For coastal  patrol work and cooperation with the   Navy, the following squadrons,also on a cadre basis,should   be maintained:-        1 squadron Ships Fighter Reconnaissance &amp; Ships Fighters.        1 squadron Torpedo  Planes  and Ships  Bombers,        1 squadron Large Flying Boats.        1 squadron Large Day  Bombers.   Lighter-than-Air.  It  is considered also  that 3 units  of   2 3,S.airships and 6  kite  balloons  should be maintained.   These could probably  be  supplied at once, but steps must   be taken to provide good shed accommodation for their   reception,29.New  Zealand,               The possibility  of  unrest  in  the East affects .  New  Zealand equally with Australia, The length  of her  coast   line makes her peculiarly  vulnerable to attack  and her   distance from the Mother Country makes  it necessary  for   her  to be able tc hold her own  until the  arrival  of  available   reinforcements.               During peace time aerial communications  should   be established  and maintained with Australia,  and the  two   air  services should work in clo^e  touch.  In the  beginning   this will probably be carried out  by means  of  flying boats,30,            The following  squadrons  (in cadre)  are  suggested:-        1  squadron  Corps  and Fighter Reconnaissance.        1      &quot;     Large  Day Bombers,        1      11     Night  Bombers.   while  for coastal patrol and Naval cooperation there should   be  : -        1  squadron  Torpedo Planes and Ships Bombers.        1      &quot;     Large  Flying Boats,        1      &quot;     Large  Day Bombers. 31,             A  list  of aerodromes suggested as suitable for    service, commercial  and postal  purposes is  shewn inAppendix
   Appendix &quot;P&quot; and it would seem that Christchurch is   indicated as suitable for the main aircraft depot -   which, as in the case of the other Dominions, should be   capable of dealing with every type of craft.               Attention may once more be drawn to the   importance of efficient meteorological and wireless   stations. The latter will be of the greatest importance   for keeping in touch with Australia and should be specially   planned with thi3 end in vie^..32*South Africa.          South Africa.               As regards &quot;South Africa,the main factors of   distance and scattered population and the consequent openings   for rapid mail end transport service and for commercial   aviation are again present,  but the native races present a   special problem.               It is Improbable that South Africa will be the   scene of war between European nations, but the possibility   of a native outbreak must be considered, and for that reason   South Africa should maintain her quota of cadre service   squadrons. The moral effect of aircraft on a native population   and the great economy as compared with infantry need not   be elaborated.               A geographical factor which has a special bearing   on the South African problem is the existence of many large   commercial ports southwards from Mombasa to the Cape, and   northwards from the Cape to tho Congo, vrhich it is considered   could be advantageously kept in close touch with each other   by means of large flying boats.33.            On the above lines the squadrons in cadre should   be:-         2 squadrons  Fighters.         1 squadron   Fighter &amp; Corps Reconnaissance.         1    &quot;       Day Bombers.         1    &quot;       Kight Bombers.               For coastal patrol and for cooperation with   naval forces the squadrons,  also in cadre,  suggested are:-         1 squadron   Ships Fighters &amp; Fighter Reconnaissance.         2 squadrons  Large Flying Boats.         1 squadron   Large Day Bombers,34.            7ith regard to commercial aviation, it is to be   noted that Cape Town will form the terminus of the service   to the Cape via ISgypt and that a considerable portion of   this journey will be flown over territory under the control   of the Union,  and the maintenance,  mapping and lighting   of this part of the route should receive special attention,   while the importance of meteorological and wireless stations   cannot be sufficiently emphasized.               In South Africa also an up-to-date and well   equipped aircraft depot,  capable of dealing with all kinds   of aircraft, should be established at an early date,and   everything seems to point to this being situated near Cape   Town.               A list of the suggested aerodromes and seaplane   bases for service and commercial purposes is contained in   Appendix &quot;P&quot;,   (e) Control and Development of Commercial Aerial Transport.35..            Th&quot;e development of civil and commercial aviation   in the near future will be chiefly In connection with postal   and passenger services. It may be thought that the Government,   through the Air Ministry, should own and operate the postal   services, but in order to encourage the aircraft Industryand
and to stimulate competition,  it would seem that suchservioes may bo left open to the aircraft industry underthe guidance and control of the Air Ministry on thefollowing lines--          Tenders should be invited by the Post Office-or by the Air Ministry on its behalf- for individual mailservices, the terms of invitation making it clear whathelp or subsidy the State would provide towards carryingout the contract.  The tenders submitted should then be closely investigated by the Air Ministry and, if foundsatisfactory, accepted.  In cases where the postalauthorities consider a service essential, and no satisfactoryprivate contract can bs concluded, the Air Ministry might provide a Government service.  Air work in connectionwith customs, survey,   excise and police duties, shouldbe carried out by the Royal Air Force.  From a purelycommercial standpoint, a measure of standardisation Inmachines and engines will not only lead to economy, but will facilitate the training and certificating of standard commercial pilots, while, from the broader point ofview of Imperial Defence, such standardisation isessential.          State assistance and some form of State control are, for the following reasons, essential for the maintenanceof the commercial aviation industry:-     (I)  The industry which has been built up during           the war will probably wither away if it is           not  supported by the State,    (ii)  Co-ordination of development coupled with a           certain standardisation of material and           equipment are necessary in order that types           shall be suitable for Air Force use, and to           secure economy of production and standardisation           amongst commercial pilots,    (iii)  It is essential that meteorological  information           shall be co-ordinated and organised under           State control.; such information Is  of vital           Importance  to the success of all aviation,    (iv)  Air routes and prohibited zones will be a matter           of international arrangement for which the           State must  be responsible; to ensure that           treaties and regulations in regard  to  these           routes are  observed and their marking,lighting           and  mapping properly carried  out; the State           must have  sole control.     (v)  Uniformity  of legislation, which can best be           secured through unity  of control, is necessary           for  the Air Force and  commercial air fleet           throughout  the Empire,    (vl)  Aerodromes  required for war purposes, Government           training and aerial routes in the United Kingdom           and  Crown Colonies  should be  owned  by the  State,           This would  be an excellent method of indirect           subsidisation of the aircraft  Industry  as  it           would relieve it  of the burden  of establishment           and  upkeep  of terminal  facilities.  Terminal duos           should be made as reasonable  as possible and           there Is an analogy  in the State  ownership of           harbours and  docks,  Such a form of  subsidisation           will help  the small  owner  of  aircraft  as well           as the manufacturer  owner,    (vii)  Research and development are  of  the  utmost  value           and  equally important  to  the  future of  the Royal           Air  Force  and of  commercial  aviation..  It  is           essential  that  such  research  and  development            shall be guided  and  supported by  the State In           order that  production  shall have  a  military,           as well as  commercial,  value,
39*          To meet the above It  is suggested that State   aid shall take the form of :-      (I)   Assistance to private  enterprise,  both             directly and indirectly*     (ii)   Inauguration and State ownership of certain             aerial transport undertakings of public             utility.    (iii)   State meteorological service for the benefit             of Imperial aviation generally,     (iv)   Bureau for the collection&quot;and dissemination             of aero-technical and commercial information,      (v)   World wide State propaganda in support of             the British aircraft  Industry.     (vi)   Supply, after the war, of surplus machines to             British enterprises throughout the &quot;empire on             liberal terms,3S,Reserves, The question of service reserve? is entirely   cTepe&quot;ncTent upon some such system of co-ordination and   State control as is suggested above. Air warfare demands   that units shall always be maintained on a basi3 of   instant readiness for operations- Once engaged the   wastage in flying personnel and machines is very rapid   and to meet the immediate wastage of the former, personnel   will be drawn from the reserve maintained in peace time   by a system of training which will provide for all pilots   passing through a complete service training course and   afterwards undergoing short refresher courses during   a term of years,             To meet the general reserve all necessary   types of personnel in the commercial aerial transport   service would be earmarked,  arid records of their training   and qualifications carefully preserved,             To meet the wastage in machines a pcrc entage   of up-to-date engines and machines would be held In Royal   Air Force aircraft depots. Commercial aircraft of suitable   types would also be classified and earmarked, all such   types being fitted for the installation of the necessary   armament which would be maintained in readiness.Part IIIt                                                   14.
                    PART   III.                      285                      TRAILING,39,        The training of aviation personnel will be   divided into two heads:-             (a) For Regular personnel.             (b) For Reserve personnel.           Training in ground and flying duties for (a)   will be carried out during a long period in a few special   flying schools,           Training -for (b) will be carried out during a   much shorter period at training wings, at which both   ground and flying training will be given, A training   wing will consist of 3 squadrons, each containing the   cadre of a service squadron,40,        On completion of the above the regular personnel   will be given courses in one or more  of the following   classes of special work:-      (1) Duties peculiar to cooperation with the Royal Navy,     (ii) Duties peculiar to cooperation with the Army,    (iii) Duties common to both naval and military aerial           operations.41,        Of the reserve personnel, certain numbers will be   selected on  the completion of their course at a training   wing to undergo the special training  mentioned in the last   paragraph, ... list of tho schools recommended and their   functions will be found included in Appendix &quot;C&quot;. Details   as to the length of training in any school or training   wing are under consideration,42,Civil and Commercial Pilots.           TTTs&quot; proposed tnaJ the course at a training wing   shall include a training which will enable a suitable   individual to qualify as a competent  civil or commercial   pilot. This arrangement for the uniform training of service   and commercial pilots has the great advantage of ensuring   standardisation,with consequent higher efficiency and   economy. The recording of&quot; available personnel and the   issue of licences will  also be facilitated.43,Training of technical officers?            &quot;The majority of&quot;these Officers will be drawn   from aviation personnel who prove themselves most   suited to this form of employment.  Such Officers will   have had an initial technical training and. their further   training will be carried out by  :-         (a)  Apprenticeship to R.A.F, technical depots               and aircraft factories.         (b)  Courses in R.A.F, instructional shops,         (c)  Courses in technical colleges.           The length of time necessary for such courses can   be  settled later,44 * Training of Air Staff and Administrative Officers,           These, again, will largely be drawn from aviation   personnel who, from one cause  or another, are unsuited to   normal duty in the air.

APPENDrx  &quot;E&quot; .LIGHTER THAN AIR SERVICES.     Before discussing the future requirements of the lighter-than- services it is necessary briefly to state their present complexity to reconsider the arrangements made between the Air Ministry and Admiralty at tho time of the formation of the Royal Air Force on let April, 1918, in regard to the relation of the lighter-than-airvice to the general P. f A,? organisation on the cne hand and thedralty on the other.  Experience has rendered apparent many anomaliesthe present system pf control.     The Air Fcrce Act provided for the taking over of aircraft ef descriptions, and the recommendations made by General smuts  Committee,the formation of the Royal Air Force, included the airship servicean integral part cf the air forces as a whole.   The Admiralty agreed principle of the assumption by the Air Ministry of responsibility cf aircraft, but asked that the transference of the airship serviceuld be deferred for a time in order that the Admiralty might bring toiitien their efforts towards its development, and with this Lordhermere concurred.     The present system is uneconomical and involves a number ofparate authorities in the Admiralty and Air Ministry being concerned the administration, maintenance and operation of the service.   Thus, Air Ministry is responsible for the provision and training ofsonnel, its discipline, the supply of the motor transport, and a por-m of the stores.   They exercise nominal control over accommodation have no right to decide as to the number of men required at a giventian.   They do not construct the necessary quarters, though the costthese is charged against Air Ministry funds.   They are not empoweredissue establishments to airship units or exercise any financial con-1)1 and the airship personnel is therefore at a disadvantage as regardsstions of R.A.F. promotions, etc     The placing of administration of the airship service under thekrol and responsibility flf the Air Ministry on similar lines to the[vier-than-air units operating with the navy Is very important. AIRSHIPS.     TKe&quot;&quot;advantages of this type  flf  aircraft are briefly:-.(1) Variable speed and ability to hover. (id  Good  facilities for  observation and  communication,  ,III I j Long  air endurance.I(iv) Ceiling  comparable with  the  heavier  types  of  aeroplanes  and     seaplanes.  (v) Ease  of  handling  in  fog  and  darkness.. (vi)  Possession  of  considerable  lift for  commercial work.                                            i     Against  these  however must  be  set:-  (i) Lack of  air worthiness. (ii)  Handling and housing difficulties. [Hi)  Vulnerability even with the  employment of non-inflammable gas. (iv)  Extravagance in personnel. i     The increasing range and reli oility of aeroplanes and seaplanes II tend to lessen still more the  ad\antages above enumerated.  The ex- lence  gained in this war with both lighter and heavier than air types (the present state of their respective development afford good grounds tutill greater concentration on the latter and a gradual diminution If fort on the former.                                       4,owing  .lfi 1    The commercial utility of airships is also open to considerable  k and in consequence the reserve upon which the Royal Air Fvrce  Ihlp service must depend.  I  r                                                          6,
  6,      The above considerations lead naturally to the suggestion that  the  airship service should be reduced to a minimum nf, say, a total4f 4 squadrons  of 2 ships each and of a personnel comparable to that of  &apos; aeroplane squadrons.  7.      As  regards the types of airships which should be adopted, there  is a strong weight of evidence against the continuance nf the rigid type.  The  work performed by the existing rigid ships is at present negligible  and  does not justify the absorption of personnel and expenditure on con-  struct ional and housing facilities involved.   Although experimental work  should  not  be wholly stopped upon this typo, the provision and mainten-  anse of any unit of rigid ships is not recommended.     KITE BALLOONS.          Throughout the war kite balloons have been of utility both for  naval and military operations and a  nucleus formation and facilities  fer  experimental&apos;work should, it is thought, be maintained after the war.
