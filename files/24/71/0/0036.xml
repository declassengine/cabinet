BOARD OF AGRICUL7URE AND FISHERIES,                  \%)   To avoid May, ofdms all commutations to food  PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,   ,    THE DIRECTOR GENBEAL.                                           72, VICTORIA STREET,Rtfirtnct Jfo.LONDON, S.W. (1).4th December, 1918Sir,           I beg to  submit  the  following Report on the work of theFood Production Department  for  the week ended 3rd December, 1918:-                   Thei Weather and Condition of Crops,          Mild, foggy weather was experienced throughout thecountry during the past  week, but the rain which fell was not sufficient in most districts to impede farming operations to any great extent.   Good progress was made in most counties  inploughing and seeding as well as in harvesting potatoes  androots in districts where the lifting of these crops  has  notyet been completed,                   LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.  -             Work  of Agricultural Executive Committees,          The following  are interesting examples of  the  work  ofAgricultural Executive  CommitteesCambridgeshire^-   In October 1917 the Committee took possession  andarranged for the  cultivation of a 252 acre farm consisting  whollyof  grass land  of  inferior quality at Waterbeach,   A very satisfactory report.of  the cultivation of the farm has now  beenreceived,    GoM  crops  have been produced on the greater part  ofthe holding, and  on  the  portion which was not planted a  very goodcrop  of hay has been taken.   The financial result of the workingof  the farm is  also  very satisfactory, a profit of  1,438 being shown,
Lancashire  -  The Committee have been authorised to take possessioof a 56 aore farm at TJpholland which has been very much neglectedby the owner occupier.  Reports received by the Department from theCommittee make it evident that the land would never, under itspresent management, contribute adequately to the food supply.  It 1stated to be a useful and compact holding and capable of highfarming, and it  is hoped, therefore, that under the occupation ofthe Committee its productiveness will be much increased,Yorkshire (West  Riding) -In January 1918, the Committee were authorised  to take possession of two farms near Thome which were relatively  unproductive owing chiefly to the neglect of drains anddykes.   The farms were placed under the management of four farmemembers of  the local advisory committee, and it is reported that,by means of drainage operations, the cultivable area of the farmbeen considerably increased.  One field only has not been under cultivation this year, and the farm as a whole has greatly increain value.Prosecutions.  A farmer at Drayton Lodge in Leicestershire has befined  10 and  5 costs for failure to comply with a cultivation cserved by the Committee and, for a similar offence, a farmer atWorlingworth in  East Suffolk has been fined  10 and  2 costs.                       LAND DRAINAGE.                Formation of drainage areas.          The work of fixing boundaries for new drainage areas hbeen commenced this week.  The Director-General of Ordnance Survtarranged to place 12 revisers at the disposal of the Departmentthis purpose.  These offioers will act under the direction of thdrainage Inspectors of the Department in plotting upon the maps,boundaries of the areas&apos; which it Is proposed to Include within t&apos;jurisdiction of the new authorities.  The draft maps for depositdraft orders in accordance with the provisions of tlx Land Drainage                               - 2 -
will be prepared from the data thus obtained.          Six of the revisers will be employed under the ChiefDrainage Inspector on the Yorkshire schemes which will be started in the order named below;  and the other six on the remainingschemes under the second Drainage Inspector.          The applications for the constitution of drainageauthorities which are being dealt with first, are as follows:.-               The valley of the Derwent in the North and East                   Ridings.               The Ouse Aire area in the West Riding.               The Crabley area (immediately West of Hull) In the                   East Riding.               The Rivers Poss and Kyle, the Rivers Swale and Wiake                   in the North Riding.               The Rivers Wey and Mole in Surrey               The Rivers Loddon, Blackwater and Whitewater in                   Surrey, Berkshire and Hampshire,               The River Clwyd and Rhuddlan Marsh in Flintshire and                   Denbighshire.          Schemes for the extension of the Strine Water Board&apos;sjurisdiction so as to include the greater part of the valley ofthe Tern in Shropshire, and for the establishment of a DrainageBoard to control a substantial area of low land between Didcotand Wallingford in Berkshire, are being prepared by local agency.Determination of Tenancies.   During the week 1 Order has beenmade by the Board determining a tenancy on account of bad farming                            tin respect of a holding of 10 acres.                        HORTICUI/TTJRAL DIVISION.Provision of Land for Allotments.   Reports received from 1,193districts show that 297,160 plots containing 21,457 acres havebeen provided under the Cultivation of Lands (Allotments) Order,1918, and previous Orders.          During the week, in addition to the area mentioned above,26 local authorities have agr-eed*-tO&apos;acquire a total area of 566
acres (4,863 allotments), including 143 acres at  Birmingham, 3acres at Cardiff, and 31 acres at Newton-in-Makerfield.Price of Apple3.   The arrangements made by the Ministry  of Foewith regard to the Immediate importation of large quantities of canadian apples have necessitated the amendment of the ApplePrices Order.   The Ministry, in consultation with the Departmihas proposed that the price of apples should be fixed at  asum admitting of their retail sale at 9d. per lb.          In order to give growers time to dispose of stocks of keeping apples, the price of which is still uncontrolled, theDepartment have recommended that the new Order should not comeinto force until the 14th December.Marketing Section,   Steps have been taken to improve the markforganisation in Berkshire, Devonshire, and Surrey, and It ishoped to open further collecting depots in the latter county,                        TECHNICAL DIVISION\Inspection of Land. (1) At the request of -the. Agricultural ExetCommittee, an inspection has been made of a*catchment area ofabout 1,500 acres adjoining large waterworks in Cheshire, theproduction from which during the past season has been practicalnegligible.   The area is capable of carrying a large sheepflock, even if it is considered detrimental to the purity ofthe water supply.to have cattle.  Advice has been given as to 1stock which such an area might reasonably be expected to  carryand treatment suggested whereby the yield and quality of the hicrop might be considerably improved.     (2);, The farm, - Haydon Grange, taken over in  the spring of1918, by the Somerset Executive, Committee has been inspected.Owing to unavoidable circumstances, work could not be commence!until April and most of the corn was sown    the  last fortnighMay,   As a result,, much of it was affected by the drought in
early summer but quite fair crops &quot;were- secured.   As- praxrtl^a 1 &quot;Ly-the whole of the land was formerly under inferior grass and the farm was in a more or less derelict condition, the crops obtainedrepresent a clear gain to the food supplies of the country.  Thefact that close on 100 acres of corn and 35 acres of roots were&quot;sown by the end of June on land which was under grass at thebeginning of April, is evidence of the energetic character of   *the management.                      LABOUR, DIVISION.          t  -Demobilisation.   The names of agriculturists who are recommendedby tho Department for early release under the &quot;pivotal&quot; men&amp;cheme, are being forwarded to the Department of demobilisation and Re-settlement dally.Harvest Labour.   The number of soldiers specially released forharvest work and still out on farms Is 2,012.   The number ofprisoners still out under the migratory gang system is 5,997.The majority of these men are engaged on potato lifting.Soldier Labour.   The number of ploughmen specially released on two months&apos; agricultural furlough is now 2,784,   580 men who arestated to have had experience,in threshing have arrived atdistribution centres during the week, under the general order for&apos;the release of threshing engine drivers on agricultural furlough,&apos;Some of the men, however, prove, on examination, to have had noprevious experience of this work.Sale of Horses Order, 1917.   Regulation 2T of the Defence of the realm Regulations, which prohibited an occupier of an agriculturalholding in Great Britain from selling or parting with the possession of any horse, used or  capable of being used for the cultivation of the holding, except under licence, having nowbeen withdrawn by Order in Council, it will be convenient  to summarise the work which has been undertaken by the department under this Regulation.
                                                         &apos;  .1          The board&apos;s powers under the Regulation weredelegated by the Sale of Horses Order, 1917, to AgriculturalExecutive Committees and County Borough Councils.          Since the Order was made in June, 1917, 180,325 lihave been issued for the sale of agricultural horses, anaverage of slightly over 10,000 per month.   19,528 of theselicences were Issued in favour of the Controller of HorseTransport for essential trade purposes.          Proceedings have been taken for contravention of tRegulation in 178 cases, involving 227 separate charges.Eleven of the charges were dismissed, three were withdrawn opayment of costs, and in one instance costs were awarded tothe defendant owing to the fact that the proceedings were tain the wrong Court.          In all other cases convictions were obtained, and penalties amounting to  1,788. 8s. 2d, were imposed.          There  is clear evidence that the Regulation prevena very large number of agricultural horses being sold offthe land at a time when their work was urgently required inthe interests of food production.   It also enabled theGovernment to allocate to  the Army or to essential trades allhorses surplus  to  the requirements of agriculture.                        Wornenfs Branch.          The Oxted Tractor Training School is to be  closedduring the winter, owing to the unsuitability of the  building?this time of year.   An excellent training has been given to women at this centre, and  reports from the counties to  whichthey have been  allocated have always been most satisfactory.
                  -                                                   J          The best record in tractor ploughing in Kent has  been secured by a woman driving a Fordson tractor in Romney Marsh(heavy land) during the recent bad weather.    16j acres were ploughed in 45 hours with an average consumption of 3.1 gallons  ofparaffin per aore, and 97 acres were ploughed in six weeks,  with aconsumption of 3,2 gallons par acre.          Sectional conferences of the women&apos;s War agricultural committees are being held in various parts of the country.    At  aoonference held in Wales last week, it was suggested that the men&apos;sand women1s War Agricultural Committees could develop local schemes under which women would have facilities for eduoating themselves,and that the adoption of such schemes should be pressed upon thelocal education authorities.   Representatives of several of the welsh counties spoke strongly of the need for rural reconstructionas it affected women.          The conference as a whole showed clearly that the interestof women in agriculture has ha en permanently aroused in Wales, andthat many women, given the necessary facilities, will continue totake an active part in the future of agriculture.                      CULTIVATION DIVISION.Tractor^Scheme^   The following statement shows the position withregard to the provision of tractors, machinery and implements owned by the Department for the week ended 30th November, 1918t-                                   No. consigned     Total No.                                   during week.    with counties.         Tractors..............         8            4,181                                   (36 withdrawn)         Ploughs............         8            5,354                                   (55 withdrawn)          During  the week ended 15th November, J.8.265 acres were ploughed. 33 acres were cross ploughed, and  1,300 acres werecultivated.                              - 7  -
Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during  the  past  week is Ifollows&quot;:-  ploughed 16,585 acres, cultivated 11,943  acres,  harroJ436 acres, mole drained 341 acres.    Total 29,305  acres.Machinery.  One additional threshing  machine was consigned  to an agricultural Executive Committee during  the past week,  making thjtotal number supplied to counties to  date 363.                     SUPPLIES DIVISION.Fertilisers.   The supply of fertilisers during  the  remainder of present season is likely.to be  increased as a  result of the cessation of hostilities.   There should be no difficulty in providing a supply of 285,000 tons  of sulphate of  ammonia for tlxwhole season, as compared with  230,000 tons last year.    It maypossible to arrange for the release of some Government  stocks ofnitrate of soda to the farmer,  and  a  parallel  release ton for tonsulphate of ammonia for export  to Sugar  Colonies,  Allies, etcis estimated that 280,000 - 300,000 tons will  be about  the  maxiiquantity of sulphate of ammonia and nitrate of soda  together, wWlwill be purchased by farmers at present  prices.          As regards superphosphate,  it  is  expected  that sufficiephosphate rock will be available to bring  the  total  production for the season up to 900,000 tons,  as compared  with 700,000 tons lastyear.   The demand for superphosphate at the  present time is good and there is evidence that the  quantity  which can be manufacturesin time for application to spring crops  will  be  disposed of.          In the case of basic  slag,  the better supply of labour will enable manufacturers to  increase their output to some extentbut the total production will probably not exceed 600,000 tons ascompared witji ,500,000  tons last year.
Cereal Seeds.  The following approximate quantities of stock seedwheat are still available for sale through the Departmentsdistributing agents:-                                     Qrs.  (504 lbs.)                 &quot;Yeoman&quot; ..........  11                 &quot;Little Joss&quot; ..... 161                 &quot;Brovick&quot; ......... 107                 &quot;Rivetf ..........  50          With the exception of the &quot;Rivett&quot; variety these wheatscan be sown up to the beginning of February, or even later, and Itis anticipated that the demand will be sufficient to clear thesequantities by that time.Seed Oats.  Arrangements are being made for the selection ofsuitable consignments of Black Tartarian seed oats in Ireland,  andit is anticipated that cargoes will reach this country at theend of this month, so that the pats may be re-cleaned where necessary in rmple time for distribution.Seed Potatoes.  Certain prospective purchasers of seed potatoesare experiencing difficulty in obtaining supplies from Scotlandother than those riddled over lj&quot; riddles &quot;as grown&quot;.   Theattention of the Ministry of Food has been drawn to this matter,and it is hoped that growers in Scotland will for the fufcurein all cases offer commercial varieties riddled according tostandard dressing.Wart Disease.  It is hoped that the arrangement between theDepartment and the Board of Agriculture for Scotland in relationto the export of susceptible varieties from Scotland to Englandwill soon be definitely settled.    Now that &quot;seed&quot; Is beginning to move from Scotland this is very important.Spraying.   Reports are being received from different parts of  thecountry which tend to show that where potatoes have been sprayed
during the past season the tubers are keeping much better in ttclamps than those which have been lifted from unsprayed crops.          Pew serious reports of potatoes going bad in store hsbeen received during the past week.   Wo serious losses in theclamps in the Pens havo been reported, and in Hertfordshire thecondition of the harvested crop appears to be favourable.                           I am.                                Sir,                                    Your obedient Servant,Director-General,The Ft. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M,P.
