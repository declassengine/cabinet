Hi-, C;-i-aunic Majesty&apos;s  Government                       MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.&apos;F f I A f I  liNvSr    ! 1 Ite^ort  for Week ending  Wednesday, November 27,. 1918.                        PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN. .    Consumers&apos; Council. At the meeting of this Council last Wednesday, the Deputy-Chairman (Mr. T. W. Allen) said they had heard with profound regret that the nationwas about to lose the services of Mr. Clynes as Food Controller.  The Council hadacclaimed Mr. Clynes  as  the  one and  true  successor to Lord Rhondda as FoodController, and he had justified that claiiji in every particular.  Nothing was morefitting  than that  on  such a vital  matter as  feeding the people in a great nationalcrisis  like that through which the  country had passed, responsibility should fall onthe shoulders  of  a  labour representative.   It was  through his foresight that the consumers&apos; Council was brought into existence, and that Council had justified itself,and demonstrated the necessity of its continuance until absolute release of food controltook place.  Mr.  Hyndman  and Lord Rathcreedan endorsed Mr. Allen&apos;s remarks, theformer saying that  though they had had differences of  opinion on very important matters, Mr. Clynes had always met them with a singular urbanity which disarmedresentment and left only good feeling behind.    Mr. Clynes explained  that he had  come  to the meeting  as he might not haveanother opportunity of being present.  He had indicated his willingness, if so desired,to carry on his work for a short time in order  that some Inter-Allied aspects  of thefood question might not be needlessly confused.   It was  admitted  on all sides thatthe experiment of setting up the Consumers&apos; Council had been of the greatest  benefitnot only to the Ministry but also to the  country at large,  and he hoped that, whoevercame or went, the Council would continue in the Ministry of Food.    Captain Elliott attended and explained the dual  system  of freight rates.  Therehad always been  two rates ruling, the Government stores&apos; rate representing the actual cost of the goods carried, and  the  commercial rate  fixed in competition.  The vastbalk of food  supplies was carried at the former rate.  Rates had necessarily variedfrom 2d. a lb. for tea to \d. a lb. for bacon.   It was  anticipated that the Governmentstores&apos;  rate would be reduced on an average by 50 per cent.  Commercial rates were largely governed  by  the  rates  obtainable by neutral and other competing tonnage.These rates had already fallen  considerably.  The freight on apples from Canada hadbeen reduced  from 3Z. 6s. Sd.  to 11. Is.  a barrel.   The rate for shipments  of fruitfrom Spain, had fallen from 350s. to 1.00s.  All rates had gone into a general pool andthis had enabled  the Government stores&apos; rate  to  be  put lower  than would otherwise have been the case.    Lord Bledisloe attended and explained the  effect of the- armistice on the avail-ability of sugar  for  distribution.   They had  been mainly dependent  for sugar onCuban supplies,  but  they would now be able to get sugar much more cheaply fromJava and Mauritius.  This would necessarily take time,  but  the  new conditions would justify an  inroad into the considerable stocks.  After referring to the Christmasconcessions already announced, he indicated his intention of increasing the generalration in February, of continuing indefinitely the extra child&apos;s ration, and of  givingrelief to the confectionery trades who  had suffered more  than any other branch  of sugar consumers.  The Council expressed  a preference  for an additional all roundration of .\ lb. for the week before Christmas instead of the child&apos;s extra ration, andLord Bledisloe stated that, with the Food Controllers consent, this arrangement wouldhe made.                               .  *    The  Committee  of Representatives. At  their  meeting on Thursday last, the. Committee . of Representatives were notified of the Governments desire that theInter-Allied Food Council should consider various applications  for food supplies from,neutral and enemy countries while dealing with the relief of  the recovered territories.The claims of liberated and Allied populations naturally take  first  place.  So  far as germany is concerned before granting any relief that maybe available, the Committeeof Representatives must  be  satisfied that the need  is real, must know Germany&apos;s    A  (33)6822-4 Pk 1  145 11/18 E &amp; S                                          A
 resources and ability  to  effect, a fair distribution,  and. must be  assured that a government  exists in Germany capable of dealing with the Allies for a permanent settlement.     As illustrating the varied character of the problems to be faced, it may be stated that applications for relief have been received within the past few days in respect of Montenegro, Esthonia, Vdrarlberg (Austria), Finland, &amp;c.  In view of  the measure of agreement readied between the,Dutch delegates and the representatives of the Allied Governments and the  United States, and in view of  reports of serious distress in Holland arising out of insufficient supplies, the Committee arranged last week for  the immediate diversion  to Rotterdam of the S.S. &quot; Adra,&quot; carrying about 7,100 tons of wheat.     The  Food Couneil. It  was  reported by Sir Alan Anderson that, at a meeting called at the request  of the  War Cabinet&apos;s Economic Defence Committee, it had been decided to ask the Inter-Allied Food  Council  to  undertake measures  of  relief in  the matter of the supply of clothing and boots for the recovered territories in addition to the supply of food, the Ministry being asked  to  be the responsible Department of  the British Government.     At the request of the Agricultural Relief  of Allies Committee, it has been agreed to allocate feeding-stuffs for live stock collected for restocking the devastated areas in France, Belgium, and Serbia.  The Feeding-stuffs  Board have  been  asked  to make the necessary arrangements.     The staff of the Central Clearing House is to he reduced from 460 to 200.  The work is to be limited  to checking butchers&apos; returns and  selected returns from retailers of sugar.   It has been  decided that  if  Canadian apples can be imported  in sufficient quantities on private  account no purchases need be made by the Ministry.   A retail price for apples of 9d. per lb. has been agreed.  The restriction on the use of wheaten flour in cakes and pastry is to be  removed.   ,  The Impo7*ts; BoarfA-Oontracts have  now been completed for the  purchase of  the exportable surplus of butter and cheese from  New Zealand and  Australia for  the period of: the. war and one clear season after; the  declaration  of peace.  Sanction  has also been obtained for the purchase of, the Argentine output  of butter up to the  end of March.     ),,-                    ,       ui r. -  . VThe  Department of Import. Restrictions have promised  to licence  freely  the imports of tomato puree from Italy.   The Treasury have agreed to  licences being issued by the Department of  Import  Restrictions for 10,000 hogsheads of silver skin onions in brine and 5,000 hogsheads, of cauliflower in brine from  tlolland.     Representations  have  been made to the War Office that shipments of pork  and beans from America should continue and that any surplus over War Office requirements &apos; for France should be sent to the United  Kingdom in view of the probable  demand  for food-stuffs of this kind for re-occupied territories.  Sanction has been obtained for  the purchase of 800 tons of first-grade cheese  from South Africa.     Arrangements have now  been made to lift the 3,000,000 lbs. of  China tea already purchased.     The Joint Finance  Board.-The question  of  the saving anticipated in war risks insurance was considered.  In the case of the  Wheat Commission it was reported that there was no separate  fund  for  insurance, the rate of premium to  cover war and marine;.risks being reckoned in  the  cost of cargo. In the  present  cereal year  the reduction  in  the  premium and the saving up  to November  llth would  together amount to about 12,800,0001.   This figure, relating  solely to the importation of  wheat required on a 70. per cent, extraction basis for the 9a\ loaf, would be  equivalent to a reduction  in the amount of the bread subsidy of  &quot;83d. per loaf.     In the case  of the  Sugar Commission, the  reserves accumulated were not  too large to cover the risk of depreciation in value of stocks.  No possibility of  a  bonus distribution from the Sugar Commission^  insurance reserves is anticipated except inthe form of maintaining the present price of sugar in spite of the rising  cost of newpurchases.     The Milk Control Board. The immediate problem before the Milk Control board is that of winter shortages.   Although the number of  milch  cows has  not decreased,the yield of milk this  winter will be low.  The principal&apos;reasons for this are :-  &apos; t;  (a), The  shortage- of feeding-stuffs:  Of  the home:produced  feeding-stuffs,&apos;1  he  v\,,;    ; root crop has been a( partial failure, and a large part of the hay crop &quot;Was         , requisitioned&quot;for  the  Army;&apos;  while,  owing to  the cut  in tonnage,  the  v.1&apos;&apos;     supplies of imported:!eeding-stuffs  were  greatly reduced.&apos;  : &quot;    (6) the shortage of skilled labour on farms and in milk depots and dairies.
     There is no reason to  anticipate that the total  supplies during the winter months will not be sufficient to cover the requirements for those for whom milk is essential(i.e., children, nursing mothers, and invalids), but  already in some districts  there is&apos;evidence of shortage  and it is certain  that essential  requirements cannot  be met without better distribution on the one hand and  drastic  restriction in the consumptionof milk by adults on the other;     The following steps have been taken by the Ministry to meet this situation : -:       (.1)  Condensed  milk,  of  which there are at present ample stocks, is being              distributed  on a  liberal basis,  and Divisional  Commissioners  have              been informed that in the event of a serious shortage of liquid milk in              their divisions, an additional emergency distribution of condensed milk              will be made.       (2)  An Order will be issued restricting the use of milk in  catering and resi-              dential  establishments, to -j%ths of a pint for breakfast, and TVth.of a              pint for other meals.       (3)  The use of  liquid  milk in the  manufacture of margarine and  of condensed              milk has&apos; been  reduced. Imported dried milk is being supplied to the              margarine factories, in substitution for liquid milk.    4  -       (4)  An alteration is proposed in  the Cream  Orders restricting  deliveries of              cream to invalids, suffering from  specified diseases, and children under              five.                                                     .      ,(.       (5)  An official Press notice, urging adults  to  abstain from the use -of; liquid              milk  as far as  possible has  been  issued, and unofficial information              has been supplied to the Press as material for propaganda.       (6)  Weekly  returns of  sales  by retailers are being obtained through Food&apos;              Committees.   The week ending  September .28th is  being taken  as  a              standard.  The percentage  by which; a  retailer&apos;s weekly sales fall below            &apos;  his sales in the standard week, will be compared with the percentage by              which the total sales  of the district  have declined in that period,  and              Committees  will  endeavour by agreement with  the  trade to, bring the              supplies of each retailer up or down  to the percentage  of  the whole              district;  Failing agreement,  Committees will refer  the  matter to the              Divisonal Commissioners  who will  exercise  the powers of  diversion              which have  been. delegated to them under the provisions of the Milk              (Distribution] Order, 1918.   Commissioners will similarly adjust supplies              between Committees&apos; Districts, and the Ministry between Divisions.,       (7) Special measures  are being taken for Greater London, where the shortage              is likely to be most acute.   A Committee, representing the  milk trade,              has been formed  under the chairmanship  of the Divisional  Commissioner   v.&quot;/  ;       for the Home Counties Division, and they  have provisionally agreed              to reduce supplies to all retailers to 85. per  cent, of their supplies for&apos;        .      the week ending 12th October.   At the  present moment  some retailers              are receiving considerably more  and some considerably less than their              supplies for that week.       (8) Committees who  have not already  put priority schemes into  force have              been urged to  do so,  thus securing that children under five years of age,              invalids, and nursing mothers should have the first call on the available              supplies.  It is thought that this is a better method of dealing  with the              question than rationing owing to the  highly perishable  character  of              milk,  and to the fact that consumption varies  so  greatly in  different              districts and between different persons.  This question, however, is being              explored together with the kindred; question of registering customers,  to              prevent persons obtaining supplies from more than one retailer.                            SUPPLIES AND  DISTRIBUTION.     Feeding-stuffs. The demands under the Distribution Order are not yet sufficient to take up the quantities of cakes and meals that are available, owing to the fact that&apos; a number of live stock OAvners have not applied.  .    -  &apos;      1 -        1 :    . Meat. The supplies of  cattle of the first grade have now appreciably diminished, and it has become necessary to give notice  to&apos;the Army authorities that it1 is unlikely that we.  shall  be&apos; able  to ;fill  their  requirements - after   30th November.   An endeavour will be made to provide a double civilian ration of home-killed meat for the
week ending 21st December.  It, is felt  that this  course will  be more likely to meetthe views of the public, as difficulties might arise if any discrimination were exercised in the distribution of  home-killed and frozen meat for the Christmas  supplies.   Nocomplaints are now arising in respect of the quality of  imported supplies, and thepresent method  of inspection  adopted in North America appears to  be producingmore satisfactory results.     Complaints  continue  from the  miners  in  the Rhondda  Valley of the generalquality and shortage of food-stuffs they receive.   The Divisional Commissioner has,however, sent in a report with figures showing the average ration of  essential food-stuffs supplied in five mining districts, over a period of three months, which indicates that the Rhondda district has been better  supplied  than  any other.  Special con-sideration has been given for some time to the claims of the mining districts.  &apos;               ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE REALM REGULATIONS.     1. The Syrup,  Liquid Glucose,  and Molasses Prices  Order,  1918, dated  18thNovember  1918,  fixes  maximum  prices for syrup, glucose, and molasses.   The retail price for syrup and glucose is lOd. per lb. loose, and lO^d. in containers.     2. Order, dated 19th November 1918, amending the Bones (Licensing of Purchasers)Order, 1918, applies the Principal Order to Ireland as from 16th  December.     3. The Canned Condensed Milk (Maximum Prices) Ireland Order, 1918, dated20th November 1918, extends the  control of prices to Ireland and fixes manufacturers&apos;wholesale  and   retail  prices  in Ireland.  The  Order  comes into  operation onDecember 9th.     4. The Raw  Coffee  Eetums  Order,  1918, dated 20th November 1918, requiresreturns of raw coffee in the United  Kingdom whether in bond or not on the 30thNovember.  The return must be made by all persons who hold 50 bags or more.     5. The Butter (Cold Storage) (Ireland) Order,  1918, dated 21st November  1918,prohibits the removal  of  butter from  cold  storage in Ireland  except under licence.Accurate records are to be kept and necessary returns made by owners of cold stores.                           ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS.     The total number of prosecutions for the week are 915, of which 803 resulted inconvictions. The average fine  in England, Scotland and Wales, was 31. 9s. lid.; inIreland, 7s. 9d.     The number of Orders affected  by  the  prosecutions is 71;  of these rationingwith 132 cases  and  127 convictions, and  milk  distribution  with 80  cases and80 convictions take the lead.     At Southwark, Dennis 0&apos;Brien was  sentenced to one month&apos;s imprisonment, for obtaining and using a double set of ration books.             PART  II.-SUMMARY  OF THE FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    Imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs in the week ended November 23rd(140,500 tons) again show a decrease whether compared with those of the. precedingweek (161,100 tons), or with the average for the first 47 weeks  of  the calendar year(181,500 tons), or with the average for the  first 12 weeks of the cereal year (181,800&apos;tons). &apos; ,  /         .  vvV     ;   v^---&apos;-        ^V&apos;./.&apos;&apos;       (;    &apos;  &apos; &apos;&apos;. &apos;.\  ^vtV:;    The decrease in the total ois  accounted  for by low imports of sugar, meat, and maize;  again no barley arrived.  There was an average supply of  wheat and of oats.Oranges began to arrive in substantial [quantities (J,800 tons) as well as bananas(1,700 tons).                                                &apos;              ,

Milk. The quantity of milk  conveyed by railway companies (Table C (4), p. 9),has declined, though not at a greater  rate than last year.   The decrease in rail-bornemilk appears to be greatest in the  Eastern  and North-Eastern Counties.   Statisticsrelating to a  company controlling 50,000 milch cows show that the average yield percow fell 61 per cent, in October and 1\ per cent, in the first nine days of November,compared with the corresponding periods last year.    Fish. Supplies of fish, show a  steady  improvement.  The quantities coming forward at Billingsgate and the larger inland  markets for the week ended  November16th were 5,029 tons, as compared with 3,710 tons  in the previous week.  supplies at Billingsgate alone were 3,000 tons, as compared with 2,138 tons in the previousweek, and a weekly average of 1,900  tons in November 1917.     Jam. Returns made by jam manufacturers give the  total output in October as24,300 tons, which is equivalent  to  20  ozs: per head of population.   Their stocks on31st October were 26,200 tons of jam, equivalent to 22 ozs. per head, besides 32,700tons of pulp.  Their prospective output  for November and December is put at 24,000tons and 26,000 tons respectively.  It would, therefore, appear that the domestic jamration of 4 ozs. a head  a week (- 17-1- oz- a  month), together with the  allowance tocaterers, is amply secured, provided  the supplies of fruit and sugar anticipated, areforthcoming.                                    STOCKS.    The stocks shown in Table D  have been revised in accordance with the latest estimates of  production and  the  farm  3tocks.   The  total home production,  after deducting seed and tail corn, as on 1st September is now estimated  at 7,450,000 tons as compared with 5,985,000 tons on 1st September 1917.  The  result of the revisionis to  raise the estimated stocks  of cereals on  1st November by 528,000 tons to,010,000 tons, of which 6,030,000  tons represent home crops available  for consump-tion.  Cereal stocks are  considerably higher than those of last year, the corresponding figures for 1st November 1917  being 4,826,000 home-crops and 7,220,000 tons total stocks.    Stocks of meat and  provisions  in warehouses and cold stores have been  increased during  the  week ended  the  16th November  as regards  imported beef  (increase7,700 tons), canned meat (increase 1,400 tons), cheese (increase 1,100 tons), and lard(increase 1,000 tons);  but  there  was a  decline in the stocks  of  bacon  (decrease4,000 tons), condensed milk (decrease 2,900 tons), and butter (decrease 1,000 tons).The total stocks of meat have now  reached 125,300 tons; the highest figure hithertorecorded being 103,200 tons on 1st November 1915.A 6822-415    The total imports for the first  12 weeks  of  the  cereal years 1917-18 and1918-19 are compared in the following table:
