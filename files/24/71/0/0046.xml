TIMS poCumeITColonel  W. Dally Jonesi   the  Property ofSECRET.His  Britannic  Majestys Governraer.&apos;MINISTRY   OF    FOOD.146  iiT,  644 5llhllBfmtm for  Week  ending Wednesday,  December 4,  1918.                       PART  L-ACTION  TAKEN.    The Food Council. Mr. Clynes, presiding over a meeting of the Food Council,referred to the proposal to secure more beer and a reduction in prices, and emphasised the importance of the question of prices being dealt with promptly.    It has been decided that it will no longer be necessary to maintain the rationing of lard.    The Council have agreed to relax the following restrictions on the sale and rise ofcereals: -    (1) The Cake and Pastry Order.    (2) The limit on the total sale of breadstulfs for afternoon meals in catering           establishments, &amp;c.    (3) The restriction on the use of maize, barley, and oats for industrial purposes.    (4) The limit on the percentage of imported flour which may  be mixed with G-.R.           flour.    (5)  The restriction on the use of  potatoes  and potato products, except that the           use  of sound ware potatoes must continue to  be restricted  to  seed or           human food.    (6)  The restriction on  the  sale and use of cereals, flour, starch, &amp;c, other than           those imported by the Wheat Commission.    In deference  to  further representations received  from  the  Board  of Trade theFood Council have decided  to withdraw their objection to the publication of figuresof imports in the Board of Trade monthly returns.    The Imports Board. At the Board&apos;s meeting on Thursday,  November 28th, theChairman expressed  the Board&apos;s appreciation of the  way in which Canada and theCanada Food Board had saved the butter situation in the United Kingdom by  requisi-tioning butter in Canada.  Had it not been for Canada&apos;s prompt action it would nothave been possible to maintain the butter ration.    Owing to a reduction in War Office requirements a greatly increased quantity ofdates from  Basra  will  be  available  for civilian consumption.  Provided Treasurysanction is obtained it is proposed to increase the purchases on account of the ministry to 23,500 tons.  It is understood that shipping will be available.    The purchase of  Danish eggs is completed and it is  expected that the Egyptianprogramme  will be  fulfilled, but the supplies  of eggs from North America havefallen short of the  quantity it was hoped would be purchased.  The position is  asfollows : 	Programme.	Available Supplies.	Shortage.U.S.A. - &apos; -&apos;	90,000 cases. 30,000 ,,	65,000 cases. 5,000 ,,	25,000 cases. 25,000 ,,    In view of this deficiency the suggestion has been made that supplies should beobtained from South Africa if cool space can be made available.    Tonnage will be provided for importing 800 tons of dried apples, from Australiaif supplies are satisfactory.   It is understood that more freight space will be available from Australia in January  and February for  general cargo; the  Meat PurchasingCommittee have been notified accordingly.    The Home Supplies Board. In view of the representations of the President ofthe Board of Agriculture deprecating the fixing of prices for root crops, it was agreedthat prices should not be fixed  for turnips, swedes, beetroot,  or parsnips, but that inview of the shortness of the crop a  maximum price at all stagey should be fixed forcarrots.                             &apos;    A  (33)7008-1  Pk9 145 12/18  E&amp;S                                         A
     The Chief Live Stock  Commissioner, reporting  on the operations of the feeding stuffs  distribution  scheme,  stated that after&apos; January 25th  it was hoped rationing of offals would  he no longer necessary, though probably some form of rationing would still be required for cake.     The  Central  Agricultural  Advisory Council. The  Council met  on  Tuesday, December 3rd.   The  question  of the price  of the 1919 British  wool  clip was discussed, and it was agreed that members of the Council who also  sit on  the Wool Advisory Committee of the Army Contracts Department should draw up a Report for submission to the  Council  at the next meeting.  The Council  will then be able to forward its views  to  the Wool Council, which is formed of  Representatives of the Trade appointed by the War Office to consider the  whole question of control; this Council is to meet on December 19th.     A suggestion put forward by the Ministry of Food that pigs below 178 lbs. live weight should be sold by auction,  and not at  the  fixed  maximum  price of 21s. per score, in order that another outlet might be provided for the  surplus pigs in the market, was approved  by the Council.     A request  from the National Agricultural Labourers&apos; and Rural Workers&apos; Union for representation on the Council was referred to the Standing Orders Sub-Committee for consideration.   .  The Development of the Margarine Industry. A food industry which  has  shown a remarkable  development during the war is the edible oil and margarine industry. Before the war when the deodorising of oil  was mainly a  continental industry, and facilities both for this purpose and for hydrogenation  were inconsiderable, the British margarine industry supplied only about  half the home  consumption which was then ,roughly 3,000 tons per week.  Until the spring of  1918  we  continued  to import margarine from Holland, and  the  necessary oil was forwarded  under  licence to that country for the purpose.  In the meantime the necessary machinery for the refining of the oil and the manufacture of margarine was being installed  in this country with a view to making Great Britain self-contained so far as this important food industry is concerned.  In particular, great strides were  made in the refining of edible oils and fats from seeds and kernels grown in the British Colonies which  formerly were largely imported  by  Germany.  The capacity  of  oil-refining factories  has been increased during 1918  roughly  from 4,250  tons  to  nearly  10,750 tons, and the margarine factories from about 5,000 tons to 9,500 tons,per  week.  Even in the  event  of a failure of the butter supply the margarine machinery would be adequate.     Previous  to the control of margarine various grades were placed on the market of good, bad, and indifferent quality, hut since the inception of a fixed working formula by the Ministry the quality has been uniformly improved so  that at the present time, despite war conditions, the public are consuming a better article than at any other previous time.     Further important steps are being taken  by the Ministry to  benefit the trade by the grading of seeds, kernels, and oils so as  to  establish recognisable qualities to be maintained by the adoption  of  standard  contracts,  and by  the encouragement of research in the use and properties of the articles.                                    SUPPLIES.     Bacon - Hams, and Lard. The demand for bacon keeps low, although the quality supplied to the trade has greatly improved.  With regard to the  question of a revision of retail prices in England, it has been decided that while the retailer, and more particularly the small retailer, may have had difficulties to contend with in the matter of an  inferior assortment of bacon, the position, taken  as a whole, is not such  as to justify the Bacon Division in  asking  the Food Controller to assent.to any increase in the maximum price.     Stocks of lard in hand,  and anticipated purchases, are sufficient not only to allow lard to be released from the coupon, but to allot a certain amount weekly to manu- facturers whoat present receive only &quot; compound &quot; for manufacturing purposes.  It is, however, intended to maintain the registration of customers and the present system of distribution, so that the machinery for rationing will be complete if circumstances make it necessary to institute it afresh,  .! Dried Fruits.-The release of  dried fruits for the Christmas trade is proceeding satisfactorily, sufficient  sultanas  being available  to allow 25 per cent, of the datumperiod quantity of this  variety to be Released.
      Meat. Reports from areas all over the country indicate  that  an appreciable quantity of live  stock was held back from the markets last week in order that farmers should reap  the benefit of  the advanced prices which came into  operation on  the 1st December.   At the same time the increases in the market during the current week aro not expected to be maintained for any appreciable time.      No meat has so far been diverted to the recently liberated countries, but there is no doubt that demands will shortly have to be met.      The necessity for increasing the output of frozen meat is still urgent owing to the difficulty expected in pro Adding storage space for later arrivals, but the reports received from the country show that there is  considerable doubt whether  the public will take advantage of the double ration which is to be made available for them during Christmas week.  This doubt is strengthened  by the concessions which have  been made in the direction of  freeing poultry and game from the coupon.  The future demand for meat will probably be adversely affected  by the prices now required.   The reports received already indicate  a diminution in the purchasing power  of the public, and the problem is likely to arise of providing an adequate  ration for the industrial community at prices which they are able to pay.     It has  been announced to  committees and  to the  public that, from Sunday, 1st December, until  further notice, the  following classes of  meat may be sold by retailers and served  as part of  a meal  by  caterers without requiring the&apos;  surrender of meat coupons : Edible offal, including tongues, kidneys and skirt and all other edible offal of  cattle, sheep  and pigs mentioned in  the Uniform Schedule of Maximum Retail Prices for Offal; and imported tenderloins from  cattle.  This concession also applies to institutions.     Potatoes. The recent shortage of potatoes in London has been terminated, and there are now abundant supplies of  potatoes coming forward into all the  London markets.  It is proposed to  carry out certain modifications in the Potato Distribution Scheme to make  the Scheme less rigid, and it is hoped that these  alterations will&apos; come into force on the 12th instant.     The Board of Agriculture estimate that the stocks of potatoes on hand in England and Wales on the  1st November 1918 was 700,000 tons in excess of the stocks in the country on the corresponding date last year.  Arrangements have already been made ior  the export of 10,000 tons to France,  and it  will  probably be found necessary to export further quantities later in the season.     Tea.-Nearly 2,500,000 lbs. of the 3,000,000 lbs. of China tea purchased by the Ministry of Food is being shipped  on a vessel leaving Shanghai during the present month.                                DIVISIONAL REPORTS.     South Wales.-Representatives  of the Ministry of Food were invited to attend a conference of miners  delegates in  South Wales on  the 2nd  of December.   The delegates&apos; complaints chiefly concerned  unequal distribution.  They also declared that the present rations of meat, sugar, and butter were insufficient to keep them in bodily health. The representatives of the Ministry present explained in reply  the reality of the shortage of available  supplies, and why the signing of the Armistice could not afford immediate relief to the situation in this respect.     The delegates received the  replies in  a very good spirit, and evidently appreciated the  reasons given as to  why it is impossible at present  to relax the  restrictions on the rationed articles.     Scotland East. Prisoners of war repatriated from germany are arriving in large numbers at the Port of Leith, where they are receiving a  magnificent welcome from the  citizens.   The Scottish Branch of the Red Cross Society, who have made special arrangements for their comfort, have asked for the release of dried fruits to  make fruit cake for 10,000 men.                ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE  REALM REGULATIONS.     I. The  Apples (Prices)  Order, 1918,-dated)d4th November 1918, controls  the price of  all home-grown and  imported  apples.  The maximum retail price is  Qd.1 per lb;  The Order comes into force on December 16th, and  revokes  the Apples and Perry Pears  (Sales) Order, 1918.                                               i-     .2. The  Horseflesh (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, dated 30th November 1918, fixes maximum wholesale and retail prices for horseflesh.   Notices  of  sale  and prices must be kept posted in a conspicuous position by retailers.
    3. The Milk (Restriction in Establishments) Order, 1018,  dated 30th. November1918, prohibits  the serving of  milk  as  a  beverage in  any catering or  residentialestablishment, except under a medical certificate, and also provides for the rationingin bulk of milk in establishments.                            ENFORCEMENT OF  ORDERS.    The number of prosecutions has dropped in the past week  by 250 cases.    The total number for the week is  859, with 768 convictions.    The prosecutions are reported under 64 different Orders, those heading the listbeing  the Flour Restriction (Ireland) Order with 189 cases, the Tea (Retail Prices)Order with 112  cases, and the Rationing Order, 1918, with 101  cases.    Imprisonment. A  sentence of  21  days&apos;  imprisonment,  without  option,  wasinflicted on Florence Breman, housekeeper, for using a ration bookjllegally obtained.    A number of cases are reported in which ingenious attempts have been made to evade the Orders controlling the  prices of intoxicating liquors.  It is said that hotel-keepers make a practice of closing down the public bar  and compelling customers toobtain their drinks in other parts of the houses where higher prices are charged.              PART  II.-SUMMARY  OF  THE  FOOD POSITION.                                    IMPORTS.    Average imports only arrived in the week ended 30th November (181,400 tons).As compared with the preceding weeks there were substantial increases in  meat(increase 16,600 tons), bacon (increase 4,200 tons), rice  (increase  6,000  tons), sugar(increase 4,400 tons), and tea (increase 9,300 tons).   There was again  a good import of oats (15,200 tons), but maize (2,800 tons),  was still  low, and practically no barleyarrived.  The import of tea (12,800 tons), was the highest recorded  in any week (with one exception)  during the past two years.  There were also good  imports  of eggs(1,200 tons), poultry, lemons (1,800 tons), and oranges (3,500 tons),  but no bananas.    The total  imports for  the  first  13 weeks of  the  cereal years  1917-18  and1918-19 are compared in the following table : Total Imports in the first 13 weeks of cereal year.	1917.	1918.

Provisions. The returns of sales by multiple shops and co-operative stores showan all-round decline in  the four weeks  ended November 23rd,  compared  with  thepreceding four weeks.  The fall in bacon  sales has been continuous since the high level  reached  in June.  The present  sales are  16 per cent,  below  those  of  thepreceding four weeks, 38 per cent, below those of  June, and about 14 per cent, belowthe general average for 1916-17.  They are,  of  course, very much higher (51  percent.) than those of a year, ago, when there was a bacon shortage which lasted until april 1918. &apos;Cheese  shows a  fall of  14 per cent, on  the sales in the  preceding
four weeks, no doubt caused by a shortage of supplies, the quantities released by theMinistry having been reduced from. 3,400 tons to ^,200 tons.   The returns  show thatcheese stocks are low, having fallen from seven to six days&apos; supply.  Butter  sales have declined a further 35 per cent, compared with the preceding four weeks.  The fall isseasonal, but its degree is intensified by the re-adjustment of the butter and  margarineration.     Bread and Flour. The fall in  the quantity of flour used  for bread and sold bvbakers in the four weeks  ended November 9th (Table C (2)) has been followed  by adecrease of 6 per cent, in the quantities  of  flour released by  millers and  issued toagents in the four weeks  ended November 23rd (Table B (1)).     Tea. The  large  imports  and  stocks  of  tea referred  to  above have  been accompanied by large increases jn the  quantities balloted  for (Table B (1)), thefour-weekly average having  increased  from  2,500 tons a week in  the  four weeks ended October  12th to 4,200 tons a  week  in  the  four weeks ended  November  23rd.This is equal to nearly 4  ozs. per head of the  total population of all ages.     Meat. The  estimated  consumption  of  home-grown butchers7   meat  in  GreatBritain in the week ended 23rd November showed a slight increase on the  preceding,weeks.   The quantity of  refrigerated meat issued rose further to 1,800 tons, but,of *this 1,100 tons consisted of boneless beef and  offals.   The estimated total consumptionof meat  sold against  coupons,  after deductions  for waste, was 16,900 tons.   Theincrease in the  meat consumption in the United Kingdom (Table B (1)) is  due partly to the increase of imported meat falling outside  the  ration ; but mainly to  theincreased slaughter of  cattle in  Ireland, no doubt partly due  to the restrictions onthe; exportation of cattle from Ireland.                                     STOCKS.     During the week ended 23rd  November stocks of beef, were enlarged by 5,700tons while other meat declined  1,000 tons, due no doubt to the release of  offals fromrationing.  The stocks of condensed milk  declined .1,700 tons,  otherwise there&apos;was no material change.  Ministry storage  was reduced by 6,000 tons  of bacon, and increasedby 1,500 tons of lard and 1,200 tons of butter.     Live Stock--The estimated number  of  live stock in Great Britain on the  4thNovember shows an improvement on last  year&apos;s figures under  all heads except thoseof ewes kept for breeding where the fall is from 12,966,000 to 9,150,000 (29  per cent.).Dairy cattle show an increase of 7 per cent., total cattle 5 per cent., sheep 1 per cent.,breeding sows  24 per cent., and total pigs 5 per cent.  It must be borne in  mind,however, that the average weights have fallen.
