SUMUAHX OIL J3IIJOICADA IHFOEMATIOJI                       Hov. 29 - Deo. 5. 1918.tLOQCADE.  A relaxation of  the blockade is being carefully con-siftered in  three direotions:-    (fi)  Th.e British Licensing Authorities ara re-examining the list  of goo da which may not be  exported from the United Kingdom.Prohibitions will be removed in esses where there is no good reason for &quot;rosintaining them on account of shortage or for military reasons.    (b)  The Associated &quot;Governments ore re-examining the variousrations for Neutral countries ana  the Allied Blockade Committeeare  drawing up a list of goods which my be freely imported by thenorthern  Neutral countries.    (o)  The Statutory Black -Listswill be revised and reduced. Itis proposed that the British  Statutory  List should henceforth onlyinclude firms of enemy nationality,  firms which have close aasociaition with the  enemy, banks or agents who have acted habitually for enemy account  In transferring enemy  credits  and firms or personsknown to  be covering  enemy transactions.      The  Allied Blockade Committee suggest  that,  for purposes oftrade in  the Baltic, Finland  should  be  treated as a Neutral country, and that  trade  in neutral  $hips between the northern Heutral coun-tries and Finland should continue without interference  subject to  -the carrying out of existing agreements  between the  AssociatedSovemments and the Neutral countries concerned.     The Corawittse suggest that trade in neutral ships  between thenorthern Heutral countries and Russia should be on tho  same  footing as trade with Pinland;  but that we should  (a) reserve the  rightto declare a blockade of fiassia at our discretion, ana   (b)  inti-mate to the Russian Government that trade with Hussia will only  be
  permitted  80 long as Allied oubjeois in Huasia are unmolested  and  so  long oa trade between Kuetila     Allied oountrioa is not  impedea,         The Committee do not think that sea-borne trade between  Finland and HUBa la  on  the one hand and Germany on the other, should  for  the present  be  sanctioned.   Vessels Carrying goods between  these countries  should bo seised,         The above proposals have  been submitted to tho various  Allied  governments  for consideration,         The Intor-Allied  Trade Committees at Christiania (snd 3took holm  have made  arrangements for  supervising trade  in Neutral ships  bet  ween Scandinavia and  Germany,  Supervision will extend  to cargoes  carried both inward and  outward,        .  DSN.   The Italian  Minister at  Stockholm has  suggested  that  in view  of  the armistice Allied  cooperation is no  longer  necessary in  con-  -  trolling Swedish imports,  and that the  Inter-Allied Trade Committee  at Stockholm should be dissolved.   The  French,  British  and American  Ministers at Stockholm do not agree with this vie?.&apos;.  It is still  necessary to control imports  into  Sweden owing to the situation  in  Germany and in BUBsi a, and  with a view  to  conserving supplies.  This control should be exercised jointly by tho Allied  Governments  and  any relaxation of the blockade of Sweden should be  made by the  Allied Governments collectively.JKIfi IQM &amp; BCB THKJ3H FBAHCK,  The raprovisionlng of Belgium and Northern  France is at present in the hands of the  Commission for Belief in  Belgium acting with the Gommlasi on Internationals  da Kavi tail lament.  The work  of relief will shortly, however, be taken over by the Inter  Allies food Council working in  touch with tho Belgian Government,  Competitive efforts  by individual traders to supply Belgium will  not be sanctioned  for  the  time  being.   The  cable  censors will .  continue  to censor cables relating to the provisioning of   the
Occupied territories of Belgium and Northern France on the same lines as hithert?.

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. Ships loaded with grain will shortly be available for diversion to Trieste. The Inter-Allied Food Council will, however, give no instructions for the ? of food ships to that port, until all the ?ustro-Hungarian merchant vessels have been placed at the disposal of the Allies and until the Austrian Authorities have given full particulars to the Council of the requirements of the various States of Austria Hungary, of the stocks available, and of the proposed manner of distribution.

A German Austrian Commission in Bern? have already furnish? some particulars touching the requirements of German Austria. They state that the present stocks of grain and flour and fat in German Austria will be exhausted  by December  ?1st. In Vienna and the principal towns the potato stocks are already exhausted, but the Austrian farmers are believed to have stocks sufficient to last ? until March. The Commission ? for 76,500 tons of flour per month, 8,750 tons of potatoes per week; 1,020 tons of fats per week and 5,000 tons of meat per months. They state that the distribution of foodstuffs in German Austria is now controlled by the Municipal Governments advised by special Committees representing seating all classes of tne population.

???. The Allied Food Council are prepared to as?  Esthonia with food supplies, but, before taking definite action, the Council require guarantees that a stable Government has been set up. The Allied council desire to exchange any foodstuffs which may be sent to ??? for flax seed, and timber. The Esthonian Government have been invited to appoint delegates for the Peace Conference fully instructed in regard to all economic questions.
