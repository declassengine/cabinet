The&apos; Minister of Reconstruction, after consultation with  the  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade, has appointed a Committee with the following terms of reference:            &quot; To enquire and report as to any measures which could be adopted with a view to securing that      &quot; manufacturers and others should be financially in a position to hold stocks after  the war, and that      &quot; reasonable safeguards are established to prevent serious financial losses as a result  of possible depres-      &quot; sion following on a period of great inflation, in respect of stocks of materials required for industry.&quot;    Tho members of the Committee are as follows:              Mr. F.

  COMMITTEE   ON   FINANCIAL   BISKS           ,                        ATTACHING  TOTHE   HOLDING    OF   TRADING   STOCKS.To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE CHRISTOPHER ADDISON, M.D., M.P., Minister of Reconstruction.sulphuric,    1.   We have the  honour to  submit our Report  upon the matters referred  to us.   The first  meeting-took place on the 14th  February,  1918, and in all we  have held thirty-four meetings and  examined  seventy-one witnesses.   A list  of  the individuals,  firms, associations and chambers which have  assisted us in our deliberations will be found in Appendix A  to this Report.    2.   The great industries connected with steel, iron, zinc, copper, lead and tin  have been very adequatelyrepresented, and the same  is true of cotton, spinning and weaving.  The timber and leather trades have alsotendered evidence.   In addition  to evidence  tendered by manufacturers, we have heard witnesses repre-senting  merchants, including some important firms with  experience in both branches.   Corporate  opinion has been collected  from  the following  Chambers of  Commerce,  amongst others  London,  Manchester,Birmingham, Halifax, and Huddersfield, and from the Manchester Importers&apos;  and Exporters-&apos; Association,Wholesale Textile Association, the Federated Forgemasters, the Federation of Master Printers, the central council  of Controlled Firms, the National Chamber of Trade, representing the distributing trades and retailshopkeepers and the Federation of British Industries.  The last named represents  about 730 firms, 120 largeassociations and about three thousand millions of capital.   Its official representative stated that the views hewas submitting embodied  in his opinion  &quot; practically the  whole  of the manufacturing thought of thecountry.&quot;    Other angles of view  have been  obtained from  the  Trades&apos; Unions, the  Labour Party, the  banker,the accountant and the   taxing  authority (the Board  of  Inland Revenue).    We  do  not claim itwould have  been impossible in the time to have heard  everyone; but we spread our net wide by acquainting allinterests through the Press or by letter of our existence, and we have refused to hear nobody.  In the circum-stances we have thought it best, in the interests of the State and the trade of the country, not to  protractour sittings.    3.   It has  been difficult, when surveying the  field of our enquiry,  to avoid traversing questions undermore detailed examination by other Committees.   Obviously  the supply,  distribution and control of rawmaterials and existing financial facilities,  are  matters which bear an intimate relation  to the holding of stocks necessary to manufacturers and merchants.  Those questions  are,  however, in the more immediate;province of two important Committees.  We have tried not to trespass on the fields of their labours, beyond what was necessary to a correct apprehension of the problem assigned to us for investigation.    4.   The great central  fact brought to our consideration is the enormous rise in the prices of raw  materialajid goods.  To quote a few instances from the evidence :                                                                   1914.         1918.  -&apos;-                                                               &apos;   s. d.         s.  d.

Mahogany, per sq. ft., has risen from hd. to 2s. Qd.t    We do not accept responsibility for the typical character of all these quotations.  They represent, onthe whole not unfairly, the movement of prices.    5.   No such rise as this has  been known in our  generation.    To find a parallel we must go back tothe struggles of Europe in the Napoleonic  era a time from which lessons may be learnt, although  the con-ditions of labour and employment were widely different, and markets had not become cosmopolitan.   times of high prices are usually  followed by times of depression.   And it is urged that such depression is the  morecertain and acute when the main  cause is  the ravage  and waste of war.   Without entering upon debatableground, five main causes can be adduced as likely to operate in the reduction of general prices. Insurance ofWar risk necessarily disappears,  whilst the carrying capacity of the world,  on  the restoration of normalconditions,  will probably be ultimately in excess of trade requirements.  This means  a lowering of  freights.Thirdly, labour on  demobilisation will be more plentiful than during the war, with the result that there willbe n  fall in wages compared with the rates  prevailing,  during the war.  Fourthly,  after the war, the demandfor military material ceases, and the country&apos;s capacity for production is switched on to the supply of staple commodities, now standing at scarcity prices.  Fifthly, if the wise recommendations of the recent Committee   (20648.)  Wfr. 34099-177. 12, 20,6,40.  12/18. D &amp; S.  Q.  2.
on Currency and the Foreign Exchanges obtain acceptance, there will be a &quot; steady and continuous reduc-tion &quot; of the increased  issue of Government Notes until an effective gold standard is attained:   To thesecauses may be added a sixth.   Confidence has a potent effect upon trade, and want of confidence reacts uponthe trader.   Bankers are fearful of lending.   Enterprise is timid of borrowing.     G.   For these and other reasons the trader of this country, expecting a fall in general prices, is reducinghis stocks to a minimum.-  His view, moreover; is  that wherever  high profits are now  being made, owing tothe rapid rise hi prices, they should not be spent or dispersed in any way, but held  over to meet what he regards as inevitable future loss.     It  has  been argued, to reassure the trader, that falling prices do not necessarily injure him.   Hegoes on  buying and  selling.   If he buys cheaper he sells cheaper, whilst the rate  of profit may  remainsatisfactory.   Undoubtedly there is  a measure of  truth  in this argument.    Much may be achieved  byprudent operations.   The  loss during a period of falling prices is certainly not so great as has been  put to us by many witnesses.  And the level of prices in the future is hardly likely to be as low as that prevailingbefore the war.  Yet we consider, on the whole, it has been established that this apprehension is well founded,and a considerable drop in present inflated prices is  likely to affect  prejudicially many of our staple  industries.In some cases profits may  merely return to their j*re-war level,  but in many  others there is  likely to beactual loss.     7.   A natural  corollary to this  apprehension is  that the trader should wish to take a very  conservativevaluation of his unsold stocks.   As he  fears future loss, he desires to carry over the bulk of  his excess.profits, and he urges that the Government share of those extra profits (80 per cent, plus the Income Tax onthe balance of 20 per cent.) is so great that the amount to  be carried over is wholly insufficient to meet the anticipated  losses which will fall entirely upon him.    Tlie bulk, therefore, of the evidence  before us has centred around  questions of taxation, which,  though not actually mentioned in our terms of reference, are inevitably involved in them.    The trader puts forward three lines of  possible relief:         (.1) Lower rates of taxation during the war.       (2) The Government  to bear a share (out of the taxes now received) in any losses after the war.       (3) A re-definition of &quot; profits &quot; now  chargeable to taxation, by way of the  allowance of special reserves             as expenses in arriving at profits, or more particularly by the adoption of principles  of valuing             stocks when making up periodical accounts other than those generally  obtaining in industry             hitherto, or admitted by the taxing authorities.    It is here necessary  to turn aside and make a brief examination of the principles underlying valuation.    8.   The custom of business is to ascertain the  result of its trading from time to time by a survey of its operations.   Commercial practice has fastened  upon a year as the most convenient period  over  which thissurvey  should extend;  and the  practice of  accountancy  has been to regard profits  (or losses)  as  arisingfrom the sales during this period.    Iii  an economic world otherwise constituted, traders might.prefer  to hold that the  profit or loss of theyear is the result of everything bought or done in  that year.  The ideal method of making rip the TradingAccount of the year might be to charge it  only with the cost of the goods  actually  sold in the year (correspond-retraining to. the sale prices credited in that year)  and to  carry to  a separate account all expenses relating to goodsnot sold during that year,  as in Suspense  on account of the next year&apos;s trading.  In  practice  this course is inconvenient.   No one can say when the goods unsold will be sold, and the&apos;profits are not determined.    The same effect however (viz., that of  confining the trading  profit to the sales of the year),  is obtained by a  contra-entry  representing the goods unsold at the end of the year.   As the entry for Stock which appears in a Trading Account is merely intended to cancel the charge for the Goods purchased which havenot been sold, it should necessarily represent  the cost of the goods. If it is more or less than the cost, then the effect is to state the  profit on the goods which actually  have been sold at an  incorrect figure.   From the gross profits resulting, from this account  fall to be deducted charges on account of the diminished value ofthe capital assets of the  business through wear and tear, &amp;c, actual or anticipated&apos; losses on debts and other expenses, which entail  some  periodical evaluation to get the net profit.  The general overhead working expenses are of course usually charged as applicable to a particular period of time and  fairly represent thecharge which should  be  made against the sales of the year.  From this rigid doctrine one exception  is verygenerally recognised on prudential grounds and is now  fully sanctioned by, custom,  viz.,  the  adoption of market value at,the  date of. making up  accounts,  if that value is less than the cost.  It is of. course ananticipation  of the loss  that may be made on  those goods in the following year, and  may even have  theeffect, if prices rise again, of attributing to the following yearts  results a greater amount of profit that thedifference between the actual  sale price and the  actual cost price of the goods in question.    9.   The ground has now been cleared for an examination of  the &quot; base stock valuation &quot; theory, whiclihas engaged much of our attention and nearly all that of our witnesses.   We will endeavour to state  it withfairness  stripped of occasional inaccuracies of thought and extravagance of claim.    Business  is a matter of continuity extending over a considerable  period of time.  Long and prudentviews are necessary.  Apart from the disturbance of war, the raw material in certain trades, and more rarelythe finished or partly finished goods in other trades, are subject to great variations  in value.   When  warsupervenes this uncertainty of values permeates further into industry.    Further,  advocates  of the base stock theory of valuation hold  that profits  made on selling Article Acannot be ascertained, with strict accuracy, until Article B, which was bought  to  replace A has  been sold.Similarly the profits  made On selling B are not ascertainable until article C has been sold.  The division of profits into  short periods of time gives illusory results.    In a.manufacturing business of a given  magnitude there will always be a certain quantity of raw material,goods in process and finished goods.   Similarly, in a merchant&apos;s business, there will be a certain quantity of stock in trade.  For convenience sake we&apos;wild  call these quantities &quot;the immanent stock.&quot;    The idea of the base stock&apos; valuation system is  to take this immanent stock at a low figure.   At the com-mencement of business  the  figure must be  the actual cost.  but so soon as normal profits accrue a portionthereof&apos;is devoted to writing down  the immanent stock,&apos; and this process is repeated until  a conservative,.&apos;and  sometimes  a  nominal, figure is &apos; reached.   Bankers pursue   a  somewhat similar policy.  They writedown their  buildings to perhaps break-up value&apos;; they take a conservative view  of doubtful debts, and theywrite down their holdings of securities to beyond the dictates of  ordinary caution.    The object  of  both trader and  banker is to stablise,profits,  though there  may be  a mixture of othermotives.  A bank cannot afford to show declining  profits; secret reserves are necessary against ivndisclosable
 losses.   A business does not like to exhibit its profit (or joss) to rivals.   Both,are afraid of undue greediness in shareholders or partners asking for larger distribution.     Everyone  will admit that good times should lay by for bad times.   Any criticism, therefore, of these methods is mainly directed  against the  form they assume.  Accountants, with  a  few exceptions, consider that  these practices  misrepresent the facts.  In  good times large profits are made.  If it is desirable  to make reserves  against the future, part of the profits realised should  be set aside as reserves and so  de- nominated.  If gpods have been bought for  50  and their market price has not  fallen  below  50  at the time  of striking a balance, it is a misuse of language and a travesty of fact to write their value down to  20 out of  profits  made  by selling something  else.   The correct  procedure,  it is maintained,  is  to  place the difference  of  30 to  reserve.   The other side retorts &quot; No, I always  require a certain  quantity of these goods; they are like my plant and buildings; and I write them down to a value which I consider will hold over  a term of years.&quot;   The accountants reply, &quot; Surely you get into a  quagmire of inaccuracy.  Buildings and  plant  and machinery have  recognised allowances for depreciation; your &apos; immanent stock&apos;  will vary with  the magnitude of your business.  Why make a prudential reserve by assigning a value to it which  is known to be at variance with market  value P  This stock is not plant,  but is destined for sale  and is being sold  continuously, and  referring particularly to the contention that the profit on  Article A  is not  ascertain- able until Article B,  which replaced it, has been sold.  We cannot  accept relationship between the successive sets of transactions.&quot;   And they add  that looseness of language leads to looseness of thought.  A capable manufacturer keeps his records  so that at every stage he  knows what his raw material and goods in process have  cost him.   The assignment of values to the stock which bear no  relation to  its  cost tends to obscure his survey.    The complaint is often made by  the base stock valuation school  that  an insistence on the system of valuation at cost or market value is really to force business to write up values.  The boot is on the other leg. No writing up takes  place when material is valued throughout at what it costs  or at  market,  whichever  is less.   On the contrary,  the claim to  value  stocks at a base figure is a claim to write them  down at the expense  of profits.    .10.  Before  reviewing generally the evidence or suggested  measures of relief, the Committee proposeto advert to the concession made by GoA-ernment in what is usually called  the &quot; While Paper.&quot;    There are two main concessions one concerns those who have employed the more usual methods of valuingstock, and  the other those who follow the base stock method.    In the first concession an allowance is made for the fall in value of stocks held in the last accounting period to the extent to which they are realized in the succeeding two years.  In the second the base stock method is recognised where it is  the practice of the trade.  It is more convenient to commence by examining the groundsupon  which this second concession is based.    There  is, so  far as  we are aware,  no statutory definition of  &quot;profits.&quot;   Mr.  Clark, the official witnessfrom  the Inland Revenue, in his evidence before us, referred to three cases.  The Sun Insurance Company v.,Clark, which went to the House of Lords.  Smith v. The Lion Brewery Company, and the Usher  Brewerycase.  In the first case Lord Moulton used the words &quot; we have it by our own reasoning and I think by theaction of all commercial men that the proper way  to ascertain profits  .   .   ...&quot;    Lord Justice Farwell in the second case said,  &quot;the  expression &apos; Profit  of a trade&apos; bears its ordinarysignification as used by business men in business.&quot;    In the third case Lord Loreburn  said &quot; profits and gains  must be  estimated on ordinary principles ofcommercial trade.&quot;  All these three dicta base the ascertainment of profits on commercial practice.  And  itappears that in the absence of a statutory definition the Board of Inland Revenue has felt itself unable tocontest the  base stock  system of valuation where it has prevailed.  As the  practice is repugnant to the views which Government and the majority of this Committee hold as to the correct system of accounting  (cf. alsopreceding paragraphs 8 and 9 of this report) this concession has  not been extended beyond the point of obliga-tion.  In all there has been about twenty-four applications from various branches  of industry to come underthis concession.   Fourteen have been rejected or not pursued by the applicants. In five the practice has beenestablished for sections of the stock and details regarding the others are in. course of settlement.    In our judgment  industries which have obtained this concession have established no further title to relief.They  will commence the post-war period with stocks valued considerably below their market price.    11.  As the  vast bulk of the industries of the. country will not have the benefit  of this concession,  it remains to examine the one which we have first mentioned.    The  witnesses who came before us as representatives  of industry considered  this concession unworkableand wholly inadequate unworkable because the physical  identity of the stocks sold cannot in practice be ascertained; inadequate as only  relating to one set of sales.  The Board  of Inland Revenue, we understand,hope to be  able to overcome the first  objection to  the satisfaction of the trader.   That is to say,  a businesswill not be required to prove that the particular stock sold is that which was originally held. For example,if the stock at the end of the  last  accounting  period was  .1,500  tons, and 1,000 tons were sold in the succeeding  two years, the concession  would  cover  the whole  1,000 tons, whether they were part of theoriginal 1,500 or not.   Indeed, the official witness went further.   He expressed the  personal view that if the sales were only 1,000 tons during the two years the business should be allowed to take the remaining 500 tons at their market value  at the end of the  two years, and date back this loss just as if they had been sold.    We consider it essential when effect is given, by the promised statutory  regulation, to&quot; the undertaking in the White Paper that these points should be clearly conceded.    12.  Whatever be the decision of this question; the claim that the relief given by the Government shouldbe continuous and cover more  than  losses occasioned by  the sales of the  stock held at the end of the lastaccounting period is really the crucial question for determination, and runs like a connecting thread through-out the evidence  adduced before  us.   We propose to summarise the arguments advanced in support of this claim:             During this war^there has been a phenomenal rise in prices.   As the cost of production  lags some-      what behind a rise in prices, capital  during a period of advancing prices makes  unusual and great      profits.   This has been indisputably the case during the war.   The great industries of the country have      been most prosperous.  Owing to the exigencies of the State immensely the greater part of their profits    ,  has been diverted to the National Exchequer.  After the war there will eventually be a very heavy fall      in prices.  Possibly the fall will not bring trade.prices to the previous level, but&quot;it will be-unquestiom      ably veiy great.   As the cost of production does not fall as  fast  as  prices, capital will suffer unusual      and  great  losses.   These losses capital will  unable to sustain, for the State has  absorbed the reserves      which capital would otherwise have accumulated during  the antecedent period of prosperity.
           Capital further adds that the action of the State has been altogether capricious.   Industries which      as a whole have been in the habit of keeping large undisclosed reserves by means of base stock valua-      tions have been allowed to retain  them,  where as everyone, in  these exceptional times, would have      adopted the same practice.  The limitation of relief to a few has given rise to a sense of injustice.  &apos;    13.  There  is,  we think, no complete answer  to this last contention.  The State has allowed the basestock valuation in certain industries only, because it was in  effect bound by existing case law tomake the admission.  It could not have done otherwise without  recourse to special legislation.   In all  industries,whether receiving this concession or not, it has left untouched and untaxed the reserves accumulated prior tothe war period.   On the main issue, the real reply is that the&apos;State must take its revenue where it can find it,and that in subsequent times of depression it  has no hidden cache from which to repay losses.  The State isthe tax-paying community.   If  the more prosperous of that community falls on evil times, and if assistancecan only be rendered by additional demands on the less prosperous, the position is irremediable.    14.   Is, then, the problem set us insoluble?   We do not  think we can usefully address ourselves to morethan a part of it.  There are certain to be some cases where  the drop  in prices will be very great.  If it isnot in such cases practicable to avoid grave losses by a resort  to &quot; futures &quot; and forward contracts, we think-that it is  undesirable to foster the presumption that businesses have a  claim in all  circumstances to be keptalive  by State aid.   Should the business  be of such importance to  the  country as to justify its sustention in face of all loss,  the question would have to be considered on  its merits as a thing apart from discriminatorytaxation.   Ordinary remedies devised  for normal cases would be unsuitable.    We are likely to be attacked in  another quarter for not suggesting  any relief to  those who pay no ExcessProfits  Duty.  Much  may be argued  in  favour of  a similar  right to assistance.  Our reply is that, in ourview, the  State is not acting here as  a charity organisation  society.   Rather, borrowing a simile from the cattle and poultry yards, it is endeavouring to keep in good condition its milch cattle and the geese that laygolden  eggs.     15.  We might also be expected to provide relief  for cases where a business  has denuded itself of itsimmanent stock, at the instance of the Government, to meet immediate needs.   Such cases hardly fall withinthe terms of our reference, hut we think they have an equitable claim for consideration, which is  best preferred to, and granted by, the department of State  to which the assistance was rendered,  and which can judge the merits of the claim,  u     16.  The more hopeful line of approach to a partial solution of our problem lies in a consideration ofthe present rate of  duty.  An 80 per cent, duty encourages extravagance,  for a manufacturer or merchantthinks  lightly of. increased expenditure when only one fifth of the increase falls upon  him.  Enterprise isdiscouraged, the reward being paltry.  Little margin  is left for renewals, development and capture of newmarkets,  to say nothing of reserves against bad times.   When we  put  any suggestion&apos; for relief to a witness,and coupled with it an alternative of a simple reduction of the duty to  60 per cent, or 65 per cent., we  cannotrecall a single  case where  he did not plump for (he reduction.   Indeed, if  the rate had been  left at that figure, little would have been heard of the base valuation argument,  and this Committee would  never havebeen called into existence.   We are of opinion that, if the rate had not been raised  beyond, say, 65  per cent.it  would  have been wholly reasonable to expect and require  that taxpayer^ should  furnish  from the balance such reserves as are adequate to meet the difficulties which this Committee is called upon to consider.   Andwe think that there is much force in  the contention of&apos; witnesses that  the revenue accruing from such a rate would have been little, if at all, lower than that obtained frflirrah 80 per cent. rate.     It is difficult,  now that the war is in effect terminated, and the situation of the taxing authority is -under review, to formulate any proposals, particularly when we are necessarily in entire ignorance of the intentions of the Government.   We prefer as a  remedy, provided it could be made  compatible with the current require- ments  of  the Exchequer, that the rate of duty, for the accounting period approximating to the year 1918, and now in the course of assessment,  be reduced to 65 per cent., on the understanding-:that the duty so given up is retained  in  the business, and  not distributed.  We regard it  as most  desirable that  the  position of business  should be specially strengthened, when entering on  the threshold of a period in which markets have to be reorganised or created, and  in  which  industrial  conditions are in  a high degree uncertain.   This  pro- vision would be without prejxidice to the concession of a  still lower rate for any future periods,  if the state of the Exchequer permits.  It is necessary  to add this qualification,  because, while the  reduction  to 65 per Cent, for a period that lies  in the future, entails no such loss of revenue as must follow a  reduction in respect of a period which lies in the past, and has been already under the anticipation of the higher rate, any material-reduction  below 65 per cent,  in  future periods, - though  beneficial  to industry, would,  in our opinion, undoubtedly diminish the  aggregate  yield to the Exchequer.     Such  a  reduction  for  1918 might well be accompanied by  a  withdrawal  of the  first  undertaking provided in the White Paper, for the latter was, after all, largely consequential upon the raising of the duty to 80 per cent.  -      17.   If, however, in the present  state of the National Exchequer,  the course we suggest is impracticable, and the actual cash must be available to the  Government, we recommend that a portion of the duty  now to he paid be  regarded  not as a final payment of tax, but  as a suspensory reserve, held  on joint account by the Government and the taxpayer.  The  portion so reserved should be represented for the time being  by a special kind  of  War Loan,* which would be so held for five years.  Thereafter this reserve would  revert entirely to the State; or, in circumstances to be set out below, would  become wholly or in part (with accrued interest) /the property of  the taxpayer.  &apos;      The advantages of, this scheme are threefold : -        1.  It affords tangible  evidence  to the  taxpayer of  a definite provision made by the State towards              prospective post-war losses..        2.  It fixes a maximum limit  to the Exchequers ultimate liability on account of such losses.  &apos;. !   &quot;3..  Capital experiences great  difficulty in the financing of its  business during this period of  inflated              prices.  Relief is at present afforded by excess profits earned, but not paid in to Government              until eight or ten months after the close of the year under assessment, and by excess profits              earned but not paid in  during  the running year.  The existence of this reserve affords valuable  &apos;&quot;         .  collateral security, for it reassures the.banker at the moment when anxiety is acutest,  i.e., when              profits are declining to  a critical figure.     1 ,&apos; ,.&apos;      We suggest that the amount of  this reserve should be 20&apos; per cent, of the averane excess of profits above  the  standard in the last two years under the charge to1 Excess  Profits Duty.   (The Chairman and certain                       * It will be necessary to consult the Treasury on the feasibility-of thd scheme.
                                                                                                       14 2                                                                                    ^                   O -i w                                                   7iiembera oi the Committee are of opinion that tins percentage should be considerably greater.)  When the.list payments of duty are being made, the scrip of the special war loan to which we have referred would beliven for the sum so computed, and ordinary tax receipts for the  balance.   The circumstances in which, as we suggest,  the reserve should not revert finally to the Government, buti-kolly or in part to the taxpayer, are as follows:     The taxpayer must $how, at the end of five years  after the war, that his average annual profits over thateriod are less than the amount of  the percentage  standard  to which he was entitled,  or  would have beenntitled, under the Excess Profits  Duty, and that these deficiencies have been connected with holding stockt falling prices (as distinct, for example, from bad management or reduced turnover), during that period.[e would then be entitled to relief to the extent of 80 per cent, on those deficiencies, and the war loan, withccrued interest, would revert to him for the amount  of that relief, but for no greater sum than the amountf the reserve.  For example: &apos;A company has an excess profit of  40,000 in the last two years, of the duty,r an average of   20,000.  In its final payments to the Exchequer,  20 per cent., viz.,  4,000, would rankj Reserve (under war loan).   Its profits standard,  for Excess Profits  Duty, was  15,000  (i.e., its profits  in  .1912 and 1913),  or, say,5 per cent, on its capital of  .100,000.   If,  after the war, its average profit is  12,000, it has no claim, evenliough losses have been made at various times by sales on a, falling market.  But, if the  profit falls  belowlie percentage standard*  (6 per cent, on  100,000 s   6,000), and amounted, say,  to an average of  5,200,  would get relief as follows: -                Five years&apos;  Profits............     ...     ...     ...   26,000                Five years&apos;  Percentage Standard...............   30,000                                                              .........    4,000                                                              ......     ...    3,200                                                            If, however, the  profits amounted, say, to an                                                                    ......   20.000                                                              ..........   30,000                                                                               10,000                                                                                8,000                                                                                4,000  It may be well to explain here why the relief proposed should not extend beyond 80 per cent, of the de-ciency.   It will be obvious that if the deficiency ranked for relief in full, a trader, who found he was likely topa claimant, would have no incentive to trade properly and keep his deficiency as small as possible, for the[late would bear it all.  We, therefore, consider that some incentive must be given him,  which will, in effect,trotect the State from such an abuse.1  18.  We do not  pretend that the remedy we propose with the limit suggested meets all the possible  or[respective losses on  a falling market.   But it is obvious that any relief must be limited  and severely  con-litioned  by the financial position of the Exchequer in the difficult years  following the  war, and by theliirderi that would be thrown upon other classes of taxpayers called upon to make good the charge  to theIschequer resulting  from the relief.  Hence, we cut out altogether from consideration  all  trading  concernslliicli, though  adversely affected by the fall  in  prices, still  make relatively good  profits, and deal onlylitli those which are genuinely hard hit over an extended period, relieving them to an extent which payslore regard  to  the paramount  needs of  the Exchequer than to the degree of misfortune  of the taxpayer.lay attempt to make the relations between the taxpayer and the State in  the matter of relief on a fallinglarket exactly parallel to and consistent with their relations in taxation during the war on a rising market,Inot practicable; and, if it were practicable, does not commend itself to us as in itself an aim to be pursued.fI 19.  We have had under consideration variants  of the above suggestion : -I   (a)  in the method of arriving at the reserve.1   (b)  in the grounds and  conditions of relief.I Under (a).   Granting the necessity for reserving a specific amount, other methods have been put forwardIr arriving at it in practice.                                      * I One method would compute the reserve as a proportion of the concluding stock coming under the duty,ft the ground that  a remedy for difficulties arising through stock  values  should  be closely associated  withml values.   The chief objection  we find to this system is, that the amount of stock with which businesses areRely to be left at the  end of  the duty will be very  variously affected by the war conditions, and someRsinesses will be holding practically none.   A second method would compute the  reserve as some proportionRtlie &quot; inflated values &quot; (i.e., the difference between pre-war prices and war prices) upon a &quot; normal &quot; stockReach business.    Such a method involves very  intricate and often impracticable  computations on  theRtounts of every business, and throws a burden of work upon taxpayers and officials which would, in the finalBttt, in a majority of cases prove to be work thrown away; for it would be devoted to  the  computation of aRsrve which.is not  effectively  required.   For these reasons, the suspensory reserve should, in our opinion,fca readily calculable basis,  such as the basis of actual excess profits suggested above. I (b).   In view of the  fact that the point to be provided for is the loss on stocks on falling prices, it wouldUratural  to direct the relief towards proved and specific losses from this cause.  It may not be difficult for aReliant whose materials are  unchanged  in character  from1 purchase  to  sale, to pick  out  specific  itemsRero his stock cost  a certain sum, and was subsequently sold  at a loss; but for&apos;a manufacturer using rawRtaials passing through various stages of manipulation the problem is much more difficult. &apos; The percentage standard in the case of businesses, not carried on by companies, is 8 per cent., but in the case of new businesses[iWsinesses where there has not been one pre-war trade year) the percentages are 9 per cent, and 11 per cent., for  companies andft businesses respectively.  In all cases the rates 9 and 11 per cent, apply to new capital introduced.[t In this direction the ingenious suggestion has been made to continue the Excess Profits Duty, that is to arrange to give trade in[times what hits been taken in good.  Indeed  this suggestion sometimes goes to the length of recomm3nding that the  rate forfaprofits be reduced gradually from 80 per cent, to 20  per cent., and for the recovery of excess  losses to be increased gradual&apos;yP2D per cent, to 80 per cent.  The State not having the purse of Fortunatus, would be in the awkward predicament of repayingp to ennty pocket.

We have had under consideration the point that some businesses, which have elected to adopt tilreserve  method, would find it undesirable to keep the  matter open for five years, and  would wish to close tlwhole transaction during that period.  We suggest that they should be entitled, on giving notice  within t\jmonths of the end of the third year, to take the average trading results up to that date, on the lines indicateabove, and to have a  claim upon three-fifths of the reserve only, bringing the matter to a final issue at tliapoint.   The same right would exist at the end of the fourth year, up to four-fifths of  the reserve.    21.  It is not possible for our suggested remedy to have application simultaneously with that promiseby the Government under Paragraph I of the White Paper; and  we should accordingly  have recommendtbut for one consideration,  that the latter be cancelled.   The Government undertaking relates to the  losses upoone set of sales, viz., of the stook in hand at the end of the Excess Profits Duty, without regard to the genenprosperity of the business in the long run.  It may well be that businesses  having a  claim under the WhitPaper,  on the faith of which  they are  now resting, will never even expect to be so depressed  as to conwithin  our proposal.   We therefore suggest that undertakings given in the White  Paper  (made clear, we recommend in paragraph .11) should  stand; but that each business should state, when making its retuifor assessment for the last period, whether it proposes to come under the White Paper, or, waiving all rigli^thereunder, to come under the five-year  war loan system of relief.  This election is,free  from the objecticwhich would attach to  an option after the event.    22.

In  signing this Report  we have  accepted the  position that  for the purposes of ExcessProfits Duty, Parliament has decided,  with a limited exception, that stocks must be valued &quot; atcost or market value.&quot;
     We feel that in general the effect of this decision has been to bring into account as profits,during a period  of especially heavy war taxation based on profits,  the provision made againsta fall in stock values, by firms and companies who have, for many years, adopted the base stockprinciple of valuing,  and  very  largely  to  appropriate the results of such prudence for  theservice of the State.  This has certainly resulted in hardship in individual cases, where a small number of prudent firms, who have observed this practice, have not been able to establish thatit had been the custom of the trade.     To maintain the stability of  trading concerns and particularly of Joint Stock Companies,we regard it as desirable, for the future, that all firms and companies so electing,  should be permitted to adopt the base price method of stock valuation, independent  of taxation; but theprices  must not be lower than they have actually reached &quot;at cost or market  value &quot;  withinthe trader&apos;s experience.     We are of the opinion that the base stock method of eliminating from trading profits  thefluctuations in stock values, is preferable to the creation  of reserves from profits enhanced  byrising  markets, and using up such reserves  against losses in  falling markets,  as the more accurate ascertainment, and  more equal distribution of actual trading profits,  over a  longer period than one year,  whioh&apos;  results from the method we  advocate,  stabilises the business andenables loan,  or  preference capital, to be obtained on better  terms.     Generally,also we are of opinion  that  the Report  does not sufficiently recognise the  un-doubted fact  that  the  annual or semi-annual profits on which the Excess Profits Duties islevied  are reputed and not real profits.   A subsequent fall in  prices may  prevent these  profitsbeing realised, and thereby an equitable  case for the return of a certain portion of the Duty is established.     We also desire to state that  if the remedy proposed  in paragraph 17 cannot be granted,then we ore of the opinion that the limit proposed as to the amount of the reserve in paragraph 18is too low, and that it should be at least double.     In our opinion it is equitable that  the State should make a better, though still inadequate,provision for the  losses due to the fall in stock values, the State having received much the larger share of the profits during the rise in values.  It is in the interests  of the State to promoteconfidence in the trader,  so that  he may devote his whole energy  to carrying on his business with enterprise and thereby give the largest amount  of employment  to labour during  thereconstruction period.                                                               t     A  lack of confidence, due to a  desire to minimise his losses on stocks taken at inflated values,and possibly sold later on at lower values, tends to limit the trader&apos;s operations.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office&apos; By DARLING AND SON, LIMITED, BACON STREET, E.^.
