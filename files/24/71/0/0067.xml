THE EFFECT IS THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY UPON THE  &apos;     j    Copy of a lettor from the Chairman of theRailway &quot;UompanTeT1  AsaociaTlon to&quot;the^rimTlfanlster ^THE RAILWAY COMPANIES1  ASSOCIATION,             8,  Victoria Street,  S.W.-1.                        9th December,  1918.     Dear Prime Minister,               As this is  the/first time they have  had occasion to     communicate formally  with the Government since the termination     of hostilities, the Council of the Railway Companies&apos;  Association     have asked me;  when forwarding the enclosed Resolution,  to     express to you their  great joy at the  complete triumph British     arms have secured.   It is a great satisfaction to them  that     British Railwaymen and British Railway organisation have aliket     proved fully capable  of discharging adequately,  and with credit,     the heavy taskfyon^hem by the war.               In sending  these Resolutions I am to state with all   &apos;  possible emphasis that the Companies,  if left  to themselves,     could most certainly  not have assented to such a sweeping re-     duction of working hours except under  a guarantee from the     Government providing  for the very large resulting cost.               I am also to point out that  the concession of  an     eight hours day added to the previous  concessions granted by     the Government while  tho Railways have been in the possession     of the State constitutes an addition to the working cost of     the Railways which, if continued after the resumption.of     normal conditions, and if unaccompanied by a corresponding     addition to charges,  would more than wipe out  all margin of     profit.               The Council submits that it  is due to the Railway     Companies that the Government should at onco clearly Indicate     their intention with  regard to the future of the Railways.                                  I am,                                    Yours truly,                                                                       11                                     (Signed  BESSBOROUGff,                                                ,   -  -     .....        I                   Chairman of the Railway Companies&apos; Association.      , IThe Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George,10-Downing Street, S.W.1.
9th December,  1918.        ho Council of the Hailwsy Oomoanios1  Association  having lournt that tho Government hava given fheir  assent  to  an eight hour day far Railwaymen m the United  Kingdom havo  resolved as follows:-  1.        While the Council are sinoeroly desirous  that       Railwayman should work undor roasonable and just  con-       ditions and should receive adequate remuneration,  they       feel hound to record that it is their deliberate  opinion       that it cannot bo to the permanent interest either of       the country as a whole or oven o* tho Railwayman  them-       selves that such a far rec-vChinp change as the  acooptanoe       of a general light hours&apos; day for Railwayman should hava       been deeidod upon h;  the Government without consideration       by Parliament, Railway Companies or traders.2.          The decision necessarily involves a great and       permanent increase ia the oost of transportation,  ul-       ready swollen by previous concessions and increased oost       of materials. Such increase, whilst causing a  serious       and far reaching reaction on the general trade of the       country,- must not operate to the detriment  of  tho share-       holders, since Parliament has fully recognised the       principle that increases in wapes cost should  be  met  out       of increased charges.  Tho proprietors are  justly entitled       to resume possession of the Hallways in u. condition       unimpaired as to earning power at the expiration  of the       period of control.3.          The Railways are of vito.1 importance, not only to       shareholders but to the whole community, and it is ossen-       ti-al that the industry should not he crippled.  It must       be clearly undorstood that action taken by the Govern-       ment since it assumed control has raised the cost of       operation to an unduly high level in relation to earning       power..4.          Copies of these Resolutions to bo sent to the Prirad       Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tho President       of tho Board of Trade and the Secretary of the Jar       Cabinet.
