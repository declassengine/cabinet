The week ends in complete tranquility, the Steelsmelters&apos;  strike  at Middlesbroughhaving been settled, and no other strike of importance being in progress.    The dispute in the cotton textile industry is the subject of negotiations.  So far asthe weavers are concerned, of the four points which they have urged, one, the maintenanceof the Rota system, has been sanctioned by the Control Board for six months.  Two others,including a demand for 50 per cent, advance in wages, have been referred to arbitration,and the last point, which deals with a &quot; fall-back &quot; wage, is to be the subject of a further conference with the Chief Industrial Commissioner next week.Sailors&apos;  and Firemen&apos;s Union.    This Union has afforded another  instance of indiscipline during the past week, in itsrefusal  to  convey M. Camille  Huysmans to France, notwithstanding the fact thatMr. Havelock Wilson had agreed to his sailing. M. Huysmans was finally conveyed ona ship manned by a  crew who were members of the Seafarers&apos;  Union.  The question ofthe similar action of  the Seamen&apos;s and E!iremen&apos;s Union on previous occasions was dealtwith in  this Report for the week ending  6th November, 1918,  and comment was madeon Mr. Thomas&apos;s speech on the subject which suggested the possibility of similar action by other unions against individuals of whom they did not approve.  Of  this an instancehas occurred  during the past week.  The managers of the Albert Hall  having withdrawnfrom their contract to let the hall for  a &quot; Herald &quot; meeting on Saturday,  23rd November,the Electrical Trades Union retorted by severing cable connection with the hall and thusattempting to prevent its use for other purposes on that date.  They  also threatened toplunge London  into darkness if the cable were repaired.   This is doubtless an isolated    (C 1554)
instance, but it is an illustration of the possibilities which might ensue if the action ofthe Seamen&apos;s and Eiremen&apos;s Union were to be followed by other unions in support of whatthey believed to be desirable policy.  Mr. Thomas was not exaggerating when he made thesuggestion  that if this method were carried on  to any considerable extent it would in-inevitably lead to chaos.    At the instance of the Ministry of Labour the managers of the hall have reconsideredtheir refusal and the &quot; Herald &quot; meeting is to be held.on the 30th instant,  The decisionto approach the Directors of the Albert Hall Company was arrived at before the cable wascut.                                 II.-PRESS COMMENTS.                                     (k.)-military/ty.      Military questions are now given quite a secondary position in the Labour Press.  The  &quot; Call,&quot; for example, is the only paper that refers to the armistice,which it casually describes  as disgraceful.  The &quot; Herald &quot; deals with the sufferings of our prisoners of war in Ger- &quot;many, which it declares to be entirely the fault of the Government.   It also publishes an  article on discharged consumptives by Captain  Donisthorpe,  who estimates that there  are at least 100,000 discharged soldiers suffering from tubercular disease.   He contends  that the pension is utterly inadequate and that the Government thinks that it can doom  the 100,000 ex-service men to the workhouse and thence to death by organised suppression.                                 (B.) Foreign Affairs.  Germany.     Warnings against interference with the German revolutionary movement are uttered  by  all the Labour papers.   The &quot; Call &quot; traces  the  parallel  progress  of Revolution in  Germany and Russia and welcomes the dictatorship ol the proletariat in both countries.  The &quot; Herald,&quot; analysing the situation, thinks that lack  of food accounts for Dr.  solf&apos;s  somewhat undignified appeals for help.  &quot; Justice  &quot; regards the Revolution as in the nature  of a deep-laid plot and refuses to believe that a Revolution which  can retain the services  of Dr. Solf and Marshal von Hindenburg  is other  than specious.  The &quot; Workers&apos; Dread- nought,&quot; in an article on New Germany, takes up very much the same attitude.  It gives a short resume of the course  of the Revolution and concludes with a  quotation from the &quot; Folkets Dagblad Politiken,&apos;&apos; of Stockholm,  containing  a bitter attack upon President Wilson. Russia.   The same issue of the &quot; Dreadnought &quot; contains a reprint (with some omissions) of Dr. Hagbert  Wright&apos;s article on  Bolshevism contributed by him  to the &quot; Contemporary Review &quot; for November, 1918.  The article, which appears to be well informed, endeavours to show that it is the constructive efforts of Bolshevism and not its destructive power that accounts  for its permanence.   Gradually it has shed  all  traces of bourgeoisism and the Western  nations dislike it because it represents  none of those commercial, industrial, agrarian and  political elements with which they  are  acquainted, but stands merely for the supremacy of  the peasant class.                                 (C.)- Home Affairs. General Election.    The views expressed concerning the  General Election show a not unwonted degree of unanimity.  The views most generally  expressed regard it as a scratch election which has been engineered by Mr. Lloyd George  in the hope of obtaining power for another five years ; that it was deliberately fixed for the present time in order to prevent the possibility of an adequate soldiers&apos; vote ;  that the policy of Mr. Lloyd George is in fact the old Tory policy, and that by his trickery he has induced a large section of the Liberal Party to join the Tories.  The remainder of this Liberal Party is weak and  discredited, and Labour is the only effective opposition.  Many of the papers are very bitter in their remarks, as for instance the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; which  at one  place alleges that Mr. Lloyd  George is attempting to build on the dead bodies of the men  who won the war a throne for himself. It is suggested in several of the papers that the reason for  rushing the election is  fear ofRevolution, and that it is in part a step to entrench the propertied classes against attack by the proletariat.  The  &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; thinks that it will be a disaster if Laboursustains&apos; defeat at the polls.   Nothing is better  calculated to drive  the masses of theworkers in the direction  of anarchy than  the triumph of reaction through the election.
                              III. District Reports. London and South-Eastern.     There is a continued agitation for an adequate  unemployment allowance at Woolwich. It is pointed out as significant that, for the first time in Woolwich, labourers of all grades have been admitted to  the  skilled  workers&apos; meetings.   This step towards  industrial unionism is said to be due largely to McManus&apos; recent activities in Woolwich.     It is reported that unrest continues among the workers at Park Royal,  especially at Messrs. Berwicks. South- Western.     It is reported that a strike is threatened next month at the collieries in the  Forest of Dean  because the  demand for a  reduction of  surfacemen&apos;s hours  is still refused. However, it is expected that, in the meantime, the  question may be settled amicably. West Midlands.     The Coventry and  District Engineering  Joint Committee  have issued a  circular of &quot; suggested New Working Conditions &quot;  to  Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Federations. These &quot; suggestions &quot; include a 40-hours working  week, a reduction of hours -to absorb all unemployed  if the unemployment  register reaches l\ per cent., a minimum district rate for skilled men of 120s. a week, and other clauses dealing with overtime, piecework, apprentices, &amp;c.    At  Birmingham, members of  the Discharged  and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers Federation are stated to be protesting against the &quot; rush &quot; General Election as they allege that thousands of soldiers will be left off the lists owing to the military authorities being ignorant of their exact whereabouts. Yorkshire and East Midlands.    It is reported from Leeds that the women discharged  from national factories are already  entering clothing factories and domestic service.  Nevertheless,  the N.U.W.W. is demanding that these  munition workers  should receive a fortnights  holiday pay to give them time to find new work.North-Western.    It is reported that trouble is likely to arise among the cotton workers in Manchester. Both 1*he weavers and spinners have  recently applied for higher wages.  The  spinnersare especially determined,  as they declare that the masters have been making large profits.It is suggested that if  the Government appointed the same  tribunal to  investigate this question as reported on the recent unrest in this industry, the men would accept theirruling, since they are believed to be biased in the men&apos;s favour.    At a recent  meeting  of the central  body of Manchester shop  stewards the general opinion appears to have been that if  the Government keep  a firm hand on  employersduring the reconstruction period the situation might be tided over satisfactorily, otherwise there would be serious trouble.    At a meeting of the Mersey District Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades federation the Labour Party Conference.     On the whole the Labour Press regards the result of the Conference as satisfactory.The &quot; Call &quot; criticises the Party as lacking in imagination, verve, and courage, but thinks that it took a tremendous step in the right direction by declaring its independence.   The&quot; Labour Leader &quot; demands the taking of decisive action immediately to  compel theLabour Ministers to  withdraw from the Government.   The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot;contains a long and bitter attack upon the  Conference from the pen of Sylvia Pankhurst.No one escapes her censure.  Henderson is played out, Bernard Shaw too antiquated, Clynestoo tenacious  of office, Thomas too anxious not to offend, Smillie is not strong enough,Robert Williams is too accommodating, while Sidney Webb is not worth listening  to.   MissPankhurst obviously belongs to that most unsatisfactory of all parties, the party of one.Revolution at  Rome.    The &quot; Call &quot; publishes an article entitled &quot;Now for the Enemy at Home,&quot; whichis an encouragement to Revolution in England.  The living flame of freedom  is sweepingacross Europe. The future lies with International  Socialism, but the Coalition is a mereunion of the capitalist class against the workers.   The paper urges  that if  Labour is tocontrol industry the workers of Britain must rise in accord with those of other lands,  andthey will soon drive  from the  field all the forces of militarism and predatory capitalismwhich  are represented by the Coalition.
on November  19th at Liverpool, it was resolved  to ask all districts whether they wereprepared for a national  strike if the full amount claimed at the next hearing before theCO.P. is not granted.    It was felt that  the recent  award of 5s. was unfair in face of the evidence given bythe men&apos;s representatives.    At the meeting of the Liverpool Shop Stewards on November 24th it was announcedthat the Mersey Trades Federation had asked all the engineering and shipbuilding centresto demand that peace-time wages should be made  equal in value to pre-war wages.Northern.    With the  exception of the  strike of the steelsmelters at Middlesbrough and of ,thecoal miners at Birtley-which are both ended no disturbance has been manifest in this district.Wales.    It is reported that the miners in the Khondda Valley are again agitating for a bettersupply of foodstuffs.    The  South Wales and Monmouthshire  Council of locomotive engineers and  firemenare stated to have passed a resolution threatening to  cease work within 48 hours if the eight-hours day pledges  are not  redeemed at the forthcoming meeting between the Boardof Trade  and the Railway Executive Council.Scotland.    No reports of unrest among the munition workers have,  as yet, appeared from this district.&quot;  The imminence of the  general election has transferred the attention of prominentagitators from industrial to political questions.                                  IV. Disputes.    The industrial situation remains quiet; no disputes of importance are in progress.(a) Involving a Stoppage of Work.    The Admiralty Labour Department reports four stoppages during the  week endingNovember 23rd.   In three cases work has already been resumed.    Two demarcation disputes involved stoppages ; one at Morrell Mills &amp; Co., Liverpool;and the other at Vickers, Barrow,  where 1,500 platers, riveters and anglesmiths. struckon  November 20th owing  to a  dispute  with the drillers.   Work was  resumed  onNovember 22nd.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that 18,090 workers were on strike and three strikesremained unsettled on November 20th.    The strike at the American Assembling Factory (Hollinwood),  mentioned last week,is now at an end.    A strike of steelsmelters was in progress during the week at Middlesbrough, in supportof a demand  on  the part of the sample passers for increased wages.  Work was resumedon November 22nd, the dispute is to be dealt with through the ordinary machinery.    The Coal Contro ller reports nine fresh stoppages during the week ending November 2j6th.In five cases work has already been resumed.    Among the strikes still in progress is one at the Lilleshall Company&apos;s pits in Shrop-shire, where the  men are claiming three full days&apos; wages for  the Armistice holiday.   TheCoal Controller allows only one day&apos;s war wage to be paid in  respect of this holiday.    The miners  at the Bedwas Colliery fMonmouthshire)  have been idle for several daysowing to the alleged unsafe condition of the mine ;  and they refuse to descend until itis reported safe by the workmen&apos;s inspector.    The War Office Contracts Department reports no strikes this week.(6) Not involving a Stoppage of Work.    No cases  are reported by the Admiralty Labour Department or  by the Ministry  ofMunitions.    The Coal Controller states that a stoppage may occur in  the Somerset coalfield owingto the demands of the examiners for increased wages and changes in working conditions.    In connection, with the dispute as to surfacemen&apos;s  hours, it is  stated that the mine-owners have offered to establish a working week of 49 hours (in six  clays), excluding meal-times.  This offer is now being considered by the Unions.    The Committee on Production heard 31 cases in London and 27 in  Glasgow during thepast Week.    These included (1) applications by the Electrical Trades Union  and the AssociatedBlacksmiths&apos;and Ironworkers&apos; Society in  Southampton for  wage advances, and (2)  anapplication for an advance of 15s.  a  week to boilermakers, engineers, joiners,  pattern-makers and blacksmiths in Scotland.
