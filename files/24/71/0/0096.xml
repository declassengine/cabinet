The Memorandum was put down for discussion at theImperial War Conference but at the meeting of 24th July itappeared that the Dominion representatives would prefer todiscuss it directly with the Admiralty.  Tho outcome was aMemorandum by the Dominion Ministers (with the exception of thePrime Minister of Newfoundland! forwarded to the Admiralty onthe  15th August last, stating -Ghat &quot;the proposals for a single&quot;Navy at all times under a central authority are not considered&quot;practicable&quot;, but adding          11 It is thoroughly recognised that the character of&quot;construction, armament and equipment, and the methods and&quot;principles of training, administration and organisation should&quot;proceed upon the same lines in all the Navies of the Empire w  *  x          &quot;For this purpose the Dominions would welcome visits&quot;from a highly Qualified representative of the Admiralty who. by&quot;reason of his ability and experience, would be thoroughly&quot;competent to advise the naval authorities of the Dominions in&quot;such matters.&quot;          &quot;As naval forces come to be developed upon a considorable&quot;scale by the Dominions it may be necessary hereafter to consider&quot;the establishment for war purposes Of  some supreme naval  authority&quot;upon which  each  of the Dominions would be adequately represented.&quot;          whilst  the Admiralty  do not depart from  their declared views as to what  would be the most effective scheme of naval defence  of the Empire, they welcome this expression of tho desire on the  art  of the  Dominions to  secure  the greatest Measure  of uniformity that  is  possible in naval  organisation, training and types of materiel throughout  the Empire.   Tho  pursuit  of. uniformity in all  these important  directions cannot fail  to assist  the realisation of many  of  the  objects underlying  the  Admiralty Memorandum.           I propose,  therefore,  if  the War Cabinet approve,  to accept  the above mentioned invitation of  the  Dominion                                            Premiers......
Premiers                by appointing Viscount Jellicoo toproceed early in the New Year to visit such parts of theEmpire as express a desire to be included in his Mission,  inorder to confer with and advise the Dominion Authorities on naval matters.          Mr, Hughes and Sir Robert Bordon, on &quot;behalf ofAustralia and Canada, have already expressed enthusiasticooncurronce in this proposal.  Sir Joseph Cook presses for theAustralian visit to be announced as early as possible, as itwould be very helpful to have it known in Australia.          Mr. Long has cabled to New Zealand asking whether that Dominion desired to be included,  and proposes to consultGenoral Botha on his arrival as regards South Africa.          It is thought that it would also be desirable toinclude India, and Mr. Montagu has telegraphed to the Viceroy toascertain his views.
