Yours very truly,                         (Sgd)  David Brooks                                  Lord iiayor.The Right Hon. Austen Chamberlain ii ,P.

City of Birmingham,     Lord Mayors Parlour,         The Council House.     6th December 1918.Dear Prime Ministor.          I desiro to call your attention to a matter which isof grave importance and which calls for immediate and sympathetic consideration.          The Government has repeatedly made promises to dis-charged disabled men that, in addition to adequate pension,they shall have such opportunities for treatment and training as their condition requires,          I can unhesitatingly say that in this city, so far astreatment and training are ooncorned, these promises are notboing fulfillod.          At tho present time the Local War Pensions Committee- is responsible&apos; for nearly 17)000 disabled men, of whom some 39$require further special medical treatment.  Such treatment isbeing provided for over 1,400 cases per month, oxclusive of thosewho may bo referred to their panol doctors.  Until recently theCommittee had to rely almost entirely on the existing civil.hospitals, alroady understaffed and over-crowded.  How thoy have obtained satisfactory accommodation for ordinary medical andsurgical oases at Lodge Road Hospital, and 50 beds for Orthopaediccasos at Highbury Military Hospital,     They havo, however, no provision for Orthopaedic out-patientcase8 beyond that of the  civil hospitals, and a scheme for thoocroablishment of an out-patient clinic which was put forward abouta year  ago is still under consideration by the Ministry ofPensions, although  the available building has been lying omptyfor months and tho matter is one of groat urgency.          Lion  suffering from shall-shook and various forms ofneurasthenia are referred to their panol doctors owing to  the inability of the Committee to obtain for them any special  treat-&apos;ment, though it  is  recognised by all who have had to doal  withthis class &quot;of case  that prompt and highly  specialised treatment is  essential to  recovery.  For Paraplegic  cases there is no provision  in Birmingham at prosont,  and a  small scheme which  isin  course of preparation  will owo  its  existence to localcharitable effort.   This  ought not to  be so.           It must be  specially borne in mind  that tho most acutestage of the problem of treatment  has  yet  to  come when  larger numbers of men  aro  discharged from the army.           As regards training, the position  Is  equally uneatle-factory.   Hitherto  men have not  availed  themselves  to any  largoextent  of  the  facilities  offored,  being  attracted by the highwages which  unskilled labour  could command in munition  faotori^o.How, however,  that  those  openings  have been  closed,  the men are-applying  in  large  numbers,  as may  be seen  by  a comparison  of  thofigures of the men who applied for training  during  the  monthsof  October and llovomber - 290  and 420  respectively,  an  increaseof  45  per  cont.   Tho figures  for December  will be still moro striking.   As  a rosult,&quot;the facilities which wore always  in- adequate,  aro  now strained to  their  utmost;   all the engineer- ing classes,  naturally the most  popular  in this city,  are  full,
and men are being refused in large numbers.         &apos; It must be remec.bereel, too, that Birmingham is thenatural industrial centre for tho West Midlands and has to pro-vide both for its ovm population and that of tho surroundingdistricts.  The pressure on the accommodation in Birmingham hasmade it necessary to close practically,  so far as tho outlyingdistricts aro concerned, all the facilities which have hither-to been available  In one &quot;neighbouring  county alone, some 60men are awaiting training as a consocjuence.          As a practical moans of meeting the most immediateneed,  we have already submitted a scheme to the Director cfTraining at the liinistry of Pensions, of which the enclosedletter gives an outline  This scheme, however, is likely to fall through, unless the Ministry of Munitions whioh hashitherto occupied the buildings, can be  induced to give preco-donce  tc the claims of the disabled men.  It has further been urged  upon me by some of the most important Technical AdvisoryCommittees in Birmingham, especially  those connected with thoengineering industries, that the whole of the facilities, work-shops, plant, instructors, &amp;c, which have hitherto been usedfor the training of munition workers whould at onco be placed at tho disposal&quot;of the Local War Pensions Committee for thetraining of disabled men.. Even if these steps are taken, theycannot do more than relievo the present  acute situation without-providing for future needs.  -          The problem of. the treatment and training of the dis-abled  man can only be solved ifi the Government replaces theexisting policy of parsimony and delay by one altogether raorogenerous, more far-slghtod, and more worthy of the men to whomthe country owes its freedom.                         -          Various schemes for  treatment  and-training have been/submitted to  the Ministry of Pensions, and  the difficultyappears  to bo in the fact that the Ministry of Pensions/ having no power to  sanction capital expenditure, has to obtain theconsent  of the Treasury  to  every particular item.  The result has been that urgent schemes,  which would to  some  extent havenot the  present  situation,  have been rejected or delayed.          Great  dissatisfaction exists,  not only anonget themen affected, but also  amongst the members  of  the  Local WarPensions -Committee  and  the  Local Advisory Committees,  Every- thing  possible  is being done  to allay  this  fooling of  die- - satisfaction, but the magnitude of  the problem now calls for immediate  and practical measures  on  the  part  of  the Government, otherwise  I  fear that  there will  bo  considerable  trouble  in the near  future  amongst  the men to whom  promises  have  boon made- for their  re-settlement, in. civil  life.                I  am,. Sir,                     Yours obedient  Servant,                  (Sgd)    David Brooks,                               Lord  kiayor,  .

BIRMINGHAM WAR

161 Corporation Street,

Birmingham.

2nd December 1918.

Dear Sir,

I am desired by the Local War Pensions Committee and the various Trades Advisory Committees to draw your attention to the present situation in Birmingham as regards training.

Up to the signing of the Armistice the training facilities fell far short of the demand. Since the Armistice the situation has assumed a seriousnees and urgency which brooks of no delay. Men who have hitherto found employment in munition factories and elsewhere are now applying in large numbers to the Local War Pensions  Committee for the opportunities of training which have been repeatedly offered to them by the Government.     At the present moment the Committee are quite unable to fulfill those promises with the natural result that there is evidence of grave and growing dissatisfaction among the disabled community in Birmingham and the surrounding districts.

The difficulty of finding accommodation has hitherto prevented the development of various schemes proposed. There is now an opportunity of obtaining fresh accomodation if the workshops which are being abandoned by the Ministry of Munitions are taken over by the Ministry of Pensions, but there is need for an immediate decision  if the opportunity of procuring suitable accommodation, machinery and instructors is not to be lost. For the Ministry of Munitions classes are being closed and the instructors have been given notice as from the end of the present month.

As an example of what can be done we have submitted a scheme for taking over the Engineering Workshop classes held by the Ministry of Munitions at the technical school, Suffolk Street, and its extension in Corporation  Street.

This scheme involves training in :-

(1) General Woodwork.

(2) Training of Transport Workers, Garage Attendants etc.

(3) Drawing Office Assistants. 

(4) General Scheme of Training in Engineering and Allied course Trades.

Each provides not only workshop training but technical instruction in Drawing, Lecture work, etc.

We very earnestly press for an immediate decision as unless the matter be dealt with promptly and adequately a grave situation will arise.

Yours faithfully,

(Sgd) T.H. Francis
