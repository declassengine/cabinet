/This Document is the Property OfHis Britannic  iviajesty&apos;5 Government.)SECRET,12.372REPATRIATION OF KBi&amp;t ALIENSaMemorandum  &quot;by the Home  Secretary,      I think that the time has come when the repatriation of civilianalien enemies who are in internment camps might be commenced.      It is convenient, so far as possible,  to carry out this process                                            done before the conclusion of peace, as this can  be^without question under existing  regulations? and the ships which are employed in bringingprisoners of war  to this country can be utilized for sending enemy aliensback to Germany.    I have ascertained from the Army Council that they haveno objection to the repatriation of these aliens, although of military age, provided that information is given to the War Office before any action is taken in respect of these enemy subjects  who are of interest to theGerman authorities.  In this connection the Directorate of military intelligence is in communication with my department.      I should propose to begin by repatriating those who are willing toleave, leaving any application for exemption on special grounds to beconsidered at a later stage.   The total number of interned aliens i3about 24,300, and it is probable that the greater number of these would bowilling to leave  at once.OAVE.17th December,  1918.
