*This  Doc[ the Property of152His  yMINISTRY  OP  POOD!.nent.)WORK OF THE MINISTRY OF  FOOD.    The attached  diagrams summarise  and illustrate the work- of the Ministry ofFood in respect of the four maiu items of supplies, stocks, prices, and rationing.    Supplies. The diagram compares^ so far as they can be ascertained, the amounts of the various principal foodstuffs available per head of the population in the UnitedKingdom, Germany, and Holland, in 1918 and before the war.    The shaded columns show the weekly rations in 1918, except in the case of breadin the United Kingdom, which is not rationed, so  that the column  represents actualconsumption.    The immensely better position of the United Kingdom in 1918,  as compared withthe principal enemy country and a typical neutral is clear.   It had half as much breadagain as Germany, three times as much meat and fat, and substantially more sugar.As compared with  Holland, the United Kingdom had twice as much bread,  three times as much meat, more fats, and practically the same amount of sugar.    The diagram shows also the extent to which 1918 supplies  have fallen short of pre-war supplies.  In  the United Kingdom bread supplies per head have actuallyincreased slightly; fats have fallen very little ; meat has fallen by a little over a third ;sugar also has fallen somewhat, but an exact comparison is impossible.   In all casesthe deficiency in 1918  on pre-war figures is far  greater,  both for  Germany and for    It is probable that even as it stands the diagram understates the advantage of theUnited Kingdom.  The British ration has  been an actual ration, whose  supply neverfailed.  This has not been the case in Germany, and perhaps not in Holland.    The maintenance of  supplies of course has not been in any sense the work of theMinistry of Food alone.   It has depended on the co-operation of many other Govern-ment  departments, in particular on the large  development of home production bythe Board of Agriculture and on the organisation of transport by the Ministry  ofShipping.  The  Ministry of Food, however, for their part, have built up  a world-widepurchasing  organisation, covering now every  food  of importance and  every source of supply.  This organisation  serves Allied needs equally with British, and carriesout the  programme of an Inter-Allied Food Council, but, at the request of the other allies, the bulk  of  the administrative work is performed by officers of the BritishMinistry of Food.    Stocks. The: diagram showing stocks of the principal foods at September 1st (thebeginning of the cereal year) illustrates in another way the success of the Ministry ofFood  in maintaining supplies.   The stocks which  two  years  ago  had fallen to thepre-war level (a dangerous point in war having regard to the uncertainties of transport)had,by September 1918 been built up again to a point ensuring safety for the coming winter.    Prices. These diagrams  show the coursja of prices in two stages ; one from July1914  to July  1917 when the  main development of food control in the  UnitedKingdom began, and the other from  July 1917 to October 1918.   For  each of  theseperiods the course of food prices is contrasted                      -       (a) with  that  of  the prices  of  certain other staple articles in this  country            (textiles, coal and soap);  and       (6) with prices in France,  Germany and Sweden, respectively]     The effect of the introduction  of price control from July 1917 onwards, is very marked.  The rate of increase for controlled food since that date is  one-quarter of therate before  then and is also very much less  than  the  rate for other articles and  forother countries.  If the  prices of such food had continued after July 1917 to rise atthe same rate as before, they would in October 1918  have stood not 115 per cent, but 150 per cent, above the pre-war level.  If they had continued after July 1917 at  the same rate as textiles, they would have reached 185 per cent.      The controlled foods included in the  diagram cover 94 per cent, of the total food expenditure, including every important food.      The keeping down  of food  prices  is of  course to some extent due to the  intro- duction of the bread subsidy.   The dotted line in Diagram HIA shows, roughly, whatHolland.A (33)7027  Pk600 12/1S E&amp;SA
would have been the course of prices if bread were sold now at its commercial  pricewithout a subsidy.  Though with this allowance the effect of control in slowing down the rise of prices is naturally less, it is still clearly marked.  The rate of increase in food prices after July 1917 remains little more than half the rate before then, and lessthan the rate of increase for any of the other articles shown.  To this result two distinctfactors have contributed one, the fixing of prices and margins  by the Ministry ofFood on a costing basis  in  this  country; the other, the action of the Governmentof the United States  and other  exporting countries in  controlling the prices  paid tothe producers there.     Rationing. The diagram shows the number of persons in food queues in London,before and immediately after the introduction of the London rationing scheme, for meat, butter and  margarine, on  February 25, 1918.  In the week before rationing1,339,000 persons were counted in queues in the London area during the six days.Tn the first week  of  rationing the number fell to 191,000 ;  in the  second week to64,000, and  in the fourth week  to 15,000 (including  queues for unrationed  articlessuch  as  cheese, lard, and fish).   Before rationing about  550,000 people stood inqueues every Saturday in London.  On the first Saturday after rationing the number was 110,000, on the next 24,000, and on the fourth Saturday under 7,000.     The effect of rationing was  thus almost instantaneous.   Similar figures for othertowns are not available, but the  experience was the same almost everywhere.  In mosttowns large queues for butter,  margarine  and meat developed in the first months of1918 or before.  In all they were removed by local schemes for rationing butter and margarine, or by the general Meat Rationing Scheme introduced on April 7th.     A comprehensive national scheme of rationing, covering meat, butter, margarine,sugar, lard, and, later, jam, to  be  administered  through the  local  Food ControlCommittees,  was introduced on July 14th,  1918.   By means of it every individual member of the population has in every part  of the country been assured of his shareof these  essential foods  at  controlled  prices and without the necessity for standing in queues.    It is probably no exaggeration to say that a large part  of the  population havebeen better fed during the war than at any previous period, because, for the first time they have been assured  of regular work and wages.  A number of luxuries  and subsidiary foods fruit, canned fish, sweets have been cut off.  The supply of essentialfoods, though reduced as  a whole, has been sufficient for all because it has been fairlydistributed among rich and poor.I. SUPPLIES.
