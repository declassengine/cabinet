The weather has been satisfactory and farm operations  havebeen carried on without difficulty.   On the whole conditions havebeen favourable for wheat sowing.&quot;   Committees havo issued Schedulesto farmers asking for a return cf the cropping proposed for  the ensuing season.  1.  Compulsory Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.      The Board have withdrawn in the following oases from posses-:sion of land taken over by them under Defence of the RealmKegulation 2M, viz:-   Stair  Glebe,         Ayrshire,   Oookrunning Mill,     Lanark,   Grass Park on Dunipace     Estate,             Stirling,   Grass Parks on Castls     MenziOB Estate,     Perth,   Tarland Golf Course,  Aberdeen.      In the first four oases the land had been taken over inorder to provide accommodation for stock displaced from farms onwhioh increased cultivation had been undertaken.   In tho lastcase the Board issued an Order on 23rd March last requiring  the cultivation of 20 acres 6f Tarland Golf Course but, owing to thedifficulty experienced in regard to labour and the lateness  ofthe season, the Board agreed to defer action until the Autumn ofthis year.  After careful consideration and in consultation  withthe Aberdeenshire District Agricultural Executive Committee, theBoard decided not to press for the cultivation of the land inquestion and their Order of 23rd March was accordingly withdrawn.  2,  Action under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2Q.      glntail Deer forest:t Roea^shlre.       With a view to preventing or reducing injury to crops orwastage of pasturage on the above forest, the Board have, with theconsent of the Secretary for Scotland, authorised certain tenants(or any agents acting on their behalf who have bsen approved of by the Board) to kill hinds to a number not exceeding 95 in all.       The tenants in question were allocated grazing land on the forest by the Board under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2M.  3.  Supply of fertilisers.       The Board have now considered applications and issuedlicences authorising manufacturers of Compound Fertilisers toobtain their requirements of Superphosphate for mixing purposes for-the period from December 1918 to May 1919.       The demand for Sulphate of Ammonia for agricultural usein Scotland during the December - February period exceeds thosupply likely to be available, which is estimated at about20,000 tons.   Supplies amounting to more than 14,000 tons havealready /
    already &quot;been allocated.      4.   ^j^eptjlp^          of Potatoes.

DEMOBILISATION - OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS.             The&apos; Board have boen informed by the Ministry of Labour      that the number of pivotal men to be released for agricultural      work in Scotland has now been fixed at 2,500.   This limitation      hao entailed&apos; a revision of tho lists furnished to the Board by      the ^District Agricultural Executive Committees, which is now      proceeding.   it is hoped that it may be possible to increase     .. the.number at an eariy date,  1;  -Record of Board&apos;s staff in His Majesty^ Forces.

Offtp e., Ac o ommodaJtlpn.         The question of office accommodation for the Board&apos;8staff has recently been the subject of conference between theOffice of Works and the Board.  The accommodation has at no time been satisfactory and at present the Department is housed in&quot;eight different buildings, some of which are considerable distancesfrom the Head Office at 29 St, Andrew Squaro.   After discussionwith the Office of Works it appears unlikely that a building canbo found in Edinburgh suitable for housing the whole staff, andthe Board propose accordingly to concentrate on securing that their staff be accommodated meantime in two buildings only, as convenient.:ly situated to each other as possible.
