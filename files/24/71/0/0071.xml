This Documentperty of telegrams-&quot;SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDON.ent  Any further communication on thissubject should be addressed to-   The Secrotary,      Ministry of Shipping,         St, James&apos;8 Park,  . - .   &quot; .    London, S.W.1,MINISTRY  OF  SHIPPING,12th December, 1918.          In  continuation of my letter of the 25th ultimo,  I  am directed  by  the  Shipping Controller to report, for  the  lnform-ation of  the War Cabinet, as followsFINANCE.          Since my  last report4the sum of  1,311,495 has been paidin compensation  for  loss of requisitioned ships, making a  totalcf  39,673,443 paid  on this account since the 1st April, 1918.RELEASE OF TANK  STiSAMBRS.          Owing to  the  cessation of hostilities and the  consequent reduction in the consumption of fuel oil by the Fleet,  theAdmiralty no longer  require the services of the requisitioned tankSteamers  hitherto  eu^-ed in the transport of fuel  oil,    Thetotal tonnage released, or to be released, from this  service is approximately 500,000  tons cargo capacity.          Other direct  Government requirements are comparatively small, and there is  sufficient Government owned tonnage availablefor their transport.          tfith a  view to restoring normal conditions in  the petroleum Trade  with the least possible delay, it has been decidedto release all privately owned&quot;tank steamers to their owners, withcertain reservations.    TheBe are    (1)   Sufficient tonnage will be retained to carry  theKPool Board&quot; quotas, until it is found possible to&quot;discontinue that body.G SECRETARY,WAR CABINET,
    (2)   The right to bring released vessels back  into          requisition is retained.    (3)   All voyages and charters  will for  some  time  to          come,  be regulated by License.         Owners  have been notified  of this decision.BRITISH SHIPS IN GBRMAN PORTS.         In view of Article 50 of the terms  of  the  armistice with Germany, providing for the restoration  of  all  Britishand Allied ships in enemy ports,  arrangements  were made  withthe Admiralty for three representatives of the  ShippingController to accompany the Naval Armistice  Delegation whioh hasprooeeded to Germany in connection with the  navel terms of theArmistice.   These representatives  have been instructed to take steps to ensure the quickest possible removal of all such vesselsas prove to be in reasonable sea-worthy condition,  and unlessconditions are such as to render this impossible, to claim thatthe German Government shall deliver them in the United Kingdom.The Delegation has now arrived  in Germany end the first telegramhas been reoeived from them stating that one vessel, the &quot;RUTLAND&quot;was expected to sail for the United Kingdom on the 7th instant,PASSENGER SSRVIOE TO NORWAY.         Since March 1917 a special passenger service underAdmiralty control has been run  between Aberdeen  and Bergen, thishaving been  rendered necessary  in  order to ensure regular communication with  Scandinavia  and Russia owing to the  neutral  lineshaving ceased service  in consequence  of the submarine menace.Since  the Armistice  arrangements have been made  by  the regularshipping Companies for the  resumption of their  services,  eonse-quently  a special Admiralty service,  which was  purely a  Warmeasure *  Is  no  longer  required and is being brought to  an endthis  week,  the  two vessels  employed  being transferred elsewhere.HOMEWARD CARGOES  FROM THE WHITE SEA,          The summer season for shipment to  and from Archangelhas now  closed and all British ships were cleared  from that  port                                                        on/
In addition the troop-ship previously referred to is expectedto load 700 tons for joint British and French account,  whichwill leave a balance of only about 200 tons of Flax stilllying in Archangel.          Throughout the season first priority has been givento Flax, but in addition to various small consignments  of miscellaneous general cargo and a certain quantity of Tar, thefollowing approximate quantities havo been lifted : -          Timber            9,757 Standards          Aspen            15,000 Loads          katch Splints       614 Tons          Plywood           1,966 Tons          Manganese Ore     2,305 TonsTONNAGE TOR COAL.          The serious shortage which has existed in all Coalexport Programmes since the Armistice, continues.   The cessation of hostilities has thrown a great deal more tonnage on to thecoal market, but the amount of coal available for  shipment is entirely inadequate for this ttonage.          This necessitates tonnage being sent away from thiscountry in ballast and ovor half a million tons has been sentaway in the last fortnight.   The loss this causes in Revenue                                                         to/on November 26tiu   One troopship has since  proceeded  to the mouth of the Dwina river with troops-nrgentlv^required, beforethe Winter, and the opportunity is being taken to load in herthe overlying balance of Flax, so long as the weatheTT^anialn^mild enough to permit of this being done with safety.    From nowjonwards the service to Archangel will be carried out by Ic^br^aiceT^which have been organised on the lines previously reported tothe War Cabinet.          The quantity of cargo brought from Archangel duringthis season is approximately as follows :-          Flax for Scotland       17119 tons           &quot;    &quot;  Ireland         5331  11           &quot;    11  France          6883  &quot;           11    11  America         5615 , ,                                 34,948 tons
                                                            fat O Mto this oountry is of course very groat.          The shortage is very seriously  felt in the ItalianProgramme .   It is estimated that up to the middle  of thismonth the shortage in the 600,000 tons Programme trill be over100,000 tons, and the loss of coal,  and stoppage of work at the ports during the General Election and the Christmas andNew Year Holidays, will it is estimated,  result in a furtherdeficit in the Italian Programme by the middle -J of January of something like 250,000 tons.          The supplies of coal to France  are still considerably below the programme figure, and it is understood that the Gastiorks in such important cities as Paris and toarseillea are onthe verge of being entirely out of stock.          The export of coal to South America upon which dependsthe working of the railways and meat works there, has of necessitybeen practically entirely suspended on account of the shortage.The United States of America to meet the  emergency, has agreedto furnish 70,000 tons of coal for South America in the next 6weeks,  and British Ships are being sent across to America toreceive it.   Even this help however, will not meet the south american requirements, and the position there Is likely to getcritical in the course of the next month.          Arrangements are also in hand to take some Americancoal for St.Vincent  for bunkering purposes, so as to save coalbeing  sent from here.          This Department is in communication with the Board ofTrade with a view to  increasing the shipment of coal to  london in order to relieve  the truck position in the United Kingdom.If this is carried through,  it will tend to get back the  arrange-ments  for distributing coal  in this country to something  like a prewar basis.AMERICAN TROOPXHG.
