All the permanent Deseeding Stations with the exception of    five are now in full operation.   Temporary breakdowns of    machinery have hindered the progress 4s several instances.    Important Deseeding Stations at Peterborough and Bury St. Edmunds    are not sufficiently advanced to enable operations to be commenced.                               Land Division.Small Holding copy-nies.         Holbeach.  Potato lifting has progressed satisfactorily during    tho week owing to m*re favourable weather, and providing the weather    holds good it ie hoped to conclude tho work shortly.         Heath Hill.   The Boil has been too wet to enable tho corn    drilling to be finished^ and manure carting has been carried on for    the greater part of the week.   The new minimum wage, viz:  39/-, was    paid to the horsemen and stockmen on the eoleny for work done during                                   2.
I   tho week.   Tho first lot of oattle havo bain brought into the yards,    14 heifers of whioh will Tie fed with the idea of getting them away    du r ing -^february ary,Tithe, Commons. Copyhold and Surrey Branch,  tfith one exception, all    applications for redemption reieivocl sinco the passing of the    recent Tithe Act have boon on the eld basis of 25 years&apos; purchase    of tho par value of tho tithe rentcharge, tho applicant landowners    and their legal advisers being apparently unav/aro of the roduoed    terms on which redemption may be effected under tho now Act,   As    a result however of a prese Notice issued by the Board on the 7th    instant, numerous requests have been received for information    regarding the provisions of the Act, including several from large    public bodies.   Judging from these enquiries thore is every    reason to oxpeot a large number of applications as soon as    landowners and their advisers become better acquainted with the new    Act,   Further stops are being taken to make known its previsions.Kelham Estate,   with the exception of 30 heifers-in-calf almost all the    cattle are now in tho yards.   About 45 will bo fattened out    during the next two months and the rest carried on with a diet of    hay, straw and roots of which we have plenty,   None of tho sheep    are having artificial ftcd as yet but^shortly the whole lot will be    having roots,               arming in December with labour in  its present unsettled    state, together with tho wet days, is not as satisfactory as it might    be.   The late spell.of frost has given way to weather of the    dirtiest and darkest typo, which is usual at this time of the year.    In the ordinary way with the main farming operations cleared up, the    loss of a certain amount of time through darkness in the early    morning and late evening is little thought of and efforts are    somewhat relaxed, but owing to the nature of the work being oarried    on here and the heavy winter1s programme we have to face, the    darkness and mud proves disconcerting and tends to upsot    calculations.   Sickness is still very prevalent at Kelham,  Whether    it is duo to the epidemic, defeotive drainage or part pressure of    the work cannot for  ths moment be ascertained, but it is oausing    groat anxiety.              The last week has beon devoted to threshing with  our    cm tackle, and 52 quarters of wheat, 170 quarters of oats, and 15    quarters of barley have been threshed so far,  inoluding tho moves    from farm to farm.   The oats have beon sold  for seed at 68/- per    quarter and the wheat at Government prioe,    A large quantity  of    wheat-e$,raw is being offorod to tho Local Government Vuyer,                           Statistical Division.         Statistical Branch.   A formal letter has been sent to the    Treasury asking sanction for tho transfer to  this Department  of the    work of oollecting the annual Agricultural Returns.   The  scheme    proposed  involves the increase from 220 to some 330 in  the  number  of    Crop Reporters, who  vculd thus  occupy a more  important  cffiodal    position,  being rosponsible for the collection of the annual    returns of acreage and live stock,  of tho estimates of produce  of    crops, and of monthly reports  on agricultural conditions generally,I   v/hile they would be  Called upon to  answer  inquiries on  subjects  ofI   Bpooial  interest from time to  time.   Tho  soheme further contemplates    that Reporters would ultimately deal with claims under  Part I,  of    the Corn Production  Act, 1917.   A  Conference with representatives of    the Customs and Exoise,  and tho Scottish Board of Agriculture  (vhc    propose to adopt a similar  scheme) has been hold.               The  &quot;Monthly Agricultural  ReportH was  issued  on  tho  7th    instant.   Autumn cultivation is upon  the whole  rather moro backward                                  3.
than last yoar, and tho reports indicate that b% to W/9 loea ifheeihas &quot;boon awn than on December 1st last year.          A mooting took place at tho Board of Trade on tho 6thinstant, to oonsider arrangements for the holding of a oonforonoo ofthe statisticians of the Empire next year, in aocordanoe with thorocommendation of tho Imperial War Conference.   A provisional programme for the proposed conference waB agreed, and invitations tothe Dominions, India, and&quot; the Crown Colonies will be sont out.     Agricultural Wages Board,  During last weok 68 new oases ofoomplaint were received,&apos; the largest numbor from any singlo countybeing 12 in the case of Somerset;  23 cases cf complaint were sentto the Inspectors for visit;  onquiries by correspondence were made in104 oases;  and 18 cases wero completed.   Reports were reoeived fromInspectors in 15 cases.   Throe additional Inspectors have oommenoodwork this week, one being a whole-time Inspector, the other twobeing part-time Secretaries of District Wages Committees who willgive half their time to inspection work.          No meeting of the Board or of any of tho Committees of theBoard has been held during the woek and there is nothing of special interest to report in oonneotlon with administration.    Report of the Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and         Fisheries and tho Ministry of Pood.                                                                   *          The Deputy Director met in Conference tho Joint Committee1eRepresentatives of Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire at Aberystwythand Havorfordweet reepectively.   At both Conferences the unsatisfactory nature of the distribution of feeding stuffs incertain districts was much emphasised.   Steps havo since boon takenby the Ministry of Food, on the representation of the JointCommittee, to remedy this state of affairs.          It was farther reported that jnilk was being converted intobutter owing entirely to lack of faoilities of transport to convey the milk to tho nearest railway stations.   Action has also beentaken with regard to this.          The ordinary business of the Joint Committee is proceedingnormally.   Certain leaflets are undergoing revision onthg it the changing policy of various Government departments, and thepublication of the &quot;Weekly Notes&quot; is proceeding on more regularlines, the difficulties met with formerly having boon satisfactorilyovercome.                          Ordnance Survey.          During  the week maps wore despatched as follows      Overseas  .....   26,640          War Offioe .....  3,109      Air Ministry ..   14,894          Other Services..    835      Admiralty .....    3,248                       iSstabliBhment Branch.          It will now be neoessary to deal with many questions arising by reason of tho demobilisation and return to sivil duty ofthe men bolonging to the Department who have  teen on aotive service.It will be neoeBsary to review the position of each Branch as regardsthe work  it is doing and the temporary or substitute staff whioh itemploys, and to re-establish a suitable permanent staff to moet thoneeds of a new organisation.
          Ono of tho groatest hindrances will &quot;be the difficulty ofsuitable iffice accommodation to which special roferonco haB &quot;beenmade in previous reports.   Whilst the Board continues to be housedin sc many buildings distant from one another, it will be difficultyif not impossible, properly to staff the Department on a permanent basis, and in any case tho working efficiency of tho Department as awhole must be seriously affected.   It is not easy to say how themen as they return are to bo adequately accommodated in someDivisions.   Some time must elapse before the Board may be in aposition to make any substantial reduction in the numbers of thetemporary staff owing to tho many changes and additions to the workwhioh havo ocourred during tho War.Secretary.12th Deeember, 191S.
