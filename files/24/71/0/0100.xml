 (This DocurwentjBjhe PropertLgl^^^^  ^-    -                                37b    MAINTENANCE OF C^SORSHIP.a      I  circulate  to  the Members of the War Cabinet thefollowing memorandum which has been prepared in the$ioard of &quot;Trade.                              A .H. STANLEY. December 17th,  1918.          Memorandum prepared  in the Board of Trade,    The Board of Trade  recognise that  the maintenance of ttecensorship may well be  necessary during the period whichi will-elapse before Peace is  officially  concluded.    During thisperiod the blockade of  enensv  countries is to be maintained and we recognise that for the  maintenance of the blockade a thorough examination of cables and letters is,probablynecessary.    There is  no doubt that  the censorship hafiproved a valuable weapon in detecting  attempts at evadingthe blockade in the past and the conditions &quot;which at presentprevail are not substantially  different from those prevailingduring the period of hostilities.   But any suggestion for maintaining the censorship after the  conclusion of peace inthe period of reconstruction could, we think, only bejustified by the strongestpes;ible-cFurr.rnt^ultis just duringthis period that traders in this country will nave to  takethe most energetic steps to get back to normal tradeconditions and anything which will interfere with theirregular channel of communications  v/ill be a serious obstacle to such activities.     The censorship involves the holding up of telegrams fordays even for an entirely unrbicseeable number of days, and increases the expense as well as the normal delays  ofbusiness.     The conclusion of the General Staff in their iiemorandum(G.227) would seem to bo that in any case the maintenance  ofthe censorship of letters after the war would present almostinsuperable difficulties and a censorship of cables alone  could hardly be effective for any of the prfeoses for which acensorship is designed.    It will be been from the memorandum that the possible uses of the censorship after  the  war arem connect  on with 1. the control of foods and  materials                   2. the rationing of neutrals, and                   3. the control of finance.    As regards the first,  four articles are mentioned whichare controlled by the Board of Trade,  viz- Meat  CoalTimber and Gotten,  and in none of these cases have  thoseconnected with the control asked for tho  continenceTthe                                               oensorshi?)/
 censorship.    On the  other hand those connected with the control of tte  cereals,  oil-seeds and wool appear to deprecate its  discontinuance.      We venture  to think that  this  is due to the fact that the  controlling authorities in theso cases aro not  so Much  in touch with general trade interests as in  the other casos of Board of Trade controls and that they have therefore not given the same weight-to the objections to the continuance of the- censorship which  bulk very largely in our eyes.      As regard?rationing  we are  convinced at the Board of Tirade that rationing   of neutrals could not be continued  after the war  is over so that this ground for  the maintenance  of the censorship disaooears.      As regards  financial control it must be admitted that the enforcement  of Defence of the Realm Regulation 413). will be  very difficult with- out  a Censorship  and that the carrying out of tho Clearing House system for  the  settlement of debts (if that system is adopted) may  also be prejudiced if private communications on the subject aro allowed to pass uncensored;  but it is very doubtful whether Regulation 41D  could it3elf be maintained after  the war  in face of what is bound to be  a very strong public  foeling against it..   In  , any case the control under this Regulation is bound to be  relaxed and it may be sufficient to rely on the  existence of the Regulation without a strict check which the censorship would supply.   ,  On the whole it  does not appear to  us that the If  norandum of the  General Staff gives sufficinet reason  for the continuance of the Censorship beyond the actual conclusion of peace.     We  have not  been consulted offia ally on any aspect  of the que-stion except in regard to its bearing  on import and  export restrictions and  in this case we definitely take the view that  we could not press for the retention of the Censorshipbeyond  the conclusion  of  Peace.
