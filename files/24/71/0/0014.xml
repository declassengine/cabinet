To  go  further than this would, in my opinion,  give rise           to  bitter criticism of tho Government on tho ground.           that  it  was perpetuating conscription,
   7.*With reference to Lord tlilnor^s memorandum(G.T.6368) in which- it is proposed LO carry men nowbeing released for civil work to a now section of thereservej  &amp;o statement is made of the grounds on whichit is proposed to depart from the procodu.ro which hashitherto prevailed in such cases,  Unloss for some reason not stated it is absolutely necessary to abolish the sections to which released men have hitherto beencarried, it would appear on every ground to be more convenient to continue tho existing practice.-                                 C * Addison *                                          29th November,1918.
