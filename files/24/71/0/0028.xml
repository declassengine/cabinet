INVALID SOLDISRS.             Memorandum by Mr. Austen Chamberlain.                         (W.C.502 Minute 6.)      As a result of the meetings&quot; held under my chairmanshipand of the Papers circulated to ui, I decided yesterday toreport the following conclusions to the War Cabinet      (l)  That it is clear that the Pensions Ministry           is not at present in a position to deal with           the large number cf discharged soldiers likely           to require treatment&quot;in the course of the noxt           few months.      (2)  That the transfer from the Military to the           Pensions Authorities cf the duty of dealing           with these men can only be gradual and must           depend in part upon the $repress made by tho           Military Authorities in setting free civilian       ;    practitioners and in releasing hospitals and          , beds.      (3)  -That the Army is the only body, that has the           necessary staff; accommodation and organisation           for dealing&apos; with immediate and proximate needs.      (4)  That the Army should therefore, remain responsible           for the treatment of discharged and re-admitted           men for a period of six months^ subject to the         -  transfer meanwhile, and from time to time, of           any portion of the duties which the,.Pen3ions           Ministry may be in a position t* undertake.      (5)  The Army will not discharge a soldier from           hospital till he ceases to require in-patients           treatment according to the ordinary standards           in vogue in civil hospitals.      (6). That the Pensions Ministry should at .6nse prepare           a detailed scheme of organisation for the reception.          - and treatment of discharged men showing           (a)  To what extent such treatment must be given               .,; in their homes by  loeal medical practitioners                and what arrangements they propose for                 securing this: treatment.,           (b)  %at provision they require for the more                 serious cases and  in&apos; what iplaces-           (c)  How much of this, accommodat ion can be                 obtained in existing hospitals, whether                Military or Civil  and what new.buildings  or   \                institutions must be created for them,  x   The period  of six months is taken as being approximately      the time which may be expected to elapse before the      signature of peace.
- 2 -            (4)   &quot;What  propoBals  they would make  to  secure                * that  special skill  shall  be  available  in                 pases where special skill is required.            (e)   Any other proposals which they  have  to                 make  in order to  secure that proper  treat-                 ment  ie available for all discharged men.      In making  these  proposals  the  Ministry  of  pensions should give where possible an apprbximate  estimate  of theexpenditure for  which  Treasury sanction is required.      On the signature of peace,  the power of the MilitaryAuthorities tc  commandeer buildings and beds and to  retainsoldiers cease3.   The&apos;Ministry of Pensions have no powerto do either. The Military and Pension Authorities will therefore meet in Conference some  time before that  date toconsider whether any further powers  are required and  will report their conclusions to the \rar Cabinet.   They willalec report as to the progress made with the acquisitionof accommodation hy the Ministry of Pensions  and as to the times at which the Minietry can take over the duty ofproviding for discharged men.      These proposals were accepted by the two departments and the Adjutant*General and General Goodwin  the Directorof Medical Services undertook to give effect  to thorn, as faras the War Office is concerned.  Puller notes of the proceed-ings will be circulated to the Committee later.(Intd.)   A. C2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.,      December 4th,  1918*
