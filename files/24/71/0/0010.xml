35FOOD SITUAIIOH IB QmjtW&amp;     I circulate a memo ran dura on the food situation in Germany, which lias been prepared in the Ministry of Labour.                         (Signed) (Jeo. H. Roberts.Ministry of Labour,    8 * 11.18.
       Those who have  closely followed the aocountc of food- conditions in Germany, harvest prospects, and reports on the avail- able  supplies of  other foodstuffs published in the German ProseIdu::ing  the last six  months may be forgiven if they are unable to*unleratauad how Germany, which has always prided herself on her genius  for organisation, has come to what&apos;&quot;Is practically the end of her  food resources within a few days after the conclusion of the Armistice, and is in danger of starvation unless supplies are at once poured in by the Allied,   Ho one, of course, supposes that  a  condition  of  plenty refcgns in Germany, any more so than in Prance  or Great Britain, but -the reports in the press - often beead on official statements - would certainly have led us to conclude that with due economy the German people were in no immediate danger  of  an/thing like starvation.   Granted that the supplies of fats and flesh were probably limited, we know that the acreage under cereals has grown in extent etsery year since the war began, and the harvest reports have been almost unanimous in declaring that the cereal crops are from 15 to 20 per oent. better than last year1a;  several declare that the harvest is the beat since the commencement of hostilities;   and one or two say it has been the best harvest in Germany for decades.      Even if we discount some of the optimism on the ground that patriotism demanded  that journalism should do its utmost to encourage the nation and stiffen the will to resistance, the follow- ing quotations ranging from May to October, 1918, can hardly leave us in doubt that in regard to the grain harvest, at all events, Germany is much bettor off than she was a year ago:- Bread, Corn ft Cereals.      ;:oniglicher Oekonomierat oohiftau-Lindow states in the IColnische Zeltung (26th May,  1918) &quot;that the harvest prospects in Germany are in general very promising.....Early sowing will compensate to a large extent for tho lack of artificial fertilisers ...... Rye has come through the winter well on medium and good soils, while on light soils it is mediocre but never- thelese -far better than last year.   Wheat promises an excellent harvest, although this grain in particular has to suffer from the shortage of nitrogenous fertilisers.   Oats and barley have oome up well everywhere.&quot;      The munich Ileuestp Naohrlchten (30th May, 1910) writes -&quot;The reports agree in representing the  oondition of the crops of rye and&quot; bread-corn as, in general, excellent,   landowners declare that the orops have not been bo good for fifteen years.&quot;      The Frankfurter geitung (3rd August, 1918) publishes a privaTe Eelegram from Berlin with regard to the supply of bread- corn - &quot;By the ingathering of tho new harves-t, all doubts have been removed as to whether Germany had sufficient supplies of .bread-corn.   The granaries of the Imperial Corn Board already&apos; contain far more than will be required during the next fe** weeks. In spite of last $ear&apos;a bad harvest, Germany has succeeded (thanks to strict control of supplies)  in safeguarding the bread supply of the Army and of the civilian population, and.that too in spite of many unfavourable contingencies.&quot;      The munich Eteueste Hachrlohton (23rd August, 1918) states that &quot;The harvest in the tfurteiaberg lowlands is for the most part already ended.   From many localities it is reported that so fine a harvest has not been seen for decades past.&quot;   The same paper                                                &apos;  / (24th August
 p:4th August, 1918)  says that &quot;aooording to  the  prollrninary estimates of the Imperial Corn Office  the  total  harvest  Jrield will fce,  about 10 to 15 per cent,  hotter than  the  yield of  last  year.&quot;      A writer in the Deutsche 71rtschaftsseitunfi (let September, 1918) say a - &quot;Tho proJpecTs  of the harvest are not bad,  oonsider- ing the lac): of manures and  the difficulties  of  delivery.   Talcing everything into account it will be the beat harvest we have had during the war.&quot;      The lleue Froie  ?re8Be (8th lieptember, 1918)  spealcing  of the HungarianTiarveet writes - &quot;Pessimistic  reports  of the corn harvest in Hungary -were circulated juat  before reaping,  but the actual result showed a good  average harvest in all kinds of grain/ and a considerable improvement  on  last year&apos;s 02op, especially in barley and oats.&quot;      The Bavarian Minister of the  Interior is reported in the munich Ileuesta Nachriohten (13th September, 1918) as having stated thaT &quot;The bread-corn  harvest oan  be described, on the whole,  as a good medium harvest, and is  in any case better than last  year&apos;8.    The barley  crop  is  to all appearance good.   The late  potato crop will  not  provide  the  great yield  of  last year, but nevertheless promises  to be good if  only the weather improves to  some extent.    The  fodder harvest,  particularly in the case of oat&amp;,  in better than  last  year.    The  important late vegetable orop  is oertaia to be  good,  but the same unfortunately is not true of  fruit,  which yielded such an adundant crop in 1917.&quot;      The  munich  Noueste  Hachrichten  (19th September, 1918) states  that. &quot;The  Imperial  Chancellor,  in the course of his  reply to the  Memorandum on Food  iiupply Conditions drawn up by the Social  Democratic  Party and  the  General Committee of Trade Unions, said  -  *The food  condition,  in  the  past economio year, has un- doubtedly been  better  than in the preceding year.  In the new economic  year  it  will  not  be less  favourable.  The supposition that  the  reduction of  bread  rations will be permanent is not correct89*      The  lorddeutsohe  Allgemeine  zeitung.(27th September, 1918) contains  a semi-official review of  German&apos;food supply prospects for the new harvest year in  the  course of which it is stated that &quot;The  yield  of bread-corn,  according to preliminary estimates is 15 per  cent, better than last year, and this increased yieldwill  certainly be  brought  in.   Accordingly the old bread-rationwill be allowed  as from 1st.  October.&quot;     -Dr. Heim, the Bavarian  specialist on food policy, declared in an interview, reported  in the Berliner Tageblatt (3rd October, 1910) that  &quot;according  to his information the yiell of the grainharvest  in  1918  is greater than that of 1917,   Summer grain is particularly  good,  and  the produce of barley and oats markedlyhigher.    The  1918 harvest is a good one and Dr. Helm hopes that  those  who are managing  the  nation13 food policy will not robthe German  people  of the harvest&apos;s blessings.&quot;      On the 19th  October,  1918,  the munich Hgueste flaohriohten re-oorted  that the  War  Pood Ministry had announced that &quot;the deliveries  of broad-corn,  barley and oats up to the 17th October, despite  the delayed harvest  and other difficulties, had exceeded the deliveries up  to the same date  last year by 695,484 tons; and the  Quantities of  potatoes  delivered to the authorities by the landowners  so  far  are  considerably larger than can be despatched  to the  towns  under e::istine transport condition.&quot;                                                    / The
 The above extracts would appear to warrant the conclusion that in regard to cereals Germany was wuch better off at the end of October than she was a year agoj Potatoes.      As regards potatoes, the reports vary.   We have Just seen that on tho 19th October the War Food Ministry stated that the quantity cf potatoes delivered to the authorities by tho land- owners before 17th October was almost 700,000 tons in excess of last year.      Dr. Heira,  the Bavarian specialist above quoted, informed a representative  of the Berliner Tageblatt (3rd Ootower) that &quot;Last year Germany had a r ecu ret po tatTTEarv e s t:   this year a good harvest is expected^   Quite generally the  outlook for the produce of the  soil for the year 1910-19 is more satisfactory than in 1917-18 and muoh more so than in 1916-17.&quot;  On the other hand tho  Munohner Heueste Naohrlchton (13th September) stated that &quot;The prevalence of Wet and cold weather caused muoh anxiety as to the keeping of the promising potato orop*&quot; Vegetables. Fruit,      In the semi-official report published in the Korddeutsche Alleggmeine Beitung (87th September)  and the Besflttfeageblatt (27th September) the supply of autumn vegetables iff stated to b* good,  but on the other hand the fruit crop was not so goods Fodder. .      In regard  to fodder, &quot;prospects  are better, as larger quantities of nutritious bran and molasses will  be obtained, and the cultivation of oil-seeds has made progress.&quot; Sugar.      &quot;The sugar-beet harvest&quot;, according to the  semi-official report above referred to, &quot;is better  than last year, although the sugar-content of the best appears to be smaller owing to the unfavourable weather.&quot; Meat.      &quot;In respect of the meat supply&quot;, says the semi-official report already quoted, &quot;Germany is worse off than last year; and $he ration of 25o grams per head per  week therefore cannot be maintained except for Berlin.  It will probably  be necessary to maintain the meatless weeks until 31st January,  1919,  The cattle-stock, which, in the last year of peace,  numbered ZZ million horned  cattle and 25 million  pigs, has been severely  * diminished by war conditions, for of  the? munbers just mentioned 10 million horned cattle and 4-5 million/tee fed on imported fodder.   It has been neceseary to kill off part of the cattle stock in order  to avoid excessive use of bread-corn as fodder. The number of horned cattle on 1st July, 1918, shows a decrease of 2 millions in comparison with the  number on 1st. July, 1917, and half of it  consists of milch cows which, for the sake of the fat supplies, cannot be used unrestrictedly for slaughter, purposes.&quot;v\     With regard to fata, the semi-official report speaks as follows:-                                                  / The
        The Ge*noan PAT  supply  in time of peace tyas based upon theP  high pig stocks and  the  large import of butter, Jard, and oil   from foreign countries.   The import continued &quot;during the first   years  of war, but ceased almost entirely  in 1918,, and moreover   the number of milch  cows has diminished by about 7$.  A substl-   tate for fat is provided by margarine, which is to be produced   in future from better raw materials than wore hitherto employed,   A good beechnut orop wil,3 help to oover the oil requirement of   the oountry.   The fact  thai despite all this so much butter   oan be obtained in surreptitious trade is due to the circum-   stanoes that milk and butter are far more difficult.to bring   under control than bread-corn ai?d potatoes.   Many methods have   been proposed to improve the seizure of milk and butter, e*g, ,   th&amp;t cowkeeping should be more closely connected with the   dairies; - that Communal Unions should be able to check openly   practised surreptitious  trade;  and that the rations should be   lowered in the producing areas.   Summary,        If one may judge by  the foregoing official and private   reports, the prospects for the German Pood Supply at the end of   October were as follows:  bread-corn, oereal foods, and fodder -   considerably better than last year;  potatoes and fats - some-   what loss certain;  meat and fruits - worse;  sugar and   vegetables - rather better.4,
