                                    o u uMEMORANDUM.    A  &quot;ufMiOK THE POST-WAR FUNCTIONS OF THE AIR MINISTRY      &apos; %D POST-WAR STRENGTH OP THE ROYAL AIR FORCE.      MNpTE:!&quot;* &apos;     (It has been necessary to prepare this paper without         any very definite information from the Admiralty and v,rar         Office, who were approached last August but have not yet been         able to advise as to the post-bellum requirements of the         Navy and Army).        1 desire to submit to -the Par Cabinet certain caonsiderations and definite recommendations on the post-war functions of the AirMinistry and the post-war strength of the Royal Air Force.   Theseproposals are of a far-reaching and comprehensive character;  theyinvolve the weighing of certain factors which at present are veryindefinite and on which there is room for much difference of opinion.It will be appreciated that the complexity of the problem is incieasedby the fact that in the case of the Royal Air Force and Air Ministrythere is no pre-war experience to which reference can be made.Nevertheless, I am convince that action on the lines indicated, isnecessary to ensure a satisfactoryfuture development of aviation inits fullest sense in the British Empire.        (1)  On the outbreak of war, aviation was in its infancy,    both as regards its technical development and its military    application.   During the war it has developed rapidly, has    demonstrated its far-reaching military value, and has become a    third service of the crowdy/nj  yet in regard to its potential value    as a war weapon it is obviously still in its infancy.   It is quite    conceivable that in time  air power will rank with land  power and    sea power,  and it is certain that future war effort will become    more and more strongly  developed in its air phase.  Accordingly,    as far  as can be foreseen,  it will be necessary  to provide an Air    Force of such strength  as will amply meet the needs of  the Empire,    such needs  being of course  governed, by the conditions surrounding    International armaments,  and the strength of the Force  being    adjusted in reference to  the efforts which may be made in the  same    direction by  the Dominions  and Colonies.         (2)  While commercial or civil  aviation  is  at present    non-existent,  the technical developments  of  war aviation have    been  of such  a nature as  to disclose  the  infinite possibilities    of commercial  aerial  transport.    These  developments  in my view    warrant the conviction  that after  a preliminary period  of    pioneer work,  which may be  expected to  be  shorter or  longer    according  as  such work  is properly directed,  commercial aerial    transport  will become  a great  social  and economic factor of    civilisation,  and will  support  a very substantial manufacturing     industry.         (3) As a result of war effort there has been developed     a very large  aeronautical industry, and the  best guarantee  for     the  continued future supremacy of British Military aircraft  is     to secure  that this  great industrial organisation shall be    maintained ann developed for commercial purposes to the utmost     extent which may be  possible.         (4)  Closely allied with the aeronautical industry is the     large technical organisation built up of Royal Air Force officers     serving under the Kinistry of iamitions.   Under their initiation,     guidance,  and active supervision,  has been carried out research,     development and experimental work of the most valuable character,     together with the direct application of such work to military     aircraft.    If the pioneer work above mentioned Is to be properly
directed it is essential that the functions  should beextended, and to a considerable extent the personnel of  thisdepartment should be conserved and applied as rapidly  aspossible to furthering the development of commercial aviatior!while keeping in mind also the requirements  of military  aviatlForce    (5)  Accordingly, the      and Air Ministry isproblems presented by theprincipally bound up with the single question ofarmaments and in the influence of the conceptionproblem of the future of the Royalsubstantially different from theNavy and Army, which will be doubt                       strength of                       of a LeagueNations.   The problem of  the Royal Air  Force  and  Air minister!is directly associated with  the  initiation  and rapid  develop:of an entirely new  industry, which has in it eventually thepossibility of a practical revolution in transport system, industry is one in  which the keenest competition is to beexpected from other nations.   It is at  ihe same time one  inthe British people  will expect the British  Empire  to  leavenothing undone to secure the first place.    (6)  The problem naturally divides, itself  into two headsthe policy of the future as regards military aviation - and policy as regards commercial aviation.    I annex a full  and comprehensive memorandum by the ChiefIthe Air Staff, with which I am largely in agreement,  but whiltends in my opinion to overstress the military aspect,  andunderestimates the future relative importance of  the civilproblem.    The memorandum  contains definite proposals  as  to  the futjstrength of the Royal Air Force  in which I concur.    Theseproposals are based on the following assumptions,  which I haflaid down j-(a)  That the military situation foreshadows a probabllltl    a real and enduring peace, not merely a suspended stf    of war.    (b) That a slight but ever growing movement will  develop!        towards the reduction of  armaments  through  the  gradJ        acceptance and initiation of  the  policy of  a  League        Nations.    (c) That nc strong support will be offered by political        in any of the first-class powers  towards  extensive j        expensive schemes of a militant character,  except po]        in the case of Japan.    (7)  These assumptions do not imply a conviction  that illwill be possible to eliminate armaments,  but rather a belief!that it will be reasonably safe to adopt  a  moderate policy,keeping&apos;, as a matter of course, a close watch en  the  policy by other first-class powers.  The risks are obvious,  but appto out both ways.   It might reasonably be  held that  GreatBritain on account of the concentration of  her industrial areas, is peculiarly open to air  attack,  and, consequently,she should&apos;be very strong in aerial defence and in  thecorresponding offence which it held to be the better  part of]defence.  On the other hand. It may be argued that  by forminla strong air fleet Great Britain  will set up a standard for jether nations and. thus Inaugurate competition in  armaments 11this sphere.   Against this &quot;it must be noted that in  the Aiifas on the sea, the wide dispersion of the Empire  entailsobligations which do not devolve  upon more  centralised pofel
                          &apos; 3 -                             309   I    (8)  As regards the future of commercial aviation, it isessential to emphasise that as regards technical development the possibilities have only been indicated up to tho presentand it may be usefully predicted that within 10 years thedevelopment in the transport of mails, goods, and passengersby air will constitute a social and economic revolution somewhatakin to the development of the automobile, but on  an even widerscale.    Subject only to weather limitations, we have at presentin existence, aeroplanes capable of carrying out continuousflifhts of 1200 miles at B apesd of 100 miles per hour, witha crew of 9 persons and carrying one ton of useful load.  Ourlatest type of flying boat recently passed through a successfulseries of trials, its characteristics being a total loaded weightof 16 tons, the aggregate power being 2,000 horse power, its range800 miles, speed lio miles per hour, with a useful load of over1 ton.    In addition to the carriage of nails, goods and passengers,there are other valuable and definite duties which will ultimately be fulfilled by the use of aircraft.    It is essential to note inthis connection that&quot; the developments will be of an imperial and world-wide character rather than  developments of the applicationof aircraft to the particular needs of Great Britain.    A parallelexi3ts in the British Mercantile Marine,  the part of which engagedin the British coastwise industry is comparatively small in proportion to that engaged in overseas trade.   In commercialaviation as in merchant shipping Great Britain must take the leadamong  the nations.    I  am particularly anxious that  these  remarks should bo regardedas predictions for the future and not as  of applying  to the1 mediate present.  The greatest degree of caution will be necessaryin the early enterprises to make allowance for what may becalled the &quot;glamour of the air&quot; and  its effect in producing wildcatschemes.  At present no experience  exists of the working of .commercial aviation.   Meteorology  for aerial navigation and air navigation itself  are merely  in their infancy, and&quot;final successwill only be achieved by  sane, scientific, and sound  pioneer workinvolving considerable expenditure  without, immediate, return.    (9)  The practical problem in connection with  the  aboveconcerns the extent and degree to which  the  State must  contribute towards  the essential development.     It might  reasonably be held that,as  the  State  possesses  through its Royal  Air Force  organisationand Technical Department,  practically all existing  aeronauticalexperience  the State  should  control and  operate  commercial  and civilaviation developments.    For example, that  the State  should immediately create a  State monopoly  of aerial mail  carrying.    I  have  given this  matter very  careful consideration andhave  finally decided  that the correct policy is to  aim atestablishing conditions under which private  enterprise will secure an enduring and  prosperous  existence,  through active  help.assistance,  and  guidance  from the  State.   Monopoly by the  state would undoubtedly limit  and handicap the  rate  of progress  and  it is extremely doubtful whether State operation would be as efficient,economical and  energetic  as  private enterprise.    Por  the moment my conception of the guidance and assistance which the  State  should give is that it should take the following,main torris,  (1)  provide the strongest possible technical department for experimental and research purposes,  which would administer,in the closest touch with the aeronautical industry,  substantial
sgrants of public money with the object of indicating the poundslines of progress and developing what is good in the work doneprivate persons and organisations,   (This department would naturally keep close touch also with any other public or semi-public institutions which may be engaged on research &quot;rearing onaeronautics),   (2) provides as far as possible for the needsof the country in aerodromes, e.g., purchasing and holding, inaddition to aerodromes specifically for R.A.P. purposes, the considerable number of other aerodromes now held under theP.O.R.A. where the compensation payable or the cost of re-instatement is likely to  be excessive and acquisition thesoundest policy (3) to provide for the special meteorologicaldevelopments requisite to meet air requirements and forother development such as the mapping of aerial routes (4) tosupvle.:ent private enterprise as may be found requisite by undertaking mail, goods, and passenger services.    (10)  It is necessary here to lay stress on the influence which a progressive and enterprising industry will have on thefuture of the Royal Air Force as a military arm.  It will, be of vital importance to the Empire that the commercial aircraftdevelopments shall be made available as a reserve for wrr, purpojand that there should be co-ordmar/ion in aircraft  productionand technical development for both the military and commercialwork.  This point must not be over-laboured.   At the momentcommercial and military requirements, in aircraft may closelycoincide.  I  have, however, the conviction tnat within a fewyears the actual machines utilised for commercial purposes willnot be legitimately available as an efficient reserve for v?arpurposes, and no handicap should be put on the commercial development by limitations of military requirements. To a largeextent in the immediate future and entirely when the developmenjust alluded to are complete, the real reserve of the RoyalAir Force must be in the aircraft industry itself, the potentialproducer in war-time for the&apos; needs of the military force.    In particular the Royal Air Force must rely for its reservepilots in war-time on pilots occupied in civil aviation on theoutbreak of war, and, partly because of this, and partly becauaiof the necessity of securing the safety of the public, provlsiolrequires to be made1, and is made below,; for the training of pilfexcept such as fly for purely private purposes,  .&apos;. (11)&apos;  I-Yould add that the above views and proposals regard!commercial aviation agre? in most essentials with the conclusioicome to by the Civil Aerial Transport Committee. .   ,,.    (12)  The following specific proposals are accordinglysubmitted as to the post-war functions of the Royal Air Forceand the Air MinistryV-MILITARY SECTION.    1,  To form&apos; an Imperial Air Staff to advi.se in regard.to        the organisation, training and eqvjpment.of the Air      -  Forcesrof the&apos;Empire, on the&apos;lines.followed&quot; in the        Imperial General Staff in the war Office, ;.,  2,  To provide specialised-units to co-operate with land fo    3,  To provide specialised units to co-operate-with sea fon ,-4,  To provide an Air Fleet  comprising  a  striking  force and    home defence force.5,  To provide a general reserve,  to be drawn from oommercij    aerial  services, where possible.
    6*  To provide a cadre of llghter-than-air services  to undertake        such parts of coastguard duties  as may be  assigned.    7.  Tr assume responsibility for all anti-aircraft defensive        measures.    8.  To undertake training of pilots, except such as  fly for purely        private purposes, and testing of all pilots  for  licence.    9.  To provide such aerial services  as are required  by other        Government Departments as e,g.,  police or  surveys.CIVIL SECTION.    1.  To be constituted as the authority for guidance  and super-        vision on all questions of civilian air transport.    2.  To have power, to undertake mail, goods and passenger services,        while affording the utmost freedom and help, other than        direct financial help by way of  subsidy or bounty, to private        enterprises.    3.  To carry out functions of inspection and certification of        aircraft under domestic legislation shortly to be introduced.    4.  To own and maintain all aerodromes in the  United Kingdom        required for war purposes, Government training and aerial        routes, and possibly in the Crown Colonies where such are        requisite for overseas mails, goods and paosenger services,        and to control and regulate the  marking, lighting and        mapping of such routes.    5.  To undertake the initiation of such steps  as may be necessary        to secure rights in the international air  routes.    6.  To undertake the inauguration of a Meteorological Department        for Air Service and commercial purposes, in liaison with the        Meteorological Office and similar institutions overseas.    7.  To undertake all technical research requisite for the drvelop-        ment of aeronautics, so far as this Is not provided for by   -        outside institutions.    The principles on which the peace organisation of the Royal Airce should be based are as follows:- ,    (a)  The only units to be maintained at war establishment to bo    those embarked in fully manned:aircraft-carrying ships and in    overseas stations where local reserves are not available.  In    addition to these, there will be-a-Government  fleet of 20    squadrons used for civil purposes, which in the meantime would    be  available if required as a striking force.    (b)  Other units to consist of training units containing the    cadres of service squadrons with mobilisation equipment stores    at or within convenient distance.    (c)  The number of training units to-be sufficient to  provide    personnel for the peace establishment and reserves to  complete    cadres to war establishment, also to maintain wastage until the    output of fully trained personnel, trained after mobilisation,    begins.  &apos;  Detailed proposals as to the strength, character, and position of the proposed peace strength are given In the annexed paper$e Chief of the Air Staff, and may be summarised as follows
(a) Home Defence.(b) Striking Force(c) Expeditionary Force,    and First Reserve.(d) Mesopotamia(o) Egypt &amp; Soudan(f) India(g) Africa(h) Grand Fleet    requirements(i) Home Waters mine    searching and    anti-submarine.(j) Overseas Imperial    bases, including    Mediterranean20 Squadrons (which would be cadres)20 Squadrons (at full strength for              commercial purposes).57 Squadrons (which would be cadres) 4 Squadrons 4 Squadrons) These Squadrons to be              at full strength.12 Squadrons&apos; 2 Squadrons 8 Squadrons  (to be at full strengt]15 Squadrons  (to be cadres)12 Squadrons (these to be at full                     strength)Total:-  -62 Squadrons at full strength, 92 Squadrons cadres.(15)  The personnel required for this force would consist ofOfficersCadetsBoys 7,300  on the establishment 1,500  under training 5,00076,500 cn the establishment 3,000 under training 6,000or a total of about 100,000 to which must be added a reserve of 15,000 officers and 100,000 men.   These figures include a peace establishment for India but not for the Dominions and colonies.  They do not include personnnel for lighter than ailcraft or anti-aircraft services.   The estimated annual costmaintaining this force may be taken as about  41,000,000.(This figure does not take into account any of the terminalcharges connected ,with .tbe war, and must not, of course beregarded as in any way representing the requirements for thenext financial year).,   The difficulty of framing anything 111an accurate estimate.in present conditions will be readilyappreciated.  When conditions are more normal; and a fullyorganised system, of administration is set up, it may well be*economies on the above figure will be practicable.   It willbe realised that a figure of  41,000,000 is probably equivaleito some such figure as. 28,000,000 o.n a pre-war basis.   I desire also to emphasise the point that this expenditure, unliNavy and Army expenditure will be on the principles laid down on this paper, to a,very large extent, by way of a-commercialinvestment.       It should be stated that the estimate includes theprovision of  2,000,000 for annual expenditure on aeronautica)experiment and research, the intention being that this amountapproved for a period of, say, five years and be provide&apos; insuch a manner that the balance unspent in one year be carried over to the next; year.
    (16)  The first essential step in initiating internationalcivil aerial transport will be an International AircraftConvention, regulating the conditions of flying between thedifferent nations.   This has been prepared on the basisgenerally recommended by the Civil Aerial Transport Committee,carefully revised, submitted to other Departments of State and agreed..   The technical provisions are undergoing final revisionafter which it will be submitted for War Cabinet approval.  Afterapproval it will be sent to the Allies and if agreed by them,  anInternational Conference can be held.    A Bill covering the domestic legislation and regulations for flying in time of peace is now being put into draft by the AirMinistry in consultation with other departments of state and thiswill be submitted to the War Cabinet at an early date.    The detailed organisation of the Air Ministry itself requiredfor the performance of the functions already defined is now beingworked out, and will be submitted to the Cabinet at an early date for approval.  It involves a very large degree of reconstruction of the Air Ministry^ present organisation, and comprehends the taking over immediately from the Ministry of Munitions the functionsof supply and technical design.   The supply functions would onlybe those of a highly technical character, as it is assumed thatsupply to the Air Ministry of a non-technical character will becarried out by the future Ministry of Supply.  On the other hand,none of the commercial encouragement and development of aviationis possible, so long as the Technical Department is under the control vof the Ministry of Munitions.    (17)  For the present the Cabinet are asked generally to approve.-    (1)   The definition of duties and principles set out in the          foregoing paragraphs.    (2)   The fixing of the peace establishment of the Royal Air          Force at 154 squadrons, of which 62 will be kept at full          strength and 92 will be cadres.    (3)   The approval for the purposes of this establishment of          the provision of personnel as indicated in paragraph 15.    (4)   The purchase of whatever aerodromes are required for the          peace establishment of the Royal Air Force, together with          other aerodromes at present held by the R.A.F. where the          compensation payable or the cost of restoration will prove          to be excessive and the actual acquirement of the land          will be the most economical and business-like policy..    I would add that the earliest possible Cabinet decision on theabove proposals is requisite.  The  position in the Royal Air  -Force to-day as regards the officers is that the whole of them, with two exceptions, hold temporary commissions, a certain number holdingalso pre-war commissions in the Navy and Army.   There is accordingly complete uncertainty among the officers as to their position and prospects and it is essential in the interests of theRoyal Air Force to deal with this situation at the earliest possible moment and to nominate officers to permanent commissions  In the R.A.F.up to the  establishment above proposed.    As regards other ranks the position is that at present thereare some 12,000 liable for service after the declaration  of peace.
 Tho Air Council have,  with Cabinet sanction, adopted a scheme on tho  v/ar Office lines to provide personnel for general servij by moans  of voluntary engagements during approximately the nexlfour years.   No definite numbers have yet however been approved] and it  is nocessary -oo obtain such approval in order to make actual  engagements.  I propose that the War Cabinet should authorise eng^ge^ent up to 60,, 000 men on the lines approvedorA,hear            Office, 20,000 for  service, up  to March  1921*  20,Oftfor service up to March 1922 and 20,000 for service up  to Marti1825 *  if this authority is given it  is anticipated that  suffilengagements will be made to maintain  the R.A.F. at  a  suitable]strength for &quot;the next two years and thereby provide for theimmediate requirements of the situation.    I should add that pending demobilisation the utmost carebeing taken to leave the question of  the post-bellum  arranged for the Royal Air Force and Air Ministry unprejudiced.  But ljfar as those arrangements are a necessary  element in  decision]which have to be taken, the proposals  made  in this paper are bjtaken as the basis.(Sgd.)Weir.-12/12/18.
