/6- ^ r^-184ftV/ar Cabinet.      War Cratuity^and[Naval Prize.^^emo rand urn by the Secretary of State for War,ate a note on G.T.6419 by  the Assistant  Financial Secretary-)-1.   Dr. Macnanara1^ Memorandum doeo not  state  the V/ar  Office positioncorrectly.  It is not proposed to do anything which  should  interferewith the Royal Proclamation of August 1918 promising Prize  to theNavy, or to lay down that the Navy shall  derive no benefit, ascompared with the Army,  from the prize fund;  but it  is  contended thatin awarding war gratuity to the Navy and  Army the Crown may properlytake &quot;&quot;into consideration its grant of Prize to the Navy, and should be advised to do so.%f   It is not in dispute that up to the  time of the Ashanti V/ar theXavy had its customary right to prize and the Army had  its  customaryand equally ancient right to take booty and sell it  for the benefitof the troops.  Thereafter, the taking of booty by  the  Army for itsown personal benefit was forbidden and (as the  records  make clear)War Gratuity was given to the troops in consideration of thisdeprivation.3.   The Navy Prize Fund in the present war is  understood to  be some7 to 8 millions, and as qualification for a full share has  been restricted to these with at least 30 months sea time, the numberssharing are reduced and the average share enhanced.   The cost  of gatuities on Army scales for the Navy has &quot;been given to the  BarnesCommittee as some four millions (including Officers).  It is  difficultto reconcile these figures with Dr.Naonamara&apos;s  statement thatNavy Prize &quot;to those who will get it will probably be at least 5 and may be more, to the Able Seaman, up to  2,000 or more  to theCommander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet&quot;.Army scale would be  5 to  29 accordingA.B&apos;s would get  it, not only  those withtherefore, the total oost of  gratuities  imeB 4 millions, or the individual share of Prize should be several  imes the figures given by Droliacnamara, for both higher and lowerranks,  The valuo of Navy Prize is  obviously an important factor  in the  discussion and the War Office has desired  to confer with theAdmiralty pn  the subject, but the Admiralty prefers not to discussuntil the principle  is settled.4.   Acting  on such  information as,is available, I suggest that the sailor  should be given in  the first  instance a sum equal to Army gratuity.  When  the Prize Accounts  have been worked  out  (twelvemonths  hence) he should be  given  such further  sum as will  bring his total  to  Prize H-a -fixed fraction  of gratuity (only  this fixed fraotion being  charged against Votes  of Parliament).  Before  deciding what the fraction should  be,  the discrepancy in the figures  should  be cleared up  and  the  value of  the Prize share roughly  determined. 5.    The following  are  brief answers to  such of Dr.  Macnamara&apos;e arguments as call  for  reply      (2)  There  is  no  interference: see  paragraph 1  of this Memorandum.      (3)  There  is  no  tampering with Prize,  or failure to  appreciate           the services  of  the Navy, but  the  Army also  has  claims; and           see paragraph 3.      (4)  Incorrect,  See paragraphs 1  and 4,      (5) and (6)  A complete misunderstanding.  The War Office           Member of Mr.Barnes1  Committee has never  accepted  the           Admiralty view. The gratuity to an A.B.  onto length of service, and all30 months sea time.  Either,to the Navy should be several
(6)  Before the present  war,  each Fleet or Squadron of the     Navy stood by its own  captures.  The principle of universal     distribution is  novel.   Any landing party or $aval     cotitingent attached to  an Army would undoubtedly be entitled     to share booty taken by it or by the Army of which it formed     party. But it cannot be argued that on this ground the whole     Navy, should get  the full Army share in addition to its own     Navy Prize.  Would  the  Navy admit a claim by the whole     Army to the equivalent  of Navy Prize, if a few soldiers had     taken part in the capture of a ship?.(9)  There is no precedent  for giving the whole Navy the Army     gratuity in addition to Prize, ac is now claimed.(11) This is a mere question of book-keeping.  The value of     captured ships,  etc.,  if net distributed to the Navy, would     accrue to the Exchequer.(12) to (16).  These  are points for consideration by the     Department or by the Barnes Committee,  They do not affeot     the main point of equity as between the two Services.MILKER.9th December, 1918.
