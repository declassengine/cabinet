-gills  DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVEJ-JMBNT. *) MCOKPIDIilHTIALt ^Y^I^LCU   l^A C^JjVvJ                                  I.                               PERSONAL.              aa a Canadian, 34 years of ago.   I had been studying      -iJniloeophy and economics in Germany for four years previous       to the war, had travelled extensively through Germany and had       a large number of personal friends, practically all belonging       to the more,liberally thinking classes.   Many of these visited       and talked freely to me from time to time during my internment       in Ruhleben.            In December, 1914, I was out of internment for two weeks,       and had a good opportunity to find out how people of these       circles regarded the war and Germany&apos;s situation, and to       realise on what grounds these circles at that time supported       the German Government in its policy.            After the Revolution I was  in Berlin nearly every day,       and talked with men of all classes.            My training has not been entirely academic, as I spent       several years in practical engineering work  in Canada before       taking up my more reoent lines of  research.                                 II.                                                    t                   THiii BACKGROUND OF THE  REVOLUTION.1*           A large majority, especially  of the better  educated       classes  in Germany, had not  thought politically  before the       present  war, and took  no  interest  in politics.   The people       had no   sense for the  incapacity of German  diplomacy.             I found, previous to  the war,  a widespread  feeling  that       Germany  was being hemmed  in  in  her development  by  the  other       nations,  and  the  sentiment had  been carefully fostered by the       Militarist  or Pan-German  circles,,  that a v/ar of  self       preservation  would  presumably  be necessary  in the near        future.    At  the outbreak of the war,  the official documents  i
issued by  the German Government to the people presented this war purely as a war of self-preservation or of defence.The Germans have always had a deep rooted sense of respect for and deference to authority.   They have followed the directions of the recognized authorities in science, in politics and in military matters.   The average educatedman pretended rarely to a political opinion and would sayquite frankly that he left that to those whose businesspolitics and statecraft were.   The impression which I havereceived very strongly within my last two months in germany is that the dramatic collapse of Germany&apos;s military position within BO few weeks has convinced the people thatthose whom they trusted as their military and politicalauthorities had entered into a great speculation.   Every-thing which I oaw  and heard In Berlin convinced me thatthis has destroyed the prestige of the former ruling classin Germany as nothing else ever could have,     Dissatisfaction with the old regime has Ions boenpresent;   (witness the strikes of winter 17/18).   Overa year ago the soldiers of the Guard in Euhleben expressedquite frankly,their belief that a revolution was coning,and stated that the then Crown Prince would certainlynever come to the throne.   The first tiUe when anything &apos;like a general discouragement seized the people was afterthe failure of the German attacks at Verdun.   The Germanpeople have also- never had anything like an adequaterealisation of what America^ earning into the war might mean for them, arid the people at large, having no experience in maritime affairs, have always had an exaggerated ideaof the accomplishments of their submarines.   Even thebest-informed of my visitors at Ruhleben shared theseideas.     Agencies created by General Ludendorff worked veryhard last&apos;  winter preparing a backing of popular  confidence
                            [ &apos;                            249for the German offensive of the Spring.  This confidencedisappeared rapidly after- the German defence came to a standstill^-In June 1918 I was in Berlin for a day, and was able to spendmost of the time with a man in a position to hear what theindustrial magnates and officers on leave regarded as thegeneral scheme of the German offensive this Spring.   Briefly,people in such positions believed that it would be possiblefor the Germans so to shatter the Allied Armies on the Westfront that these would have to withdraw at least south of theLoire before re-inforcements arrived from America in any numbers.     Germany was supposed to be building the parts forsubmarines in great quantities,  with the purpose of then rashingup erecting yards in Brest and other Atlantic ports, for thepurpose of preventing entirely the American transports, and of effecting a complete blockade of England.   Just before.theGerman March offensive, all the firms which had large numbersof men recalled from the front for special technical workreceived a general circular from Army Headquarters stating :.-&quot;Should the offensive now about to start pass over again intoa period of trench warfare, which we do not expect, you mustbe pr^parei to release at once 45 per cent of your recalledmen&quot;.   This 45 per cent was actually called back to theArmy again immediately after the German advance was stoppedat Montdidier.     The dissatisfaction with the old regime was augmented bythe peculiar conditions of food rationing in Germany.   Thecircles upon which the German Bureaucratic Government hasalways relied for its  chief popular support remained  com-paratively very well off, and in many cases reaped  large profits,while other circles were getting  in a steadily worse  condition.In the cities the impression was  widespread and was undoubtedlyjustified, that the great  landowners were making  a very goodthing out of the war at the expense of  the working population in the industrial centres.   The  amount of sorruption and
 irregularity  in  the  carrying out of Germany1s rationing scheme had been  growing  steadily, and owing to the depletion of the official  staffs through the war, the risk of detection and punishment cf  such irregularities was growing steadily less. The reiterated warnings  of. Socialist and Radical speakers in the Reichstag and  the journalistic utterances of men like Theodore Wolff,  Maximilian Harden and Erich Kuttner as to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and revolutionary feeling throughout the country were thoroughly borne out by statements of friends who visited me in Ruhleben more than a year ago.     The reasosn why the German people as a whole, according to the impression which I received, supported its Government in the war, have of  course nothing to do with the grounds which actuated any of that Government&apos;s measures, but Ibelieve that  they explain why the Revolution,  when it occurred, received the  support not only of the Socialist parties, but of wide circles  of the German people, who, previous to the war,had been anything  but revolutionary.     I talked with a number of University teachers and students who had become officers during the war, two of them in responsibility- ible posts in the Wireless Service.   These were mainly menwho,  previous to the war, had taken no interest in politics.All told me that the events -of the last year had convinced themthat just this political apathy of that class  of the people to whom they belong was.what had been fatal to Germany, andthat they were rea-dy and believed that the large majority of the younger men of their type were also ready to support whole-heartedly the modex^ate, that is to say, the democratic as distinct from any Bolshevist Revolution                           III.          THE SITUATION 7$ GTZWH IN THE MIDDLE OF                  ......    &quot;^ gy^l^&quot;     One of the  Wireless Officers above mentioned was at thattime in charge of one of tho largest stations  on the outskirts &apos;
of Berlin.   He had been.in an, exceptional, position, tofollow the exact course of events during the week of theRevolution, which he related to me in detail.   He had knownpreviously that organisation for the Revolution was inprogress.   The German General Staff had made, all- arrangements.for crushing the Revolution;  on the assumption, however,that it would break out first in Berlin.   Pour Army Corpsregarded as loyal were posted around Berlin ready to convergeon the city at a given signal.   This signal was to have beensent through my informants station.   He said it was theeffect on the sailors of the Fleet at Kiel  of an apparentlyunfounded rumour, which precipitated the Revolution there.This anticipated considerably the date for which theRevolution was being planned in Berlin.   The result was thatBerlin remained quiet, while the movement was spreading inan unorganised manner over north-western Germany.   By thetime the movement reached Berlin it had become clear that anyattempt to crush it there could have but temporary success,and at the last moment General Von Linsingen (&quot;Oberkommandantin den Marken&quot;) sent through these wireless stations thea)i?der to the four Army Corps above mentioned to remain wherethey were and make no  use of their arms.     At the middle of November the relative strength and thetendencies of the new bodies which the Revolution had broughtforth had &quot;become fairly clear,   The condition was one of very labile equilibrium. .  The Soldiers&apos; and workmen&apos;sCouncils were in every case lo*al affairB, and it was atthe request and with  the  support of the Berlin Council thatthe two Socialist Parties had  proceeded to form  theProvisional Government.   Under the circumstances thesuprising  thing was that  so little  friction had  occurred be*wtween  the  measures adopted by.the new  Government  and those adopted by the various local  Councils.
The new Government had bound itself to a comparatively moderate course. Its members had stated clearly to the people that the present was an impossible time to ?ffect any extreme Socialist Revolution in economic affairs, and had bound themselves to summon a Constituent National Assembly as soon as possible. In this moderate course, as distinct from an attempt at forming a permanent Government by workmens&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils, as the Liebknecht group was urging, the Provisional Government supported itself rather on the Soldiers&apos; Councils than on those of the Work-men. The Soldiers&apos; Council of greater Berlin was a body of about two thousand ?. It not independently of other bodies. The Executive Committee ("Vo?lzugsrat") a body of some 15 to 20 members, was, however, the Executive of the workmens&apos; and Soldiers&apos; Councils.

In two meetings of the Soldiers&apos; Council the thoroughness of its support of the moderate tendency within the Revolution was very marked. A proposal to form a "Red Guard of Labour to defend the Revolution," which had received the assent of the Executive Committee of the combined Soldiers&apos; and  Workmens&apos; Councils (the Vollzugsrat),? and which was supported vigorously by some members of this body before the meeting of the great Soldiers&apos; Council was turned down by a very large majority, and nearly all the speakers were vigorous in their denunciation of Li?bknecht and his group.

The choice of the members of the Executive Committee, with whom at that time the real power and initiative in Berlin resided, rather that with the Provisional Government, seemed to have been determined largely by chance circumstances. Men previously unheard of were presented as candidates with the recommendation that they had done good service in organising the Revolution.

? It was charged in the meeting of the Soldiers&apos; Council by one of the Soldier-members of the "Vollzugsrat," that this assent had been obtained at the end of a ?rotracted night sitting after most of the Soldier members had left.


As a result ? be greater in thus Executive Committee than in the Soldiers&apos; Council as a whole. In so far as one can judge from the most recent in the English Press the arrest of the Executive Committee has been due to just that fact, and would seem to in dicate that the determination of the Soldiers not to be ? by the extremists remains as strong as ever.

Liebknechf&apos;s action in the first day of the the Revolution lost him sympathy and discredited him with the soldiers as a whole. It has transpired that a great deal of the shooting at the soldiers, in Berlin during the Revolution was done with rifles distributed indiscriminately by Liebknecht and his followers when they stormed the magazines on November 9th. The soldiers, who had on the whole preserved thorough loyalty to the revolutionary organisations which they had created on the spur of the? moment, resented Liebknecht&apos;s attempt to utilise the opportunity to make himself supreme. Before November 20th it had also transpired that certain quite irresponsible groups of people belonging to the Liebknecht party had, on november 9th,  seized rooms in the Rheichst? Building, and established offices there with high sounding titles, which had issued orders conflicting with those issued by the real leaders of the Revolution.

Meetings of the labourers of certain of the ? Berlin trades, notably the metal workers, were much more extreme  in their tendency than those of the Soldiers&apos; Council.

The metal workers meeting adopted a resolution against the summoning of the National assembly before "the fruits of the Revolution had been consolidated and safely secured against all possibility of attack" It was very evident that among the members of this meeting at least the tendancy was to gravitate toward the extreme left.

The meaning was that the National Assembly should be summoned, if at all, in such form that elections to it were entirely in the hands of the Soviet organisations, thus disfranchising all other classes of the people.


                         -P-                             254      The mindo of intelligent  people--^mic --occupied  to thetemporary exclusion of everything else  by the  oaa^len^if:yr^ftlempresented by the rapid demobilisation of the army.   Tho  armybehind the front, so I was  informed by everybody in  a position tojudgei  had to a great extent  broken up in disorder,  and  was pressing back into Germany by evory means available, thus  causingat one and tho same time grave  difficulty to the front armieswhich were retreating in good order, and to the authorities  inthe German cities themselves.   This was borne  cut by what  one could see of the over-crowded railway trains coming  from thewest, and of the condition of things in Berlin, especially atthe railway stations.      In the first weeks after the Revolution  one sawpractically no more officers on the streets of the capital.But there was an immediate increase in the numbers of ablebodied men in civilian clothes.   These were largely theofficers, of whom there had previously been great numbers onstaff work in Berlin.   One of my informants,  a reserve  officer who had plaeed himself at the disposal of the  moderate  revolu-tion, stated that a return of these men to their duties  wasnot to be looked for until the relationship between Officersand the Soldiers&apos; Councils was fixed by general regulation.The passing of such regulations was, however,  being hinderedby a variety of causes.  He expressed the greatest  concern that, without the assistance of the technical  knowledge  of theseofficore it would be quite impose&amp;blc, no matter what the good  &apos;will of the organs created by the Soldiers&apos; Council, to  carryout the demobilisation without fatal disorder resulting.   Thesame concern was strongly shared by the wireless officer citedabc^e.  In his own unit the, relationship in question had beenlooally 30-ttled, and a working compromise arrived at.   the morale of the home army has long been far below that of  thetroops at the front.   In June 1918 I was given details  andexamples indicating an astounding degreo of demoralisation.
And. owing to the impossibility of punishing strictly allthe lapses from discipline (&quot;by reason of their very numbe 12)many disciplinary orders had been officially relaxed.      Before I left Germany, more order had been introduced into the despatch of returning men at therailway stations.   Men whose homes were not in Berlin werenot being allowed out of the railway stations, beingforwarded thence directly to their homea.^   There was however a very large number of disorganised soldiers inBerlin;   estimates ran up to 300,000.   These had, inmany instances, no regular means cf pmcuring food, andwere thus a constant source of danger.      A gentleman who works in a social (Settlement inthe East-end of Berlin told me that their estimate ofthe number of deserters, in Berlin at Midsummer was already ^0,000.      As to the strength of different revolutionarytendencies among the working people, opinions variedgreatly, depending largely on the different groups ofworking men with whom my informants came most into contact.   Two engineers from the AllgemeineEloktrizitat3 Gesellsohaft were  aonvineed that themost extreme tendencies would soon gain  the upper hand.The A.E.G. have, however, been notorious for  its un-generouo treatment of employees.      The social worker referred to  in  the  last paragraph,on the  contrary, had been greatly encouraged  by his conversations with working men from all  sorts of factories in the  east-end  of Berlin.   He  told he  that  their graspof the  situation was generally sober  and their  standpointmoderate.x   The position  of Commandant  of  Berlin  was being filled   by  a Socialist member  of the  Reichstag;   and his deputies    seemed to  be  exercising  au-ecessfiuiLy a  great  deal of   tact  in  dealing with the returning soldiers.
                   - 10 -     An engineer of the Telei\inken&apos;^Co]i^in hie Company they were getting along well with theWorkmen&apos;s Council and anticipated no trouble.     In conversations with the common people on my visits to Berlin, and with many of our guards at Ruhleben, I foundalmost invariably the realisation that Germany must look forward to a lon^ period of poverty and very hard work.  Manyhowever, were apt to be despondent as a result of the armistice conditions.  There was the fear thai shortage of rolling stockwould make the regular provisioning of the cities and an order-ed demobilisation impossible.  A railway official told me thatthe number locomotives and wagons demanded from Germany wouldhave caused Germany no inconvenience in ordinary circumstances,                                        thebut that so many men had been called into/colours in the lasttwo ye-ara that locomotives badly in need of repair had simplyhad to be left.  A great deal of German rolling stock was alsoin Rumania, Bulgaria, the occupied territories in the East. etc.That in the East had been confiscated by the Poles, and so faras the ordinary person could see, everything certainly didindicate that Germany is at present very badly off for railwayrolling litock.     One met very generally the opinion that the armistice conditions were not only in themselves very drastic, but were an indication that the Allies intended purposely to dictatepeace terms to Germany which it would be impossible for thelatter to carry out.  This feeling tended to foster the ^pathywhich had been apparent among wide circles in Germany as aresult of the privations and sufferings of the past two orthree years.     The Chairman of a local Soldiers1 and Workmens1 Council(A University lecturer now serving as officer) told me thatwhile the extremists would never have but a small proportionof the population in their favour, large bodies had become soapathetic that they would accept without any resistance a coup of the extreme Loft.
      The more capable thoserwirth -whom -^me-^^allce^weTe .ofjudging the  conpjm^c features of the situation, the more^tmo^rnecLone found them with the dangers introduced by; the necessaryjrapiditg of demobilisation.   The equipment of the factories, they said, was tio a great extent exhausted by the work which had beendone during the war.   There was a dearth of raw materials;  andeven in the case of those which Germany herself produced, reserveshad been used up.x   At the same time there were being thrownupon the country within a period of two or three months millions of demobilised men for whom employment must be found unlessstarvation and anarchy were to result.      The general opinion was that if the Provisional Governmentcould manage to keep the provisioning arrangements from failingutterly until the convening of the National Assembly, thesi-situation would be saved.   An uncertain featute cf the situationis the meeting of delegatesjfrom Soviets of all Germany to be h^ldIn Berlin on the 16th of this month.   Up to the present theProvisional Government has received its most effective support from the soldiers in Berlin, and from the fact that almost without exception the entire machinery of the old officialdom remainedintact and allowed itself to be put at tho disposal of theProvisional Government.  These officials, who might have been expected from their traditions to have offered the most determinedresistance to the Revolution,, have apparently been overwhelmedby the suddenness and the strength of the revolutionary movement.This seem to be true of many of the former supporters of theConservative Parties.      On November 11th a report was spread that the greatLandowners were about to withhold supplies from the cities.  TheConservative Party itself immediately issued an appeal to these people to Bupply the cities with all that they could, as anyother course would inevitably lead to self-destruction.x    Apparently even in the case of products of which Germany  before the war enjoyed a practical monopoly, such as Pota&apos;t\h  (&quot;akali&quot;), she has little or nothing.ready for export.  The most  probable exceptions are the chemical and electrical industries
                          -12 -       *                258      The Provisional Government seemed in  general  to havereceived the support of the local Soviets throughout thecountry, hut very few cases had arisen to put  the genuinenassof this support to the test.   The meeting  in  Berlin onDecember l6th may create a body which will  supplant, as thereally most powerful body within the Empire,  the BerlinSoviet.      The existing local Soviets vary greatly as regardsthe relative strength of the radieal and the  moderate  elementswithin them.   When I left Germany on November 22nd,  that,at Leipsic was by far the most radical, the new localgovernment there being apparently under the control ofKUhle, an avowed Bolshevist.   Merely local movements  may,however, have very  little  significance  in the present  stateof affairs, all the more so in  the literally  chaoticstate of  communication within tho Empire at present.  Onemay look  to the meeting of  December  l6th to give a picture of the  real relative  strength of the  different tendenciesthroughout  the whole  country.      Immediately after the Revolution, new daily papersbegan to  appear in  large numbers  in  the Capital.   Thesepractically all represented the extremer tendencies, andtheir articles were characterised  by shallowness and by thedem&amp;gogic nature  of their  appeal  to  the people.    Onreturning to England one is struck by the  faot that theEnglish Pre88  is  publishing news  from Germany indiscriminatelyfrom good and  from  worthless  sources.    In the middle  ofNovember the  &quot;Vorwarts&quot; and the &quot;Berliner  TafieblEutt&quot; werewithout doubt  the best informed of the papers in the Capital.x       The present Government  labours under the  difficulty of a  relatively moderate  Government  in revolutionary times, -......- i imm rr   1 i j\ mi i . i .../H  i ii-nii  -i ii - i -r . i i  m m i - i i   . i i i. i -ii i.  L j.M m. ,    rx while in Ruhleben I managed to  see the  &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;   fairly regularly.  Its  Rotterdam correspondent  (Mr,   Leonaid Spray)  seemed usually very wetl  informed as  to,   affairs in  Germany.
 in  the\ circumstances prevent^it-fvGm^e^nslMln^iriiiiixi a short space of time a condition of things which will produce a betterment of the material situation of the people which will be  felt  by the latter.  Meanwhile thd^abouring classes, ignorant of  conditions in other lands and suffering greatly under present circumstances, were undoubtedly being influenced by the favourite argument of the Extremists:- that if the German &quot;Proletariat&quot; effects  now a Revolution which will place the power entirely in  the hands of the Soviets, the peoples of the Western nations are bound to follow their example, but that if this opportunity is  allowed to pass, the people of Germany will have to slave for the  capitalists of the Entente lands for a generation to come,,    After my converations and observations in Berlin, I regard it  as very probable that the again&amp;tatory activity of the Extremists, and the  sudden multiplication of the Extremist press, tend to give an  exaggerated impression of the real popular backing of this Party.  ThiB exaggerated impression ie, however, received not only by the stranger but by the German people themselves, and such an impression is significant in a time like the present, for it may determine what the nation would accept as &quot;inevitable&quot; in  the case of a Bolshevist coup.    The better olaBses and the more serious among the workingpeople &apos;and soldiers themselves,  are in genuine terror of such aBolshevist attempt.   Two of my informants, v/hom I consideredbest able to judge the general feeling,  fully expected suchan  attempt to be made before the convening of the national assembly.   Both believed that the attempt v/ould be unsucoess-ful, unliess in the mean time the demobilisation and a failure of provisioning in the big cities, had demoralised the present organisation of the Soldiers&apos;5 Councils.
Both, too, thought that the^s^rlc^uaness^ o^,suclv-an^rilrempt(probability of bloodshed, length of lighting,  etc.,) vwouldxdepend almost entirely on the chance circumstances of  the&quot;7nomenrtwhen it was made.     The possibility of a reaotipnarj Counter-Revolution,was considered, in Berlin at least as very remote.  The opinion was that only the chaos of a Bolshevist regime  could secure forthe reaction any support from the middle classes.  It  is per-haps owing to the chaos in the sources of news  from germany in the English Press, that one finds Englishmen very scepticalas to the genuineness of the Revolution.  What  the feelings ofthose circles may be which were the main support of the oldregime, I had no first-hand means of determining.  Certain Itis, however) that these are In a much smaller minority inGerman than they ever have been before, and they seemed to bethoroughly cowed by the evidences of the real popular  strengthof the Revolution.  The &apos;great majority of the German people,too, is undoubtedly at present more hostile and bitter towardjust these circles than toward anything or anybody else.     The German people as a whole has not the slightest Ideaof the real popular feeling in other lands towards it.  Thohorror of the German name which has been induced        the warby all the well known facto is not understood there.  little of all that has been published In the Entente and NeutralPress with regard to the events in Belgium and  the like, has .got into the German papers *  On the other hand  a groat dealwas made (particularly by the official Wolff Telegraph Agency)of supposed barbarities of &quot;Franctireurs&quot; in Belgium against german wounded in 1914, and the impression has  been carefullyfostered and supported by all sorts of arguments in the press that the Blockade of Germany justified everything that occurred in the case of the submarine warfare.
                           * i* i                          261      Aa A result tho ordinary German is quite  incapablo  ofappreciating why the new Germany, which he &quot;believes theRevolution to have assured, has not been immediatelyacclaimed by the popular sentiment of the Western nations.The result is that in many of those who desire  nothing  butpeace and o democratic internal regime, and who were willingto accept hard, though, not impossible terms of  peace, the oldsuspicions festered by.tho Pan-Gorman propaganda are re-awakening; - for instance, that England does not want a league of Nations or a Jus I&quot;, settlement of affairs, but  desires to annihilate and crush Germany,   I found this fear stilllurking in.the back of the minds of nearly all  with whom Ispoke, and the only reason they bould give was  that the AlliedPress, so far as quoted in their own, seemed to be concerned to cast .doubts, on the genuineness of the Revolution.  Theyevidently felt this genuineness so thoroughly themselves thatthey had hard work to attribute a questioning of  it to anybut ulterior motives.      Those most  oapable  of having a reasoned opirion on theeconomic  situation and the possible  effect of peace termsthereon,  varied  greatly in their  opinions.  All realised theextreme difficulty of the  situation  for  Germany:  - thenecessity of finding employment for great  numbers  of men at atime when the  plants are  exhausted and  the supplies  of rawmaterials depleted.  At the  same  time  labour is evidentlydetermined not to abate anything  of  the  advantages which ithas  gained as  to conditions  of labour,  wages, hours, etcThose who were not frankly hopeless  looked to  schemes ofeconomic, reform  which have been ably advocated by WalterRathenau  and by  Kuttner,  (Editor  in  Chief of &quot;VorwHrts&quot;).Rathenai&amp;Vs writings  have  received a  great deal  of attention from economists  and have  been the subject of heated  commentsin the  Reichstag,   Already in 1917,  Rathenau reckoned withthe  impossibility of Germany obtaining any  indemnity at  theend of  the war,  and with  somewhat the  same  general  economicsituation as she has to  face to-day,  although  in  a  lessalarming  form.    He  formulate,1, the problem  as  that  of how
to pry relatively high wages,  to&apos; raise heavy taxes,  to  secureraw materials,  and at the same time to produce cheaply  enough  to compete in the  largely hostile markets of the world. He found the only possible solution in an organisation of the entireproduction, export and import of the country in such a  form as would cut out a number of sources of unnecessary waste  which hespecified, and thus  increase the productivity of each unit oflabour.  Ho calculated out fairly carefully for certain groups of  industries the percentage of total  cost of production dueto  these oliminatlo  factors and outlined the organisation whichhe  regarded as necessary.   Kuttner,  since the Revolution, hastaken up and urges very much the same  scheme as being a first step  in the direction  of  Socialism, and  as being the only possible  step in  that  direction feasible under the  presentcircumstances.    He  reckons  candidly  with an  indemnity  to bepaid  by the German people,  at  least to Belgium and  France,although  he has  expressed no  expectation fts  to  its  amount.  If an indemnity be demanded from  Germany in such  a form that  Germany&apos;spayment  of it  is  dependent  on  her  selling the products  of her industry  in the  markets  of  the world,  it would thus seem  that oneof two  possibilities would  be  octualised.    Wither  Germany  wouldbe unable to perform the terms of  peace, with the result  of disorder  and Bolshevism  in  Germany,  and  thus perhaps the expensive necessity  to the  Allies  of  occupying  the  country; or Germany would manage  to  carry out  these  terms  by perfecting an organisation of her industry which would place her,  after  the completion of  her indemnity payments, in a  very powerful position as against  the  other industrial countries  of  th? world,       I would&apos;humbly venture the following  consideration If the rebuilding of devastated areas could be  carried out  as far as possible by  German lahcxurore,  this would at  once relieve
the difficulties of finding employment  for men  in Germany-under present circumstances,  and therewith relieve -the Allies  fromthe unwelcome probable effects of the ohaos  which would  resultthere from continued unemployment of suoh masses of men.   Itwould also leave the industrial population of Belgium and Francefree for its own industrial work.   For the rest the Alliesmight insist that  certain of the great German mining andindustrial conoerns should be handed over to Entente control for whatever period of years the Allies might, determine;  Germancapital in these undertakings being provided with low-interest-T)earing bonds.  In this way the Allies would themselves control the production  and distribution of produots of these works;German  industry would be  gaining no advantages for future trade from the working of them;  there could no longer  be objectionfrom our side to the supplying of raw material to them  in so faras this might be necessary under any scheme of the AlliedGovernments  for oarrying  on  these works;  the German labour involved would  be  sure of employment,  and thus  again the dangers which  could  accrue to us from  a  ohaos in  the German industrial world would bo averted;  the  entire  profits  from this labour would however  go toward liquidating  the  indemnity imposedupon Germany;   and the Allied Governments would control the distribution of all  the products.       Erom my observations and oonversat ions  in Germany afterthe Revolution, I  believe that the  popular  feeling  in germany might  be more ready to acquiesce, without  such  trouble  as  it is in our own interest  to avoid,  in an indemnity imposed in such terms,  than  in  one which  it  were left  to Germany to find themeans  of raising.    One of my strongest  impressions was that thegroat  majority  of  the people  would  accept any terms which  gave them hope of being able to maintain an ordered  life and to regain ultimately  something  of their former prosperity,

Hence, I venture to  suggest,  the^neoe-s---sity for the Allies, in their own interest, to  impose  the indemnity in such a form that the German people, in its presentdistracted condition, can still realise a possibility  of payingit without such Immediate material hardships  as would  make evena Bolshevist regime seem preferable to the mass of the people.                  NOTES.     1. The present industrial situation is complicated byan undoubtedly large issue of rather questionable paper-moneyduring the last two months.  Among other things great  quantitiesof new Reichsbank notes, not bearing the date August 4th 1914$as all previous ones Issued during the war had, and bearing ontheir face the promise to redeem on or after March 1st 1919, were much in evidonce since the end of October.  There have also beenruns on the banks.  Just this issue of new paper money made ithard to find out what tho real extent and  effects of these runshave been,     2. The fact that Hindenburg remained  at his post, and declared his willingness to work with the  provisional Governmenthas renewed and Increased his popularity.  There has always beena general acceptance of  the fact that he and the Kaiser  did not get along well together. To this was attributed, among  other things, the fact that  after his  early  successes in the  Easthe was  long kept on the  north-eastern  front with too few iren athis disposal  to undertake  any  serious  operations.  His  appointment as  Chief  of the General  Staff  was  looked on  as  a concession to  popular  demand  at a  time when it was  necessary  to raise  anew lean  after confidence  had  been shaken by Falkenhayii&apos; s  failureat  Verdun.  It was, however, generally believed that  for the past two years all real power - resided with Ludendorff.   The latter had apparently/             I quote thin date  from memory.

called into fccing all sorts of agencies reporting to  himaelf,and dealing with tho most various matters,  with which he,  inhis nominal official capacity, should have  had no concern.Some detnils of these were given in the press of the  Left  afterthe Revolution, all tending to show that Ludendorff had reallybeen the dictator of Germany for&apos;a year and a half.  This  was confirmed for me by some of my informants in the beet positionsto judge.      One could not help gaining an impression of the extremeunpopularity of the Ex-Crown Prince,    There remainedapparently more sympathy with the Ex-Kaiser, especially amongorthodox Lutheran circles.  With the great  majority of thepeople, however, he seemed thoroughly discredited.   Many  of the rulers of the smaller States had been very  unpopular.   3D  That the returning German troops have (at Hindenburg&apos;suggestion, it is said) been received with  flag3 and  garj-andsin many of the cities, I heard explained as follows by areserve officer to a Universtiy professor     It waa  feared thatthe lack of any 3uch reception might be felt by the troops,w&amp;o had after all fought to the last and suffered greatly,  asan indication that they were looked on as disgraced.
