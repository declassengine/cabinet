19I,   FOOD PRODUCTION.           The weather lias been favourable  on the  whole  with frost    in some districts.    Agricultural operations are being carried    on without much interruption.    Generally tho  work is  a week  or    two behind.      1*   district Agricultural Executive Committees.           District Agricultural Committees are  continuing their    work in connection with next year&apos;s feed production  scheme  and    are preparing schedules for estimates of cropping.    It is  too    soon to tabulate such estimates,  and thus get  an indication of    what the acreage next year is  likely to be,      2.   Supply of Fertilisers.             Before the cessation of hostilities., it had been consider-      :ed necessary, in view of the scarcity of tonnage, to reduce the      quantity of Phosphate Rock imported into this country, and the      output of Superphosphate in adequate measure was thereby threaten-      :ed.  The Board, through the Scottish Office, have brought to the      notice of tho Ministry of Munitions the serious effects which such      a reduction would have on agricultural production, and have asked      that arrangements should now be made for a largely increased im-      iportation of Phosphate Rock into this country as early as possible      in 1919.        3*  Sale of Horses Order.             During the week 355 licences for the sale of agricultural      horses were issued to farmers.   The total number of licences      Issued to date is 44,326.             The Board consider that there is no longer any necessity      for issuing individual licences for the sale of agricultural      horses.  A large number of Army horses are being put on tho market      and there is now little likelihood of agricultural holdings being      depleted of horse labour.   Until tho Defence of the Realm Regula-      :tion (2T) is revoked, however, a licence for the sale of such      horses must be given by the Board.   They have accordingly issued      a general authority to occupiers of agricultural holdings in      Scotland to sell or part with possession of any horses without      requiring such occupiers to apply for and obtain a special      licence.   This authority came into operation on 22nd November.        4.  Killing of Game.             The Board have issued the Grouse and Black Game (Scotland)      Order 1918 (Bo. 2) under Defence of the Realm Regulation 2R      authorising tho killing of grouse and black game in Scotland      at any time between 10th Decembor 1918 and 20th January 1919.jfoll.  COLLECTION of STATISTICS and RETURNS relating to AGRICULTURE.       Annual Estimates of the Produce of Crops.These /
         These estimates have now been completed, and a table- is,*;    *   annexed showing the principal results.         Tho oat crop has turned out much heavier than was expected,   the yield per acre, 41-J- bushels, being nearly equal to last year!s   record yield, and z\ bushels over the average.   The total produce,   6,457,000 quarters,&quot;exceeds last&apos;yoar!s record produce by over a   million quarters.  ,The crop has,  however,  suffered considerably   from wet weather, especially in the western bounties,    The yield   per aore of wheat and barley is slightly abovo the average, and   the produce of wheat exceeds last year!s by 98,000 quarters, while   barley shows a decrease of 16,000 quarters  owing to the diminished   acreage. &apos;         -The produce of potatoes,  1,150,000 tons exceeds that of   last year by 40,000 tons;  the yield per aero,  6.8 tons, is less   by .7 ton, but this is more than balanced by the increase in   acreage,         Turnips and swedes  show a total produce of 5,464,000 tons,   which is &amp;x million tons less than last year.   The yield per aero   is 13,8  tons, or little more than  two-thirds of last yea^s, and   the acreage is the smallest on record.  Throughout the sea3on the tail   crop has been, especially  in the Eastern counties, the poorest of   tho farm crops.          The. total produce of all kinds of hay,  018,000 ton8, is   83,000&apos;tons less than last year^.  , This is mainly aocounted for by \   the decrease in acreage, owing to  grass land being broken up for   cultivation.III.  . WAGES for AGRI0ULTIJRA1  WORKERS. - South Western Highlands (ITo.ll),          The District Wages  Committee for this area has fixed minimum   rates as follows     36/- per week for marriei shepherds, ploughmen and cattlemen of                                               18 and upwards,     34/-  &quot;        &quot;  single shepherds, ploughmen and cattlemen, of                                               10 and upwards,    &apos;     with an addition, in the case of shepherds,  of 2/6 per week for     koep of each deg necessarily kept.     go/- per week for male workers ox 18 and  upwards other than those    -           &quot;                                 already specified,     25/-      &quot; &apos;   &quot;  Byre women and dairymaids of 16 and upwards,     3/6   ff &quot;Cay for Female workers other than those specified of 18                                                     and upwards,    15/-   *:week for boys between 14 and 161  .          .    20/-   &quot;  &apos;. ?r   ,f   Tr      &quot;    16. and 18,    15/-   &quot;   ,T   &quot;  girls -   &quot;    14. and .16,    10/-   &quot;  ; ,r   &quot;   &quot;      &quot;    16 and 10.
