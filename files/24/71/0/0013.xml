Vs-                 (Note by the Secretary.)        With reference to Wsyr Cabinet ^05, MinuteLI circulate the attached note received from the Director of MilitaryOperations.(Initialled)&apos;  M.P.A.H.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W..1..    2nd December, 1918.O.l/B.E.F.6/15.War Office,   Whitehall, S.W.I.      28th November, 1918.Secretary,    War Cabinet..        With reference to War Cabinet ^05,  Minute 1, I havetaken up with the Adjutant-General the question regardingBritish prisoners in Germany who have not yet been identified,and I am informed that no such cases have been notified to thisOffice.        There appears to be an idea, which still seems to be  .prevalent, that there are. secret prisoners of war camps in.Germany.  This is, I believe, a myth.  In certain cases whtremen have concealed themselves behind the German lines it ia  -obviously a considerable time after being reported as &quot;misBin &quot;tfcat we hear of them..&apos;  It is pcsnible that in a few instancesthe Germans, either by inadvertence or intention, have notreported a man in their hands as a prisoner.  Such &apos;oases- have occurred here in respect  of enemy prisoners of war.                           (Signed)  P.  do B. RADCLIFFE.
