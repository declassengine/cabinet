SWISS LEGATION,

December 1st, 1918.

Monsieur le Secretaire d&apos;Etat,

Under telegraphic instructions from my Government I have the honour to transmit to Your Excellency the following communication which the German Government has requested the Federal Council to bring to the knowledge of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government:

"With the view of hastening universal peace, creating a lasting security against future wars, and renewing mutual trust between the nations, it appears urgently necessary to bring to light in full detail the events, in all the belligerent States, leading up to war. A complete and honest account of the world-situation, the negotiations between the Powers during July 1914, and the measures taken by each Government at that time, could and Would do much to overthrow the barrier if hatred and misunderstanding which has grown up between the peoples during the long war. A just appreciation of the march of events in the countries of friend and fee is the preliminary condition for the future reconciliation of the peoples and the only possible basis for a  lasting peace and a League of Nations.

The German Government, therefore, suggests that a Neutral Commission, consisting cf men whose          character and political experience would guarantee a just decision, should be appointed to examine the          question of the responsibility for the war.

The Governments of all belligerent Powers should declare themselves ready to place all the documents          at the disposal of the Commission which would be empowered to hear all persons who, at the period when War broke out, controlled the destinies of their countries, as well as all witnesses whose evidence might have an important bearing.

(Signed) SOLF."

Veuillez agréer, &amp;c.,

(Signé) CARLIN.
