A scheme for an Imperial \Y/T L&quot;ews Service hag. alreadybeen proposed by the Linistry of Information and, on therecommendation of the v/% Board, the Admiralty to whom the question was referred, have supported the proposal.  This scheme by which-news would be disseminated broadcast from high-power V//T stations in various parts of the &quot;Empire would ensure to each part ofthe Umpire a fuller knowledge of the conditions and the trend sfopinien of the other parts and so assist in united action in anycrisis that might arise.  It would further offer a ready means ofconveying to foreign countries an authoritative statement of facts in regard to the actions and intentions of the Lmpire, while intime of war such a &apos;chain of V//T  stations would be of greatstrategical value.  It wa3 proposed that the Hews Service shouldbe sent at Government expense, but since such a Service wouldnot occupy ,riore than a portion of each day, the stations might also be used for work on a commercial basis from which it isanticipated that a considerable  revenue would accrue.  Vhethersuch a Y//T lews Service be undertaken or not, some action in regardto the establishment of a British chain of high-power W/Istations I3 urgently necessary if this country  is to retainany freedom of action in regard  to &quot;Y//T oommuni cation in the future *The l1 r en oh and United States Governments have already taken steps  to establish a transatlantic v/T Service  and there is every  reason to believe that the latter Government is making great efforts  to dominate the V//T  situation in the Western Hemisphere,in addition to taking over permanently all w/T.  Stations in theUnited States.          Again,  tho United  States Government ara understood tohav-3 the intention cf making permanent their  control  of all  theland lines in the United States., These land  lines at presentbelong to  two commercial companies which  in their turn eitherown or lease from British  companies  all the transatlantic  cablesconnecting the United Kingdom  and Korth America with  the  exceptionof the German cable diverted to  Ingland and Canada during  the war.The policy of the United States  Government appears to be  to  obtaineffective  control  of  ;..ll  cables  owned  or  operated by  any  Companyorganised  under  the laws  of  the  United  States.   Such action  atonce  raises  in an acute form the question  of  State-ownership of transatlantic cables.          It is therefore suomitted that there is an urgent needfor a permenen t bod./ whose duty it would be exhaustively to&quot; study the whole problem of Imperial communications.  To this end thethree Services recommended, in October 1918, the immediate formationof a Communioationjj^ard, for &quot;the control of the w/T interestsOf tEe^rTtTsE&apos;&quot;Empire&quot; and to &quot;deal with questions of policyconnected with submarine cables, telegraphs, telephones, etc.and ail matters connected with the policy t-f communications withinthe British, Lmpire&quot;,  Such a Board would be in ne sense executivebut would be consultative and advisory and would, through iftaChairman
Chairman, laalre recommendations to the Gsvernraent for the inception of communication schemes which would he actuallycarried out under the direction of the appropriate Department.          It is proposed that this Board 3hould be founded  in the first place &quot;so as to embrace the United Kingdom and the crown colonies only&quot;, and that after its formation &quot;tho Self  GoverningDominions should be ur&amp;ed to set up similar Boards,........andshould he invited to depute gentlemen to represent these Bodieson the Eome Communications Beard.......          Since tho Departments most directly concerned in  theexecution of communication schemes are the three fighting Servicesand the General Post Office, it wa&amp; proposed that representativesof theso four Departments should be the &quot;permanent&quot; members ofthe Board under the Chairmanship of a representative of one ofthe other Departments interested - preferably the&apos;parliamentary secretary cf the Board of Trade - and that tho other Departments  -the Treasury, Foreign Office, India Office, and Colonial Office  -should he represented by &quot;advisory&quot; members v/ho would attend the meetings of the Board when they judged from the Agenda  or theMinutes of previous meetings that their presence would  be dosirahl          Tho Postmaster General has now signified his  agreement in principle to the proposed constitution of the Board  hut  inview of the great importance of the many questions now  arising andthe need for the formation of a comprehensive policy at theearliest possible moment, I ask that the War Cabinet will approve of the immediate formation of this Board as a matter cf urgency.MILKER.7th December,  1916,
