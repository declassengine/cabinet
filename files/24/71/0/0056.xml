Dear Colonel Hankey,

Transport Workers&apos; Battalions.

I enclose a Memorandum I have prepared with a view of getting instructions as to the steps to be taken in regard to the Battalions in the immediate future.

MEMORANDUM,     It is necessary that instructions bo given in regard tothe immediate future of tho Transport Workers1 Battalions.     Tho present strength of the jattaliono is 15,000 men,and this strength is in process of being increased (under theinstructions of the vur Gobinot given in September 1918)to  0,0u0 men.     The men of the Battalions h*vo been, arid aro now being,use- to supolemont deficiencies in Civilian Labour in connectionwith                    (A)  tho .?orts,                         the -it:&apos;: ilways , ,                    (C)-  the Canals,     Tnore  is annexed a statement showing tho average number  oftho men of  the Battalions  employed on Civilian aork  in  each oftho months  since ;*ay 1916.     Since  the strength  sa  brought up  to 15,000  (under  theinstructions of the &apos;-;!ar -Cabinet 11th -April  1918 -  309, minute 8)the -vora-iO n mb r  of men  actually available  for Civilian work has been  K bout -                                     13,000,  .that is after&apos; allowance has  been made  lor     (A)  The men  required to  maintain  the  Headquarters          of  the 9  different Battalions.     (3)  The men  absent on  account of sickness,  on  leave,          etc     (0)  The men  travelling to and from parts a     Th-3  average daily  number  actually ompi-..ye-.i  on Civilian.work ha s  been as under  :-               ...ay     1910 ...........   9,919                June        &quot;...........  10, 405                July &apos;      &quot;...........11,231               August      &quot;   ............ 12,491                3optember   &quot;   ...........  12,397                October     11...........  10,593                November   TJ   ............  11,713 .     The  number actually  employed on  Civilian \ ork was on the           2nd December, 1918 ...........  12,250     It  ia  of the  essence  of the  success of tho  Scheme that there  should be  always men at  the Headquarters of each of the Battalions  available to deal immediately with rushes of work: find so to avoid blocks.   Furtner,  the existence of such a reserve  has again and again acted as  a stimulus to Civilian La..:our and  thereby avoided the calling in of the Battalions.      It  ,;ill &apos;\y?. noted that now no sach reserve exiets.
    Eha maintenance of the flotf of traffic-through-H&apos;tha.Port-e.continues to present many difficulties.    Tho abolition of the Convoy System has relieved theposition as regards exceptional rushes of  work,  but on  theother hand the abandonment of the precautions that had to  botaken on the voyage against War perils has increased substantially the number of voyages,  and therefore (over aperiod) the oargo carrying power of the ships.    The volume of imports is limited by the receiving capacityof the ports, rather than by the cargo carrying power of theships available,  eund the receiving capacity of the ports is limited by tho rate at which tho imports can be distributedover the railways, coastwise, and by the canals,    The faot that there are now IE,OOO mon of the Battalionsactually employed on Civilian work demonstrates that there isa shortage of Civilian labour, for it must be borne in mind that the mon of the Battalions t.ru only employed after aLooal Committee (upon, which Organised labour is represented)has certified that there is in fact a deficiency of CivilianLab our.    Speaking generally, this shortage is an actual shortage;but in regard to the Iron Ore Cargoes it aiises in partbecause Civilian Labour, even when oily part time employed oneasier work, refuses to undertake this class of work, and inthe result tho greater part of the total Iron Ore importshave for many months been handled by tho mon of the Battalions.lh fact Steel Workw have for many months been kept going bythe men of tho Battalions&apos;&apos;. &apos;    The Ministry of Labour is organising the demobilisation of the Transport Workers in the Army, but it must take somemonths before tho forts can be again fully manned by the train-ed men now serving.  &apos;  In the meantime, the discharge of the Munition and otherCivilian v/ar Workers has increased the available supply  of civilian Labour..    At the moment oho of the most pressing questions is  how to keep the work in the Ports open for the bona fide transportworkers until they are released from the Army,  but also  tomaintain tho flow of traffic which is essential to getting theNation back to Industry and Commerce and thereby the Amy backto Civilian employment.    I am acting as Chairman of the Port Demobilisation Committeeappointed by the Minister of Labour.  Upon that Committee thereare 12 representatives of the Employers and 12 representatives  -of organised Labour.  I was attached to that Committoo,  in an advisory capacity, as tho Chairman of the xtfrt and transit executive Committee. I have no vote..  I wan nominated as chairman by representatives of Labour and olected unanimously.
                       - 3 &quot;*          On that  Committee both  the Employers end Labour -              (1)   Attach  the  greatest  importance to preventing                   the  Forts being  flooded with e.n excess, of                   casual  labour.              (?)   Fear under  employment  simost as much as                   unempToymcnt.              (?-)   Insist  that the  work in the Ports must be                   kept open for  the bona fide Transport Workers                   until they  arc released from the Army.          They point  out that  if  the Ports ore flooded with the     men discharged from Munition and other  Civilian War Work, not     only will the bona fide Transport  Workers in the Army be     deprived of  their  permanent  jobs,  but that they will find     themselves crowded out  from  the houses.          To meet  these difficulties e?ch Port i  now engaged oa     working out  a Registration System  in connection with the     unemployment  Donation,  the object  of which will be to provide     that whilst  the  Port  will be fully manned with sufficient labour,     it oil! not be flooded  with  casual labour at the risk of     permanent under-employment.          If these Registration Systems can be brought into     successful operation  a  bio; step will have, been taken towards     the solution of  a  great part of the  problem of casual labour;     one of the great problems of social  economies under peace     conditions.10.       Holding these vies  the Port  Demobilisation Committee  is     unanimous in pressing that the men of the Transport Y/orkers     Battalions should continue to  be employed until the ports can     again be fully manned by  the return  from  the Army of tne bona     fide Transport Workers.11.       It might be possible to maintain the flow of traffic     through the  ports without the  Battalions, if  the fullest possible     use could be  made of  all  Civilian  Labour  released from     Civilian ;:/a.r  Services.   The  difficulty  would be in making     such Civilian Labour, without  organisation, mobile.  But     the success  of this  plan  would depend,  in the main, on whether     Organised Labour in the Ports  would  work  with this outside   -  Labour.          Judging by  the views expressed  at  the;  Port Demob * lisation     Committee I doubt whether this co-operation could be  obtained.     The feeling is so strong  that  -             1st.  The permanent  jobs  in the Ports mu3t be  kept                   open for the bona  fide Transport Workers until                   they are released from&apos; the  army.             2nd.  Outside labour must  be kept out  of  the  Ports.
                        M 4 **    If the demobilisation of tho Transport /orkers1  Battalionsbe deferred,, then all bona fide Transport  orkers belonging tothose Battalions would be registered under the RegistrationSystem that is being established, and they would ultimatelytake up their old positions in their Torts.  Tho other menin the Battalions ( that is, those who had not been TransportWorkers before enlistment) would ultimately have to find their way back to other employments.     As between the men in the Transport Workers battalions and the rest of the Home Defence Army, it should be borne inmind that during tho Jar tho men of the Battalions have earned in civilian pay upwards of  1,600,000, so that there is ground for postponing their demobilisation in favour of otherBattalionso     It is recognised that the employment of the Transporty/orkers1 Battalions for the purposes indicated above would bea departure from the principle approved by the frar Cabinet,namely, thai  ;he Battalions were primarily part of the HomeDefence Army kept mobilised ready to repel an invasion, andthat they should only be employed on civilian work (a) whenthe men could bo spared from Military du&amp;y, and  (b) whenCivilian Labour was not available.     In the interests of the Country as a whole, and in theinterests of the bona fide Transport workers, both those whoare now in  the Army and tho 3$  who will hereafter man the ports,  I am of opinion that the  Transport WorkersT Battalionsshould be maintained in a full  state of efficiency.and continueto be employed, for some months  longer.     If this recommendation is  to be acted on then I submit that instructions  should bo given that  the Transport  Workers1Battalions  are, for all demobilisation  purposes, \iO be dealtwith apart  from all other Battalions in the Home DefenceArmy0   Their full  strength, in both officers and men,  shouldbe maintained for  the presents9th December, 1918.
