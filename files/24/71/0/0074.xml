W. CvMINISTRY OF SHIFPING.Note by the Shipping Controller cn the  tonnage  situation In relation to future shipping policy.The Armistice has brought with lightning  speed an entirechange of conditions.  Immediately prior  to the  Armistice the  pressure on shipping was at its maximum.   To add to the great  need theAmerican programme had demanded enormous  extra assistance both for troops and supplies.  With the conclusion of the Armistice  and the cessation of hostilities an Immense amount of tonnage has come quioklyfree and it is difficult for the moment to utilise  it fully.    Thetfaited Kingdom is flooded with foodstuffs.  The  ports are blockedand it is difficult to get cargoes through because  of detentions and delays.Australian wheat, which to some extent relieves the  position,  and every kind of commodity which the country requires is being brought  freely  in and no difficulty is expected with regard to required importations.Immediately on the Armistice being concluded and the possibilities beingseen the regular Lines were given permission to make arrangements forresumption of services as far as this could be promptly done.        In the Interests of National Economy the moment Is opportune for the discontinuance of the system of general requisition as an essen-tial preliminary to the proper&apos;re-establishment of British trade,bride:- private mxaagement costs of working can be reduced in many ways and uo\y    r*av.al restrictions are to a large extent removed,  theefficiency of shipping can also be very materially improved.A number of ships have been sent to Australia to bring
           The Controller therefore  proposes  to  complete  arrangements as rapidly as possible for the substitution  of  direction and  control of shipping by licence in plaoe of  control by requisition.  Care  will be taken that the change is so brought about as to  ensure satisfactory moderate freights for essential supplies  and the Controller believes that under this system freights will rapidly fall even below  requisitionlevel.  The power of re-requieitlon  will,  of  course,  be retained for . use in case of need and certain tonnage will in any event have  to be kept under requisition for some considerable time.            Prompt action is necessary to  avert  difficulties and to endeavour to get back as quickly as possible some of the enormous trade which during the period of the war has been lost to Britain. Foreign competition is already active and Japan, America, and other countries are already pushing into all trades.        The Controller trusts, therefore,  that  the tfar Cabinet willgive immediate approval to the general policy outlined. 13th December, 1918.
