             This Document Is the Property of            Hjg -:,vk\n &apos;lc  i&apos;&apos;!a.jesty&apos;s Government. jZ   &apos;----------------                         30th November, 1918*REQUISITIONING OF PPJEMISES.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet*          I note  that  at  a meeting of the Coma.lit too of HomeAffairs  on the 21st instant  it tias decided  (ItLnuto 7) tore com.lend              &quot;That the Admiralty and the Controller General    &quot;of Merchant  Shipbuilding should vacate  at the earliest    &quot;possible  moment the  portion of the new  public offices    &quot;in TCLnpj Charles Street and Great George Street occupied    &quot;by them&apos;1.          Tho  Committee which arrived at this decision oon-disted of the President  of the Board of Education and thePresident of  the Local Government Board, and as these are tisetwo  Departments which are wait in: to step into the Admiralty&apos; ss&amp;oes in that building,  the  recommendation  is entitled only tothe  full  consideration accorded to individual requests fromthe  Heads of  these two Departments.          The  Adiiralty and the Ministry of  Shipping atpresent  occupy over 180, 00  square foot of  floor space in thebuilding referred to, the staff accommodated there being over2,800 in number.    The staff belongs principally to theDepartments working under the Controller and Lord Pirrie, andalthough the  Centrollers staff will be rapidly reduced, thereis a great deal of work remaining to be done in the immediatefuture in closing down the enormous number of transactions which have been entered into for shipbuilding and other supplies.         The  best estimate that can be made at present isthat wo may hope to have surrendered ac coma da t ion occupied.by about 1,000* per sons by the end of the next three months.Any more rapid evacuation of this particular building couldonly &quot;be effected by taking over other large buildings in thevicinity  of the Admiralty temporarily.   a This I understand tobe contrary to other recommendations decided upon by theCommittee of  Home Affairs at the same meeting, and in anycase tho waste of time and the confusion resulting from atemporary move of this kind would be very serious.(Sd.)  EPJO  GEDDSS.             30,1.1.18.
