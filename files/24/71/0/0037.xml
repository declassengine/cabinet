On the 27th ult,  the Presidentrecalved a large deputation of the leading representatives of theBritish Pishing Industry who pressed for the creation  of  a Ministry of fisheries and for Government assistance in the development of fisheriesgenerally.   A number of resolutions paased by various localauthorities and trade bodies have been received  supporting theproposals for the creation of one separate Department  for Fisheries,     Pishing operations.   Restrictions on night-fishing  have beenrelaxed at Plymouth, Falmouth and in the Lowestoft Command, ^here alsoa considerable extension of area  has been  allowed.

                             Intelligence Division,     Education Branoh.   It is clear from the correspondence  reachingthis branch that tW cessation of hostilities has not only set  thesoldiers thinking of their future careers, hut that  the  minds ofyouths relieved from immediate anxiety as to the interruption of  theirstudies by the call of military aervioe are also turning to thoughts of land and to the preparations necessary for entering on a farminglife.   In dealing with applicanta for advice in some of these  cases,both from soldiers and oivilianafc it has been considered necessary  topoint out that, while there ia no reason to regard the prospects  ofgeneral farming as anything but favourable, it must  not  be expectedthat success can be attained in this, any more than in any otherskilled occupation, without proper training and in&amp;ufcfory.          The recommendations of Lord Selbome^s Agricultural PolicySub-Committee with regard to the taking over by the  Board of thewhole financial responsibility for agricultural education have  beenunder consideration and proposals have been submitted to the treasury for the revision of the basis on which grants have hitherto been  made.

           vrith regard to the second quality and inferior seed, necessarily obtained in some hulk, it is hoped to make arrangements shortly for the disposal of these commodities to advantage (a) through the Ministry of Pood, or (b) to farmers locally for feeding purposes.           Forms of contract for the 1919 crop have now been circulated and nearly 3,000 acres have been already offered for flax,           The drying tests have proved sufficiently satisfactory to enable a decision to be reached as to the types of drying plant to be installed at the factories.                                Land Division.Snail Holding Colonies.      Heath Hill.   Corn drilling has been hindwrfid owing to a showery week.   It has not been possible to &quot;put in&quot; all the winter corn as suggested, and the season is now rather too far advanced to drill much more.   It is intended, therefore, to finish two small fields with wheat and then to suspend operations until early spring.      Holbeach.   Everyone is busy among the potatoes, and if the weather holds good it is hoped to finish in about a fortnight.      Patrington.  The farming operations consisted of potato lifting and thatching.   Steam cultivation has been             completed.   Owing to the wetweather it has been practically impossible to do much work on the land.tithe, Copyholds Commons and Survey Section.   Many enquiries have been received as to the procedure under the new Act in redemption and in conversions of corn rent into tithe rentcharge.   In many instances tithe owners have indicated their intention to apply for compulsory redemption, but no such applications have actually been received since the passing of the new Act.           Among the transactions completed by this Branch during the past week has been the issue of the Board1s approval to a scheme submitted under the Commons Act, 1899, by the Cannock Rural District Council for the regulation of Shoal Hill Common,   One of the main objects of this scheme ia the prevention of fires which have frequently occurred on the common and have caused much damage,jjelham Estate.   Until the beet is lifted other general arable work is more or less at a standstill.   The few white turnips have been lifted and carried to the yards for the oattie and the swedes are being treated in a similar manner, as sheep-folding is not being practised to any large extent this season,   wh.en all the roots have been dealt with, a large proportion of the staff will be drafted to further uprooting of hedges and levelling down on this section, with the hope that Rolleston may receive similar  -attention before the tenants go out next April.           Arrangements have now been made with the Food Production Department for securing the adequate amount of basic slag required in time for early sowing.   Supplies of flue-dust are coming to hand well, and it is being applied to all the land which is to be devoted to the growth of beet seed next year, as well as the lighter land to be set aside for roots.Live

The tabulation of the estimates  ofproduction of potatoes and root^ in England and Wales, has now beencompleted.   Potatoes have yielded 6.6 tons per acre - a third ofa ton over average, and the total production, 4,209,000 tons, 1b868,000  tone more than last year!e record production.   Roots arealso above average, turnips and swedee giving 13.2 tons, andmangolds 20.6 tons, per acre.   The total production, owing to the reduced  acreage, is in each case however, rather below last year&apos;e.The production  of     turnips and swedes is 12,018,000 tons, thatof mangolds 8,231,000 tons.         Correspondence has been Initiated with the Customs and excise with a view to transferring the collection of  the acreageand live stock  returns from that Department to the Board next year.         The Committee on Live Stock reported that the dairy herdin Great Britain on 4th November was about the same as a monthpresjlously, and the beef cattle about 85,000 less.    Sheep were reduced  by a million head.   These results are normal for the timeof year.  Breeding sows showed a reduction, owing doubtless 5.0 theprobable shortness  of feeding stuffs foreseen in September- and october.  But  with the release of further corn  offals, the  situation will  probably improve, as the market reports show a greatly  improveddemand for  store pigs in the last fortnight  of November.      Agricultural Wages Board.   The 8th number of the Wages BoardGazette  appeared on tire 30th November.         A meeting  of the Administration  Committee was held  on the27th  November,  and  dealt with a variety  of matters affectingIadministration.  Among  these may be mentioned  speoially  the largenumber  of questions which have been raised as  to the  applicabilityto  particular oases  of  the minimum rates of  wages fixed by  the wages board.   The  Wages Board cannot,  of course,  settle these  questionsauthoritatively, but  the Administration  Committee, after  severalmeetings, have  now laid  down  certain  principles,  on  the basis  ofwhich opinions  will  be  expressed  (with all  the  necessary  reserves)                                                             for
for  the guidance of the persona concerned.        The Committee also had &quot;before thorn a question as to the reckoning, as part payment of minimum wages, of Michaelmas money inNorfolk.   The matter raises a legal point of considerable difficulty,and  as it also involves the. question of the reckoning of other lumpsums, such e.g, as       lambing money, bonuses, etc, it may benecessary to take a case to the Courts for the purpose of having theprinciple settled.        The Administration Committee receives periodical reports fromthe  District Wages Committees as to Permits of Exemption applied forand  granted, and periodical reports from the Chief Inspector on theaction taken in regard to complaints of the non-payment of theminimum rates, and it exercises on behalf of the Board a general supervision over the work of enforcement.   In addition, it dealswith such questions as appeals against the decisions of DistrictWages Committees on Permit cases,  any difficulties arising from theform in which the Orders of the Board have been made,  and similarmatt4rs.   It is thus coming %v be one of the most importantCommittees of the Wages Board, by which a good deal  of the actualwork of the Board,  apart from the fixing of rates of wages, will,in future, be done.        During last week 58 new cases of complaint of non-paymentof the minimum rates were reoeived, the largest number from any single county being 10 in the case of Essex;  16 oases of complaintwere sent to the In8pectors for visit;  enquiries by correspondencewere made in 106 cases;  and 14 oases were completed.    reports were reoeived from Inapectora in 13 cases.                       Joint Committee.             3-oard of Agriculture and Ministry of Food.        During the past week the Deputy-Director met in conferenceat Guildford,  the Surrey Representatives of the  Joint Committee;he also attended an adjourned meeting at Taunton of theSomersetshire Representatives.        At Guildford, considerable interest was shown in the JointOommittee&apos;6 work of making the agriculturist conversant with government policy affecting his business.   This feeling wasendoreed at the adjourned conference of the Somerset Representatives.        At both these meetings the establishment of stands onCorn Exchanges,  to act as a medium for distribution ofinformation to farmers, was heartily welcomed and a keen desirewas expressed that such stands should immediately be established in the different areas.

                           Establishment  Branch.          The position with regard to the Board18  accommodation growssteadily Torse.   Urgent demands are being made  by three  Divisions  ofthe Board for further accommodation for staff necessary  to undertake work of an essential character.   It is understood that  the  Office  of&apos;7ork8 propose to give ua additional acoommodation  in Norfolk Street,Strand, and the Board&apos;s staff will then be distributed in 15 separatabuildings, distant from one another.   It is thus  becoming quite  ,Impossible to maintain any effective supervision or organisation  at headquarters in regard to operations which are in  many respects of paramount importance to the country at the present time.          Immediate action ia being taken by a new section to deal  witjithe training of officers and men on demobilisation who desire tosecure agricultural employment.          The keenness of !   competition for positions connected withthe direction of farm colonies for ax-service men  is evidenced by thenumber of applications received for one $oat recently advertised  by theBoard.   The applicants exceeded 450*          It may now be mentioned that of 305 men  released by the board for active aervice with the forces, 32 have made the supreme aaorifice,2 are missing, 6 became priaonera of war and 34 other sustainedcasualties of a more or leaa serious oharacter,   9 officers gainedmilitary distinctions and 4 were mentioned In despatches.                            General Branch,          Resolutions on various  subjects were Received from agricultural&quot;bodies.   They chiefly related to the shortage of imported and otherfeeding  stuffs,and fertilisers.  The position waa explained in each case and where necessary Ministry of Pood or Pood Production Departmentinformed.          Several reports  to Treasury as  to desirability of capitali-asues being  allowed to certain agricultural undertakings were sent in.          The question of  the use to vhich the 20 oinemotora now out of commission with  the War Aims Committee oould be put was considered and alternative proposals have been  aubmitted -      (a)  for  putting up a  scheme  for the  Government Departments           interested  to  send  the motors  round the  country.-with a           joint program  of films;      (b)  for  considering whether they  could not be used by  this           Department  for  showing agricultural films.          The whole matter will  be  gone  into  oarefully in detail when the  general  line of  the Board&apos;a  wishes la indicated.          The  normal work of the Board  proceeds  on  lines  indicated  in previous reports.ith December, 1918.                              Secretary,
