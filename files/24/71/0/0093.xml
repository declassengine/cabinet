Before  your  telegram received His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided  to modify  both  proposals in view of altering circumstances never intended that arrangement with United States regarding rebates on  military wool should  apply to 240,000 bales shipped this year  for  unrestricted use. As  regards wool already shipped America full brad ford civilian issue prices  without  rebate will be paid with single exception  of  25,000 bales for the American Navy on which rebate will  be  granted  to United litotes  Government equal  to rebate on wool used for British Military pur- poses.  Proposal  in the telegram of November 18th was withdrawn  by  my telegram of  1st December owing to the American military requirements having  practically come to an end.  His Majesty&apos;? Government  have telegraphed  to  South Africa that altered circumstances render it un- desirable to offer increased percentage in commutation of share  of expected profits,    union Government has been authorised  to  repeat  offer of  October 1917 and to invite South African farmers  register  sale of their individual&apos; wool clips at 5JT. above 1913-14 prices with  eventual right to receive half of any profits which may be realised on resale. Hie Majesty1s Government hope that the Government of theCornmonwealth of  Australia will  be completely satisfied with the above  and  will beI relieved from the necessity of offering any special  explanation  to  the sheep growers.
