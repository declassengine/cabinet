&apos;Ap^        \\ CONTRIBUTION OF THE OVERSEAS DOMINIONS TOWARDS ft  6459  ) Jj     THE ARivIY OP OCCUPATION IN GERMANY.      1    - 1   l.    In a  Paper already  circulated  to the War Cabinet        (0.1/185/525were summarized  the probable commitments        of the  British  Empire in regard to Armies of Occupation,        amounting to from  14  to 2o Divisions overseas, apart from        peace garrisons at home and abroad amounting to not less        than 300,000.             2.    The provision of the  numbers required will obviously        throw a great strain  on the resources of-Great Britain.  The        great Overseas Dominions have shared with the British Army        the vicissitudes and  glories  of the various campaigns now        successfully concluded, and  I hope  that  they will equally be        ready to participate  in  the  irksome but  necessary duties of        garrisoning  occupied  territory,  Without such occupation the        fruits  of victory, for which they have made such sacrifices,        will not be  gathered.             3.   I  would propose  that  the  period of occupation should  be        considered in two  stages,  as  follows                   (a)  The period of partial  demobilisation, during which                        time  the  troops of  Overseas Dominions  should  be                        repatriated  as  ships  are available, with the  ex-                        ception of two Australian Divisions and two                        Canadian Divisions,  forming  part of the Army  of                        Occupation in Germany,                   (b) Permanent Army of Occupation  for an indefinite                        period after demobilisation has been completed,                        to which Canada and Australia  should  each  con-                        tribute  one  infantry  Division.  It is  possible                        that  the  recruiting of  these Divisions  would                        necessarily  be on a voluntary  basis, in which                                                                  case
        cage similar arrangements might be made as in the case        of the British Regular Army, i.e. special leave and  *        financial inducements should bo offered, the expenditure        involved according to the  terms of the Armistice to  fall        on the German Government.     4.   A Brigade of all arms has been  contributed by canada to the Allied Forces in Siberia, and  it is hoped thatthe maintenance of this Brigade may be found possible bythe Canadian Government, also presumably  on  a voluntary basis.     5.   As a rough estimate, the proportion of British,&apos;Canadian, and Australian contingents proposed above, as comparedwith the present numbers in theatres of- operations, wouldapproximately be as followsBritish20$ to 25$or if the Regular ArmyOverseas is added30$ to 37$Canadian18$Australian20$(Signed)   HENRY WILSON,G v I a G* S*General Staff,    War Office,  S.W.1,11th December 1918.
