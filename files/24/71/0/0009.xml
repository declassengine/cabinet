In accordance with the armistice the Gorman Governmenthave announced that the German war on merchant shipping hasboon terminated and that no further obstacles will be put byGermany in the way of Uoutral commerce and shipping.   all restrictions upon neutral trade or shipping imposed by Agree-merits betwoen the German Government or Gorman, private interestsand the neutral Governments or neutral private interests aroannulled,     Tho Swedleh Minister in London has asked whether theAllied Governments propose to maintain a blockade of the Baltic,ond, in particular, whether goods of German origin destined forSweden or Swedish goods of contraband nature destined for Ger-many will be liable to capture.   German ships have ceased trad-ing with Horwa.y for fear of capture by the Allied patrols.   TheAdmiralty have decided that no modification of our blockadearrangements in the Baltic should yet be made.   2!hey do not, how-ever, think that trade should bo interfered with, provided it takes place under existing agreements.   Vessels? at presentblacklisted will continue on the blacklist and will be subject

Ho concessionswill an yet bo granted to German vessels.   3)ho  position of Gormanships trading in the Baltic has still to be deoided by tho  AlliedGovernments.     Hitherto the Army Council, in oases where  territory has  been occupied by the Allied forces, have certified that  the territory in question may be regarded as in friendly occupation and that trade facilities may under suitable supervision be  resumed.   Theyconsider that this procedure is hardly suited  to tho conditionscreated by the Armietioo, and suggest that the  new situation  shouldhe dealt with by a general proclamation.   The  Couuoil distinguish between throe kinds of territory:-          (a) Heoccupied Allied Territory,          (b) Occupied enemy territory which will not be rostor-                       ed to the snowy,          (o) linemy territory temporarily ooeupied by the Allies                       under the Armistice.     They suggest that an Inter-departmental Conference should becalled at an early date to consider whether the present restrictionson trade applied to territories (a) and (b) should not now  be partialy relaxed *     It will henceforth be the policy of the British licensing authorities to reduce the list of goods which may not be exported from the United Kingdom as much as possible.   The various  licensingCommittees have been asked to call attention to any article??  whichmay with advantage be removed*     After the 30th of Hovember there will be no further censorshipof parcels post and sample post packets addressed to neutral  countries-triee in ijlurope other than paroole containing printed, written or 1

Tho Danish Minister in London suggests that the Allied  Gov-   ernmonts should allow Denmark to import feeding stuffs  and fertili-   sers in order that the Danish farmers may increase their production   of butter, fat  and other agricultural produce for tho rovietualling   of Central Europe.   He points out that such a measure  would save   tonnage and generally simplify tho quootion of relief.  The  Danish   Minister has been informed that  the Associated Governments will   carefully bear hie suggestion in mind.    Prince V.indischgratz, the   late Hungarian Food Controller,  is at present in Switzerland en-   endeavouring to found an organisation for supplying foodstuffs and raw   materials to the States formerly eompaoing the H&amp;psburg  znpire.   Important Austrian industrial interests are behind  this scheme.  An   organisation will be formed of representatives from the various   States which will endeavour as far as possible to preserve the   economic unity of Austria-Hungary in respect of posts,  railways,   currency, customs and general trade.   Prince  indisobgratz  is;   opposoa to the incorporation of German  Austria with the Geman   -Empire.   HOBUY.  In view of the Armistice the Allied Blockade Committee   do not consider it necessary to press for the conclusion  of  branch   Agreements with the various Norwegian Associations.   Shey think   the best course is to continue the present provisional  arrangements   for a period of three months.   Th&amp; Allied Blockade Committee have   also decided that it is not in the present circumstances  necessary

The    United States Tar Trade Board have granted licences for the export    of 40,000 tono of breadstuffs to bo  consigned to the Netherlands    Government.S6. SWIT^SHLAflD,  The Swiss Government have decided that enemy  atooite  in    Switserland cannot be handed over to the Gorman Government  until    the        has been dissolved and until the intentions of the    Allied Governments have been aseertainedc   For the purposes of    their Agreements with the belligerent Po-wers* the Swiss Government    do not consider the armistice as being a cessation of hostilities.S7* SPA IK.  The Spanish iimbasey at Viashington have assured the  United    States State Department that the German allies in Spain taken over    by the Spanish Government have boon  transferred absolutely  by their    owners and that no payment will be made to Germany in rssoeot of    the m.    The Associated Governments will be free to claim  the    ships as part of the war indemnity for Allied shipping-sunk by    Gorman submarines If desired.g8. QTTOMAB EjMPMm      flaval-Authorities at Constantinople urge that    an Allied representative should at once bo appointed to inveoti-    gate the food position in the Ottoman JSapire, to relieve dietrose,    and to prevent abuses.   At present  there is no check upon  food    hoarding and profiteering in Constantinople, and grave disorders
    aro likely to arise unless immediate steps are token to remedy    the position.g9* SUIii-UiG lOSSKS.
