Orders have been  issued  that  operations  are  to  be restricted  to the  maintenance of tho  present  line by means ofan active defensive, and I am of the  opinion  that tho forcesat tho disposal of General Ironside  are  sufficient to ensurethis.hURhAHSX,     General Eaynard1s views  as to the  policy to  be  pursued in Murmansk are expressed  in  the attached  Paper,   He pointsout that at ail costs we must maintain  our present position,as we are pledged  to defend the inhabitants,  both Russian andKarelian from the  aggressive  policy  of  the Bolsheviks,  any advance by whom would be followed immediately by  thocustomary massacres of all who do not agree with  theirifieaSo   He also lays great stress on the  importance offulfilling all the conditions of the  agreement  made  with theLiurraansk Council in July,-  1918*   Up  to  tho present  thoprovision of foodstuffs for Civilians and  of  financial aidhave been far from satisfactory, but  the so matters are  beingtaken in hand and  a radical improvement  will  shortly be  made *                                                         He
He considers the military situation from two points of view :-

(a) If an offensive towards Petr?grad is to be undertaken by the Allies.

(b) If we are to maintain our present position on a defensive basis.

Under (a) he puts forward two possibilities :-

(i) An advance on Petrograd down the Murmansk Railway, for which he considers 15,000 reinforcements would be necessary.

(ii) An advance to Petrozavodsk, as subsidiary t? the main advance on Petrograd by a force based on Reval or  some other Baltic Port.

To carry out this scheme he asks for some 2,500 reinforcements.

As the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is at present against any such offensive, I do not propose to enlarge on this view.

To render our defensive policy a success he considers it necessary to advance to a line through S?geja on the railway, and Voranzhe on the Soroka - Pevyenets road, representing a forward movement of about 60 miles. The holding of this line would adequately cover the advanced base which he is establishing at S?roka, and would secure communications by the S?roka - Onega sleigh route with the forces based on Archangel. Further, it ?pens up to recruiting a larger area of Southern Kar?lia, and thus materially assists our ultimate object, the formation of Russian and Karelian troops capable of defending their own territory. This movement he considers can be carried out with the forces now at his disposal, if provided with the equipment and transport necessary for the organization, from Allied and local forces already at his disposal, of a greater number of mobile troops than was originally contemplated, and also with sufficient technical and administrative personnel to ensure the adequate running of the railway.

Such an advance will increase the numbers of Civilians, for whom food and financial aid must be supplied, by 20,000. I am of the opinion that General Maynard should be authorised to make this advance, and that provision be made for supplying the additional population.

Further, I consider that a statement of our policy in North Russia should be made to the local inhabitants, urging them to push forward with the greatest energy the training and organization of their own troops, so that our occupation can ?e terminated at the earliest possible moment.

I am addressing the War Cabinet on a separate Paper with reference to the necessity in this country ? a statement of policy in so far as the question touches the Army and Military Operations.

FUTURE POLICY FOR MURMANSK FORCE,     In the event of our deoiding to continue  operations  inthis region until Bolshevik power is overthrown.     In the above event,  we shall have to  recognise  the necessityfor employing far larger forces than are now engaged.  The smallAllied force in the Murmansk district has  fulfilled  its original purpose, but even after the arrival of the two fresh british battalions, which are expected daily,  it will  be  able  to  do littlemore than remain on the defensive,  and ensure  the safety  of thearea already occupied against renewed Bolshevik aggression.  TheBolsheviks are undoubtedly making great efforts to re-organisetheir forces, and they have at their disposal  ample  material ofwar.  They are endeavouring to secure discipline  by  a  system of terrorism so brutal that the opponents of  Bolshevism outside thearea occupied by the Allies are being rapidly  exterminated, whilstthose who remain have no choice but to serve their Bolshevikmasters.  Officers are being forced to join,  their wives  and familiesbeing held as hostages.  If they fail to carry out their  duties  tothe satisfaction of the Bolshevik leaders,  their  wives and familiesare killed.  This discipline, based on terror,  however repugnant toour ideas, is gradually moulding the Bolshevik Army  into  a controllable fighting force, the moral of which is  undoubtedly  being raisedby the revolutionary outbreak in Germany,  which is regarded as a successful Bolshevik movement.  If therefore it is our intention tooverthrow Bolshevism we ought, in my opinion,  to  strike as soon  andas strongly as possible.  The longer we delay the greater will proveour task.  Further, too great a reliance on the active assistance*f anti-Bolshevik Russians would be a grave error.     As regards the action of my Force,  I  consider it  could be most usefully employed in a movement down  the  Murman Railway in.conjunction with an advance on PBTROSRAD by a force  based on a Bulfof Finland port; such port to be that most nearly connected withPETROGRAD by railway, and available under  winter  conditions - proba-bly REVAL; though I am not in a position to offer expert  opinionon this point.     Until the arrival of next Summer the  extent  to  which I couldco-operate would necessarily be small, since (a)  my  only  base wouldbe MURMANSK, and the long line of single railway  (badly in need  of repairs and improvements)would not suffice for a  larger force, and(b) in the sparsely populated country through which  I  should be operating, I could not find winter accommodation  for the  forcenecessary for a big southward movement.     when, however, the &quot;White Sea is opened, I could utilise KIMas an additional base, but this unfortunately is  not likely to bethe case until July.  Should any movement  in force down the MURMAIRailway on ZVANKA and PETROGRAD be decided upon for  next  Summer, itwill be necessary to take in hand at an early date a large programmeof repairs to the permanent way and railway rolling  stock, and improvements at the port of KEM.  Anestimate both &apos;of  the material and personnel required can be drawn up when once  the strength  of theforce to be made available i3 decided upon.  A Railway Battalion,&apos;or its equivalent, should be sent out at an early date, unless we decide definitely to withdraw before the spring thaw.  It is  ofcourse impossible to foretell with any degree of  accuracy what  thesituation will be in 7 months time, but unless by then the Bolshevikpower is much on the wane, and having in view my  long                                                      , .  line  /
 line  of communication,  I  do  not  thinx  it would  bo of any use to attompt a move on PBEROORAD  with a  force available south of PETROZAVODSK of loss than 15,000 infantry with  a  proportion of other arms.    As neither  Karelians  nor Finns  oar Id bo regarded as available for the operations:, as Russian support would bo an unknown factor,  and  as  -  from present  indications - it is far from  certain that cither  French; Italian or Serbian troops will be  retained  here tor so long,  my estimate would amount practically to  my force  being increased  to a strength of  2  British Divisions. If  however it is decided  to  commence at once  a  move on P3TROGRAD by  a  force based on  R3VA1 (or some  other Baltic port), I consider that  even during the Winter  months  I could co-operate with good results by moving on PSTR0MVOP3K,  the  its   oo of which from SOROKA is a  little under  200 miles,   I coa dtiar I should have a reasonable hope of capturing PETROZAVODSK, if,  in addition to being left  with all troops now  under my command and with the 2 battalions and detachment R, .?.rF, whose  arrival I  am expecting, I am givon the following reinforcenents;-                 1 Machine Gun Company,                 1 British infantry  Battalion,                 1 Pioneer Battalion; Of  the above, only tho  Pioneer Battalion is in  addition to what was originally allotted  me, seeing that I  have already sent to Archangel 1 battalion and 1 M,,Go0oy,  Should the Serbian  or any other battalion bo  withdrawn, I should  require an additional British battalion from home  to replace it.       The Pioneer B  tt., lion  I consider essential. PETROZAVODSK is tho  centre of the Murin n r ilw.;y system,  nd its capture would h .vo  - consider ble mor: 1 effect, whilst its occupation vnd retention by us  would constitute .&apos; distinct threat on the PETROGRAD -  VOLOGDA  r ilway  :-t ZYA3KA, .ind even on PETROGRAD itself. I would not recommend the uu.cl.ert-icing   -a an isolated operrtion, on account of my long and  vulner ble communications, but I believe there is  every chance of it proving successful if c/rried out in conjuno- tion  with .*,;  force operating from   Be It to port,  It would at least tend  to disarrange the  whole of  the Bolshevik organisetion in the PETROZAVODSK district,  v-nd,   s niready pointed  out in parrgroph 1, the sooner this is accomplished  the  batter. If  it is&apos; decided th-...t . n ?.dvanoe in strength is to bo made down thoI-Murrain railway in the e^rly  summer, I  r.o of opinion thst it is highly desirable I should Hm*..jca  good&quot;  the railway to cs for south as  LUMBUSHS&amp;I (h. end of Loke OMA) during the winter months. This  would enable me to repair bridges i nd improve the conditions of  the railway, thus ensuring the summer operations being pushed on with  greater rapidity,   I consider I could do this, even without the co-operation of  any other force, if I rm given the extra reinforcements tsited for  in para. 4, I regard it as so important not  to allow tho Bolsheviks to carry on their organisation in  die hake CJJfSGA region undisturbed during the Enter months, that  even if given no reinforcements additional to those already promised  me, I intend to push on to SEGSJA on the railway (60 miles 3, of BOPOKA)  and to VORAflZHS (not marked on man but 30 miles S. of SHUSH POSAD) on the SDM3KI  POSAD - PCVYKNBT3 road, with 4 to 5 mobile columns.    If circumstances  ere isvourablo, and the inhabitants seem likely to join  in with us, I propose occupying both these places permanently, vnd utilising them as bases for mobile columns operating at least us far South as I-UMBUSBSKI (on railway) .land PCVYEMETS (both  at II, extremity of Lake 0.NEQA) *I 1th  this in view I  have already repaired two bridges S0 of OLIMPII 2nd am guarding them both.  I have also collected material for the reoair of all bridges up to ana&apos; including that over the GISDA1 140 miles 3. of SOROKA).
7. 1 There is one point, however, which must to mode absolutely    clear, namely, that no matter how many troops are employed to    guard the L. of 0, the safe working of the railway cannot be    ensured whilst the discontent which is rife Amongst the rail-    way workers affords so excellent an opportunity for Bolshevik    agitators.  And the railway employees will oontinue to display    active discontent until they are paid at least an apr-^oiable    portion of their bock wages and ar-1 fed cn a. scale which will    enable them to carry out their work in an Arctic climate,  We    must remember, as they dc,  that it was owing solely to our.    action, that their supplies cf money and feed war.&quot;&apos; cut off from    the South.  Without r,onoy and without food, net only are opora-    ticiib South of SCRQKA impossible, but tho maintenance of my    present position would V a matter of considerable difficulty.    It must also bo rent shared  that, as we advance southwards, it    will be necessary to food th^ inhabitants within the area    occupied by us. * Those;, in  the caw: cf my reaching PETROZAVODSK   &apos; will probably  number an additional 60,000, and in the case of    LUKBUSHSKI 40,000,,    In the event of a decision to withdraw, or at least against    our taking increased active measures either, by an advance on    PETROGRAD&apos; from (say) REVAL or down the- Kuimar railway.8.  In this event our efforts must be centred ia endeavouring to    organise an increased Russian Army, preparatory to our eventual    withdrawal -    wh shall! not be able to increase our Military commitments to an    great exit out, but the occupation by mobile columns of SSG33JA    and&apos; VORANZHS (So a para *) wil] still be most desirable, partly    on account of the moral offset&apos;  and partly because it would    almost certainly r(vault in the Russian Army obtaining much    needed roorujts.    It will also K, necessary to continue to open up OLEKETZ-KAEELT.    by means oi  the KAKBlLlAil regiment, and further to use every    endeavour to get haielians and Russians to wsrk together as a    united force,    I cannot, however, imagine that we can contemplate complete&apos;    evacuation until either :-     a)  some form of stable Government is established in Russia,     b)  The Bolshevik Government gives assurances - which must be    backed by guarantees - that no reprisals will VQ token against    those who have sided with the Alii s.    (o)  The Russians in this r-gion have raised a, force of at    least 3*600 and th*&apos; district has be n placed by the Allies on    a satisfactory economic basis as regards the&apos;supply of mono]/,    food and clothing,
