(THI3 DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRLMNIC majesty&apos;s government).fcCREJJ,                      WAR    CABINET.a    UNEMPLOYMENT AND SZiTE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY,WSMRkSDM  BY  THE  CONTROLLER  GENERAL  CO?  CIVIL  DEMOBILISATION                  AND  RESETTLEMENT,abeSSt     I desire to lay before the War Cabinet the following points for their consideration and ruling  (a)  That the principle be admitted of financing stocks of approved       artioles in industries where difficulty exists or unemployment       is expected;  and further, where necessary, guaranteeing       manufacturers against a falling market in respect of such       stocks,  (b)  That the Treasury and the appropriate Department ask       federations and financial interests representative of such       industries to consider and report on the means by which this       financial assistance can best be rendered;  (c)  In relation to the revival of export trade, the necessity       of stablising freights;                  *  (d)  That the policy of the Government in regard to allowances       for depreciation before taxation, and their decisions as       to the excess profits tax, be announced with the least       possible delay,     I am of opinion that it is impracticable for- the Governmententirely to withdraw its support from industry at this moment, and while I am in agreement with Lord Weir that industry should befreed at the earliest possible date from State interference, therisk of such a course at the present juncture is too great,     While it is true that the world&apos;s needs for raw materials and manufactured artioles have never been greater, and that there are amass of orders in this country waiting to bs placed, it is also truethat in certain industries hesitation exists on the part of manufac-turers and consumers, and that in other directions costs have sogreatly increased that long delay must ensue before the purchasercan be assured that purchase would not result in too serious a finan-eial risk.   Hesitation or long delay might very easily bring abouta social upheaval,  for unemployment will not be tolerated.6rriilliai3?aon  I        In  regard  to  fa),  any  proposal  to  guarantee  manufacturersTJagainst  loss raises  large questions  of  policy and  involves  the  state in liabilities of unknown magnitude, but  I  see no  alternative  Itf confidence is to  be  restored in industries where their raw  jmaterial is subject to wide  fluctuations in price or  is dependent  lupon  the  freight market.-1-
     Aa an instance may be quoted the position of the Cotton  trade,where, apart altogether from  questions connected with the  recentstrike, a state of complete stagnation has existed  since the  sig-nature of the armistice, owing to the faot that buyers are holdingoff in the expectation of a substantial drop in prices.     In a case such as this,  more especially in view of the faotthat this industry if full work was  ensured should  absorb  some  tensof thousands of women discharged from munitions, it is not possibleto &quot;wait and see&quot;.   There is little or no inducement to a manufacte.r to manufacture goods which m:\gut  in a  few months1 time  showa very heavy loss if the price of his raw material  or theoost of transport fell substantially during that period.   I would urge that a discussion should at once be  commenced  with the appro-priate body representing the  industry, in the case  of the  cotton trade the Cotton Control 3oard, and  such  other interests as may bethought neoessary.     In regard to (b), while  it is true that the cost of sea  trans-iport has fallen enormously since the Armistice owing to the cessation of the war risk and the abolition of the  oonvoy  system,freights are still very high, and it is widely thought that theywill fall substantially in the near  future.   The result is that foreign buyers show reluctance in buying  and exporters are charyof undertaking commitments until the probable course of freightsis ascertained.   The result  is that exports, upon  which the prosperity of this country depends to such a great  extent, cannotbe expected to attain large proportions.  I am of opinion, there-fore, that the Government should immediately consider the desira-bility of taking steps to stabilise  freights so as  to give an assurance to exporters that fluctuations1  in freight will not  involnthem in heavy losses.     In regard to (d), under  the present  system of  taxation and inview of the uncertainty as to the future, traders are bound tohesitate either to revive their pre-war businesses  or to undertakenew enterprises.     This is especially the case in  connection with shipbuilding,and I foresee serious unemployment in the shipyards at some notvery distant date.   It may well be  that  the demand for the passedand passenger cargo steamer is so great as to warrant owners of this type of vessel building at to-day1 s &amp;.ost, but it cannot be expectedthat the tramp owner will build at to-days cost until he is convinced either that the oost of building is unlikely to fall  or that he may with confidence look for a return on his capitalexpenditure that will permit  him to make  provision for depreciationwhile giving him reasonable interest on his investment.  It must beremembered that, there... has., be en an advance on pre-war cost ofconstruetion&apos; of about 4C0j jhe Inland Revenue permit depreciationbefore taxation uz&quot;vne rate of 6$ per annum.   Excess profits taxdestroys the return that to-day1^ freights might give, so from  thetramp owner1s point of view the building  of tonnage offers noinducement whatsoever.   I do not think the Government can face aslackening in tonnage construction, nor do I think  it can becontemplated that the Government should again place orders forstandard or any other class of steamer.   In these  circumstances Ithink.it necessary that, the industry should fye consulted as to theprocedure that would lead to  a stimulation in the placing of orders.it is possible that a solution of this difficulty may be foundin a system whioh would permit an owner before taxation todepreciate tonnage pro rata with the cost of building, to be ascertained annually.
     1 understand the Committee on Financial Risks have reported and that their Report will be  in the hands of theWar Cabinet on Monday 16th December.     The Federation of British Industries&apos;passed  severalresolutions on the 26th November,  df whioh I attach a copyin case these resolutions have not been brought  to the noticeof the War Cabinet.(Sgd)   ST^PHENSDN  KENT,           14.12.18.*
EXTRACTS  mm  RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE FEDERATION          0J? BRITISH INDUSTRIES ON              26.11,18.A. (2)  That in principle, so far as home orders are concerned,        it is sounder to finance, or secure against loss,        the purchaser rather than the manufacturer.   It is^        however, important that the Government should        guarantee against a falling market those who&apos;        manufacture for stock.   The Federation will he        pleased t* advise the Government as to the carry-        ing out of these principles.That the Government should grant as an allowanceout of Excess profits Duty all expenses incurred in the re-arrangement of existingplant from a War to a peace footing.   Wherebuildings have to be altered back to their previous condition, the same provision should apply.That an allowance for special depreciation shouldbe made out of Excess Profits Duty to meetthe cost of extensions of building and plant for Peace purposes on the same basis as thatgranted in respect of buildings or planterected or purchased for War purposes.That in cases covered by (a) &amp; (b) above whereExcess profits have not been earned or are not sufficient, an equivalent or Supplementaryallowance should be granted by the state.That these conditions should apply only to firms who commence re-arrangements or extensionswithin twelve months from the signing of theArmistice.B.  ( ) That ample reserves should be allowed to be made for        the depreciation of stocks in assessing Excess profits        Duty.B.

(9) That arrangements be made as soon as possible to enable        the requirements of the devastated areas to be        ascertained,  and that the share which British        Industry will take in the restoration and the method        in which orders will be placed, should be made known        as soon as possible.B.
