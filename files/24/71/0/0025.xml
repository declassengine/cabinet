fee 10.71-j fV., document/zFor the moment the General Election has out right across all the movements, and mast of the  extremist  sooieties are running candidates Aftheir own or backing those  candidates most likely to further their objects.Those of them who were violently pacifist are doing their best to pull thecurtain down upon activities whioh  are by no means popular.     A very strong demand on the part of working men, particularly inNewcastle and in the North that the Germans should be made to pay an indemnity, is making itself felt, and the people who used to advocate peace by negotiation have become very unpopular.     Uy Liverpool correspondent says  that there is a very general talk ofrevolution, but not a bloody revolution, and that the women say that they hope the revolution will not mean further killing as they have already hadenough of that during the war.     He thinks that the Cotton Trade  dispute may become very serious.   Themen say that many of the employers  admit that  they have done well out of thewar and eould ffi*.st the men&apos;s demands  quite  easily.   However, this may be,the bad feeling created among a quarter  of  a million people by what theyconsider the greed of the employers is playing into the hands of the extremists.   As the ballot has resulted in a  97^ vote for a strike, thefeeling must be very strong,    : He oomments upon the decline  of personal  loyalty  to  the King inLancashire, which he judges from the demeanour of audiences in pioturey^licP^8ohanoe remarks that he hears every day.   He  thinks this  indifference is dueto the feeling in Lancashire that the people  have been slighted because HisMajesty is  so seldom seen in the County as  compared with  his visits toSootland and foreign parts, and he suggests that matters  might be easilyimproved  if a fisit oould be made to Lancashire.   My  correspondent in yorkshire  says that very great disappointment was felt in Sheffield at  the postponement of His Majesty^ visit.     There  appears to be a very strong feeling that  the supply  of good  beershould now  be resumed and  that the restrictions of  the Liquor Control board should be  abolished.     An observer who was present at  the East Ham Town Hall meeting  on the27th tells  me that Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P.,  has praotioally carried East  Ham infavour  of Mr. Henderson  by his olever platform oratory, and that  the coalition candidate will be  nowhere&apos;.LABOUR AND THE POLICE.        It is to be feared that  in the event of serious labour disturbances the
   Police in the large oitioa cannot be depended upon.    From Birmingham  I   hear that the President of the Trades Counoil, who is  a  lieutenant  of  J.W.   Kneeshaw, a Lobour member of the City Council, who waB prominent as a  -   paoifist and revolutionary in the mooting addressod by Mr.  Gompers  two   months ago, is very aotive in fostering a olo3e alliance between the Polioo   Union and the extremists.   On the 31st October two of the  London men,   Constables Thiel and Crisp, visited Birmingham with tho  objeot  of   inoreasing the Membership of tho Union,   The Pulioe Union has  now   oiroulated leaflets to all candidates with the object  of obtaining  the   promise of offioial recognition, and agitators among the Polioe make no   secret of their intentions to side with labour during  a  strike,  What will   almost inevitably happen is that in the event of strike  disturbances the   Polioe will not aotively join the strikers,  but will quietly neglect to do   their duty, and unless sooiety is provided with some other  means of keeping   order there may easily be a seizure of publio buildings  and Exeoutive  power   by the strikers,   Probably the best manner of dealing with the situation   at the moment is publicity.THE BRITISH SOCIALIST PARTY.        There is a quarrel between Fairchild of the British Socialist Party   and the Independnet Lab-pur Party, because an Independent labour Party  man   is standing for Roohdale, where Fairchild was the prospective Labour   candidate, and was rejected on aooount of his paoifist views.BOLSHEVISM IN ENGLAND.  ,        As indioated in my last report, the. hiring of the Albert Hall for   meetings where revolutionary demonstrations oan be made  is  part if a set   plan, for which Lansbury is only nominally responsible.    The wirepullers   behind him have not yet been disclosed, but the.plan is., by holding a   series *f revolutionary meetings in what is regarded as  a Btronghold of   the capitalist class, the Royal Albert Hall, to test the strength of the   revolutionary movement and fan the tamper of tho London  workers with the   view of preparing for aotion of a much more serious character.    With  this   objeot Lansbury was primed with the1 soheme tf turning  the weekly &quot;Herald&quot;   into a daily paper.        The Hall was applied for first in the name of Mr. Thomas and secondly   in the name of Mr. Henderson for, apparently, unobjectionable objeots, and   the meeting was packed with revolutionary demonstrators, among  whom large   &quot;blooks of tiokets were distributed.   An application was made for the  Hall   for November 23rd by an advertising tailor named Bradley (of Pope and   Bradley) in the names of Lords Beauchamp and Jparmoor,  to address a meeting   on the subjeot    President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points and the League of   Nations.   The plan was subsequently changed to the League  of Nations  only,   and then, when the Hall had been granted, it was announsed  that Mr. Lansbury   would replace.the two Peers, and. the subject would be  t.Labour  and the.   League of Nations,   With their reoent experiences fresh in their, minds,   the Directors cancelled the agreement, whereupon the electrical Trades

Directors to grant the Hall for the 30th.     I hear that Lansbury was disoonoerted by the aotion of  the EleotrioalTrades Union, whioh was apparently taken without consultation with  him.     The speeohes at the Albert Hall meetings on Saturday and yesterdayevenings were comparatively tame.   The red flag was wavedJ  the &quot;Red  Flag&quot;was sung, and Mr, Ramsay tiaodonald was very muoh interrupted, apparently  forbeing too mild,   Jt was estimated by those preBent that quite  half of  theaudienoe was made up of foreigners, ohiefly Russian Jews, many  of them  born in this oountry.   On Sunday evening a third of the seating  aootmmodatitn wasvacant.     At a meeting held at the Hoiborn Empire last night (Sunday)  with W,F.Watson in the Ohair, the speeohes were in the highest degree inflamatory.About six hundred people were present, mostly foreigners.   The singing *fthe &quot;Red Flag&quot; was so halfhearted that the Chairman had to announce that  thelast verse would be sung in French, whereupon the audienoe joined in  theohorus in some half dozen different tongues, making the most appalling  noise.The meeting ended in a free fight, because the Chairman refused t*  allow  amember of the Industrial Workers of the World to speak, and  the hall  was  onlycleared by a threat to turn out the lights.   The principal  speakers  wereWatson, Jaok Mills, and Ramsey of the Eleotrioal Trades Union,     During the past fortnight, the idea of direot action by the  workers  hasoertainly gained ground, espeiially in London.   Among the advanced peoplethere appears to be a quiet certainty that Revolution is coming.    One  hearsthe remark being made openly and with conviction and even among steady  gtingsocialists the wildest rumours are now beginning t* ciroulate.    There  is,for instanoe, one persistent story in London that two regiments stationed inEngland have made known their intention *f siding with the people in  the  eventof any important strike.   This,story, which oarries its twn refutation - forhow could a regiment express an opinion - is widely believed in the East  End,Another ridiculous story whioh was first circulated by Mr, Pemberton  Billing,and has now been adopted by the Revolutionaries, is that the Casing round thestatue of Charles I masks a machine gun whioh is to be used  on  the  workers ifthey demonstrate in Whitehall,   I understand that the hoarding oannot  well beremoved until metalworkers are available for repairing dofeotive places  inthe oasting of the statue, and there was also a fear that in Peaoe  rejoicingsdamage might be done to the beautiful plinth by roysterers,. as  was  the  case with the plinth of the Helscn Column,     A report, not yet -jonfirmod, has reached me that 100,000 red flags havebeen made for distribution in Barrow and Coventry and the neighbourhood,  andthat the Shop Stewards in these places intend to formulate a demand for a

The principal  speakers  wereWatson, Jack Mills, and Ramsey of the Electrical Trades Union.     During the past fortnight, the idea of direct action by the workers hasoertainly gained ground, ospeiially in London.   Among tho advanced peoplethere appears to be a quiet certainty that Revolution is ooming.   One  hearsthe remark being made openly and with conviction and even among steady  goingsocialists the wildest rumours are now beginning to ciroulate.    There  is,for instance, one persistent story in London that two regiments stationed inEngland have made known their intention of siding with the people in  the eventof any important strike.

I understand  that the hoarding oannot  well beremoved until metal, workers are available for  repairing defective plaoes inthe casting of the statue, and there was also  a fear that in Peaoe  rejoicingsdamage might be done to the beautiful plinth by roysterers,, as  was  the  case with the plinth of the Nelson Column,     A report, not.yet Confirmed, has reached  me that 1^0,000 red flags havebeen made for- distribution in Barrow and Coventry and the neighbourhood, andthat the Shop Stewards in these plaoes intend  to formulate a demand for a
- 4 -thirty-two hours&apos; week, a minimum wage of  6 for skilled and  5 per week for unskilled labour, with a time limit fcr aooeptanoe,  and  that failingaooeptanoe they will &quot;down tools&quot; and proceed with the Revolutionary move-ment.   Enquiries are being made.     A private letter from Miss Sylvia Pankhurst to a friend in Glasgow,whioh has come into ray hands, oonoludes with the words,  &quot;l  expect theRevolution soon, don&apos;t you?&quot;     Mr. Will Thorne in. conversation said a few days ago that Bolshevism.or rather the state of dissatisfaction that might &apos;f oitier-^it, has never been so high in England, as.at the present moment.   The industrial workers of &apos;Scotland are of a deeper red than the usual red-flaggers.    There is growing unrest among the railway workers, whioh will soon make itself felt.He,went on to say that there would be no Revolution in England, not in hislifetime, but&quot;that it would come on the Continent.     Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, who has just oompleted a week&apos;s  tour of propaganda in Glasgow, said that in Scotland there wore &apos;patohes&apos;  where theIndustrial Workers of the World were of some numerical strength.   She also stated that the Silver Badge men are the most attentive of  her audienoe,and that the &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, especially in Sheffield, was eagerly bought upby thorn.   She admitted, however, that the working man^s interest inBolshevism was flagging, and that they were more intent on  the doings ofthe German Socialists than on what was going on in&apos; Russia.   In thosmaller towns and villages of Scotland she found that what  interested thepeople were pensions, the oost of living, unemployment,  the  return of thesoldiers in time for Christmas, and the land question,      Messrs, D. B, Poster and Harold Clay, of Leeds, have  been negotiating with the officials of the Discharged and Demobilized  Sailors1  and SoldiersAssociation to revive the defunct Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Council.      In a speech at Ton Pentre, Glamorgan, on November 17th, Noah Ablettj,who has long been known to us for intemperance,.( both in speeoh and drink,said, &quot;I rejoice in Bolshevism; I am proud of it.  We., can do the same inthis country, and now the War is over I wish good luck to the GermanBolshevist as well.  Good luok to any of the working class  where the germof Bolshevism reigns&quot;,  .&quot;.&apos;  At Fleetwood, on the 19th November, a man named Bailey was oonviotedand fined  20 for distributing the leaflet, &quot;To the Toiling Masses&quot;.      On the 27th November the notorious John Arnall was bound over on asummons for using threatening language to a Police Officer,  who had givenevidence against him on a former summons.-      At an &quot;evening&quot; arranged by the Jewish Social Democrats, Sohwartz,a Russian Jew, proposed a toast in the German and Russian Revolutions andcongratulated the Electrical Engineers for their action at  the Albert Hall.
He said that British workers under the torch of the  British  SocialistParty will baok up their German and Russian comradea in spreadingRevolution.      Endeavours are being made to revive the Anarohist organ,  &quot;DasArbeiter Wort&quot;, whioh was suspended during the War,  and attempts  areboing made to obtain the release of the Anarohi3t, Linder, who  is nowinterned.  *      The crusade among the extremists for the respite  of Tom Mooney,Condemned to death for a murderous bomb outrage in America will nowoease, for Mooney has been reprieved.2nd December, 1918.B.
