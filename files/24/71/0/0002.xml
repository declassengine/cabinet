(b) on page 3 must  also he included.   In addition, a number of vessels shown under ore,phosphates, lead, &amp;c, load outward for an Allied Government.  A comparison of  the  numbers shown  under IV. for the 8 months does not therefore give an accurate criterion of the vessels in Allied service at the different periods.    1 &quot;-Requisition&quot; is here used to mean  &quot;requisition for full Government service.&quot; . The vessels shown as &quot;free  fromrequisition &quot; therefore include the vessels that are requisitioned under the special liner requisitioning scheme :                        t SPECIAL  LINER  REQUISITIONING  SCHEME :-   All liner  trades are now requisitioned  under  special conditions, which,  while leaving the vessels still under the manage-ment of their owners, and free so far as circumstances permit to accept private as well as Government cargo, secure that thevessels are operated on Government account, the owners being paid on a Blue Book basis.    I The decrease in the Liners shown under (4) on page 4 is due to the inclusion  under IV. (a) on page 2  of Liners whichare now definitely engaged in importing work for France and  Italy.  In  addition, certain other vessels which were previouslyshown under IV. (a) on page 2 have also now been brought within the Liner Requisitioning scheme, so that, in  all, there arenow included under &quot; Trading for France and Italy &quot; respectively, the following vessels which are under Liner Requisition :                                       France    -     - 39-229,035 G.T.
