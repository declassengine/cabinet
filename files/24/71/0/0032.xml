I.              I desire to bring before my colleagues  tho urgent        necessity for introducing immediate legislation for the        simplification, of procedure in connection vrith compulsory        acquisition of land for public purposes, on the linos        recommended in the First Report of Llr.Leslie Scott1s        Land Acquisition Committee.                  This Committee, &quot;hich is  composed of a very  strong        body of experts, v:ac appointed by the Prime Minister in June        1917, v:ith designedly rri&amp;e terms of reference, to        deal with the defects in the  existing systom.  of lav; and        practice involved  in the acquisition of land  for public        purposes.   They found, unanimously, at an oarly stage of        their proceedings, that  it would be useless to approach the        question of  amendments in  the Lands Clauses Acts v;ithout        first dealing v:ith the causes giving rice  to  great delay  and        expense  in obtaining  compulsory povrors.&quot;   Thoy recommended        that  &quot;as a general principle, any Publio  Department or Local        Authority on tfhom Parliament lias Imposed  a duty  or conferred
power, the exorcise of which involves the acquisition of land,should he able to acquire land compulsorily by some simple andexpeditious procedure.   They further thought that, having regardto the urgent need of stimulating productive industry, and the lack of capital for purposes of commercial ontcrpri.se after thor&apos;ar, any private company or individual who can prove to the satisfaction of a suitable Independent Authority that Mo &quot;under-taking&quot; serves a public purpose, should have similar facilitiesfor the acquisition of land,&quot;          As regards the question of a suitable SanctioningAuthority, they examined and rejected (for reasons in which I concur)the suggestion of a large delegation of such Povrcrs to GovernmentDepartments, or the constitution of a Standing Pormcnent Commissionof a legal nature,   I also concur in their general view that itwould be more desirable to adapt the existing Parliamentarymachinery in a greatly simplified form for schemes involving the compulsory acquisition of land, than to remove the granting ofsuch Powers from Parliament altogether.          The Committee1s own suggestions as to a  suitableSanctioning Authority arc given in detail in Section III of theirReport,          Briefly, they are that a general Panel of Commissioners,Parliamentary and Extra-Parliamontary, should be appointed by a selection Committee of both Houses of Parliament at the beginningof each Session, with a special Panel of Chairmen  to preside at public enquiries, who would be similarly appointed.   To theSanctioning Authority thus constituted should be referred allschemes involving the compulsory acquisition of land, and where necessary, such schemes should bo dealt with at a  Public Enquiry,conducted by one, or more Commissioners from those  panels,   Thedecision of the Commissioners this deputed should  be the decisionof the Sanctioning Authority on the scheme, and should bo finalon all questions of fact, and the general merits of the.scheme.
                        -3-                                   9 6 in order, however, to preserve Parliamentary control over mattersof policy, appeal might be made to Parliament itself against any decision of the Commissioners involving a question of principle.Fur such appeals, the Committee suggest a simplified form ofprocedure for the consideration of Parliament itself.   they further recommend that schemes involving acquisition of land should be submitted to the Sanctioning Authority at any time ofthe year in the form of a simple memorial;  and that theCommissioners should have full discretion as to procedure and allocation of costs.          I think that the arguments in favour of such aSanctioning Authority  (in effect, a Joint Sub-Committee of thetwo Houses of Parliament, supplemented in personnel by Extra-Parliamentary members with suitable general experience ofaffairs) are convincing.   I also feel that the suggested powertip refer schemes to such a Sanctioning Authority at any time ofthe year, and the full discretion given to the Commissioners inthe matter of costs, should go far to remedy the unnecessarydelays and expenses of the present system.    it would, no doubt,be necessary to make provision for appeal to Parliament itself on questions of principle in certain cases, biit I think it is reasonable to hope that such appeals would bo rare, and that most cases would bo finally settled by the decision of theCommissioner-s at a single Enquiry.          The Report of the Committee, which was made public in January last, has received an  exceptional measure of  support from the public, and from many competent  export authorities;  forexample, the Report has been unanimously  adopted by the  Councilof the Surveyors&apos; Institution, and by the Law Societies  of liverpool and Manchester.   Further, although the  actualproposals in this Report are confined to  the acquisition of landfor publio purposes in England and Hales, expressions  of  opinion                                                            very
strongly endorsing the scheme proposed in the Report,  have heenreceived fron the Association of County Councils In Scotland,tho Society of Writers to II.M. Signet, the Scottish Land and property Federation, and the Society of Advocates .    TheGovernment Departments in England concerned, endorse thoproposals, and ray colleagues, the Secretary for Scotland, is considering ho:; far they can be adapted to local conditions inScotland.         The only adverse criticism of any importance upon thescheme, is contained in a Memorandum circulated by the LordChairman of the House of Lords in June last.   In the ensuingdebate, the Committee!s proposals verc strongly supported byLords Pool and Sclbornej  and I do not think I need deal at length uith questions of detail raised in this Memorandum,   X,hovrever, endorse the view indicated in paras, 5 - V of theMemorandum in question to the effect  that land  owners nowadaysaro generally no longer the main opponents  of enterprisesinvolving the acquisition of  land.    I think, in fact, that  the costs of existing procedure  for promotion are  as heavy andunfair  a tax upon progressive landlords  as  on other leaders  ofenterprise in the Kingdom,    The existing system is,  in  fact,an anachronism,  v:hich it is  urgently  necessary  to remedy,  invie::  of the great need  in the immediate  future  of stimulatingnational production by  all  possible means.          For these reasons,  1  think  that the proposed extension of  facilities  for compulsory powers for privatepromoters,  subject  to proper safeguards, is most desirable;and  I need hardly lay emphasis  upon the  necessity  for talcingat once any possible steps  to facilitate the acquisition of:land by Local Authorities,  for the  settlement of soldiers onthe  land, and other  urgent measures  of National Reconstruction           There, is  the  further general merit about these
                         ft 5^proposals, that they suggest an immediate and practical measureby which the pressure on the time of Parliament, for largelegislative proposals which are urgently necessary for thopurposes of National Reconstruction can, to some extent, atall events, be relieved.     10.   In order to enable my colleagues to appreciate thoaction immediately necessary upon the Committee!s proposals, Iappend a memorandum, Indicating in outline, the heads of aBill for giving  effect to them.          I strongly recommend that the Cabinet should approve of those proposals in principle, without delay, and that instructions be given to the Parliamentary draughtsman toprepare, in due course, a Bill fur introduction to parliamentary t t he e ar 1 i e c t p o c a i bl e da t e .                                    C., ADD IS OH, -                                      29th &quot;November, 1918.
          A K XI E X H iACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES!,     A Bill will be required to give effect to the first report of the Committee on this subject, inasmuch as that Reportcontemplates an entirely new procedure for dealing with schemesinvolving tho compulsory acquisition of land.     It will be necessary to dofinc by statute the. general lines of the new procedure which Is baaed on parliamentary procedure, and also to abolish by  statute the various department and non-Parliamentary methods for  authorising the compulsory acquisition of land which now exist.     Although the Report of  the Committee is, owing  to  tholimited terms of reference  to the  Committee, confined to proposals  involving the  compulsory purchase  of land, it isclear that the principles underlying  the Report  are  applicablenot  only  to  schemes involving  the  compulsory acquisition ofland, but  also  equally  to  all  schemes  requiring  parliamentary sanction,  and  any  Bill   to  carry  out  the Report  must,  if theReport  is  to be  carried to  its  logical conclusion,  be  capableof application to  all such schemes,      1,    The  leading provision of the Bill would be an enact-ment that all  applications  for the compulsory acquisition of any land must  bo dealt with by the new authority and under the nev; procedure,  and that all other statutory provisionsunder or in pursuance of which land may be  compulsorily acquired are to be superseded,
     2 k    ^hc next stop will &quot;be to define tho constitution,functions and procedure of the now authority,   ahetherconstitution or functions should be dealt with first is amatter which is always difficult to decide, but for thepresent it seems best to take constitution firSt,     ft.   As far as constitution is concerned it will benecessary to provide -                (a)  For tho appointment of a certain number Of           Ceramicsloners to. form a panel from which Commiesionorn           should bo selected to weal with each scheme as it           comes along,                (b)  For tho choice of tho Commissioners at the           commencement of  each session by a Joint Selection           Committee of the two Houses of&quot;parliament,  the Commission-           era  to be selected with special regard to their general           experience  of affairs, and without  special  regard to           their being or not being members  of either  House of           Parliament.   The number of the Commissioners chosen  to           be  on  the panel  to be  fixed as occasion  requires, having           regard to the probable volume  of  the work to be done.                 (c)    For  the  designation by the Selection Committee            of  a certain number  of the  Commissioners  to be            Commissioners  to act  as  Chairmen sat- Enquiries. .                 (d)    For  the  appointment by&apos; the Selection Committee            at  the commencement of each Parliament of a Chairman  of            the whole  panel of Commissioners, the Chairman to  hold            office during the life of  the Parliament,  to be a            member of  one of the two Houses,
                (e)   For Making  tho  Chairman  responsible for ail           the business  arrangements  in. connection  with the worh           under the  nor/ procedure, and for  giving  him  the           assistance of v  proper staff for &quot;the  purpose,                (f)   For tho  payment to the Chairman of  a  sub-           stantial  salary,  and to the Commissioners of           travelling and out-of-pocket expenses -Then acting           on enquiries  or  helping tho Chairman  in the  duties           of his office;   and of proper salaries to tho           Chairman&apos;s staff.     4.   The functions  of  the new authority ylll bo to dealwith all schemes involving  the compulsory acquisition ofland, and for that purpose  if v;ill bo necessary to providei-                (a)   For the reference of schemes direct to           Parliament in special cases where promoters  make an           application for the purposes, and a tribunalP consisting           of the three Chairmen,- namely, the Lord Chairman in tlx           House of Lords,-the Chairman of Committees in the           House of Commons,, and the  Chairman of tho Commissioners,..           consider that onlng to the magnitude  of the scheme, or           the  special  nature  of any  principle  involved in the           scheme, the  proposals  of  the promoters  should be           submitted direct to Parliament,  and  dealt alth by           Parliament in the  ordinary way as  a  private bill.

(c)  For a public  enquiry into  the scheme  by  the           Commissioners so chosen,  placing on  the Commissioners           the  duty  of - considering the scheme fully and dealing with                                                         &apos;  all
the proposals of the scheme, not merely those involving the compulsory acquisition of land, in the came^manner as the provisions of a private hill arc dealt with baa Private Bill Committee of cither House,  and the dutyof oeoing that the proposals, as approved by them, are put in the proper legislative form. (See E (h) as     todispensing with a public inquiry where there is no opposition to a scheme).      (d)  For giving immediate statutory effect to thescheme as approved by the Commission of Enu iry, subjectto tho appeal to Parliament in special cases,      (e)  For allowing an appeal to Parliament -           (i)  Where the Minister at the head of a                Government - Department certifies that the                Department desire to appeal against the                deciciion of the Commission of Enquiry, and                that the decision against which tho Depart-                ment desires to appeal involves a question                of policy;  and           (ii) Where any party desires to appeal against                the decision of the Commission of Enquiry                and obtains the leave  of  the  three Chair-                men to  appeal, that leave only to ho                given in&apos; cases where the  Chairmen certify                that the decision  against which the appeal                 is desired  involves a  point  of policy  upon                which it is proper that the  decision  of the                 Commission  should  be reviewed by  Parliament      5.    It  will be necessary  to  make certain provisions asregards  Parliamentary procedure.   .&quot;-             (a)   It will be necessary  to  provide  that  if tho
     DGh.oi.-ie  ic  referred  direct to Parliament under the     authority  of  the  throe  Chairmen, the proposals  of the     scheme  shall  bo put in  tho  form  Of a Bill, which should     be dealt with as  a  Bill in  respect of which  Standing     Orders  respecting publication, etc, have been  complied     with.         (b) It will  be necessary to provide that where an     appeal  is  allowed against the decision  of the Commission     of Enquiry on the scheme, the proposals  should  be put     in the  form of a  Bill,  and  that  the  Bill should be  % -     presented  to  Parliament and be deemed  in each House to     have passed through all its stages up  to and including     Committoe.           Standing Orders would then provide for giving time     in  Parliament for the consideration  of the  scheme&apos;,  and,     if  necessary, for recommitting tho Bill giving  effect     to  the  scheme to  a Select  Committee,     6.    It will be necessary  to make  certain  provisions  asto the procedure of the new authority.    That procedure  must,to a great extent, be  left,  according to  the ordinary practice in such cases,  to rules, but it  is most  important thatcertain matters should be specifically dealt with.            (a)   The fullest powers of awarding  costs should be      given to the Commission of Enquiry, and the Commission      should be put under an obligation to consider definitely      by which of the parties the costs  incurred should be      borne,
     (b)  v?he Commission of Enquiry should &quot;be direotorito hoar any persons who appear to thorn to have an interestin, or any reasonable ground of objection to, any sohomowhich is the subject of the enquiry (including reprecrowtyeii.tives of Government Departmentr:) without being; bound by&apos;any hard and fast rule;-; of locus stand!.     (c)  Tho -&quot;CJoinmlfitJion of Enquiry should bo given thefaullcst powers as to receiving evidence, and should bedirected to prevent the multiplication  of expert vit-nesses,      (d)  The Commission should have at their disposalexperts to whom any scheme might be referred for reportfrom any special point of view, but in  such  case the experts shall bo subject to cross-examination by theparties at the enquiry,      (e)   Rules roust be made  providing  for  the modeand form in  which  applications&apos; shall  bo mad? to  theCommission,  and for the  form  in  which proposals  are  tobe submitted to the Commission of Enquiry.      (f)   Rules must  also be  marie for the publication of applications and for  the  communication of -applicationsto the  Government  Departments concerned&apos;.,      (g)   Rules  should be  me.de  that  the number cfCorrrmissloners  to form a Commission of Encu iry should,&apos;in ordinary  cases, be three,  but in oases of magnitudeand  complexity five Commissioners should be allowed,and  in small cases areferonoe to a single commissioner would be  sufficient.
          (h)  Rules should bo made for dispensing with an     enquiry in cases where there is no objection, and where     no useful purpose would bo served by the enquiry.     7.   Certain rocomwiendations of the Committee which were rather outside the main lines of their report would requires t atutory sanctioned i on.          (a)   Provision might be made that, any Government     Department should have power to acquire by agreement     and hold land for any purposes of the Department, and     similarly that where powers or duties have been     entrusted           *- by statute or by any Order having     statutory effect to any local authority or body of persons     that authority or body of persons should have power to     acquire by agreement and hold land for the purposes of     those powers and duties.          (b)  Provision might be made that local authorities     shall have power to acquire land compulsorily within     their area without further sanction for the purpose of     any of  their powers and duties, unless the owner alleges     that other land suitable for the purpose can be and     ought to be acquired, or that the  authority is not     exercising its powers judicially.           (c)  In connection with the abolition of the powers     to acquire land under the Defence Acts, some  special     facilities might be given to the Defence Departments     to acquire lands for tho purposes  of defence  or     strategic works *
