This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]381Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1919.SECRET.G.-252.WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, ANDsTD AIR FORCE PAY.Interim Report on the Pay, Allowances, Retired Pay and Half Payof Officers.1. The Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet on the 19th June (War Cabinet 581, Minute 1) &quot;to co-ordinate the proposals of the Admiralty, War Office, and/Air Ministry with regard to pay,&quot; and present herewith an Interim Report dealing with the Pay, Allowances, Retired Pay, and Half Pay of Officers.2. The Committee have examined in detail the various proposals of the three Departments under these heads, and they have addressed themselves for the most part to what they considered to be their main task that of correlating, as far as possible, the emoluments of officers of similar rank in the three services.3. The following general principles enunciated in the War Office Interim Report -on,Army Officers&apos; Pay (G.-249) are accepted by the Committee as applying equally, mutatis mutandis, to all three services: (a.) The present multiplicity of rates of regimental and corps pay for different arms of the Service should be replaced by uniform inclusive rates, except where the duties of a particular arm are essentially those of a special profession, such as medicine or civil or mechanical engineering.(6.) As far as possible, there should be a clear distinction between the expenditure to be covered by pay and that to be covered by allowances. It follows that allowances, when given, should be adequate to meet the expenses to which they relate, and should be adjusted from time to time in accordance with the movements of prices.(c.) The pay of an officer when first commissioned should be sufficient to enable him to take a share in the normal life of his regiment without private income.(d.) An officer upon attaining the age of 30, or the rank of captain, should be recognised by the State as entitled to marry, and his pay and allowance should then be sufficient to enable him to support a wife without private means.4. On account of the diversity of duties, the varying conditions of service, and different systems of promotion which obtain in the three Services, it does not appear desirable, even if it were possible, to pay at exactly the same rates officers of equivalent rank in the Navy, Army and Air Force up to the rank of Colonel. In the case, however, of Flag Officers and General Officers, -there is a broad basis of comparison in the responsibility attaching to the posts they occupy and the station in life to which these posts entitle them, and it thus appears that the emoluments of these officers should be uniform throughout the service.5. Royal Marines. In the past the duties of the Royal Marines have been mainly of a military nature, and their pay has been based on army rates. The Admiralty propose, however, and they have in fact already initiated a system to provide, that in future the duties and responsibilities of Marine officers shall, on completion of a rigid course of training in naval subjects lasting for four years after being first commissioned, be assimilated to those of officers of the Royal Navy. In these circumstances it seems only right that the emoluments of these officers should in future be based on naval rates.
6, Income Tax. During the war the Services have been in a privileged position in the matter of income tax; but, now that the war is over, it is undesirable that any-particular section of the community should be accorded preferential treatment in this respect, particularly in view of the fact that a Royal Commission is already examining the whole of our present system of income tax. The Committee recommend, therefore, that the Service rates of income tax should cease at the end of this financial year.7. Revision of Emoluments. In recommending the emoluments for the three Services set out in the Appendices, the Committee have borne in mind the present devaluation of currency. The scale of emoluments proposed would certainly be too high if the cost of living were to fall to its pre-war standard, and, in view of the uncertainty which attaches to the economic conditions which are likely to prevail a few years hence, the Committee feel that these rates should be reconsidered after the expiration of five years, when it may be found necessary, should there be a marked rise in the purchasing power of the sovereign, to lower the rates for future entrants into the Services.In assessing the emoluments of the officers of the Royal Air Force, the Committee have felt bound to take account of the risks attaching to flying. It follows that if, during the next five years, the progress of science should bring about a material diminution in flying risk, this circumstance should be taken into consideration in the revision of the rates for future entrants into the Air Force.8. Directors. The Committee feel that officers who vacate their commands in order to take up work of possibly increased responsibility as Directors at the Admiralty, War Office, or Air Ministry, should not lose thereby. At the same time, it is highly probable that the high salaries which the Committee recommend for these officers will tend to react unfavourably upon the salaries of Civil Servants performing duties of an analogous nature. Acceptance of these rates may, in fact, raise in an acute form the question of the revision of pay throughout the whole of the Civil Service. It is only fair, on the other hand, to draw attention to the possibly long periods of unemployment that occur in the fighting Services as compared with the continuity nf work on full salary which obtains in the Civil Service.Pay.9. The new rates of pay recommended are set out in Appendix I.10. Royal Air Force: Junior Officers.  The Committee feel that the rates of pay for 2nd Lieutenants and Lieutenants in the Royal Air Force may be criticised as being too high. They realise, however, the difficulty of olfering rates lower than those suggested, which are themselves lower than those now obtaining, and the lowest rates of which are lower than the lowest rates offered in 1912, since when it is by no means certain that the flying risk has appreciably diminished.11. Naval Medical Service. Although the Committee have assented to the rates of pay proposed by the Admiralty for medical officers in the Royal Navy, they wish to point out that these officers have little opportunity for improving themselves professionally, and, as their practice is in no way varied, their efficiency is bound to suffer, which is bad for themselves, for the Service, and for the country generally. Some members of the Committee would; therefore, prefer to see a system framed to encourage medical officers to retire on a gratuity and take up private practice after four or five years in the Service. It is understood that the Admiralty have already considered this plan and do not regard it as feasible, but the Committee wish to place on record their firm conviction that its adoption would tend to greater efficiency in the Service and to the common advantage.Allowances.12. The rates of allowances where they differ from the old rates are shown in Appendix II.The representatives of the Treasury incline to the view that the rates of pay now proposed are so liberal as to exclude the necessity of granting allowances in addition, and, in particular, they are strongly opposed to the grant of ration allowance, and of lodging allowance in the case of general officers and flag officers.   Throughout the
Services, on the other hand, there is a very strong feeling in the opposite direction, and not only is there the strongest opposition to any extension of the system of consolidated rates of pay, but it is felt that the consolidated rates now obtaining should cease, and that all officers should be placed on pay and allowances. The Committee have therefore felt bound to follow this course, and under their proposals consolidated pay, except in a few cases, will no longer exist.13. At the same time, since allowances are given to cover particular items of expenditure, e.g., lodgings, rations, &amp;c, the amount of the allowances should depend upou existing prices, and it is highly desirable that arrangements should be made for the periodical revision of the scales.Retired Pay.14. The proposed rates of Retired Pay for the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and Royal Air Force are given in Appendix III.15. The Committee are not able to submit proposals for the Retired Pay of the Army, but they endorse the suggestion that an immediate announcement should be made that an officer who desires to leave the Army, or has left since the date of the Armistice, will be given the benefit of any new rates of Retired Pay that may be brought out after his retirement. This will have the effect of causing the immediate retirement, at considerable saving to the public, of large numbers of officers who have made up their minds to retire in any case, and are only waiting so that they may not lose the benefit of the new scale.16. The Committee are agreed that the new rates of Retired Pay in the three Services should apply to all future pensioners, and to all who have served in the present war.Half Pay.17. The Committee have accepted the recommendations of the Committee on Naval Half Pay as amended by the Board of Admiralty (Appendix IV), subject to adoption by the War Cabinet of the rates of full pay set out in Appendix I.No proposals are yet available regarding half-pay in the Army.It is understood that the question of half-pay in the Royal Air Force will be settled between the Treasury and the Air Ministry.   &apos;   . -General.18. The Committee have not considered the emoluments of the Service members of the Board of Admiralty, the Army Council, and the Air Council. They feel that the rates of pay of these officers should be settled by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War and Air, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.19. Effect of New Rates of Pay upon War Gratuities. The Committee consider that the gratuities granted for service during the present war should be estimated upon the existing rates of pay, and should not be affected by the new rates now proposed.20. Dates of Increases. The Halsey Committee on the Pay of Naval Officers recommended that, in view of the fact that these officers have in the past been considerably underpaid, and that many of them are now heavily in debt and are unable to provide themselves with new outfits, the new rates of pay and half-pay should be aute-dated to the 1st October, 1918. The Admiralty recommend that, as was done in the case of the men, the proposals should be ante-dated to the 1st February, 1919, for all officers in the Service on the 1st May. The Committee, while they feel the greatest possible sympathy with the Admiralty point of view, and that the amount of money involved in ante-dating the proposals for Naval officers would probably be comparatively small, are of opinion that it is hardly possible to differentiate between the treatment
accorded to the Navy and the Army, and, in the case of the latter, the number of officers affected and the amount of money involved are considerable. The War Office feel that the new rates should only take effect from the 1st July, 1919. In these circumstances, the Committee are unable to make a recommendation, and leave it to the War Cabinet to decide.The same difficulty does not arise in the case of the Royal Air Force, and the Committee agree that the new rates of pay should take effect from the date of the first Gazette in the case of permanent and temporary officers of the new force, and from the date on which they are again seconded in the case of officers reseconded from the Navy and the Army. The new rates should not apply to officers awaiting demobilisa-tion, or who are temporarily retained.The new scale of retired pay should take effect from the 1st April, 1919.The new rates of allowances should take effect from the same date as the new rates of pay.21. The Committee have considered the proposal that, as was approved in the case of men in the Royal Navy, the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry should be granted discretionary powers to waive the recovery of overpayment made and received in good faith owing to genuine misunderstanding or to am biguity in the wording of orders.They are of opinion, however, that this question does not come within their terms of reference.22. The following examples show the considerable increases in the pre-war emoluments of officers in the Navy and Army effected by the Committee&apos;s proposals : Royal Navy.	Pre-War.		Proposed.		Afloat.

23. Cost of Proposals. -The cost of the Committee&apos;s proposals is estimated to be as follows: (o.j For the Royal Navy and Royal Marines it is estimated that the proposals, based on the number of officers in the Navy on the 1st April, 1919, mean an increase of 1,693,0007., which will be increased for the current year if the proposals are ante-dated to the 1st February, 1919. The figure will increase in future years, as the cost of the new pensions scale increases, until the maximum is reached in about twenty-five years, when it should begin to decline.The increased cost of the proposals for pay represents an increase of 73 per cent, over pre-war Bill. (b.) In the case of the Army the additional cost based on pre-war numbers is : !Officers&apos; pay, &amp;c, 3,200,0001. annually.Extension of children&apos;s  allowance from  the 1st July, 1919,  to the 31st December, 1919, 1,000,0001 Non-effective increase (normal), equivalent to the proposed retired pay for the Navy, 1,250,0001The proposals as regards pay mean an increase of 74 per cent, over the pre-war Bill.(c.) In the case of the Royal Air Force it is estimated that the total cost (not the increase) of the pay and allowances now proposed will amount to 3,031,0001. for 5,300 officers.It is not possible to give in the case of the Air Force an accurate estimate of the percentage increase which this represents, but is believed to be about 20 per cent.24. Further Report on the Army. The proposals of the War Office have not been put before the Committee in the same detailed form as those of the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. This is due to the greater complexity of the organisation of the Army and the much greater intricacy of the questions relating to it, and to the extreme pressure still prevailing in the War Office. A complete scheme will be submitted to the Committee as soon as possible ; but they have been able already to settle the main or basic rates for the Army, and they make their report to the War Cabinet without further delay. They propose to submit to the War Cabinet a further report on the Army in due course.25. The following papers are attached to the report: I. A note of dissent by the representatives of the Treasury. II. A note by the representatives of the Admiralty regarding certain points. III. A note by the representatives of the Admiralty regarding the suggestion that mess allowance in the Navy should cease.Summary of Recommendations. The Committee recommend: (1.) The rates of pay set out in Appendix T.(2.) The scales of allowances set out in Appendix II.(3.) The scales of retired pay for the Navy, Royal Marines, and Royal Air Force,set out in Appendix III. (4.) The adoption of the amended Report of the Committee on the half-pay of theRoyal Navy (Appendix IV). (5.) That the emoluments of Service Members of the Board of Admiralty, the ArmyCouncil, and the Air Council should be settled by the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Secretary of State for War and Air in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. (6.) That the rates of pay, retired pay, and half-pay be reviewed in five years&apos;timefor future entrants into the Services, regard being had (a.) To any decrease in the cost of living.(6.) In the case of the Royal Air Force to anv diminution in the &quot;Flying Risk.&quot;(7.) That arrangements should be made for the periodical revision of all allowances[1.68] G
(8.) That the special rate of income tax for the three Services should cease at theend of the present financial year. (9.) That the new rates of pay should not affect the War Gratuities granted forService in the present war; which should be estimated on the existingrates of pay.(1,0.) The Committee are unable to recommend a date, from which the new rates of pay and half-pay in the Navy and the Army should take effect.The new rates of pay in the Royal Air Force should take effect from the date of the first Gazette in the case of permanent and temporary officers in the new Force, and from the date on which they are again seconded in the case of officers reseconded from the Army and Navy. The rates should not apply to officers awaiting demobilisation or who are temporarily retained.(11.) The new scales of retired pay should take effect from the 1st April, 1919, and should apply to all future pensioners and officers who have served in the present war.(12.) The new scales of allowances should take effect from the same date as the new rates of pay.H. A. L. FISHER (Chairman).G. Myrddin Evans (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 7, 1919.INote of Dissent by Treasury Representatives.1. We regret to feel obliged to dissent from certain recommendations of our colleagues. We recognise that circumstances such as the rise in cost of living and the adoption by the Government of the Jerram Report for the pay of the lower deck render inevitable the increase in certain directions in the rates of pay and pension of officers of the three services. At the same time, having regard to the serious financial condition of the country and to the general level of pay in the Public Services and in the open market, we consider that the combined effect of the increased pay, the increased allowances and the increased pension as proposed will be to raise the total emoluments of officers to an unnecessarily high figure. As illustrations we give the following rates.A 2nd Lieutenant in the Army, aged, say, 19, will receive 13s. a day pay plus free rations, plus free lodging, fuel and light, plus attendance, or when free rations and lodging cannot be provided cash allowances in lieu at the following rates: lodging, 3s. Qd.; fuel and light, Is.; rations, 2s. Id; total pay and allowances, 19s. 7d-a day, 358/. a year. This is in addition to the actuarial value of his pension rights which are not likely to amount to less than about 70/. a year. Outfit allowances, free medical attendance and railway fares less than civilian rates are among other emoluments likely to be allowed but not all determined yet.A Lieutenant in the Navy, aged, say, 23, will receive 17s. a day pay, plus Is. 2\d. a day rations total 330/.; ordinarily he will be employed afloat, but if ashore and not in barracks he will receive also 80/. lodging, and 80/. compensation total 490/. per annum,. in addition to free medical attendance and to pension rights, the actuarial value of which is estimated at from 130/. to 160/, to which it is proposed to add 50 per cent. Total emoluments will therefore be 490/. a year plus pension rights valued at upwards of 200Z.
2. It is unfortunate that it is necessary to determine future permanent rates of pay while the probable course of prices is&apos; so uncertain. It is true that it will be possible to adjust that proportion of an officers total emoluments which is represented by allowances should prices fall in the future, but we cannot agree with our colleagues that officers with permanent commissions entering the army while they are in force should have a vested interest in the rates of pay for all ranks.Article 1 of the Pay Warrant is as follows: &quot;Subject to Articles 2 and 4, no officer soldier or other person shall be entitled to claim hereafter any promotion, retired pay, pension or other advantage conferred by any provision, of this warrant in the event of such provision being at any time added to, varied, or cancelled.&quot; Articles 2 and 4 reserve rights for officers, soldiers or other persons to pension retired pay and compassionate allowances with which they have already retired or to which they may be entitled under previous warrants.It seems clear from the above that, though as a matter of administration it might be difficult to modify the rates of pay actually in being, it is not the fact under the existing regulations that a 2nd Lieutenant has a vested interest in the pay, say, of a Colonel at the rate of his entering into the Army.The Admiralty representatives claim that in the naval service such a vested interest does in fact exist, but we believe that no article of the King&apos;s Regulations can be pointed out which establishes such a vested interest. In any case there would seem to be no reason why the announcement of the proposed increased rates of pay should not be made in such terms as to prevent a vested interest being set up.Particularly in regard to the proposed Pension scale, does it seem undesirable to set up a vested interest. We would point out that if this is done, the scale will be in operation for at least 60 years. As it stands, the Navy scale of pensions is exceedingly liberal, the actuarial equivalent being estimated by the Government actuary at from 130Z. to 160Z. a year. It is proposed to increase this sum by 50 pet cent, on account of the rise in prices, and to apply the improved scale to the Air Force. To prevent a vested interest in such a scale being set up we would recommend either that the whole increase in the scale of pensions be made by way of an.allowance subject to revision as prices fall, or that at least a part of the increase be made by such an allowance, the balance being made as a permanent addition.3. Ration Allowance. The proposals of the Committee to give free rations to officers constitute a new departure as regards peace arrangements. Before the war, officers of the Army did not receive free rations in kind or allowances in lieu. During the war free rations have been issued and it is proposed to continue the emoluments of officers upon this footing during peace.In the Navy free rations were not issued to officers before the war, except to the extent provided for by a cash issue of %\d. a day, which was the cash equivalent of certain free rations to which officers were formerly entitled. During the war the cash equivalent has been raised to Is. 2\d. It must be remembered that the Navy also have the privilege of purchasing duty-free stores. The value of this privilege in the last year of the war is estimated (for the whole Navy) by the Board of Customs at 3,950,0007. We think that it would be reasonable in view of the substantial concessions made to officers as regards rates of pay that the principle should be established that in peace they pay for their rations. We should have no objection to officers of the services getting the benefit of the GovernmemVs purchasing arrangements provided that an abatement is made from their pay, sufficient to cover the actual cost to the tax-payer of the rations so provided. Alternatively, we think that if it be decided to give free rations in kind or money equivalent in lieu an equivalent abatement should be made from the rates of pay laid down. We would point out that the State gets no credit for any emoluments paid to an officer other than his actual pay, and it is constantly represented in consequence that officers are underpaid, because Parliament and the public cannot be informed of the actual value of the emoluments received by them in kind. &apos; We can see no reason why if an officer is paid a fair market rate for his services he should not at least pay for his own food like anybody else.4. Pay of Admirals, Generals, &amp;c. It is proposed to increase the pay of all Flag officers by 21. a day (730Z. a year) in addition to other increases in the other emolu-niehts to be drawn by officers. We would prefer that the increase should be 1/. a day (365Z. a year). The war bonus given to civil officers on a comparable status is limited to a maximum of 300Z. a year. This would make the pay of a Rear-Admiral 1,460Z. a year, in addition to table money if employed in a command at sea, and to lodging and compensation, (proposed rates 180Z. a year) when employed ashore, besides certain other allowances which are payable in special circumstances.  Alternatively,
if the rates of pay are increased by 730/. a year, viz., 1,825/. for a Rear-Admiral, 2,190/. for a Vice-Admiral, &amp;c, we&quot; consider that these rates of pay should be held to cover the liability of finding himself a house and feeding himself, when he is employed ashore in a post which does not carry an official residence. We would apply the same rules to General Officers in the Army and Air Force.STANLEY BALDWIN. G. L. BARSTOW.IINote by the Representatives of the Admiralty on certain Points.While agreeing generally with the conclusions arrived at by the Committee, the Admiralty representatives feel they must record their views on three points of vital importance which have not received the support of the Committee.1. The antedating of full pay and half-pay at the new rates to the 1st February. 1919, for those in the Service on the 1st Mwy.The full report of the Committee presided over by Rear-Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey contained the following passages: &quot;Tit is evident to the Committee that very great hardships have been endured by many of the wives and families of officers during the war. Some have lived in working-class cottages, without a servant, having difficulty in affording food and clothing. Others have had to expend their savings, surrender their life insurances, borrow money, and in some cases wives and families have had to depend partly on charitable relatives. The Committee have examined the accounts of many officers, both as regards their expenses on board and of their wives and families, and are satisfied that if the facts became known to the general public, much indignation would be roused at the straits to which officers have been reduced owing to their lamentably inadequate pay.&quot; A large number of officers are very much in debt, both by overdrafts on the bank on which they have to pay interest and by loans from other sources.&quot; These burdens appear unjust and must be detrimental to the service. For whatever purpose it may have been granted, the War Gratuity is entirely inadequate to re-establish officers in a sound financial position. As an immediate step to enable officers to pay off their debts, to meet their expenses, and to re-equip themselves with uniform, &amp;c, we recommend that a sum be at once granted, and that this shall take the form of dating the revised scale of pay to 1st October, 1918. This is in line with the recommendations of Admiral Jerram&apos;s Committee. We consider it absolutely essential both in justice to the officers and for the benefit of the Service to relieve them of their pressing financial liabilities.The Admiralty representatives from their personal knowledge are in a position to confirm every word of the above quotation. They desire to point out that in the autumn of 1917 the Admiralty recommended an increase in pay for all officers of the the Naval Service below Flag rank. This was considered by the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee then presided over by Sir Edward Carson and that Committee, while considering that their terms of reference limited them to making recommendations for officers of junior rank, nevertheless stated that the case of senior officers of the Navy called for sympathetic consideration. Acting on this report the Admiralty at once put forward to the Treasury most moderate proposals for increasing the pay of the more senior officers of the Naval Service. This was in February 1918, but they were met by a flat refusal from the Treasury, the only reason given being that no necessity was seen for the increase proposed. It is probablethat the Treasury was influenced by the effect on the Army if the Admiralty proposals had been approved, but we submit that this showed an imperfect knowledge of the conditions of the two Services. It has been stated on high authority that Army officers at the front were able to live on the allowances granted for wrar service in addition to their ordinary emoluments and could remit the whole of their pay to
their wives and families. The Naval officer on the other hand received not one penny more in war than he did in peace. Further, rank for rank, the permanent officer in the Army enjoyed much higher temporary rank in the Army than was possible in the Naval Service. These arguments which seemed unanswerable carried no weight with the Treasury, with the result that by the end of 1918 the position of senior Naval officers was&quot; positively desperate. This cannot possibly be denied and the Admiralty had no responsibility for such a state of affairs. We desire further to represent, the following arguments: (1.) It is impossible to deny to the officer what has already been granted to the men.(2.) It is impossible to antedate the pay of the permanent officers without doing the same for the temporary officers who were serving on the chosen date (the 1st May has been suggested by the Admiralty as in the case of the men). There are two reasons for this. In the first place officers serving side by side all over the world cannot receive different treatment. Secondly, by far the majority of the temporary officers now serving are officers of the Merchant Service to whom the country has acknowledged its indebtedness over and over again. To accord them different treatment would arouse intense indignation and would probably drive many of them in disgust to join the United States Mercantile Marine. It must be well known to anyone who has studied the subject that the United States are making a strenuous bid for the carrying trade of the world. At the present moment, owing to the loss of British tonnage in the war, we have a temporary surplus of Merchant Service officers for whom ships cannot be found. The United States on the other hand are building up a Mercantile Marine and have not enough officers to man it. It is worth their while to offer any terms to attract our officers to join and they will not hesitate to do so. The question at issue is a tight for the carrying trade of the world, as it was 250 years ago between the Dutch and ourselves. Then the issue was decided by wars. Now we stand to lose solely by want of sympathy with, and appreciation of our Merchant Service officers. Knowing what the Merchant Service has done for the country and the Navy we desire to disassociate ourselves entirely from such a suicidal policy.2. The &quot;Kept on&quot; Officer.Officers who were retired before the war when called out received the full pay of their rank on the retired list plus 25 per cent, bonus on their full pay.   Those who have reached the age for compulsory retirement since the 4th August 1914, have continued to serve on their ordinary emoluments, and, having already reached their maximum retired pay, have been held to service without any accruing advantage whatever.   There are cases of officers who retired in the last week of July 1914, who were called up in the higher rank granted on retirement and received the 25 per cent., bonus on their full pay.   Conversely there are officers who were due for compulsory retirement in August 1914, who have served on without any advantage. We submit that this is manifestly unfair.   An officer enters the Naval Service with a contract that he will be compulsorily retired at a certain date, and, if he is held to service after that date, he should be entitled to the advantages granted to him if he had been so retired.   We understand that the opinion of the Committee has been to some extent influenced by the effect which the Admiralty proposals might have on Army officers, but this does not not seem to us to be altogether relevant. The Admiralty might just as well claim that a retired Naval officer should receive full pay plus pension as the retired Army officer does when called out, but such a claim has never been made.   Further, we would ask whether there are not cases of Lieutenant-Colonels or even Majors held to service who have been granted the rank of Brigadier during the war.   If so, any argument on the part of the Army falls to the ground for no such advantage is possible in the Naval Service.    The Naval Service is very jealous of its traditions and the rank of Flag Officer is not granted to anyone who has not held the high rank of Captain on the Active list of the Royal Navy.   Why then should the Naval &quot;kept on&quot; officer be penalised in comparison because the Army have found it necessary during this war to advance their &quot; kept on&quot; officers to higher rank ?   The question is one about which the Admiralty feel very strongly and it must be well known what the feeling is in the House of Commons.[168] D
III.Note by the Representatives of the Admiralty with reference to the Suggestion by the Treasury that the Issue of Ration Allowance should cease.-The Board of Admiralty resist with energy the suggestion of the Treasury that the old estbalished practice under which Naval officers receive an allowance in lieu of victuals should be abrogated.It, jhas been the rule of the Naval Service from time immemorial that both Naval officers and men alike shall receive the same Government ration of victuals or allowance in lieu. tDuring the recent war there were many occasions on which Naval officers had to be victualled on the Government rations just like the men as no other supplies were obtainable. The Navy is always on active service, and such emergencies may occur at any time. The system under wdiich the Government treats the officer and the man exactly alike in regard to their victualling provides for such incidents of sea service in the simplest possible way. It is understood that in similar circumstances the Army and Air Force had to resort to the grant of free rations to officers under active service conditions.The Treasury proposal seems to have been based on the supposition that the allowance in lieu of victuals was some small perquisite of Naval officers that might reasonably be abolished. It was probably not understood that the present system places everyone in the Navy, officer, petty officer, or seaman on an equal footing as regards rationing, and that this is a principle to which the Naval Service for practical as well as sentimental reasons attaches the greatest importance.HUGH TOTHILL. CHARLES WALKER.j3. The Pay of Schoolmasters in the Naval Service.Before the war there was a definite boycott of the Naval Service on the part of schoolmasters in the civilian world. The decision of this Committee will accentuate this and the result will be that the needs of the Naval Service will not be met. Three months ago the Admiralty advertised 15 vacancies for schoolmasters. In response 273 applications for terms of service were received but from this number only 45 presented themselves for entry. It was with the greatest difficulty that 15 suitable candidates were selected. It is not so much that the conditions are unattractive as that the standard required is so high. The Naval Service in these days demands a very high standard of technical education and the war has proved this beyond question. Not only must a schoolmaster be able to teach boys who have passed out of secondary schools but he must adapt himself to the requirements of the Naval Service. Thus he may be required to teach boys in the Training Ships one year and in the next be expected to take classes of men desirous of qualifying for warrant rank. The very best type of teacher is wanted and he can only be attracted by a salary considerably in excess of that obtainable on shore. It Was argued before this Committee that the emoluments of schoolmasters were fixed less than twelve months ago and that therefore no increase should be necessary. In regard to this we would remark that these emoluments were fixed with relation to those of other officers but that now that a general revision of officers&apos; pay has taken place the Schoolmaster cannot possibly be left out in the cold. If he is, he will doubtless compare his position with that of other officers and the former boycott will at once be re-instituted. The result of being forced to make concessions to meet our requirements has always operated adversely in the past and will doubtless do the same in the future.HUGH TOTHILL. CHARLES WALKER,

Our terms of reference were as follows : &quot;To inquire into the question of the half-pay of Naval Officers, having regard to the changed economic and naval situation, and to report whether any, and if so what, revision of the present rates of half-pay, and the regulations governing the grant of half-pay is called for &quot;[168] H
3. We considered in the first place whether it would he possible or desirable wholly to eliminate half-pay in the sense of a special rate of pay lower than full pay during periods of unemployment in the Naval Service.This proposal was put forward by Vice-Admiral Sir W. Pakenham in his letter of the 30th November, in which he advocated (a.) That every officer willing to serve, whether employed or not, shall be entitledto full pay, lodging and provisions : (o.) That half-pay shall then be reserved for those who may not wish to serve orwho have been found guilty of misconductWhile urging the claim of officers to an &quot;assured and good living,&quot; Admiral Pakenham ranked the need for employment almost as highly. This employment, he considered, need not be directly naval; when naval employment fails other kinds should be provided, e.g., lighthouse and harbour services, inland waterways, governor-ships of Crown colonies, consular service, &amp;c.Admiral Pakenham was interviewed by the Committee, and emphasised the views expressed in his letter. Briefly put, his proposal is for continuous full pay and continuous employment; but if the latter is not available the former should still, in his opinion, be granted.4. The question of employment of officers on other than naval duties does not fall within the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, but having carefully considered Admiral Pakenham&apos;s views, we are of opinion that unemployment during periods which are often prolonged has always been, and must continue to be, necessary incidents of Naval Service. During the years preceeding the war which were marked by large additions to fleet material, unemployment almost ceased to exist in the junior commissioned ranks, but we assume that it will always be necessary to maintain during peace a Flag List and a Captains&apos; List considerably in excess of the numbers of officers for whom commands are at any one time available. In the higher ranks where employment is not possible for all, there must always be some compulsory &apos; unemployment, and in such cases full pay at the substantially increased rates now before the Board would not appear justified.Moreover, if a reduction of the Fleet is decided upon, it may be impossible to find continuous employment for officers of- rank junior to Captain. It would not, in our view, be justifiable to pay unemployed officers indefinitely at the same rate of pay as if they were fully employed.ft. We also attach much importance to the following considerations : If pay during unemployment were not fixed at a lower rate than retired pay, unemployed officers of Captain&apos;s rank and above would have no inducement to retire, and stagnation of promotion would result.6. On the other hand, as regards junior officers, we think a distinction should be drawn between officers waiting employment and holding themselves at the disposal of the Admiralty and officers who are unemployed at their own request or in consequence of misconduct.For the former class, pay for which we suggest the term &quot; Unemployed Pay &quot; should be provided : and for the latter, half-pay half the rate of full pay- is sufficient in our opinion.7. In assessing the rate of pay for unemployed officers, we have taken into consideration the fact that compulsorj&apos; unemployment may be a great hardship to married officers with families to support and educate, unless they have private means  and that it is not desirable either to limit the Navy to officers with private means, or to place on the officers concerned a sudden and severe diminution of income. We have assumed as rates of full pay those adopted by the Board of Admiralty for recommendation to the Cabinet, and have also assumed that those rates are fixed without reference to the contingency of unemployment at existing rates of half-pay. Naturally, if the new rates of full pay were intended to include a provision by way of insurance against half-pay, it would not be so necessary to revise half-pay rates. Should the full pay rates proposed not be accepted, it will be necessary to revise the rates suggested below.8. The following are our recommendations : For officers up to and including Sub-Lieutenants of all branches there should be no half-pay except for misconduct or at an officers own request when he wishes to be free for a time.
Lieutenants, Lieutenant-Commanders, and Commanders of all branches  unemployed pay to be six months&apos; full pay, followed by six months&apos; at 17s., 11. 2s. Qd., and 11. 7s. Qd. a day respectively, at the end of which time, if still unemployed, they should revert to half-pay.Half-pay for Lieutenants, Lieutenant-Commanders, and Commanders of all branches to be half the rate of the full pay of their rank and seniority on the Executive Officers scale.A Commander of any branch, on promotion to Captain, if not employed, to have six months&apos; full pay on the existing highest Commander&apos;s rate, namely, 21. 8s. a day.Captains of all branches unemployed after the first six months to receive half-pay at the following rates :Under six years&apos; seniority, 11. 12s. Qd. a day. Over six years&apos; seniority 1Z. 17s. Qd. a day.The rates of half-pay for officers of Rear-Admiral&apos;s rank and above to be as follows : Rear-Admiral   ... ...         ...         ...         ...    2   5   0Vice-Admiral    ... ...         ...         ...         ...    2 15   0Admiral          ... ...          ...          ...         ...    3   5   0Admiral of the Fleet ...         ...         ...         ...    1,800 a year.Note. As an Admiral of the Fleet is not usually employed, and may not retire voluntarily, his half-pay and retired pay must necessarily be the same.9. As regards Marine Officers, there is ordinarily no half-pay up to the rank of Colonel-Commandant, except in cases of prolonged sickness. To provide for such cases, however, we propose that Marine Officers should be treated rank for rank exactly in the same way as officers of the Executive Branch of the Navy. For the higher ranks of the Rcyal Marines we propose that Colonel-Commandants should receive half-pay at the rate of 2Z. 5s. a day, and that the half-pay of General Officers should be the same as the half-pay of Flag Officers. It will be seen from this that the half-pay of a Colonel-Commandant and of a Major-General will be the same, which is the case at present.10. We consider that unemployed pay should only be granted in cases where officers unemployed in the naval service are not undertaking continuous professional work for which payment is made.11. Any periods during which unemployed full pay or unemployed pay are received should only count as half-pay time.   Half-pay time should count as at present.12. We recommend that any officer declining an appointment should be at once placed on half-pay.13. As regards officers under 40 who at present, if retired, receive the half-pay of their rank, we would observe that in future their retired pay should not depend upon half-pay, as in some cases this would be excessive, and it will be necessary to fix fresh rates of retired pay to meet such cases. This is, however, outside, the terms of reference of our Committee.(Signed)    CHARLES WALKER. (Signed)    E. H. BRUEN.(Signed)    J. W. S. ANDERSON. (Signed;    G. L. BARSTOW.*June 2.I have signed the Report, with the general principles of which I agree. As pointed out in the Report, the specific proposals for rates of half-pay and unemployed pay are contingent on the adoption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the rates of full pay lor naval officers, which are about to be recommended by the Board of Admiralty, and I wish to record that my signature to this Report does not in any way imply acceptance at the present stage of the full pay rates or the rates proposed in this Report.
