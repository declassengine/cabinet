B- 328.MESOPOTAMIA.Administrative Record during British Occupation.(Memorandum by Political Department, India Office.)1. Introductory. The country to be attacked by the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force which left India in the autumn of 1914 was hostile to its Turkish masters. There was a certainty that if bur operations were successful the Arabs would detach themselves from the Turks ; there was a hope that they would attach themselves to us. Accordingly, Sir Percy-Cox, who by many years of service in the Persian Gulf had acquired a unique position and reputation in these regions, was appointed Chief Political Officer on the Staff of the General Officer Commanding. On him devolved the solution of the political, administrative and diplomatic problems which resulted from the progress of the Army, Prior to the occupation of Baghdad, Sir P. Cox conducted his correspondence exclusively through the General Officer Commanding; in August 1917 he was given the title of &quot; Civil Commissioner &quot; and was authorised to report direct to His Maiesty&apos;s Government, addressing his communications to the Secretary of State for India,2. Military Situation. As operations progressed, the military map of Mesopotamia showed a base at Basra, a long thin line of communications on the Shatt-al-Arab to Kurna, and thence tip the Euphrates to Nasiriyah, and up the Tigris to Kut. At a later phase the Tigris line extended to Samarra with outposts at Falujah on the west and Baqubah on the east, but for many months after the fall of Baghdad there were no troops on the Euphrates between the Hindiyah barrage and Nasiriyah. The Arab is a notorious marauder, and it was the policy of the Turk to make him harass our flanks and embarrass our convoys. It was the work of Sir Percy Cox to persuade him to good behaviour and gradually to attract the Shaikhs and the cultivators to an active appreciation of Western administration. Shortly after our arrival in Baghdad deputations arrived from the Euphrates begging the presence of a British representative for the maintenance of inter-tribal order and the visible guarantee of authority. In the Basra Vilayet districts were formed and were peacefully running while the fighting before Kut was still in progress ; within four months of the occupation of Baghdad the whole of the surrounding country was under control, representatives of Government in four instances Arabs were established in district headquarters, and the tribes, many of whom were still armed with British rifles and British ammunition, spoils of Ctesiphon, were back on their canals busy with the coming harvest. As our sphere of influence extended, contact was established with Kurdistan and Persia, with the Arab of the desert and the Arab of the Peninsula, and to Baghdad were attracted the refugee Armenians of Van, Assyrians from Julamerk and Chaldeans from Urmiah and Salinas, 50,000 in all, the feeding and con-tentment of whom has been an added care. j3. Early administrative Problems. The administrative problem had two aspects, rural and urban ; and the problem of the town was the more difficult. The machinery of Govern-ment had been Turkish, the towns were cosmopolitan. In Basra even before the war the rupee was more current than the piastre; in Kerbala Persian and Hindustani were better understood than Turkish; the population of Baghdad contained Sjn-ians, Armenians,&apos; Chaldeans, Indians and Persians, French nuns and Jewish rabbis. The townsfolk, even the villagers, considered themselves distinct from and superior to the mere &quot;Arab&quot; of the countryside and desert. The personnel of the Ottoman Government invariably fled on our approach, and except at Basra were careful to remove or destroy all records. But the townsfolk expected government. On our entry into Basra, the date harvest had to be collected and disposed of; revenue charges were due, Customs dues awaited collection, litigation awaited settlement, property changed hands and legal sanction was required.4. Machinery of Government. To assist Sir Percy Cox, Mr. H. Dobbs, I.C.S., was sent out in January 1915 as Revenue Commissioner. He found that in the Basra vilayet the land revenue demand was for the most part fixed, and other taxes collected by farmers. He made such alterations in the contracts as equity demanded, but generally speaking maintained the previous system. He was fortunate in finding the demand registers intact. Waqf property was regulated, an education policy framed, and the Avork of administration was gradually crystallised. He left in 1916 and was eventually succeeded by a Revenue Board of two officers who assumed under Sir Percy Cox control of Land Registration, Land Revenue, Land Settlement, Customs, Excise, Miscellaneous Revenues, Public Debt and Waqf. To these was added the duty of Legal Remembrancer.s 50   100  8/19a
With the advance to Baghdad the Revenue Board for practical purposes split into two. In the siimmer of 1917 the experiment was made of separating the Basra vilayet as an-administrative unit from Baghdad, the former governed by a Deputy Civil Commissioner under Sir Percy Cox&apos;s control, the latter governed directly. The functions of the Board were somewhat similarly divided. As facilities for com?nunication increased it was found possible again to centralise, and the two-vilayet system was abandoned contemporaneously with the departure of Sir Percy Cox in 1918 for Teheran. By the summer of 1918 the departments under the Revenue Board had grown to require a director at the head of each. In. 1919 the supervision of these directorates was taken from the Revenue Board, which was abolished, and all work became centred in the Civil Commissioners office, the secretariat of which combines the work which in India would be divided between Government, the Financial Commissioner and the Accountant-Ceneral. The districts have been combined into divisions, and in each division a local Advisory Council has been, set up.5. The administration in working. The machinery thus created enabled settled govern-ment to proceed pari passu with the advancing army, and to spread rapidly on either flank. Political officers, sent to act at first as intelligence officers with headquarters in the field, were left to open political offices at the headquarters of former Turkish districts, as the army advanced beyond them.&apos; They were visited by the revenue officer, who ascertained the agricultural requirements of the area, and made provisional arrangements for revenue establishment and collections. Recommendations were submitted for the Civil Commis-sioners orders, and in a few days business proceeded normally. Thus, for example, though the Turkish officials had fled, yet within three hours of the occupation of Kirkuk an effective municipality was created ; within seven days revenue collections were proceeding, arrange-ments for the restoration of agriculture were in train, and even an orphanage had been established.  This was but one of many instances.6. Considered departmentally the activities of the Civil Commissioner and his staff may he summarised under the following heads : (i) Political-The Arabs of Mesopotamia, hostile to Turkish rule, are content underour administration. The tribes beyond Mesopotamia, Arab and Kurd, are in friendly relationship, while the growing prosperity of Mesopotamia and the opening up of communications has exerted a favourable influence on affairs in the neighbouring districts of Persia.(ii) Land Revenue and Agriculture. While we were still in Basra small agriculturalloans were made to the Shaikhs of agricultural tribes. Within four months of the occupation of Baghdad, our influence was extended to the cereal-growing country on either flank, and a scheme was ,put forward, sanctioned, and carried through whereby by close co-ordination of military and civil resources, over 100 canals were restored to efficiency, nearly 7,000 tons of seed, and 20,000Z. of cash, were distributed as advances ; the staff almost entirely local necessary to supervise and account for the detailed transactions was collected and trained, and two new canals with a command of 100,000 acres, designed by Willcocks, were constructed. As a result, the country, which the year before was restless and in the grip of famine, not only required no imports, but produced a surplus sufficient for the increased population attracted from starving Turkey and Persia, for the 50,000. refugees at Baqubah, and for the supply to the army of corn, which by the end of 1918 had amounted to over 50,000 tons. Wheat and barley sold in 1917 at from AOl. to 100Z. a ton. The present price is from 51. to 10Z. At a cost of 21,0Q0Z. the scheme produced crops worth over 2,000,000/. The development scheme of 1917-18 was followed in the ensuing year by the formation of a Board of Agriculture, the establishment of an agricultural and an irrigation directorate, and the co-ordination of all activities directed towards the increase of the food supply. Two new canals have been established and colonised, and new head-works provided for the most important canal (the Khalis) on the Diyalah river, which, thanks to Turkish neglect, was threatened with complete destruction. River protection work has been such that never in the history of Baghdad have floods of equal severity proved so harmless.In all this there has been the closest co-operation between the military and political authorities.(iii) Customs, Excise and other Taxes. It has been found&apos; necessary to abandon certainof the justly unpopular Turkish taxes in particular the poll tax for roads, war taxes, and in certain areas the salt tax. The provision of international law to the effect that the fiscal policy of an occupied country must be maintained, has been scrupulously observed. Sea customs have proved a profitable source of revenue from the first; and land customs on Persian trade are duly levied. The rights of the bondholders of the Ottoman debt have not been neglected ; and though it was impossible to permit the debt with its central offices at Constantinople to continue
to function, its revenues have been collected and in many cases expanded, and separate accounts carefully kept.fiv) Justice. Before the advance from Kut civil justice was administered by a Court in Basra, which in civil matters applied regulations based on Indian law, or the personal law of the litigants, and in revenue and fiscal matters followed the Ottoman code des terres. Crimes were dealt with by courts-martial, military governors or political officers ; and iii tribal cases a regulation based on the Indian Frontier regulation was found a success. In Baghdad a court for small causes (known as the &quot; Peace Court&apos;&apos;) and a Qudhis court were opened in 1917 : followed in 1918 by Courts of First Instance and a Court of Appeal. In this vilayet Ottoman law was applied from the first, and steps have since been taken to assimilate the legal system of Basra to that of Baghdad. Arab judges are asso-ciated with their British colleagues in all the Mesopotamia!! civil courts, while the Baghdad &quot;Peace Court&quot; has throughout been placed under the sole presi-dency of an Arab judge.(v) Education. Our policy has been to encourage indigenous schools, to provide technicaltraining, but to open Government schools only when teachers of an approved standard are available.   Of 80 ex-Turkish schoolmasters who applied for posts at Baghdad, only five were found suitable.   A training school for teachers was also opened, from which qualified teachers are being recruited for Government schools. There are now 20 missionary schools in receipt of grants in aid.   A school for Mamurs (revenue officials) and surveyors was established at Baghdad, and turned out 80 qualified surveyors in its first year of existence.   A self-supporting coin-mercial school is proving most popular.   The Boy Scouts movement has been started, and promises success.(vi) Medical. Three towns have a whole-time Civil Surgeon; others part-time men.Sanitation in all towns is regulated. Progress has been hampered by lack of staff, but a D.A.D.M.S., Civil, has been appointed, and a scheme for the provision of 34 hospitals is under consideration.(vii) Civil Post Offices. There are 11 Civil Post Offices open, 11 more sanctioned forwhich recruitment is proceeding, and a further 22 under consideration.(viii) Militia. Patrol and guard duties on roads, rivers and railways, and at Governmentstores, where troops are not available, are performed by the Aral) militia (Skabanah), raised, trained, and commanded by British officers. They assist, when necessary, in revenue collection, in the suppression of tribal disturbance, aud the arrest of evil doers.(ix) Government Press. There are Government presses both at Basra and Baghdad. Six vernacular papers and two English daily papers, apart from pamphlets, official publications, and the Monthly Gazette are published.(x) Surveys. A commencement was  made with the training of  stall &quot;on the firstoccupation of Baghdad. Mr. Glass, of the Survey of India, has laid out several rectangles, and it is hoped to avoid the multiplication of departmental surveyors, which obtains in India, by forming a survey department to fix points within which cadastral surveys sufficient for all purposes can be completed by a less highly trained staff.(xi) Archaeology. Precautions have been taken to preserve sites and maintain Govern-ment rights in antiques discovered. Under the auspices of experts certain works of research have been undertaken. Mosques and other historical relics, neglected or damaged under Turkish rule, have been repaired and restored. Every care has been taken to prevent antiquities leaving the country.(xii) Finance. While active operations continued the more important services werenecessarily of a military character, and their cost was borne by military funds. The accounts of the civil administration were able to show a profit, and the following sums were paid over to Imperial Treasury in respect of &quot;surplus revenues,&quot; viz.:- 15O,O0OZ. in January 191.6, and 350,000 . in February 1918. There is also an unpaid surplus of 433,000L in respect of last year. The Civil Commissioners budget for the current year, of which we have received only a brief telegraphic summary, shows a deficit of 422,0001.; but it is to be noted that of the total estimated expenditure (3,330,000 .) a sum of 7o3,OOOZ. is entered on account of pubiic works and irrigation, a considerable proportion of which iss 50 A 2

Up to the time of the armistice the course of progress, both political and material, was unchecked. The people had been assured the country would not revert to Turkish rule, and they took it for granted that they would remain under British protection. They had seen our work in battle and in administration ; they appreciated our thoroughness, our strict justice, and, above all, our rapidity of action. Since the armistice the position has not improved. The delays and uncertainties of the Peace Conference have had their inevitable reaction upon local opinion. Distrust of our intentions and fear of the return of the Turk have been engendered. For reasons which need not he discussed here, it was considered necessary to invite the population of Mesopotamia to express their views on &quot;self-determination.&quot; They reflected that if they voted for the Turk and the British came, they would be none the worse ; whereas if they voted for the British and the Turk came, they would inevitably pay the penalty. Their open declarations in our favour were therefore the result of stable conviction. The continued postponement of a decision gives endless opportunity for agitation, while it necessarily tries the patience of our friends. Arab hopes and fears in Syria also have had their influence on Mesopotamian politics The results are to be seen not only in signs of unrest in the interior of the country, but in actual disturbances in the outlying districts, particularly in Kurdish areas, where no less than three incidents involving the murder of British officers have recently occurred. At the same time material progress on the previous scale has become impossible ; and both the Agricultural and Irrigation Departments are depleted of officers who cannot afford to abandon the certainty of good employment elsewhere for the doubtful prospects which are all that Mesopotamia can at present hold out. Already men of excep-tional experience have been lost to the country; Col. Garrow has gone to the Argentine, Col. Evans to Burma, and Col. Engledow to England.8. There is also the financial aspect. &quot;We are at present bound to accept Turkish fiscal policy, and a financial system which requires complete reform has to be made to serve. We cannot inaugurate new taxes; we have had to abandon old ones. Mesopotamia is to all practical intents and purposes a separate State; yet a proposal by the Civil Commis-sioner to introduce a Customs barrier against the Syrian frontier has had to be negatived. Other sources of revenue that await exploitation, e.g., rise in land values, minerals and lease of State lands, must remain untouched. The longer the delay the greater the political and financial embarrassment.9 A few remarks may be added as to the position of the India Office in relation to the Civil Administration of Mesopotamia. The circumstances in which the Chief Political Officer with the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force was accorded the title of &quot; Civil Commissioner and the right of direct correspondence with HisMajesty&apos;s Government, through the Secretary of State for India, have been mentioned in an earlier paragraph. This arrangement, which was introduced in August 1917, has been maintained dowruto the present time. The India OlHce has dealt iff the first instance with all reports, recommendations, &amp;c. from the Civil Coinmis-sioner while the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government (on other than military matters)
Lave invariably issued in the name of the Secretary of State for India. The latter has throughout acted in the closest possible co-operation with the Foreign Office and War Office, while on all questions of high policy reference has been made to the Eastern Committee1 of the War Cabinet. But the India Office has been, and still is, the Department primarily responsible. The supervision of the Secretary of State for India in matters of policy is exercised direct, and not through the Government of India, though the latter are kept regularly informed of all that passes, and are consulted in every case where Indian interests are specially affected or where the advice and experience of the Indian authorities are likely to be of value to His Majesty&apos;s Government. In matters other than those of policy, e.g., the auditing of accounts, the supply of material, the grant of local allowances and so forth, the supervision of the Government of India, subject to the ultimate authority of the Secretary of State, is still maintained. The task of meeting the requirements of the civil administration, as well as the military needs of. the army of occupation, has throughout imposed a severe strain upon the resources of India, both in man-power and material.10. The present arrangements are essentially of a provisional character.   Introduced at a period when military requirements far outweighed political and administrative considerations, they have survived into a time when the civil, as against the military, aspect of the local administration has necessarily become more and more pronounced    It may be recalled that Baghdad has now been in British occupation for nearly 2\ years, and Basra for little short of five years.   The task of supervising the civil administration has enormously increased, and is rapidly outgrowing the powers of the small staff of the India Office Political Department (which has to deal simultaneously with such questions as Persia, Arabia, Afghanistan, Tibet, and the Indian Native States) to handle w-ith the requisite degree of efficiency, while there are no signs of the creation of the new Department of State which it has been proposed should take over the Middle East.   So long as the future of Mesopotamia hangs in the balance awaiting the decision of the Peace Conference, it may be held that the moment for a change of system has not arrived ; but that the present arrangements cannot be maintained indefinitely is a proposition that scarcely admits of dispute, though India&apos;s interest- historical, religious, and commercial-in Mesopotamia will always give the India Office a claim to bo consulted.Political Department, India Office, 20th August 1919.1 Au informal Committee (known as the Mesopotamia Administration Committee) was first appointed in March 1917 to deal .with the problems arising out of the occupation of Baghdad. The functions of this Committee were subsequently enlarged and its name changed to &quot; Middle East Committee.&quot; Later, the whole position was regularised, and the Committee was reconstituted by order of the War Cabinet, under the title &quot; Eastern Committee.&quot; The Eastern Committee was dissolved in January 1919, but its functions are to a great extent earned on by an Inter-Departmental Committee on Eastern Affairs, which meets from time to time at the Foreign Office.   Lord Curzon has been the Chairman of all these Committees.
