(&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]- - 344Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1919.SECRET. G.244.WAR CABINET.RESEARCH COMMITTEE.Report on Meteorological Services.Reference.1. IN their letter of the 25th January, 1919 (appendix), the Treasury requested the Committee to advise upon the organisation and co-ordination of the meteorological services of the country, and they enclosed papers relative to the question of re-organising the Meteorological Office in such a way as to enable it to satisfy the special requirements of the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, while continuing to carry on the meteorological services which it has normally performed in the past.Introduction.2. We have examined these papers and other correspondence bearing on the subject.   We have also received evidence from the following witnesses : Sir Napier Shaw,, F.R.S., Scientific Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government on Meteorology.Colonel Blandy, R.A.F., D.S.O., Deputy Director of Communications, Air Ministry. Captain Douglas, R.N., Assistant Hydrographer to the Admiralty.We find that the calls for meteorological information and advice have steadily increased in all sections of the Service, and that in the course of the war the demands which the fighting services have made on Meteorology, have been so greatly enlarged as to render a reorganisation of the State Meteorological Service inevitable.It is noteworthy that the new demands made heavy drafts both upon much of the research work carried out by the Meteorological Office in recent years and upon the records of the office which embody the results of discussion of accumulated observations and of statistical information. Indeed, the experience of the war years has shown that, for known and possible demands alike, adequate provision for the systematic collection and study of current observations and the maintenance of facilities and staff for meteorological investigation, are primary necessities in the organisation of a State Meteorological Service.In 1917 the Meteorological Office submitted a statement which showed that, besides carrying on the investigation of varied problems in meteorological science most of which have an immediate practical bearing, the staff were called upon for expert information or advice under the following heads : For public administration : information bearing upon  Food supply. Water supply. Roads.Public health.Conditions of working in factories, &amp;c. Law cases.[1936]
Navigation and transport By sea : weather conditions of sea route. * By land.*By the air : weather conditions of air routes.*Explorations Supply of instruments and information. Training of staff.Agriculture and commerce (local and imperial) Climatic conditions of various countries and their variations. Weather conditions.*Engineering Information bearing upon the working of engines at various levels in different parts of the world.Naval and military services Information as to climatic conditions of various theatres of naval, military, andaerial warfare. Informatiori as to weather conditions in these areas. Information bearing upon Gunnery.Gas warfare.Sound ranging.Bombing.Training of scientific and technical staff. Supply of instruments.3. There has not recently been any material alteration in the nature of the services required from the Meteorological Office by the Civil Departments of the Government, the Mercantile Marine, or the Industries, and the machinery for supplying such services has already been established within the existing organisation of the Meteorological Office. So far as these needs are concerned the Central Meteorological Service will have to be developed in certain directions which have been indicated by the Meteorological Committee in their statement of the 28th December, 1917 ; this development would not, however, call for reorganisation although it would necessitate a considerable increase of staff.4. The dominant new considerations in the national requirements in respect of meteorology are those which concern the needs of the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and Commercial Aviation.In 1915 the War Office, with the aid of the Meteorological Office, formed a meteorological service for the army. The officer personnel of this service was made up of men from the staff of the Meteorological Office and others trained in the office. The Royal Naval Air Service was developed under the Admiralty at the beginning of the war; in 1918 the greater part of it was transferred to the Air Ministry who have since largely expanded it. The Meteorological Office has co-operated with all these services as fully as was possible with the limited staff at its disposal but, taken as a whole, the arrangements which were made under stress of war did not provide a satisfactory measure of co-ordination.In the case of the Army we find that the provision necessary to meet their require-ments has recently been the subject of discussion with the Meteorological Office and that a scheme of consolidation of service and personnel has been drawn up which is entirely in accord with our conclusions.We have received evidence from the Admiralty and the Air Ministry as to their continuing requirements.5. In Sections 6-11 below we state the general conclusions at which we have arrived and we indicate the more important considerations which must, in our opinion, affect the lines of reorganisation to be adopted.In Sections 11-17 we deal with the methods by which the personnel of the several fighting services may be related to the Central Meteorological Service on a reorganisation of the meteorological services generally.In section 18 we state our recommendations on the whole question referred to us.* These services included forecasts of weather and the supply of information to local establishments as a general basis for local forecasts.
Considerations which affect the Organisation and co-ordination of the MeteorologicalServices of the Country.6. On the necessity of a very large measure of consolidation of meteorological services we wish to emphasise the following points: (a.) The meteorological material required by the Meteorological Office (for general service) by the Admiralty, by the War Office, and by the Air Ministry is, to a large extent, common to all of these as a basis for their current work. / All this material ought to be available in a ready and systematic way for research, and the advance of meteorological science in the interests of all these services.(6.) Uniformity of practice in meteorological observation both here and in othercountries is of first importance, (c.) For weather-work speed of transmission  is essential, and a scheme oftransmission common to all the services should be arranged if that speedis to be secured with economy. (d.) The number of skilled meteorologists is not large, and a good organisationof meteorological services is necessary for the full use of the trained staffavailable, or likely to be available.These four factors demand the closest co-operation possible between the several existing services. We are of opinion that this co-operation can best be provided for by establishing a central organisation for all common parts of the current work, and by placing in that organisation departmental sections maintained for the special standing or occasional needs of individual services, viz., the navy, the army, the air force, the mercantile marine, and commercial aviation. These departmental sections should have access to the work of the Central Service, and the Central Service should be kept informed of the work and projects of the Departmental Services.7. The organisation as a whole ought to be such that each service would benefit by joint arrangements in respect of Systematic observations on land, at sea, and in the air (observations from all are required for the benefit of each Service).The speedy and regular collection of these for current examination.The preparation of general or particular forecasts from them. (The best use of the material, a wide range of observation, and special skill in interpreting them are required.)The distribution of weather reports and forecasts, either generally or to particular centres. (Speed of collection and transmission is greatly increased1 by central organisation.)Access to printed and manuscript records in the Meteorological Office.On the other hand, one service or another would require, either regularly or from time to time, special additional information or interpretation, which could be readily prepared by the departmental offices working in close relation with those of the general organisation. So, too, the general forecasts received at a particular station could there be supplemented by the local officer in consideration of local conditions and in the light of later local observations.8. In the 1917 proposals for expansion of work under the Meteorological Office, emphasis was laid on the development of local forecasting stations to serve special areas or special interests, industrial as well as military. For the proposals made by the Meteorological Office a considerable increase of staff is required, but this provision would be a measure of economy if it were arranged as part of a service common to the several groups of requirements in this matter. Under the organisation contemplated, secondary forecasting stations, able to make local forecasts in supplement to the general forecasts issued by the Central Office, would be maintained at centres of permanent or temporary importance in respect of marine, aerial, military, or other requirements. These local forecasts would be based on the information supplied from the Central Office as to general conditions and prospects, together with further information supplied specially to the local station from the Central Office or elsewhere, and they would be framed with a knowledge of local conditions at the time of forecasting, and also of the general climatic conditions of the locality.In the establishment of local stations for obseivations and for forecasting, the authorities concerned with the development of civil aerial transport will require to have [1936] &quot; B 2
power and facilities for prompt action. They should, however, keep the Central Service fully informed of the action they contemplate, for that service has increasing interests in world meteorology.9. Much research is required no less for the increase of knowledge of meteorology than for improvement in its practical application. There is little that is sectional in this. For instance, meteorological science as a whole is now specially concerned with full and accurate information as to the conditions prevailing in the upper atmosphere, and this calls for a considerable extension of the work which has been done by the Meteorological Office in the course of the last twelve or fifteen years at its own observatories and with international co-operation; to-day, the air services give increased facilities for these investigations, and the requirements of aviation make them specially urgent. Again, weather research cannot be carried on apart from daily study of weather in a Forecast Office. Thus current search work would gain greatly by the maintenance of close touch between the various sections of the staff, and by the readiness with which all aspects of particular phenomena could be brought under review. Indeed, the sections of the Meteorological Office which are charged with scientific investigation, and with the collection and discussion of statistical and other information, serve all sections which have to deal with applications of meteorology. It is therefore very desirable that the organisation of the service as a whole should be such as to facilitate temporary interchange of officers between sections, so that all might have at least a general knowledge of the methods employed within the office.10. The methods of providing for the requirements of the services and the extension of their field now call for special attention to organisation in view of (a.) The nature of the information necessary for aviation which has to be based on observations on land, at sea and in the air;(6.) The importance of the systematic observations obtained from ships ;(c.) The demand for information as to conditions prevailing in the upper air over a wide region;(d.) The advantage to he gained by linking up the British meteorological servicemore closely than at present with that of British Dominions ; (e.) The need for rapid communication of reports;(/.) The maintenance of interchapge of current observations with foreign countrieson as simple a basis as possible ; (q.) The need for defining a single channel for international communications, and (h.) The advantage of placing the peace arrangements for meteorological serviceson a basis which would simplify the transition from peace to war conditions.11. The number of trained meteorologists on whom the public services can draw at present is very limited. It is therefore necessary to make the best possible use of the powers of these well-qualified men, and for this the organisation of the meteorological service as a whole must be complete. For all service that requires men to be meteorologists only, it is desirable that there be a sufficiently broad field to make the profession of meteorology attract young men of promise. Further, it is important that there should soon be adequate provision of University teaching in meteorology and of related Research Studentships, so that the growing demand for meteorologists would be met.Correlation of Personnel.12. In the matter of personnel the special requirements of the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and any public service established in relation to civil aerial transport, should be met, in the case of each, in either or both of two ways, viz. : (a.) Individual members of the staff of professional meteorologists in the general Meteorological Service should maintain special touch with the needs of that separate service, and should be marked out for duty in it, if and when required.(b.) Officers whose career started and was expected to continue in one of these services, and who appeared to be qualified for meteorological work should be seconded lor a period to the general Meteorological Service; while attached to that service ihey would acquire familiarity with the methods employed m those branches of the work which are of special importance to their own particular service. Of the officers who showed aptitude in their period of such seconded service, some should be selected for a later period of experience at the Meteorological Office. Their duty during this later period would be in a position of greater responsibility than their earlier duty had been.
13. Some such method of connecting serving officers with current meteorological practice would enable each of these Departments to obtain meteorological experience for a number of its own men without withdrawing them from normal service experience and promotion. It would keep the general Meteorological Service in touch with the requirements of the services. It would provide these services with a supply of men who had had training in meteorology and who would be the more valuable in many ways, including staff work.14. The Army Council have asked the Meteorological Qffice to arrange for maintaining a meteorological establishment to meet the requirements of the Army under peace conditions and capable of ready expansion if and when required in war. This scheme is in practical accord with that suggested in (a) of paragraph 10 aoove.15. Captain Douglas, R.N.. in giving us evidence for the Admiralty, outlined a scheme which combines the suggestions made in (a) and (6) of paragraph 10 above. This scheme could readily be worked out in detail by the Central Meteorological Service and the Navy.16. Colonel Blandy, D.S.O., R.A.F., in giving us evidence for the Air Ministry, informed us as to the special meteorological requirements of the Air services, emphasising as requirements peculiar to them (a) particulars as to upper air conditions, and (6) local forecasting. He expressed the view that a single meteorological service could meet the needs of the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and public and commercial interests. He stated that the Air Force required all that the others required, with information as to the upper air in addition, that it was essential to security that a trained meteorologist should be attached to each aerodrome, and that meteorological information was so vital to the Air Services that they would prefer to control the whole.17. On the general question of the possibility of co-ordination, and indeed of a large measure of consolidation, there is thus practical agreement. The further question as to what Department of State should be responsible for the administration of a consolidated meteorological service is now before the Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet in the form of a proposal that the Meteorological Office be placed under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and we understand that, with the exception of the Air Ministry, all the Departments concerned have expressed their concurrence in the proposal.   On this question we are not asked to express an opinion.18. We recommend that (a.) The provision for the Meteorological Office be so increased as to enable it to perform the functions of a central State Meteorological Service.(6.) The Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry should be represented on the Board of Management of the Meteorological Office with other State Departments for whose operations meteorological information is required, and with members selected in respect of special knowledge of meteorological science.(c.) The Meteorological Office should be removed from South Kensington to some place within easy reach of the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, and should be in direct communication with the General Post Office and a wireless station.(d.) The collection of current meteorological observations should be a general service. Provision should be made for the collection of supplementary area observations required for local or area forecasts. The Air Ministry should have power to establish meteorological stations required in connection with aerial routes, although not otherwise necessary for the general meteorological service. The observations made at such stations should be reported for record and reference at the central Meteorological Office, as ship obser-vations now are.(e.) The Meteorological Office building should be suitable for the accommodation of a service on a much larger scale than at present, and should include rooms for - officers detailed by the several War Departments of State for metero-logical duties there.(/.) These officers should have ready access to the library and records available at the Meteorological Office for reference, and should carry on their work in due relation to the general service of collection of information for the office.(g.) The special arrangements for the Meteorological Service which the central office could render to each Department, War or Civil, should be made between the authorities of the Meteorological Office and those of the Department concerned.   Departments other than the Meteorological Office
should keep that office informed as to any changes in the nature and extent of their meteorological requirements, arid should not themselves make provision for these unless it is found that the needs cannot be supplied by the general service.(h.) Current reports and general forecasts for publication as from the central office should be issued only on the authority of the Director of the Meteorological Office, local forecasts and secondary forecasting stations on the authority of the several officers in charge of stations. Forecasts embodying specific statements as to &quot; flying conditions &quot; should he published only on such authority as the Air Ministry directed. Similarly other state-ments implying expert advice in specific applications of meteorological information should be subject to the authority of the Departments concerned.(k.) The Central State Service embodying the existing Meteorological Office should be, as that office has hitherto been, the channel for international meteoro-logical arrangements.H. A. L. FISHER (Chairman).F. G. Ogilvie (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 18, 1917.APPENDIX.Letter from the Secretary &amp;f the Treasury to the Secretary of the Research Committee.Sir, Treasury Chambers, January 25, 1919.I AM directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter dated the 6th December last from the Meteorological Office, with enclosure (in original for return), relative to the question of reorganising the office in such a way as to enable it to satisfy the special requirements of the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry, while continuing to carry on the meteorological services which it has normally performed in the past.My Lords fully recognise the necessity of co-ordinating the work of the Meteorological Office and the special meteorological services of the different Depart-ments of State, and the desirability, if possible, of concentrating the whole of the services in one building, and they think it would be very desirable that the question should be considered and reported on by a committee appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.I am therefore to request that you will be good enough to submit the document enclosed herewith to Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee of the War Cabinet, which is considering certain questions regarding research, and to ascertain whether that Committee would be prepared to take up and advise upon the organisation and co-ordination of the meteorological services of the country.I am, &amp;c.ROBERT CHALMERS.o
