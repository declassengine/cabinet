Government that no person should be employed in any government Office during the present war who was not the child of natural born subjects of this country or i an Allied country unless there was a definite National reason for such employment you appointed us on 2nd August last as a Committee&quot; to examine the case of every such person as to whom it might be alleged that there was a definite &quot; National reason for the continuance of his employment and to report to you thereon.&quot;We now beg to report as follows.We interpreted the Reference as confining our jurisdiction to a consideration of the cases of persons as a whom it might be alleged that a definite National reason for the continuance of their employment existed and we considered that such an allegation should be made by or on behalf of the Heads of the Government Offices to which the Government decision applied. We were supplied by your Secretary with a list of those Government Offices.We accordingly caused a circular to he sent to the Head of each of the Government Offices in that list, asking to he supplied with the name and address of every person employed in the office either of whose parents was not a natural horn subject of this or of an Allied country; and if as to any such person any claim was made for the continuance of his or her employment on the ground that a definite National reason for such continuance existed, we asked for detailed information regarding such person, and for the ground upon which the claim was made.We have set out in Appendix I. a copy of the terms of Reference, a copy of the List of Government lOffices supplied to us, and a copy of the circular issued by us to the Government Offices.We were anxious to report at an early date, and in our circular we asked that the information should be supplied to us by the 30th August last. We are satisfied that the officials of the various Government Offices did their best to comply with our request, and to supply the information as quickly as possible, and we desire to plaoe on record that we have received every assistance in conducting our enquiry from the Offices concerned.It is only quite recently, however, that complete information has been received from some of theIOffices. We mention this fact not by way of complaint, as we believe that the delay was quite excusable, but merely to explain why this Report has not been presented sooner.Tor the purpose of our Enquiry we considered that the countries which should he treated as Allied Countries should be determined as of the date when we were appointed to hold this Enquiry, and we have treated Russia, Russian Poland, Roumania, and Brazil as Allied Countries. In all other respects we have dealt with each individual case as of the date on which we adjudicated on the claim for the retention of his or her services.The returns made to us by the various Government Offices of persons employed by them as coming I within the terms of the Government Order showed a total number of 2,186 of such persons.We have carefully considered each one of these cases and we have also made an analysis of the returns with the following results.592 of these persons should not, in our opinion, have been included in the Returns at all, upon the ground that they do not come within the terms of the Government Order as interpreted above.The remaining 1,594 persons whose names are set out in Schedule I. may be classified as follows:_In 220 cases both parents were enemy subjects.In 615 cases one parent was an enemy subject and the other either a natural born British, or Allied, or neutral subject.In 468 cases one parent was a natural born British or Allied subject and the other a neutral subject.

380REPORT.To the Right Honourable the Prime Minister.ISir,In consequence of the decision of H.M. Government that no person should be employed in any government Office during the present war who was not the child of natural born subjects of this country or if an Allied country unless there was a definite National reason for such employment you appointed us on !nd August last as a Committee&quot; to examine the case of every such person as to whom it might be alleged that there was a definite a National reason for the continuance of his employment and to report to you thereon.&quot;We now beg to report as follows.We interpreted the Reference as confining our jurisdiction to a consideration of the cases of persons as to whom it might be alleged that a definite National reason for the continuance of their employment existed and we considered that such an allegation should be made by or on behalf of the Heads of the Government Offices to which the Government decision applied. We were supplied by your Secretary with a list of those Government Offices.We accordingly caused a circular to be sent to the Head of each of the Government Offices in that jt, asking to be supplied with the name and address of every person employed in the office either of whose parents was not a natural born subject of this or of an Allied country; and if as to any such person any claim jwas made for the continuance of his or her employment on the ground that a definite National reason for ;uch continuance existed, we asked for detailed information regarding such person, and for the ground upon jwhich the claim was made.We have set out in Appendix I. a copy of the terms of Reference, a copy of the List of Government Offices supplied to us, and a copy of the circular issued by us to the Government Offices.We were anxious to report at an early date, and in our circular we asked that the information should be supplied to us by the 30th August last. We are satisfied that the officials of the various Government Offices did their best to comply with our request, and to supply the information as quickly as possible, and we desire to place on record that we have received every assistance in conducting our enquiry from the Offices concerned.It is only quite recently, however, that complete information has been received from some of the [Offices. We mention this fact not by way of complaint, as we believe that the delay was quite excusable, but merely to explain why this Report has not been presented sooner.For the purpose of our Enquiry we considered that the countries which should he treated as Allied Countries should he determined as of the date when we were appointed to hold this Enquiry, and we have treated Russia, Russian Poland, Roumania, and Brazil as Allied Countries. In all other respects we have dealt with each individual case as of the date on which we adjudicated on the claim for the retention of his or her services.The returns made to us by the various Government Offices of persons employed by them as coming within the terms of the Government Order showed a total number of 2,186 of such persons.We have carefully considered each one of these cases and we have also made an analysis of the returns with the following results.592 of these persons should not, in our opinion, have been included in the Returns at all, upon the ground that they do not come within the terms of the Government Order as interpreted above.The remaining 1,594 persons whose names are set out in Schedule I. may be classified as follows:-In 220 cases both parents were enemy subjects.In 615 cases one parent was an enemy subject and the other either a natural born British, or Allied, or neutral subject.In 468 cases one parent was a natural born British or Allied subject and the other a neutral subject. In 276 cases both parents were neutral subjects. In 15 cases the nationality was not known.A. large proportion of the above persons were women, and in many instances of both men and women aey were themselves natural born British subjects though of the parentage above described.2 iQ?e?nite clai^S w-?re made for tte retention of the services of 1,232 persons out of the total number of Mob above mentioned.a fl J^Af 5Hy P0118^/ whether there was any general rule which we could adopt as to what constituted eiS? I5atl0?1al/e.a.S0n/or *he continuance of any particular person or classes of persons in Government mpioy, and while failing to discover any rule which would he applicable in all the cases which were brought(21464.)   Wt. 41439-1.   3000.   6/19.   T) &amp; S.   G. 2. A
before us, we considered that a definite National reason for the continuance of his or her employment did exist where:  (1) A man after serving in His Majesty&apos;s Forces and having been wounded, or invalided out of tk Services, had been taken into Government employ. A woman who was either wife or widosj of a man serving or who had served in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.(2) A man who, being a member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces, was with official sanction employed oil work in a Government Office of a kind which we considered to be of more use to the State that any work upon which he could otherwise be employed in the service to which he belongs, o a man who, having been in His Majesty&apos;s Forces, was a time-expired man.With regard to persons who did not fall within any of the above categories, we felt that if we were j do justice as between individuals we must adopt some test or tests which would be applicable to all alike.In every case, therefore, which did not fall within the above categories we considered : -(1) Whether the work upon which the individual was engaged was in its nature of definite national importance.(2) Whether, assuming that it was of such national importance, it could be suspended temporariljwithout injury to the national interest. (3 Assuming the answer to the first question to be in the affirmative and the second in the negativethen whether some efficient substitute for the individual could be found.This last question involved many considerations, such as the technical character of the work done In the individual, the special fitness of the individual for the work on which he or she was engaged, and tk possibility of finding anyone with sufficient experience, or anyone at all, to take his or her place. To sow extent we had to take into account the fact that by the Treasury Minute of September 4th, 1918, it appears that the persons who were removed in consequence of the determination of the Government were to be treatei as merely suspended during the war.Our investigations have necessarily been confined to those cases which were brought before us by tin Heads of the different Government Offices.We have carefully considered all the information laid before us, and we have heard all the Officials froi the various Government Offices who have expressed any desire to be heard before we came to any decision, an as a result we have inserted in Schedule II. the names of all the persons with regard to whom we wen satisfied that a definite national reason existed for their continuance in National employ. The total numbc is 745. Against the names of the persons falling within the categories mentioned above and numbered and 2, we have inserted either the letter B (Category 1) or the letter C (Category 2) as indicating the categor into which the individual falls. The names which have no&apos; letter appended to them are the names of i\ (individuals who have, in our opinion, satisfied the above mentioned tests.We wish to make it plain that the non-inclusion of any person&apos;s name in Schedule II. does not invoh any suggestion of want of loyalty, or want of capacity, or want of devotion to the Public Service. It due, and due entirely, to the fact chat his or her particular employment or qualification either did not justil the Government Office in making any claim for the retention of his or her services, or that we consider? that the claim as made did not justify us in coming to the conclusion that the tests which we have aboi indicated were satisfied.We desire also to say that having regard to the terms of the Reference we did not consider ourseh entitled to consider in reference to any individual any question of hardship, or loyalty, or capacity, ( length of service, or in reference to the working of any department any question of inconvenience, evt though it might be of a serious character.We desire to place on record our great indebtedness to our Secretary, Mr. W. de B. Herbert, Ban at-law, who has himself done practically all the clerical work involved in our Enquiry, and all the , entailed in the classification of the Returns and the preparation of the Schedules for this Report, and \vi by his courtesy and attention has greatly assisted in the performance of the duty, which you placed upon uIn conclusion, it may be of interest to you to know that in no single instance have your Committ differed in opinion as to the decision at which they ought to arrive.We have the honour to be,Your obedient Servants,JOHN E. BANKES. JAMES CRAIG. ALBION H. RICHARDSON.W. de B. HERBERT,Secretary,February 14th, 1919.ruJ^^T&amp;&amp;J2?tbg &amp; Sf His Majesty1?
