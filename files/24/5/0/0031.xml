G.-231.WAR CABINET.-SOLDIERS&apos; AND   SAILORS&apos;  PAY   COMMITTEE. 4Seventh and Supplementary Report.*Previous Papers G. 154, G. 172, G. 188, G. 193, G. 207, G.T. 5148, G.T. 5203, and W.C. 235 (13), 280 (11), 320 (8), 349 (10), 364 (13), 435 (10), 449 (15), 451 (10), 477 (4), 479 (14), 486 (11), and 498 (1).I.1. In this Seventh and Supplementary Report, the Committee deals with the question of a further increase in Separation Allowances for Wives and Dependants of men in the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force..The Committee was re-assembled in accordance with W.C. 447, Minute 4, when the War Cabinet decided that the Committee should meet in order to see whether the Separation Allowances to the relations and dependants of Sailors and Soldiers ought not now to be increased.These terms of reference were widened, after consultation by the Chairman with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the extent that the Committee was authorised to cover the whole ground of the pay and allowances of the three fighting services, paying particular attention to the question of increasing the present rate of Separation Allowances.At a later meeting the War Cabinet decided that the question of the pay of the Army and Navy should not be considered until after the question of.an increase in the Separation Allowances had been reported on.  (W.C. 479, Minute 14.)2. The Committee has held three meetings, and now submit the following Interim Report.3. The Committee decided to defer their recommendations on the question of increased pay to a later report.II.Wives, Children and other Dependants.1. The Committee summarise their recommendations under this heading as follows : (a.) That the flat rate now payable to wives remains at the present figure.(b.) That the allowance supplemental to the flat rate payable by Local War Pensions Committees to a wife without children when she is unfit or unable for other reasons to obtain employment should be increased from 4s. a week to 6s. 6d. a week.(c.) That with reference to other dependants who are unable to earn, the supple-mental allowances now payable by Local War Pensions Committees up to 33^ per cent, of the assessed dependance should be increased to 50 per cent, of the assessed dependance.id.) That where there is one child under the age of 14 in the family, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance shall be increased by Is.(e.) That where there are two children under the age of 14 in the family, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance shall be increased by 2s.(/.) That where there are three children under the age of 14 in the family, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance shall be increased by 4s.
(g.) That where there are four children under the age of 14 in the family, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance shall be increased by 5s., with an increase of Is. for the fifth and each subsequent child.(h.) For motherless children under 14 years of age, the weekly rate of Separation Allowance for one child maintained in a home shall be increased by Is.(i.) That the weekly rate of Separation Allowance for the second and subsequent motherless children maintained in one home shall be increased by Is. for each child.(j.) That the flat rate allowance of 5s. a week shall be payable to the parents of unmarried sailors, soldiers and airmen who have attained the age of 18 years, and who were under 26 on enlistment, provided that they are not entitled to a larger allowance under previous regulations.(k.) That the flat rate increases and the Parents&apos; Allowances referred to in paragraph (j.) shall be payable as from the first pay-day in November 1918, and the Supplemental Allowances referred to in paragraphs (b.) and (c.) shall come into operation on the 1st November 1918.2. It is estimated that the cost of the above proposals will be approximately  17,765,000 for the three services, but it is impossible to estimate with any accuracy the amount which will be payable for the supplemental rate to the wife without children under the proposals now submitted.A sum of  500,000 has been included in the above total, as an estimate of the amount which will be payable.III.Childless Wives.1. In recommending an increase to the Supplemental Allowance payable to the flat rate to wives without children, who are unable to work, the Committee also took into consideration any possible defects in the present system of administration.It was clear that women were not made sufficiently acquainted with the fact that these grants were payable, and the Ministry of Pensions is issuing a special notice calling attention to the Supplemental Allowances which may be granted to wives under certain circumstances.The administration by the Local War Pensions Committees of these allowances is undoubtedly very unequal. The Ministry of Pensions is consequently issuing a circular calling the attention of such Committees to the alterations in the Regulation dealing with this grant, as recommended by the Committee, and pointing out that the grants for the Childless Wife are to be paid as a matter of course in every case where the woman is not earning wages. The regulations of the Special Grants Committee will be amended accordingly.Other Allowances Payable by Local War Pensions Committees and the Civil LiabilitiesCommittee.In addition to the 6s. Qd. mentioned above payable to the Childless Wife, it should be noted that further grants are payable in all cases by Local War Pensions Committees or the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee which may be summarised as under : (a.) An allowance up to 12s. a week towards rent, insurance premiums, hire purchase payments, mortgage interest, if she can show that her present income is less than her income before her husband&apos;s enlistment after taking into consideration the saving in expenditure resulting from his absence.(b.) Grants up to 10s. a week during serious illness.(c.) Grants from the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee if the total of her rent, insurance premiums, etc., exceed 12s. a week.In calculating the allowance payable under (a.) the income taken into consideration is the income of the household as it was or would have been in January, 1918, but for the husband&apos;s enlistment.
172Separation Allowances for Children.It will be remembered that, in addition to the increases to rates for children which came into force in March 1915, January 1917, and October 1918 respectively, and those now recommended, the Government relieved the soldier of all compulsory allotment in October 1917, and raised the minimum pay of all ranks to Is. 6d. a day in November of the same year, besides approving of the payment of proficiency pay after six months service, and Id. a day for each year&apos;s service since the outbreak of hostilities. Hospital stoppages at this time were also abolished. These increases added more than 3s. 6d. a week in every case to the pay of the lowest rank and more than 7s. a week when he had dependants.The corresponding concessions to the Navy took the form of increases of pay to certain ratings, relief in respect of allotment charges and hospital stoppages and the issue of a free kit.A Statement is appended shewing the rates of wives&apos; and children&apos;s allowances for the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force as recommended in this Report, and at the various periods when they came under review and. were increased.V.Separation Allowances for the Wives of Junior Commissioned Officers.The financial position of the Wives of Junior Commissioned Officers was brought to the notice of the Committee, and it was generally agreed that no Separation Allowance was desirable.The rate of children&apos;s allowance to such wives appears, however, to require reconsideration. The Committee did not feel justified, under its terms of reference, in making any recommendation on this subject, and therefore ask now for the authority of the War Cabinet to do so.VI.Increase of Pay for the Navy and Army.The Committee will submit their recommendations under the above heading in a further Report.(Signed) G.
