1 * TKjj ORIGIN AND FIWilONS.OF THg SUPR igg WAR COUNCIL..In November 1917 an important advance was made in the sphere of inter-allied co-operation.   More and more the conviction had grown upon the Associated Governments that the machinery existing for conference and consultation &quot;between the Allies had proved cumbersome and inadequate.   The desirability of creating such a body as the Supreme V/ar Council had been foreseen and was suggested by the late Lord Kitchener early in 1915.   It was not, however, until two years later that circumstances rendered i; necessary tn carry the idea into practice.   The. strategical surprise effected by the Germans against the Italian Army with the consequent reverse sustained by the latter, brought matters to a head, and it became evident that a Very much closer co-operation was necessary for a successful prosecution of the war by the Allied Nations.As far as the Central Powers were concerned the mind of Germany dominated their military policy and gave it . effective coherence and meaning.   Germany was however, accepted as the predominant partner because her contribution was far greater &quot;than any of her partners.The efforts of the Allies, each of whom wasindividually exerting his uttermost strength, on the other handlacked co-ojpelinatlon, and the intermittent conferences betweenthe heads of the Various states, though enabling many differ-ences and divergencies of opinion to be smoothed over couldnot ensure close and continuous working on common plans thatcould meet with the approval and agreement of all.   Such planscould only be ensured bv regular and frequent council togetherbetween the heads of the various Governments allied andassociated together against the Central Powers.   It wasobviously impr act triable that all could participate as severalof the minor - 2 ------
of the minor states at war with Germany and her Allies were taking no active part in the war at all and others but a very small one which even proportionately was in no way commensurate with the efforts and sacrifices that were being made by iSngland, France, Italy and subsequently were to be made by America whose adhesion in tho spring of 1917 promised to be the decisive factor, were the war to be continued another eighteen months or two ^ears.   The United States was in fact at that period the great reserve force of the Allies and though their assistance up to that time had been confined to moral, financial and. material support their devolop/ent as a military power was already taking shape, and the advance guard of their armies had even then arrived in jiiurope. Very naturally the\ were therefore invited to participate from the beginning though they had not been represented at the initial meeting at Rapallo on November 7th 1917.The only other great power technically at war with Germany and her Allies was Russia.   There the unrecognised Communist Governor.ent was in power with the avowed object of making peace at the earliest date and it was therefore obviously impossible that overtures could be made to them to participate.The smaller nations were ignored as far as permanent representation was concerned though provision was made for the attendance of any of their representatives when occasion demanded.The agreement arrived at at Rapallo provided that the Supreme V:*ar Council should consist of two representatives from each of the Great Powers, the Prime Minister and&quot;one other Minister of Cabinet rank.   It was thus primarily a political and not a military body, its object br;in,^ to secure such adjustment and co-ordination of national policies as would m^ke possible the execution of a single, comprehensive,strategic
strategic&quot; plan of allied operations.   The working out ofsuch a plan on broad lines in its technical militaryaspect Txas assigned, to permanent military representatives,who would have at their disposal both the information inpossession of and the separate plans put forward by theseveral General Staffs, but details were, of course, to beleft to the Commanders-Iri-Chief or the several fronts. Otheradvisers on the Various technical aspects of the war were tobe called in as required.   It was contemplated that the fullCouncil should meet, if possible, at least once every month,the military representatives being, on the other hand, incontinual session.To give effect to the above scheme the followingresolutions were adopted:-I.        The representatives of the British, French and Italian Governments assembled at Rapallo on the 7th November, 191?, agree on the scheme for the organization of a Supreme War Council with a Permanent Military ^-representative from each power.Scheme of Organization of a Supreme war Council.II.(1)   v/Ith a view to the better co-ordination of military action on tho Western Front a Supreme V/ar Council is created, composed of the Prime Minister and a member of the Government of each of the Great Powers whose armies are fighting on that fi^ont. The extension of the scope of the Council to other fronts is reserved for discussion with the other Great Powers.(2)   The Supreme v/ar Council has for its mission to watch over the  eiieral conduct of the war. It prepares recommendations for the decision of the Governments, and keeps itself informed of their execution and reports thereon to the respective Governments.(3)   The General Staffs and Military Commands of the armies of each Power charged with the conduct of military operations remain responsible to txuair respective Governments.(4)   The general war plans drawn up by the competent Military Authorities are submitted to the Supreme \Var Council, which., under the high authority of the Governments, ensures t:-e&apos;r concordance, and submits, if need be, any necessary chances *(5) Each.. 4 -
(5) Each Power delegates to the Supreme War Council 92 one Permanent Military Representative whose exclusive function is to act as technical adviser to the Council.(6) The Military Representatives receive from the Government and the competent Military Authorities of their country all the proposals, information, and documents relating to the conduct of the war.(7) The Military Representatives watch day by day the situation of the forces, and of the means of all kinds of which the allied armies and the enemy armies di spose.(8) The Supreme &quot;.\r Council meets normally at Versailles, where tho permanent Military Ropresenta-tives vnd their staffs nre established.   They may meet at other places as may be agreed upon, according to circumstances.   The meetings of the 3upreme ?.&amp;v Council will take   -lace at least once a month.The above resolutions make clear that the Supreme War Council was in the first place a political and not a military body.   The only actual members were to be the Prime Ministers of three Great Powers; in the case of the United States such adviser as might be designated by the President&apos;, and also one- other Cabinet Minister. As this second Minister need not always be the same Minister the Supreme War Council was in substance to be a Council of 7rime Ministers, i.e. of the men who have the fin.--.l decision on all- questions of policy andaction inTho Representatives of tho Groat Powers attending the Rapallo meeting were as follows:-For Great Britain:    Mr. Lloyd George, Lt-Gen Smuts,General Robertson and General Sir Henry vilson.For Italy: Baron Sonninc.For Prance: Painleve, M. Franklin-Bouillon,M. Barrere, General Foch, General Gondrecourt and General Weygand.Secretaries:        Lt-Col Eankey, Count Aldrovandiand Comdt. Kftlbronner.As regards the United States of America arrangements were made for Mr. A.II. ?r&apos;*zier, Counsellor of Embassy, American Embassy, Paris, to attend meetings of the Military Reprcscnta-tives pending the appointment of an American Military ftcprc-sentative.   Mr. Frazier however was merely to hole a watching brief on behalf of the United States of iimerica.About the middle of November 1217, General Taskcr H. Bliss took up his duties at Versailles as Permanent Military Representative, American Soction, Supreme War Council, but was subsequently absent from Versailles from Dec.6th,1917 -Jan. 2Sth, 1918.
saction in their respective countries.   Once these were, agreed on a policy they ware in a position to carry it out assuming always they retained the support of their colleagues and their Parliaments.The Supreme 7/ar Council was thus to be an /, :.. &quot;&quot;-Vinstrument for arriving at a common policy in the conduct of the war.   It wa3 not to bi an instrument for carrying out that policy.   It was however designed to be far more efficient than the periodical conferences bet7:sen tho Governments which had been carried on at intervals throughout the war.   But constitutionally speaking it was on the same footing as these conferences.   The Council could not by a mere majority decision compel one of the Governments represented to carry out a policy of which it disapproved.     Uor had it any field of executive authority of its own apart from the executive authority of the Governments represented which remained as it was before,   Its creation had not altered anything in the constitutional position .?nd responsibility of the Governments taking part in it or of any organ of these Governments.     In this respect the best parallel to the Supreme V-ar. Council known to British Constitutional practice was the Imperial Conference, a body venose object was to promote identity of policy and co-operation among tho different governments of the British iianpire without in any way affecting their constitutional autonomy.But as was obvious under tho stress of the urgency of war the Suorsine &apos;.&quot;ar Council had to develop from the outset certain machinery for securing its own continuity and. tha proper presentment to it of the subject matter of its discussions. In the first place the continuity of i;,s working was to be largely maintained clurin-;; thc-i interval between the monthly meetings by frscoent visits ou the part of trw second Minister whoas a member
of the Supreme &quot;far Council and acting in full touch with the Prime Minister should be able to maintain informally that direct personal contact between the heads of Governments which was the essence of the idea ?;hich underlay the v-bole fabric.A very important portion of the machinery lay in the appointment of a body of Permanent Military Representatives one for each power, whose duty it w?.3 with staffs to assist the/, in their work, tojstudy the whole military situation in the light of all the factors that 8-ffected it and to submit collective reasoned conclusions to the Supreme &quot;?ar Council which were considered and if acc .)ted, translated into action by the Governments concerned.
II.    THE ORGAglgij TIC-:.; CP gig SUPRS-ilJ V/7&apos;R COj: CIL.oCoThe scheme for the organisation of the Supreme War Council as adopted at Rapallo was translated into action as follows;The Constitution of the Supreme V/ar Council itself has already been defined.The machinery itself was composed us under:-Permanent Military Rep r * j r. ent a t i ye s.Each Power delegated to the Supreme Far Council one Permanent Military Representative, whose exclusive function was to act as technical adviser to the Council. Each Military Representative was to receive from his Government and the competent military authorities of his country all the proposals, information and documents relating to tho conduct of the war, and to watch day by day the situation of the forces and the means of all kinds of which the Allied armies and the enemy armies disposed.   The offices of the Permanent Military Representatives were established at Versailles- and for this purpose the Trianon Palace Hotel was requisitioned and placed at their disposal by the French Government.The following Military Representatives were appointedand took up their duties at Versailles at the end of November,1917.France: General V/eygsnd.Great Britain:     General Sir henry 7;llson.Italy: General Cadorna.For the United Dtatcs of America General Taskcr Bliss took up his duties in November 1918.
In order to enable trie military Representatives to ,carry out the duties allotted to them as above defined, it was decided at the 2nd Session of the Supreme War Council, held at Versailles on the 1st December, 1917, that they phavOud&apos; b-e provided with all the necessary documentary and other information.   And in order to facilitate the reception and distribution between the Allied Representatives of this information that each Section of the Supreme War Council was to comprise a permanent Secretarial Staff.The Supreme lor Council further decided that the permanent Secretarial Staffs of the respective countries should, in concert, organise a Joint Secretarial Bureau for the production and distribution of the notices, agenda, protocols and prcces-ver^baux of the meetings of the Supreme War Council and for such other collective business as might be found desirable to entrust to It.In addition to the exchange of papors and information which went on continuously^ it wa3 decided that formal meetings of. the Military Representatives should, take place at frequent Intervals.As.regards the procedure to be followed at these meetings, It was decided at the third meeting of the Military Representatives held at Versailles on &apos;Jednesday, 12th December, 1917, that at each sitting of the military, Representatives one of the Military RepresBntativ-^s should act as Chairman of that particular sitting and direct its proceedings.   In practice, each Military Representative was askid to take the Chair in turn, following the order- of entry of the four countries represented into the war.
It &apos;ti.as also decided that tho advice tendered to tho Supremo&apos;&apos; War Council by tha Military Representatives should, take the form of Joint Hote3.    It rcaa agreed that Joint Notes should be signed by all the Military Representatives and sent by each Section of the Supreme &quot;Jar Council to the Head3 of their respective Governments.On the 23th February, 191S, the Military Reoresentativpassed the following further resolution :-&quot;After a brief exchange of views, the Military Representatives decided that In cases of emergency three Military Repre-sentatives would constitute a quorum and that the absent Kilitary Representative might be represented by his Chiof-of-Staff who could in such case sign for him.&quot;Further, at the 51st Meeting of the MilitaryRepresentatives held on 19th May, 1918, the followingresolution was adopted : -&quot;Tho Military Representatives decided that Joint Hotes must represent, the unan-imou3 opinion of tho Military Representa-tives and will be signed by each of the four Representatives.&quot;The 1st Meeting of the Military Representatives washeld in the Council Chamber, Versailles, on the 4thDecember, 1917, at 3.30 p.m.   And between that date and the12th November, 1918, 51 Meetings were held.   At theseMeetings a variety of questions were formally discussed andunanimous decisions were reached on a variet3r of differentsubjects.   The decisions which represented the unanimousadvice of thy Military Representatives to their Governmentswere, as stated above, expressed in the form of Joint NotesA Naval Liaison Committee constituted the necessaryInter-link between the Military j- epresentativos and the/Allied NaCouncil sitting in London.S. Dependent
Dependent on the Military Representatives were the Inter-Allied Technical Coinmittces on Aviation and Tanks. These Committees, besides affording opportunities for interchange of views on the organisation and development of those more modern branches of military science, also acted as first-hand technical advisers on subjects, either referred to them by the Military Representatives or initiated b^/themselves.   Their recommendations were either embodied in the Joint Notes submitted to the Supreme War Council, or were forwarded to the authorities concerned.(a) Inter-Allied Avi&amp;tion Committee.This Committee was created by Joint Note No. 7, of 8th January, 1918.The first meeting took place on the 9th Hay, 1918, at Versailles.   In the course of various sittings, this Committee studied and unified:-(1) The future programme of Inter-Allied Aviation.(2) The creation of an Inter-Allied long-distancebombing force, the British nucleus of which contributed in the oourss of its defensive and offensive operations to the partial and total destruction of lines of oommmication and the material, as well as to render difficult and precarious the supply of food and. munitions to the enemy.(b) Inter-Allied Tank Committee.This Committee was crsated by Joint Note No. 9, on the 8th January, 1918.   ,This Committee, the first Meeting of which took place on the 6th May, 1918, drew up and secured acceptance to a construction and organisation programme for this entirely new arm.
It succeeded in speeding up industrial production of tanks by hastoning the construction of tho Inter-Allied factory at Chateau Roux,It worked out the organisation of means of transport practicable for all classes of tanks (motor lorries, special waggons, etc).It brought about agreement ancng the Allied Governments as regards the simplification and the unification of various models of tank, each nation profiting as much as possible by tho experiments of the others,Finally, it set up an inter-allied school of instruction from which valuable information was drawn both by tho General Staffs and by tho personnel whose instruction was carried on in close contact with the other arms.In close liaison with the Transportation Council it made a study of a waggon programme for the transport and concentration of a great quantity of tanks.The Inter-Allied Transportation Council acted in an advisory capacity in supplying information regarding transportation problems confronting both the Allies and the Central Powers.This Council, created by Joint Kctc No. 8, of the 8th January, 1913, received freedom of action from the Supreme vfar Council, and was made an executive bod;&apos;&apos; not dependent on the latter.In close liaison with the Military Representatives itimproved tho output of lines of communication, especiallythose with Italy, and brought about a better use of variousInter-Allied rolling-stock.*ae nigri uonmana ax so entrusted lo it, numerousquestions for the bettor conduct of the war by the Improved
use of material and personnel.*The Organisation of the British Section.The British Section of the Supreme iVar Council, formed in November, 1917, consisted of a small number of officersspecially selected and representative of every combatant branch of the Service, to serve on the Staff of the British Military Representative.-  The organisation of this Staff, as designed by General Sir Henry Wilson, was drawn up on a new system.   For, instead of being framed on tho usual organiso.tion under which a Staff is divided into sub- . Branches dealing severally with General Staff, Adjutants1, , Generals1 and Generals1 questions, Sir Henry 311.,ondivided tha British Section into three main branches, known as &quot;A&quot; (Allied and Neutral), &quot;JJ&quot; (iinsmy and Neutral), and &quot;M&quot; (Wan-Power and Material, Allied and iinemy) .     The , advantages of adopting this system of division for Versailles are apparent, when it is remembered that the Military Representative1s Staff acted, merely in an advisory capacity, and. that the role of this Staff was not to frame and issue orders, nor to perform executive duties in any way, but to appreciate the possible effects of the adoption of courses open to the Allies or to the enemy in any theatre of operations, and generally to forecast and study tho strategic situations likely to arise in the future.A short description of the nature of the rcork of each Branch illustrates the working of the system. &quot;A&quot; (Allied &amp; Neutral),In this Branch, the situation of the Allied forces on all fronts was kept up to date, and the military aspect of the strategic situation, as visualised by an imaginary Supreme Commander, was repeatedly summarised and revised.
Did the Enemy Branch prepare an offensive on any front (on paper1), the Allied Branch countered this by suggesting means by which such an offensive could be met.   Owing to the gigantic extent of the world war. the problems, even if only treated from the broadest of aspects, were exceod-ingly intricate.     The Branch was sub-divided so that different officers specialised in tho several theatres. &quot;B&quot; (Enemy &amp; Neutral).The problems arising from the situations on the various fronts were presented by &quot;ii;&quot; Branch entirely as if originating from the enemy High Command,   tapers wore oroduced dealing with the possibilities of ?,uccessfulftaction on the several front?; as it drawn up by the enemies1 Staff.   Consequently the adversaries were v/orking man-tally against each other, and the view of a strategic situation which is apt to be formed if the same heads worked out the problems from both points of view, was avoided. &quot;e&quot; Branch like &quot;a&quot;, was sub-divided for specialisation in the several theatres. &quot;!&apos;i&quot; (Man-Power and Material) .This Branch was divided into throe sub-Branches; The first dealing with Allied fjid Snemy Man-Power problems, the second with Munitions questions, and/the third with Supply and Transport and Transportation considerations.By &quot;ft&quot; Branch, were issued periodically, &quot;Strength Returns&quot;, Allied and inemy, on all fronts, compiled from information obtained from the &apos;7ar Office, G.H.C!s, and the Allied Sections of the Supreme V.&apos;ar Council.   These included estimates of numbers of personnel, guns- machine guns, aeroplanes, tanks, etc.The main
The main role of &quot;M&quot; Branch was therefore to provide the necessary information and advice regarding available resources in men and material required by the Supreme *7ar Council as the corollary of projected plans.   To this end it was furnished with the necessary figures and kept posted in the necessary detail by the YJar Office.In any co-ordinated Allied strategical plans &quot;M&quot; Branch also saw to the co-ordination of Allied administrative resources by the interchange of views and statistics v;ith their Allied neighbouring sections, and further the co-ordination of Allied demands for men and material whether dir3ctly connected with Allied plans or not.One of the most important items of the work carried out by &quot;M&quot; Branch, was the consideration of the train capacity of the various Railways, Allied and 3nemy, in order that the rate of reinforcements of the several fronts could be calculated for the operations proposed by &quot;A&quot; and &quot;S&quot; Branches.   For this work, most valuable assistance was afforded by the Members of the Inter-Allied Transportation Council.Political Branch.The duty of this Branch was to study the Political Situation in all countries in so far as it might affect the Military Situation and render such assistance as might aid the other Branches in their appreciations.   A weekly appreciation was produced both from the Allied and iSnemy point of view.As an example of the work it may be mentioned that the forecasts of the German and Austrian offensives, both as regards dates, place and number of divisions engaged, were as a matter of fact very accurate.In order to keep the Military Representative ported with the Military and Economic Situation in all Theatres of
Far, as well as in neutral countries, noekly Summaries of Information were issued by all Branches of the Staff, dealing with the particular subjects d^alt with by the branches or sub--branches,   Exchange of information was constant between tho allied Sections.   Representatives of the Staff attended the Meetings of the Inter-Allied Councils and Committees on Manpower, Aeroplanes, Tanks, Supplies and Munitions.Organisation of the French, /jnerlcan and Italian SectionsH(a) The French Seqtion which was composed originally of some twelve officers was divided into throe sections - Western Section, Eastern Section and Economical and Political Situation,(b) The American Section followed the lines of the British Section.(c) The Italian Section was not divided up on either of the above lines but worked as a whole on all the subjects under consideration.Joint Secretariat.At the 21st Meeting of the military Representativesheld on the 11th March 1918, tho following resolutionlaying down the procedure to be followed by the JointSecretariat^ was- -adopted: -&quot;The Military Representatives decided that a Summary of Decisions of both the Supreme T.Var Council and the Military Representatives and of the Executive War Board should be made by the&apos; Joint Secretariat immediately after any meeting, and should consist of the names of these present or participating, and the subjects, decisions and resolutions taken, and these only:    that the official text consist of a triple identical Angiish, French and Italian version, and be deemed authenticated when agreed upon by the Joint Secretariat:    and that ; inute? of the Meetings be prepared subsequently by the Joint Secretariat&quot;.In oreotic - 1.6 - &quot;0
In practice it was found advisable to issue theminutes and the resolutions as two is. spar its documents: one document to contain both minutes and resolutions, and the other to contain the resolutions only.   The reason for this was twofold:-(a) Tho resolutions call for immediate action.   As their terms are decided on at the meetings, they can be issued at once.   By issuing thorn separately, this essential desideratum is secured,(b) The minutes, on tho other hand, have to be circulated In the first instance in draft form to all who attend, for correction, and delay must in consequence ensue.Finally, at tho 35th Meeting of the military Representatives, the following     dialon vras reached, with reference to tho working of tho Joint Secretariat: -The Joint Secretariat comes into operation with reference to:-I. Meetings of the Supreme War Council at which theReads of Governments take Decisions.II. (A) Meetings of Permanent Military Representatives(B) Meetings of Co;-imittees which deliberate in order to tender advice to the Permanent Military Representatives.In both cases the work required is :-(a) Preparation of Agenda.(b) Recording and Issuing of Conclusions in an agreed form.(c) Recording and issuing of Minutes in an agreed form.(d) Communication of (a),      . (b) and (c) to their respective Governments or Committees of the Supreme Y/ar Council for information, signature or action, as required.
I.   TEE SUPRilMil \7AR CODICIL.(a) To form the Agenda, the assent of the Government is reqairedcThe vie^s of, the Governments having been obtained by their Military Representatives, it lh the duty of the various Secretaries to combine a programme and circulate it to all the Representatives in-time.(b) The Conclusions are to be drawn up immediately by the Joint Secretariat in an agreed form, in 3 languages.(c) The Minutes rill bu prepared by tho Secretary of the day, who will be of the same nationality as the Chairman of the Meeting. After ccmsul-tation with his Colleagues of the Joint Secretariat he will issue the Kinutes aft soon as possible, as tho authentic text, in hisown language.   A translation of this text into the language of the other countries represented, will be made for the use cf their Government,(d) S&amp;ch Secretary will employ the appropriate agency in his evn country.II.   tm MILITARY RKPR3S2STATIV3S AXJD COMMITTEES.(a)      Agenda.Subjects may be remitted to the Military Representatives in one or other of the following way 3 : -(1)     The Supreme &apos;7ar Council may at one of its meetings refer questions to the Military Representatives for their examin-ation and an expression of their views.(2)     Any Military Representative may summon a Mooting at any time to discuss questions referred to the Military Representatives by any Government.(3)     Any Military Representative may summon a Meeting to consider a question which he wishes to raise on his own &quot;initiative.(4)     The Agenda for each Meeting will beformed by the Secretary of the day, who will be of the some nationality as the Chairman, upon receiving notice as above.   The Agenda will be formed in consultation with the cchor Secretories and ?;iil showt-The Place

These texts will only be finally adopted when approved by the 4 Representatives. A Joint Note requires unanimity and signature of all 4 Military Reprssentatives or 3 Representatives and the Chief of Staff of tho absent Representative.As regards the Hinutes, Mutatis Mutandis, the same procedure will take place as in the case of the Supreme ?7ar Cowaeil. Four copies prepared by the Secretary of the day in his own language, will be signed by each Military Representative. Each Section will retain one of these as the officialiSach Secretary will communicate Joint Notes and Minutes, when prepared, authenticated and signed, as abovej to his own government.The question of the establishment of a single common registry and record office was taken under consideration.   On account of the Staffs and Clerical   . Establishments of the Military Representatives being separate bodies and not a single homogeneous organization, the objections to a single rer;istrj were obvious and no action was therefore taken in this direction.(b)(a)(d)(e)
ITU__THE EXJllCUTIVi: WAR BOAR?.At Its third Cession commencing on 50th January,1918, the Supreme War Council decided on the creationof a General Reserve for the whole of the Armies onthe Western, Italian and Balkan Fronts :   and for thecontrol of this General Reserve under the conditionsset forth &quot;below, the following executive was nominatedFor Frence - General Foch (President)For Great Eritsin - General Sir E. Wilson.For United States - General Tasker Eliss.For Italy - General Cadorra.Tliis Beard v?as known as the Executive ?/ar Board intermediateand was in fact the/step in Inter-Allied cc-operation between a Supreme 7;ar Council and the unified command which was subsequently attained some two months later. As such step was cf such importance the conditions under which the Zixecutive War i!oard worked and the powers appertaining to them are set out In detail as foltorsIn consultation with the Common ders-in-Chief of the Armies concerned :-(a) To determine the strength in all an&apos;a and composition of the General Reserve end contribution of each national army thereto,(b) To select the localities in which the General Reserve was normally to be stationed.(o)   To make arrangements for the transportation and concentration of the General Reserve in the different areas,(d)   To decide and issue crders as to the time, piece and period of employment of the General Reserve, (The orders of the Executive War Board for the movement of the General Reserve shall be trans-mitted In the manner and by the persons who shallbe dei I ma ted
be designated by the Supreme War Council for that purpose in each particular case).(e) To determine the time, place and strength of the counter-offensive and then to hand over to one or more of the Commanders-In-Chief the necessary troops for the operation.   Tho moment this wovenent of the General Reserve or any part of it shall have begun, it will come under the orders of tho Commandor-in-Chief for whose assistance it is designated.(f) Until the movement of the General Reserve beginsit will for all purposes of discipline, instruction o.nd administration be under tho ordeno of the respective Commanders-In-Chief but no movement can be ordered except by the Executive 7/ar Board. It was further decided that in case of irreconcilable differences of opinion on a point of importance connected with the General Reserve any member of the Board had the right to appeal to the Supreme War Council.The Sxecutive War Board was given the right to visit any theatre of war.At the Fourth cession of the Supreme War Council held in London on March 14th and 15th, 1918 certain modifications as re^srds the Executive war Board were introduced and embodied In the following resolutions :-(1)   In view of the great encny concentration on theWestern Front, and the likelihood of an early attack on the British section of the line, the proposals of the Jxeeutive Var 3o--.rd for the composition of the General Reserve jvEKjuire modification.j2)* Thc British c.rA

IV.       THE ROLE CP THE SUPRI^E V/AR COUSCIL SUBSEQUENT TO THE APPOINTl  NT- OF A COUh%;0)ZR-I:!-CHIEPJ)N^THE Y/EST2RII FRONT.Owing to the appointment of General Foch to the Supreme Command of the Allied Armies operating on the Viestern Front, an impression was created that the Supreme ?Jar Council, in its military aspect had been&apos; laro:clv suoerseded and lost its importance,As a matter of fact the functions with respect to which General Pooh had superseded pre-existing arrangements were not those of the Military Repr es en. ta t iv es of the Supreme War Council but a wider and enlarged edition of the Executive War Board, an organisation affiliated since the meeting of the Supreme War Council in February, 1918, to tho Liilitary organisation at Versailles but not forming an essential part of it or concerned with its wider and more important duties of cc-ordinating the military policy and effort of the Allies in all theatres throughout the world,   Tho powers assigned to General Poch did not in any case cover the whole ground.    Circumstances might have arisen at any moment when it might have boon urgently necessary to have sent Allied divisions to the Balkans or to the Palestine theatre or conversely to have brought then from those countries to Franco or Italy,     Someone r..ust bo charged with tho duty of making recommendations on such questions end it naturally fell on the Military Representatives as pr rt of their general task of co-ordinating the Allied effort.Apart from th^ erection of the Supreme Command of the Allied-Armict, in the ,7ect the importance cf tho
- *&apos;functions of the Military Representatives at Versailles was in no way diminished.TftC essential necessity of an organisation   that could study the military situation from the point of view of tho Allies as a whole and not from that of any particular army or General Staff, and which could study it at leisure months in advance and not amid the urgent pre-occupations of existing operations, was just as great as ever.There was no time to be lost in the consideration and preparatio:, of plans for the future- especially, as was then generally contemplated, the war night continue into 1919.   Tho main tactical as well as the strategical features of future operations depended on preparations in the sphere of munitions and transport-ation which It was necessary to decide upon long in edvance if they were eventually to bear fruit.For those purposes tho functions of the Military Staff at Versailles as a centre of co-ordination for all the various Inter-Allied Committees on Transport-ationj Tojaks, Aviation, Military Purchases, etc. was of great importance. It was on this side even more than on tho purely strategical side that tho sphere of its work found its greatest development in the future.Hor was the task of the hilitary Representatives purely prospective.   It was part of their duty to watch over the actual execution of the- pirns and policies decided upon by the Supreme War Council and to draw tho attention of the latter to any failure in carrying thai out,Similarly it was the duty of the MilitaryR epr es on t a t i v eg
Representatives to sec- that the general lines of the Allied plan of campaign for 1918 was adhered to, and that the natural prc-occup-t ion of the individual General Staffs with the immediate situation on the Western Front should not cause them to lose sight of the importance from the point of view of the war as a whole,, ef maintaining and exploiting advantages alrcadv gained in other theatres.As regards the Political side the Supreme War Council was called into existence originally to co-ordinate military policy by substituing for the unsatisfactory method of Conferences, Licisons and ccnprcmiscs, an organisation, for tho working out of common Allied plans of operations.It was obvious, however, that it would be impossible to co-ordinate military strategy unless general policy was also co-ordinated and an organisation for the working out of common diplomatic plans was urgently needed to replace the previous makeshift of wholly disconnected policies mutually kept In touch but also mutually paralysed by the normal clumsy methods of diplomacy.To a certain extent that need was met by tho periodical meetings of tho Supreme War Council or by visits to Versailles of individual members of the Sujer-ome War Council.The need of co-ordination of Allied political plans became ,ar eater and greater with the ever increasing complexities of tho political situation. Russia can be cited as/case in point as their Allied Foreign policy wc* practically part of their War Policyin that it wps
in that it was concerned almost entirely in helping the military s ituatioii.But it was foreseen that the need for co-ordination uould he greatest of all when tho time for tho Peace Conference arrived.   TJnloss the /-Hies had developed some common organisation for the fomulation of a common peace policy they would have been at as great a disadvantage in negotiation as they had at one   time been in strategy.And it is in this direction, perbaps, above all others that tho value and utility of the Supreme War Council lay.

This Declaration includod the following statement&quot; The Supreme War Council gave the most careful consideration to tho recent utterances of the Gorman Chancellor and of tho Austro-Hungarian hinistor for Foreign Affairs, but was unable to find in them any real approximation to the moderate conditions laid down by all the AlliedAGovernments.   This conviction was only deepened by theimpression made by the contrast, botwoon the professedidealistic aims with which the Central voworc oi*v-.vo**(^&apos;omthe present negotiations at Brest-Litovsk and the nowopenly disclosed plans of conquest u  L -spoliation.   Underthe circumstances tho Supremo War Council decided that theonly immediate- task before them lay in the prosecu-tionwith the utmost vigour, and in the closest and frosteffective co-operation, of the military efforts of the Alliesuntil such time as the pressure of that effort shall h,aveorought
brought about in the enemy Governments and peoples a change of temper which would justify the hope of the conclusion of peace on terms which would not involve the abandonment, in face of an aggressive and unrepentant militarism, of all the principles of Freedom, Justice, and the respect for the Law of Nations which the Allies are resolved to vindicate. ifThe Supreme v/ar Council entrusted the respective Military Representatives on the Executive Board With the transmission of its orders to the Armies of the ir several countries.The other questions dealt with during the course of this Session included the followingThe Combatant strengths of the Allied and Enemy powersTlie Situation in Russia.

The Allied


&quot; T -q Alliea Governments have given careful consideration to tho correspondence which has passed between tho President of tho United States and the German Government.   Subject to the qualifications which follow they declare their willingness tc mai:e peace with tho Government of Germany or. the terms oi Peace laid down :in the Presidents address to Congress of January 8th 1916, and the principles of settle: ant, enunciated in. his subsequent addrosees.   The?; must point out however, that Clause two, relating to -what is usually described as the Freedom of tho Seas, is open to various interpretations, some of which they could not accept.   Thev must therefore reserve to themsloves complete freedom on this subject when they enter the Peace Conference.Further, in the conditions of Peace laid down in his Address to Congress of January 8th,1918, the President declared that invaded territories must bo restored as well as evacuated and freed.     The Allied Governments feel that no doubt ourht to be allowed to exist as to what this provision implies. By it they understand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage caused to tho civilian population of the Allies, and tneir property by the aggression of Germany, by land, by sea and from the air.KEITIKGS OF THE PllihAXhVV
MLETIggg OF TKL PggMAgEMT MILITARY K FRLSI.i.TATIVLS.The Permanent Military Representatives held altogether 51 Meetings from the date of Creation of the Supremo War Council up to the last Meeting, held in 1918, which took: place on the 12th November - the day after the signing of the Armistice.     The subjects of discussion wcro remitted to the Military Representatives in one or other of the following ways :.-(1).   The Supreme War Council would at one of its Meetings refer questions to the Military Representatives for examination and an expression of their viows. (2).   Any Military Representative might summon a Meetingat any time to discuss questions referred to the Military Representatives by any Allied Government. (3).   Any Military Representative might summon a Meeting to consider a question which he wished to raise on his own initiative. As regards the minutes and records of beatings, the procsdur was identical with that obtaining in the case of the Supreme War Council itself, except that four copies of the Minutes prepared by the Secretary of the day in his own language were signed by each Military Representative, one of those being retained as the official text in each of the four sections. In the ordinary course the reccmrr.er.dations or decisions of the Military Representatives ??cre embodied in &quot;Joint Rotes&quot;, when submitted to the Supreme   .Var Council, and copies of tneso Notes were forwarded by the Secretaries to the Reads of their respective Governments,   &quot;when inviting attention of otherApartments
Departments or Commanders*-in-Chief, the recommendations took the form of &quot;Joint v^iestionnaires&quot; or Resolutions. Joint notes wore usually considered at the following Session of the Supreme War Council and were accepted in their original or amended form, or rejected as the case might be.     In all 40 Joint Iiotes wore submitted during the course of tho Year.     The Supreme War Council had agreed that where a Joint ;icto was submitted to and accepted by each of tho four Governments during the intervals between successive meetings of   the onpremo War Council, it should take effect.   Tho result was to expedite decisions on matters which were not   of a controversial character, and the ratification of which would otherwise have had to be postponed to the next Supreme War Council Meeting.
VI.      GgKBHAL APPRECIATION.Even retrospectively it is not easy to estimate fully and comprehensively the value cf the work accomplished by the Supreme war Council during its existence.     It is certain that such estimation cannot be effected by a mere detailing of the questions that were considered and. the decisions arrived etj   though a record of these is in the first place necessary to indicate tho scope of its tasks and the concrete facts of their results.     It is in addition important to go beyend these in indicating what cannot be recorded in tabulated or statistical form on paper     -    not only because such factors are liable to be overlooked and perhaps even must ordinarily be overlooked In an official document; but rather because they were none the less vital to the end in view    -    one mind for the Allied Nations.Like every innovation the Supreme War Council wa3 the subject of much criticism.     On the one hand was tho point of view that its existence would, interfere with the authority of the several Comnandcr3-in-Chief in the field which It would tend to weaken, ana, therefore, threaten the freedom of action of the Governments they represented.On the other hand, it was urged that the powers of the Council and its Military Advisors did not go far enough to ensure real utility in that no executive authority was vested in it by a majority vote and that it therefore &apos;could in fact fulfil no rohle that ccuid net be fulfilled by the system of periodical conferences in which the heads cf the various Governments had up to that time participated when they were dependent for their military advice on their respective Chiefs of Staff in their Ministries of War or the equivalent.The first
The first of these criticisms overlooked the fact that there was practically no parallel for the circumstances of the Grand Alliance   -   not only from the number of nations involved and the extent and vastness of the struggle, but from the complexity of the issues which were growing more and more intricate as the war progressed.     To meet an unprecedented situation, in fact, unprecedented measures were necessary.As regards the arguments that the powers of the Council were not wide enough, it must bo remembered that unlike the Central Powers no one nation was the admitted leader of the Grand Alliance, but all were equal partners as far as the Groat Powers participating wore concerned, The minimum interference with tho rights and interests of each by the others was necessarily aimed at and the evils of over centralisation fully taken into account.Compromises, for the Supreme Ivor Council was a compromise, ere never ideal, but they are often eminently practical in that they net only serve the needs of the hour but in themselves evolutionary in their very essence.This is clearly shown by the steps that eventually led to the appointment of a Supreme Commander-in-Chief for the Western front.     The idea of unified command in the most important theatre had long been considered and generally in view of difficulties that need not be discussed here, dismissed as impracticable.     Yet looking back it is clear that such command was inevitable and no one now would admit but that it was right.     The arguments against it were necee?arily political   -   certainly no reasons definitely military could be advanced.     Politics must, however, dominate war in its highest sense   -   as war is in fact onlya continuation
a continuation of politics by other moana.     And, therefore, until, the political objections could be ovoreone the operations of the Allied armies in the Western theatre were handicapped against an enemy with one single purpose and one single will.Just so the necessity for closer inter-Allied co-op era tier in the share of a Supremo V:sr Council was demonstrated by the reverse sustained in the Italian theatre in the previous October, so was tho necessity for a still further step, made clear by the reverse sustained in the French-Theatre in the following March.     This stop bed already been prepared for by the formation of.the Executive War Hoard.The logical outcome of a Supreme War Council was, however, a Supreme Oommander-in-Chief (in each of the minor theatres where Allied troops were co-operating he already existed.)If the Supreme War Council never fulfilled any othernurpose than that of a mere otcrping stone to unifiedcommand   -   subsequently so brilliantly justified by results,,it would have more than rewarded thoce who were responsiblefor its creation.     Nor is there anything to show that theunified command could have teen occorplished by an:/ otherthatmeans than bv a body     &apos;*had by its very existence prepared public opinion for such a meesure; and further at the very crisis of the war was sole to impose it. ^the actual period of the transfer of tho Alliod Armies in tho West to Supreme Command of General Foch the Military Staffs of the Supreme War too 11 were In themselves of great value in providing tho necessary Ison between the Supreme Command while it was in process of taking over;a number of officers were temporarily lent for this purpose. Moreover, le the new General Headquarters war. being constituted Versailles wanto provide temporary facilities in many directions which enabled tho *ge to be made smoothly and without confusion or dislocation.
The subjects and volume of the questions dealt with by the Supreme War Council have already b6cn set out in the detail of the Sessions ana it would, therefore, be redundant to recall them here.     Two, however, may be cited as examples of ho?^ complete and rapid unity was attained among the Allies at critical moments.The first cf these was the decision taken at tho fifth Session in May, 1913, as regard3 the transportation of American troops.     By this the American Government, putting aside for the moment the question of building up a complete and        self-contained American Army in Prance as had been the original ir-tcnticn, agreed to g: ve absolute priority during the months of June and July tc the transportation of combatant troops and men for the service of the railways. The numbers fixed were 170,000 combatant troops for the month of June and 25,400 men for the service of the Railways.     For the month of July 140,000 combatant troops. This sacrifice on the part of the United States Government of the national aspirations for the conmon good was met by one even greater in its way by the British Government which in spite of the very serious shortage then existing turned over sufficient shipping to carry some sixty per cent of the American troops to LIurope.The second instance that may be cited lay in tho acceptance by the Supreme War Council of the recommendation made by the Military Representatives as regards an offensive in the Balkan Theatre at the 7th Session in July, 1918, as a consequence of which all preparations were made in agreement, among the Allies.     The offensive took place in September are resulted in the surrender of Bulgaria on tho 29th of that month which was an importantfactor
factor in convincing the remainder of the enemy of tho futility of further resistance.     Tho success of the Balkan offensive may without exaggeration be said to have been largely        responsible for the end of the war by 1910.Nor is it easy to see how such an extensive and well planned series of operation? could have been carried out by the heretegeneouo forces comprising the Allied Armies in that theatre had. not the inspiration come from coption counsel and common agreement above.Beyond the definite steps taken and the tasks accomplished there was what has been touched on previously the results that are not apparent on the surface.     The Supreme War Council was in its conception and genesis an attempt to &quot;get together&apos;5 on the part of the Allies and to find common ground and so to evolve a united policy for pursuance of tho war.Such &quot;counsel of perfection&apos;1 could never probably in any Alliance be fully realised.     Yet it is impossible to believe that the Allies could have marched so far on that road together as they eventually did without some common meeting ground.Up to the time of the formation cf the Supreme War Council the only common strategy they had lay in their aims to beat the enemy.   Yet as has been expressed in a paper written in the British Section at Versailles, beating the enemy was &quot;really a negative ccnception,: in that it implied that this was the only way tc prevent him beating them and that therefore the idee was fundamentally defensive not constructive.
It was essential to go beyond this if tho maximum effort cf the Allies was to bo exerted and to reach a more extended basis of agreement, which could be moulded into offensive efforts with definite coherence and meaning.If Versailles had boon no more than an Inter-Allied clearing house end a mooting place where tho Allied Staffs could exchange ideas, it would have justified its existence. For it contained under one roof tho Staffs of the four Great Powers in the Alliance working constantly and continuously together,     The broadening influence in the mind of such association cannot be over-estimated,     Indeed, it is so obvious ii need not be enlarged apon.Criticisms have not been wanting that the co-operation between the Allies even despite these conoidera-tions never became sufficiently close.     But interference with the internal affairs of cech or any was always to be deprecated.     It wss the products cf the national efforts of each that required to be co-ordinated anc3 not the ways by which these products were obtainec;.     For each one of tho Allied nations had developed and grown groat on its own particular lines and it would have been unnatural to have attempted to standardise them. .Versailles did give those associated with it a supremely uscx&quot;ul experience and a broad Interallied viewwhich- 5G -
&quot; *;*&quot; *     * ^ *     *      *     *     *     *      *     *P----------------This is especially emphasised when the subsequent rules of many of the Officers who served in the Military Sections there, are recalled.   For example :-General Sir Kenry &apos;,:-ilson left to become Chief of the Imperial General Staff.General F.H.Sykes left to become Chief of the Air Staff.General Sackville-West subsequently became Chief of the British Military Delegation to the Peace Conference..Lieut-Colonel Sari Stanhope left to become Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War.Lieut-Colonel L.S,Amery, H.P., left, to become Under-Sceretary of State for&apos;the Colonies.In the French Section General Weygand who was the French Military Representative until March 3.5th, 1918 went with General Foch as his Chief of Staff when the latter was appointed Coriander-in-Chief on the Western front.General 31iS3. the American Representative,after-wards became one of the American Plenipotentiaries at the Peace Conf-erACnce./were subsequently of great value to the Allied cause.  Lastly the Supreme War Council at Versailles formed a precedent end this fact together with the experience gained by its actual working, should not be lost sight of for future eventualities.If the Grand Alliance or any such similar one should ever again be called into existence and the Treaty made by both G^eat Britain and the United States to defend France once more against an unprovoked attack by Gema^, shows the possibility, then similsr work and similar tasks would be necessitated once more.   And in the contemplation of these it may not be cat of place to recall some words by Kenan referring to the foundations of the desire for a national existence, and apply them to a comity of nations upholding a -greet cause   together.     &quot;To possess common glories in the pastj a common will in the present: to have done great things together j tc desire to do more&quot;.
NOT! JgTTgB -ROLE AND Y/ORS CF THE SUPREME WAR COUNCIL SUBSEQUENT P9 THE DATE OF THE ARMISTICE. &apos;The usefulness of the Supreme /v&apos;ar Council did not come to an end with the signature of the Ariristice with Germany,     The necessity still existed for a common clearing house for Inter-Allied questions and it, therefore, continued to function even subsequently to the assembly of the Peace Congress in Peris in January, 1919.   It was naturally found possible to make material reductions In the Staffs and as far as the British Section was concerned in October, 1919, the Staff w?s amalgami-ted with the Military Section actually working at the Peace Conference.   The American Section had previously taken a similar step.The attached documents &quot;X!l, ,!Yn and &quot;Z11 give an outline of the wr k up to the period of the amalgamation from which time its history more properly belongs to that of the Peace Conference itself.

MR. LLOYD OEQRC-B said that he had discussed with bis colleagues the question of the place at which the Supreme KJar Cabinet was to meet.     Though anxious to -fall in with the views of the Brench Ministers, particularly in vie?-: of the fact that they were supported by Baron. Sonninb, he did not feel able to do so.     he bad hsd ana informal conversation with   M. &apos; PainlevO&quot; and had asked him to select some town outside Paris and he understood h.:Fninlcve&apos; had consented.    If it was found Impossible to work in these conditions it would be necessary to consider the matter,again,     lie desired, however, above all things, that the Supreme l;ar Council should: be independent, and further should, give an impression of independence.     He understood that the French Government - favoured- Versailles,&apos;. and he- recalled, the historical fact that the German Empire had been built up at Versailles, and he hoped, equally that Prussian domination might be broken down at the same place.M. PAIImIEVE said that he was anxious-to show the spirit inwhich the French Government approached the -organisation of &apos;this-Supreme&apos;War Council, and, consequently, although adhering entirely to the views he had. already expressed in resard to the advantages of Paris, he and his colleagues were willing to assent to the establishment of the Council at-Versailles.M. FRArKLIN-BGUILLON supported      Painieve&apos; s views.   He still remained convinced that Versailles was not the best choice, but in order to create an atmosphere of unanimity heas willing to accept Versailles.     There were so many great matters to discuss that he did not tdsh to lose too much time over what was a matter of detal1.MR. LLOYD GEORGE thanked the French Government.     He then pro-, posed the textof tho document constituting the Supreme :V vVar Council, and. nominating the Generals representing the .   three. Powers, which was adopted.       (Annexe I).  ;
BARON SONNINO asked that the agreements should be published simultaneously, the Italian Parliament would meet on Monday, and the Italian Government would make its declaration on that day.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that he and M. Painlove could make the declaration at the Parliamentary dejeuner on Monday.

M. FRANKLIN-BOUILLON said the French Government accepted this proposal.

BARON SONNINO read the terms of reference given to the Military Representatives by the Supreme War Council, which was accepted. (Annexe II).

He said that the Italians had decided to send immediately to the Front the whole of the 1899 class, which would represent about 200,00 men. They would anticipate the calling up of the 1900 class. To call up fresh classes now, when sowing had to be done, would only increase dissatisfaction in the country and lower its moral. Included in the previous classes which were already under arms were man born in 1874.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE said that General Robertson had something to ask concerning the Italian Divisions in Albania and in the Salonica armies.

BARON COMMINO said that we had learned that some German troops passing along the islands along the Dalmatian coast were to be disembarked at Durrazzo.

GENERAL ROBERTSON said that we had just asked the French Government to ask General Sarrail to send reports on the actual situation and in future to send them in a regular manner.

MR. LLOYD GEORGE
MR, LLOYD G50HGS aslied that the Supreme War Council should concern itself with all the fronts where the Allied Armies tvere fighting in common.M. PAIKLSVB said that he absolutely agreed in this.BAHOg SpMlNQ al3o agreef. in this proposal, which was adopted by the Gdnference.(The Conference approved the publication in the Italian Preso of m announcement proposed by Baron Sonnino),Beeisions of a Oonference of Ueprescniatives of t he British, French, and Italian Governments assembled at Rapallo V on November 7th, 1917.X.
