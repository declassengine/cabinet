The reten-ticn or abolition of these censorships depends on .-(1)    The continuance of the blockade,(2)   The terms finally imposed on the enemy, and(3)    the nature of the control to be exercised to enforce those terms.with this latter the question of supplies of essential commodi-ties to ourselves and our allies during the reconstruction&quot; period is vitally connected.  -A consideration of these facts rendered it necessary to make a partial survey of the work of the postal and cablo censorships during the war in order that it might be possible to form a correct estimate of the part which they have played and of the extent to which their continuance is under present conditions essential.The attached memorandum embodies the conclusions arrived at together with a summary of the evidence upon which those conclusions are based.Special attention is drawn to the first of the con-illusions on page 18,  to the effect that .-&apos;&quot;Any relaxation of Censorship control,  either vable or postal during the transition period preceding the final declaration of peace would be most dangerous, 3ince apart from its utility in other respects to the various purchasing authorities there would without it be no means of preventing the Central Powers from rushing into every free market, thereby putting up prices against the Allies,  and greatly increasing the difficulty of arriving at a proper distribution of essential foodstuffs, neither would there be any effective means of detecting movements of securities and funds from enemy countries via neutral countries in Europe to neutral countries overseas, which, for obvious reasons, it is particularly desirable to prevent at the present time.&quot;(Signed)   W.H.

The following memorandum has been prepared in consultation with the expert advisers of the various Authorities concerned, who have been good enough to place their knowledge and experience at the disposal of the General Staff.]As a weapon of economic blockade in time of war the Censorship has proved itself essential. Other means have been available for controlling the direct exchange of merchandize, but no other effective means have been found of detecting indirect financial and commercial dealings for enemy benefit through cloaks and covers in intermediate neutral countries. It would, for instance, have been impossible without the examination of transit mails to prevent trade between South America and Central Europe via Holland and Scandinavia. Had those mails not been examined, most of the cargoes which have been condemned would have had to be.eventually released and allowed to go forward for lack of evidence as to ultimate destination, and many of them would never have been detained in the first instance. The traffic in contraband would, of course, have increased by leaps and bounds, had it once been realized that such traffic could be carried on with impunity, and that the blockade was in such respects as ineffective as a blind policeman.    - .The Censorship has also proved an essential instrument for enforcing restrictions on financial and commercial dealings of a kind prejudicial to the Allied cause by persons in the United Kingdom, and for exercising an effective control over the use and distribution of essential supplies.   The following are illustrations of this : Trading with the Enemy.The restrictions on trading with the enemy depend largely for their enforcement upon the Censor. A British trader could not, of course, even in the ahsence of the Censorship, supply goods directly to or buy goods directly from the enemy, but without it there would have been no effective means of preventing him from entering into transactions indirectly benefiting the enemy through neutral intermediaries. It should be noted in this connection that in all the more important cases of trading with the enemy the prosecution have relied largely on evidence produced by the Censorship.Control op Exports.The control of exports is exercised by the War Trade Department by virtue of a series of export prohibitions issued under Section 1 of the Exportation of Arms Act of 1900 and Section 1 of the Customs (Export Prohibition) Act of 1914, both of which are based on the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1879, and breaches of which involve the penalties prescribed by the last-mentioned enactment. Under Section 8 of the Act of 1879 any person bringing export-prohibited goods to a quay for shipment is liable to a fine of  100 and to forfeiture of the goods. The two main objects of the control have been to prevent the depletion of stocks in the United Kingdom of commodities essential to the conduct of the war and to prevent goods from reaching the enemy through intermediaries in neutral countries.. The most material contribution of the Censorship to the actual enforcement of the export prohibitions has been in the case of goods of small bulk and high value, which may be easily exported by letter mail, e.g., industrial diamonds, in which case it is the only means by which the prohibition can be made effective.   In the case of bulky goods,
pits assistance in preventing unlicensed1 exports has been of a more limited and occasional character, for such goods could not, of course, be brought to the wharf-&apos;for shipment,, still less could they be shipped without the knowledge of the Customs, but cases have occasionally arisen in which, had it not been for the Censorship, shipment would have taken-place on the strength of false representations, and there can be little doubt that without it evasions of this kind would have taken place on a much more extensive scale. The examination of the mails has, moreover, brought to light several cases in which a licence granted to a particular trader has been used to cover the shipments of another trader to whom licences were not being issued.Very valuable information has been supplied from the terminal mails with regard to the storage of goods in the United Kingdom on neutral account, particularl)- in the case of cotton yarn. On the strength of this information a Committee of the War Trade Advisory Committee was recently appointed to consider the question, with the result that the cotton trade was advised not to-accept any further offers from certain neutral countries, which had already ordered more goods than could be allowed to proceed in the near future; and, although this policy has not been enforced by legislation, the recommendation appears to have been followed by a number of the principal firms concerned.It is from the purely blockade standpoint, howrever, that the work of the War Trade Department has been most materially assisted by the Censorship, for without the latter it would have been practically impossible effectively to prevent goods from reaching persons or firms abroad who had close association with enemy countries, and were in reality purchasing for Central Europe.One of the principal functions of the War Trade Department in connection with the blockade has been to differentiate between reliable and unreliable consignees, and to checkmate the innumerable and ingenious schemes that have been evolved for cloaking under a neutral guise transactions for enemy benefit. The Black List, which is, for this purpose, the handbook of the Licencing Committee, has been largely the&apos; outcome of information supplied by the Censorship. Much of the information, on the strength of which that list has been compiled, has, it is true, been obtained from other sources, such as Consular and Secret Service Reports, but it must be remembered that such reports would have in man)&quot; cases been insufficient for the purposes of drastic action had they not been corroborated by the stronger evidence forthcoming from Censor-ship intercepts, and it must also be remembered that the investigations which have resulted in adverse Consular reports have been largely initiated on the strength of such intercepts. In this respect the mails have on the whole provided more information than the cables, for traders are necessarily less reticent, and therefore more liable to indiscretion in their letters than in their telegrams.Control of Imports.The control exercised over imports during the war may, for the purposes of this memorandum, be conveniently classified under two heads, viz. : (a.) Goods under strict control, i.e., control by State purchase combined with direct and general restrictions on private dealings in the controlled commodity.(6.) Goods under limited control, i.e., control by State purchase and indirect or limited restrictions on private dealings, such as withholding of import licences, requisition, control of prices and of internal dealings.A. GOODS UNDER STRICT CONTROL.It was found necessary, in the case of certain commodities which were vital to the conduct of the war and the supplies of which were inadequate, rigorously to suppress by legislation all dealings by private individuals likely to retard or interfere with the work of the purchasing authorities. The commodities dealt with in this manner are (i.) The various articles which have been classed as war material under Defence of the Realm Regulation 30a, or are controlled under Regulation 3 Ob, or under order of the Minister of Munitions; (ii.) sugar; (hi.) hemp; (iv.) canned milk; (v.) canned salmon ; (vi.) timber; (vii.) raw cotton.In respect of such articles the Censorship has performed a double function. Firstly, it has provided a means of control without which it would have been impossible
effectively to enforce the restrictions on private dealings. Secondly, it has supplied essential information with regard to dealings all over the world, and has thereby assisted the various purchasing bodies both in framing their-policy and in carrying out their work.War material. In the case of war material it may be safely said that Defence of the Realm Regulation 30a would, as regards dealings outside the United Kingdom, have been little more than a dead letter without the Censorship, which has furnished invaluable assistance to the War Office and Ministry of Munitions, and to their various Departments of Control. The operations of touts and option-hunters had, at the time that the regulation was passed, assumed astounding proportions. Persons of both sexes in obscure boarding-houses were opening up negotiations by cable and by letter for the purchase of vital commodities on a fabulous scale. Their activities led to uncertainty and confusion in foreign markets and to a consequent withholding of produce and enhancement of prices, the effect of which on A Hied purchases was absolutely ruinous. The passing of the regulation above referred to, which was in itself partly due to information supplied by the Censorship, brought this state of things to an end as regards essential war materials. It is not, of course, possible to obtain any accurate figures with regard to the actual sum saved by means of restrictions of this kind, but there can be no doubt that as a result of this regulation many million pounds a year have been saved on the price of indispensable war materials purchased for the use of this country and of our Allies, and it must be remembered that its effectiveness has been largely attributable to the fact that the persons against whom it was aimed have been web aware that they could not infringe its provisions without detection by the Censor.The following are three concrete instances in which the Censorship has facilitated the acquisition of vital war supplies controlled under this regulation, and assisted in reducing the price at which such materials were obtainable : (i.) AluminiumJ-The control of cables in the earlier days of the war enabled the large volume of orders pouring into Canada and America from or through neutral countries in Europe to be effectively checked and secured supplies of this important commodity for His Majesty&apos;s Government at a very much lower price than^would otherwise have prevailed. The sum thereby saved has been estimated at half a million sterling. At a later period it was discovered by means of cable and letter intercepts that our AHies, in their endeavours to obtain aluminium in America, were actually competing against each other and this discovery led to the arrangements under which purchases for the Allies were henceforth undertaken by the Aluminium Department of the Ministry of Munitions, (ii.) T.N.T. Closer and more efficient control has enabled the price of the supplies of this commodity bought from the United States to be reduced from a dollar to 50 cents per pound. Since about 17,000,000 lbs. have been bought at the lower price this implies a saving of approximately  1,700,000, a result to which the Censorship has materially contributed, (iii.) Acetone. At the time when war broke out acetone was selling in the market at 35 cents per pound. Shortly after America entered the war the evidence acquired from Censorship intercepts made it possible to bring home to the United States Government the fact that supplies were being diverted to unnecessary industrial uses, and that the speculative interests which tended to keep prices high were being actively fostered by producers. The American Government being satisfied that drastic action was necessary instituted control of the material in the States, fixing the price at 25 cents per pound.The quantity of acetone required by Great Britain and the Allies at that time was from 10,000 to 1.1,000 tons per annum, so that even assuming that the old price would otherwise have been maintained, the saving thus effected amounted approximately to  470,000. It is, however, much more probable that if this action had not been taken the old price would have &quot; been greatly increased owing to the manoeuvres of speculators and to increased demand for the material.The saving of money, however, is by no means the greatest service rendered by the Censorship in connection with the purchase of essential war supplies. In the view of those best able to judge, its greatest service has been in preventing the wastage of these vital materials ; on the one
hand by securing effective enforcement of the control in the United Kingdom, and, on the other hand, by giving the Explosives Supply Department early and detailed information with regard to available sources of supply and with regard to the efforts of firms in Europe and America to negotiate business I detrimental to Allied interests. By this means the Department in question was enabled in many cases to prevent the transactions in question. It may be fairly said that without the Censorship the difficulty of securing materials of this class would have been considerably increased and the efforts of the armies in the field proportionately hampered.Metals controlled under Defence of the Realm Regulation 3 Ob. The Metal Departments of the Ministry of Munitions have on frequent occasions obtained information from Censorship intercepts of the greatest importance in forecasting prices and without the guidance so obtained, particularly from commercial telegrams, they could not have intelligently advised the Government with regard to the purchase of virgin metals abroad, or have efficiently managed their distribution in this country. Iron ore is a particularly striking instance of this. The import of foreign iron ore is roughly 7,000,000 tons per annum, and since it has been brought under the control of the Ministry of Munitions this ore has, disregarding the loss in exchange, been purchased at practically pre-war prices. There can be no doubt that, without the assistance of the Censorship, combinations against the Ministry would have been successfully organized on a scale that would have cost the country an enormous sum of money. Quite apart from the actual saving in money, any serious interference with the supply of such an essential raw material would have been disastrous, and the assistance of the Censorship in frustrating enemy machinations in respect thereof by providing early knowledge of the same, has been of the greatest importance.Sugar.-hx the case of sugar the Censorship has been of special service. Early in 1917 it became apparent from information derived, partly from cables and mails and partly from other sources, that the activities of a number of speculative syndicates in the United Kingdom were seriously interfering with the operations of the Sugar Commission. It was consequently decided to issue the Dealings in Sugar (Restriction) Order. The enforcement of that order, in so far as dealings with persons and firms outside the United Kingdom are concerned, would have been impossible without the Censorship of terminal letters and cables, which provided practically the oniy means of detecting offences.At one time, when purchases were being made in Java on a large scale, the information derived from transit cables and in a lesser degree from transit, letters passing between Holland and the Dutch East Indies was of considerable value to the Commission. Purchase in Java has of late been abandoned, about four-fifths of our supplies being now obtained, through a purchasing commission in New York, under an agreement which gives Europe one-third of the Cuban crop, the remainder being obtained from various western sources, e.g., the British West Indies, Mauritius, Peru and Brazil. The Censorship has, therefore, during the last period of the war been of much less value than formerly as a source of information with regard to the sugar market.Hemp. The purchase of hemp is controlled by the War Office, who also buy for Italy and France. Practically the only source of supplies is the Philippine Islands, but, although this source is outside His Majesty&apos;s dominions, the fact that the hemp trade is in the hands of a small number of firms, all of whom have branches in the United Kingdom, has enabled the control to be effected by means of an agreement with the trade, who, not wishing to run the risk of finding that the Government were buying over their heads in the Philippines, have agreed to act as agents for the War Office for the purchase of the total quantity of hemp required in the United Kingdom, France and Italy. All private dealings in hemp are prohibited (vide Manilla Hemp Order of 18th April, 1917), and dealers act as distributing agents of the War Office which allocates raw hemp to the manufacturer on a rationing basis. The United States Government and the War Office are at present purchasing practically the whole available supply.For the above reasons the assistance of the Censorship in enforcing the restrictions on private dealings in hemp has perhaps been less essential than in the case of other similar restrictions. It has, however, in the past provided information which has made it nossible to prevent the passage of cargoes to suspicious neutral consignees, notably in the case ot a consignment to Sweden, early information with regard to which was
obtained from a cable intercept and the sale of which was consequently stopped by. the action of the American authorities inspired by representations from His Majesty&apos;s Government.Timber control.-The purchase of foreign timber is controlled by the Timber Supplies Department. Purchases by any buyer other than that department are absolutely prohibited except in the case of-box boards, private purchases of which are allowed under permit. The price for sale to consumers is fixed and is based upon the current market price. The Censorship has provided a means of detection without which the orders prohibiting private purchases abroad could not have been effectively enforced.This means of detection has been particularly important in connection with the enforcement of Inter-Allied Agreements, for on the one hand it has enabled the dealings of Allied traders to be supervised and suitable representations to be addressed to the Allies in the case of transactions involving an infringement of those agreements, and on the other hand it has made it possible to prevent dealings by British firms with persons in Allied countries which, if they had been carried out might have led to considerable misunderstanding and friction. For instance, attempts on the part of British firms to buy ply-wood in America in contravention of the agreement to buy such wood through the British War Mission have been detected and prevented by means of the Censorship.Raiv cotton. The Raw Cotton Order of 28th June, 1917, prohibits the purchase of raw cotton except under licence, and speculative operations have been controlled through the Board of Trade and the Liverpool Cotton Association.On the 21st August, 1917, a regulation was passed by the Liverpool Cotton Association, with the approval of the Board of Trade, for the purpose of restricting dealings in American futures. The effect of this regulation was to prevent the acceptance of orders for selling or buying futures on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange except from persons resident in Allied territory. Any member of the Exchange known to be contravening this regulation would be turned out or heavily fined. The trade have, during the war, co-operated loyally in this matter, but it must be borne in mind that every trader knows that his letters and cables are examined, and that the Censorship has provided the only means of detecting offences.B. GOODS UNDER LIMITED CONTROL.A number of commodities are controlled by State purchase without direct penal restrictions on private dealings with foreign countries, e.g., cereals, meat, wool, jute, hides and leather, oil seeds, mica, paper. Private trade, though not absolutely prohibited, has been in practice effectively limited by internal requisition and by the withholding of import licences in all cases except where the goods were being bought for the Government purchasing authority, or did not exceed the fixed percentage left available for private importation.Cereals. The purchase and import of cereals, including beans, peas and pulse, are carried out by the Inter-Allied Wheat Executive, which was created for the purpose by an International Agreement between England, France and Italy, its immediate object being to eliminate the evils of competitive purchase by the different Allies. Its functions include the apportionment between the Allies of the quantity of cereals essential to each. As regards the United Kingdom, the wheat bought by the Executive is sold to the merchant, who in turn sells it to the miller at a fixed price. The profit of the middleman and the price to the consumer are thus strictly controlled.Without the Censorship it would have been practically impossible for this work to be effectively carried out, for the Executive has had to operate largely in free markets such as the Argentine, and without the control of terminal and transit cables there would have been no means of checking speculative operations by British, AJlied or neutral traders, the elimination of which has been essential to effective control. For instance, in the case of wheat, the stoppage of transit cables between Sweden and South America has been an effective means of securing due observance by private traders of the agreement entered into by Sweden to purchase its supplies through the Inter-Allied Wheat Executive only, and the examination of such cables is, it is understood, approved by the Swedish authorities.Meat.  The purchase of meat is controlled by the Meat Purchase Committee of the Ministry of Food, who, in co-operation with the Inter-Allied Purchasing Committee,
are the sole purchasing body in the United Kingdom. They purchase direct from the Governments and companies in the producing areas. Prices in the United Kingdom are controlled by the Ministry of Food.Both the Cable and Postal Censorships have in this case very greatly assisted the Controlling Authorities by enabling them to detect, and by direct or indirect pressure to frustrate attempted transactions that contravened the arrangements for Inter-Allied purchase through a single channel. From this source they have been able to obtain accurate and early information with regard to competitive operations on the part of nations not concerned in the Inter-Allied pool and to take measures accordingly. The information from both Cable and Postal intercepts has enabled them to bring pressure to bear in such cases on the buyer or the seller, for, if either is the subject of a State which is a party to the Inter-Allied purchasing agreement, he can be reported to the Government concerned as breaking the agreement, while, if on the other hand, either is the subject of a State -outside the inter-Allied pool, the purchasing authority is able to point out to the country in question that it is purchasing from other sources, and at the same time expecting its ration from the Allies. The examination of cables and letters has also given the purchasing authority a general insight into the attitude of agents in this country.A letter was recently intercepted from a firm of packers in the Argentine to their agent in London, giving a full description of an opponents operations, which had resulted in an abnormal rise in prices. This letter gave the Meat Section inside knowledge that prices were momentarily inflated through an avoidable cause, and enabled indirect pressure to be brought to bear on the delinquent company by withholding orders from them until prices had resumed their normal level.Wool. The purchase of wool is controlled by the War Office, and the Australasian wool clip has been purchased for a clear wool season after the war direct from the Australian and New Zealand Governments, which have established monopcly-purchase by the State at a fixed price. About 50 per cent, of the last South African clip was also purchased by His Majesty&apos;s Government. Stocks in the United Kingdom are controlled by requisition. The assistance of both the Cable and the Postal Censorships has been and still is of great importance in supplying the authorities with an accurate survey of the problems which they have to face and of the operations of competitors. For instance, in connection with the pending negotiations with the United States Government relative to the extension of the latter&apos;s control over supplies from South America, the information from letters and from cables has been of the greatest service in enabling the authorities to obtain a true measure of the competition that has to be met in the Argentine and Uruguayan markets.The Censorship has also supplied important information with regard to storage in the United Kingdom and schemes for evading requisition. The practical difficulties of requisitioning stocks in this country which are the property of neutrals makes it particularly important that the Government should have accurate and up-to-date information with regard to the increase of stocks held here on neutral account.Information has also been obtained from the Censorship with regard to prospective purchases by Allied firms in free markets where the British authorities are trying indirectly to control prices in the interests of the Allies by eliminating competition as far as possible. Cable intercepts have in such cases enabled timely representations to be made to the Allied authorities concerned.Jute. British India is the sole source of supply, and the trade which is carried on entirely through London is controlled by the War Office by means of a system under which no jute, can be exported from British India without a licence from the Indian Government or imported into the United Kingdom without a licence from the British Government. In this case, where the supply is controlled at the source, the Censorshijj has served rather as a means of supervision than as a means of control. It has kept the purchasing authority informed of purchases by neutral speculators for storage in India and has to that extent assisted them in judging the necessity or otherwise of requisition by the Indian Government.Hides and Leader.-The importation of hides from India and East Africa is com-pletely controlled by the War Office, private trade as regards the produce of those localities being eliminated by the withholding of import licences. Purchase from the Argentine is effected through the Tanners&apos; Federation and the fact that a great part
of the raw material in that country is in the hands of British companies has enabled the price to be controlled by His Majestys Government in co-operation with the Federation and the companies concerned. The United Kingdom&apos;s imports from these three sources amounts to 75 per cent, of her requirements and the remaining 25 per cent, has been left free of control except to the extent that import licences are required; that is to say, a certain amount of normal trade continues and small quantities of hides from a variety of sources are imported by British traders under licence.Up to February, 1917, the trade in imported leather was, apart from tonnage difficulties, allowed free play, but since that date importation has been prohibited, and since August, 1917, purchase has been confined to His Majesty&apos;s Government i.e., the War Office except as regards a relatively small quantity imported from France. Apart from the control of initial purchase the pre-war channels of internal trade have been left undisturbed, except that prices have been fixed in other words, the merchant buys on behalf of the manufacturer from the State at a fixed profit.In the early days of the control over both hides and leather the Censorship was of vital importance to it. On the one hand terminal cable and letter intercepts gave the authorities early information of attempts by persons in this country to buy for storage abroad or for neutral account, and indicated the quarters where pressure from the authorities was needed ; on the other hand, the stoppage in certain cases of transit cables enabled objectionable neutral operations to be checked. The control has now by means of co-operation with the trade interests concerned, coupled with licensing and tonnage restrictions, become so complete that the Censorship, though of very great utility, can no longer be described as an essential factor.Oil seeds. All vegetable oils and oil seeds are purchased by the Ministry of Food in the country of origin or requisitioned on arriving in the United Kingdom and by these means private purchase is indirectly eliminated. In the case of a commodity of this kind, however, where there are numerous sources of supply and where the purchasing-authority has no means of protecting itself against the activities of speculators, the Censorship has-been an essential adjunct to the system of import and export restrictions. The stoppage of transit cables has, for instance, in many cases been successfully used as a means of frustrating thp. attempts not only of British but of neutral speculators to buy oil seeds and hold them abroad.An illustration of this is the case of cables between Sweden and South America. In order to buy cheaply and to avoid internal competition, the Swedish Government has prohibited the importation by private persons of oil seeds, and similarly of wheat and cattle food, in the case of which commodities an import monopoly has been acquired by the State and is exercised by an Association of Importers under Government control. Sweden has undertaken to make all its purchases from or through the Inter-Allied Executive and has appointed a representative for the purpose in this country. All transit cables to and from Sweden, contravening this arrangement, have been stopped with the acquiescence and approval of the Swedish authorities.Mica. The purchase of mica which is controlled by the Ministry of Munitions under the Mica Control Order of the 15th April, 1918, furnishes a further instance in which the information supplied from cable and letter intercepts has been of great value to the Department controlling purchase. It has enabled that Department to judge the requirements in the various countries and has given them knowledge of the activities of the firms engaged in the electrical industry.It.has also enabled a careful eye to be kept on the prices paid for the material which, although not directly controlled, have been to a great extent determined by the prices charged by the Government for mica sold by. them. It has further provided information which has made it possible to estimate the production in parts of the world other than British possessions and German East Africa, and has thereby greatly assisted in the framing of a scheme for the guidance of the industry such as will ensure that the future supremacy of Great Britain is maintained in the electrical industries of the world.Paper. Few measures of control can be framed or carried out without expert advice obtained from consultation with the trades concerned, and it is inevitable that the fact that restrictions and embargoes are contemplated should leak out before they have been actually imposed. Premature communications with regard to such matters have, of course, a very serious effect on the prices at which the commodities are obtainable by the Allied purchasing-authorities in foreign markets.   Paper furnishes
a striking illustration of this, and the value of the Censorship, particularly the Cable Censorship, in connection with the supply of raw materials for the manufacture of paper and board, has been brought prominently into notice on three occasions, viz. : (a.) When it became necessary for the Government to place an embargo on the importation of Swedish pulp, the assistance of the Censorship made it possible to make large purchases of wood pulp in Norway in antici-pation of the enormous enhancement of prices which immediately followed the news of the embargo.(6.) When it was found imperative for the Ministry of Shipping to stop shipments of wood pulp and paper from North America, the Censorship was able to prevent the leakage of this information to Scandinavia until His Majestys Government had been able to make the purchases necessary to meet their requirements for several months, an important service in view of the fact that immediately information on the subject was allowed to go through, prices went up at a bound.(c.) When it was decided to introduce the Central (Inter-Allied) Purchase of wood pulp, the control exercised by the Censorship over cables enabled the Department of the Controller of Paper to cover itself by forward purchases before the scheme was made known in Scandinavia and helped this country and its allies in many ways to protect themselves against the operations of speculative buyers in Norway and Sweden.It has been calculated that, as regards the paper and pulp supplies of this country alone, the Censorship has during the last two years saved the Government on a conservative estimate considerably more than  100,000 on the price of raw materials purchased.Control of Tonnage.At one time the Censorship was essential to the control of tonnage, and both cable and letter intercepts have been of considerable use to the Interallied Chartering Executive in connection with the administration of Defence of Realm Regulation 39d, in respect of the chartering of ships. About 1,200 cables a day were formerly supplied to the Ministry of Shipping, containing references to the fixing and move-ment of merchant tonnage. The Ministry have now, however, remedied the defects in their system of obtaining information from local sources, and the Censorship, though useful, is understood to be no longer essential to the conduct of their work.Coal Control.The Controller of Coal Mines has depended to a considerable extent upon the existence of the Censorship for the effective enforcement of restrictions upon prices. Correspondence has from time to time been intercepted indicating evasions of the regulations as to a minimum price for sales to neutrals, e.g., offers of illicit rebates. An incentive to such evasions exists in those cases in which profits are below the guaranteed standard under the Coal Mines Agreement, as it is in such circumstances of more advantage to the mines to keep up their sales than to keep up their prices.Financial Control. (1) Investment abroad. The restrictions on the remittance of money abroad for the purposes of capital expenditure or for investment contained in Defence of the Realm Regulation 41 d could not have been made even moderately watertight without the Postal Censorship. The co-operation of the banks alone would have been obviously insufficient, since a would-be law-breaker, desiring to invest  100 in a foreign country and finding himself unable to purchase a draft without having to give awkward explanations, would merely have placed bank notes for the amount in a registered letter and thus transmitted the necessary funds abroad. If he were willing to risk eventual detection, he could equally well have sent a cheque, and although, when the cheque was presented for payment, the bank might have drawn the attention of the authorities to the matter, it would have been bound to cash the&apos; instrument. It has been found impracticable to modify the banker&apos;s liability in this respect owing to the adverse effect which such a course would have on British credit. The only effective means of stopping transactions of this kind at the outset is the intercepting of such cheques on their outward journey by the Censor. . Several cases have been discovered through the Censorship, in which transfers have been inadvertently passed by banks without a declaration or with a declaration that was false or wholly insufficient.(2)^ Control of securities. The Postal Censorship has been an essential factor in preventing the transmission of securities abroad for sale and in securing due observance
of the Defence of the Realm (Securities) Regulations. It has also been of considerable assistance in supervising the importation of securities from abroad with a view to eliminating the possibility of enemy origin or enemy benefit, and it has been the chief means of enforcing the Prohibition of Import (No. 21) Proclamation of 1917 issued in connection with Defence of the Realm Regulation 4 Id.(3) Financial Blockade. The control exercised by the Finance Section of the Ministry of Blockade over the financial transactions of British banks could not have been effectively carried out without the assistance afforded by the Censorship. The examination of terminal cables and mails has made it possible to exercise a continuous and vigilant supervision over the control carried out by the banks themselves and to institute special inquiries in all cases where the nature of the goods financed, or the identity of the persons for whom transfers were ordered was open to doubt. The restrictions upon the transmission of funds to Russia and to Finland, contained in Defence of the Realm Regulations 41b and 41dd, have also depended to a considerable extent upon the Censorship of terminal, mails and cables for their effective enforcement. The examination of transit letters and cables has not infrequently shown that the parties ostensibly involved were not those really interested, and in such cases British banks have been warned against financing the transactions in question.Restrictions on the transfer of properties and undertakings to Aliens. Under Defence of the Realm Regulation 30bb it is illegal to transfer to an alien or foreign-controlled company certain classes of mining property, oil-fields of any kind, or under-takings situated in certain countries and concerned with the manufacture or supply of articles on the contraband list. It is also illegal to transfer to any alien or foreign-controlled company any share in a company owning or controlling such mines, oilfields or undertakings. The examination of the mads has provided the means of detecting offences and has enabled many attempted contraventions of this Regulation to be nipped in the bud. &apos;General.One of the most important aspects of the work of the Censorship has only been referred to briefly in the foregoing pages since it has already been the subject of numerous memoranda and reports, namely, the disclosure of the true destination and origin of cargoes and the supply of evidence to the Prize Court. His Majesty&apos;s Procurator-General has stated that in practically every contraband case in which there is any prospect of success in the Prize Court, the information upon which the Crown rely is derived from letters intercepted in the post. The significance of this will be appreciated when it is remembered that, the estimated value of cargoes seized as prize exclusive of ships is over  30,000,000 sterling, and that the goods actually condemned and sold up to date have realized approximately  5,000,000.For the same reason nothing has been said about the work of the Censorship in preventing the passage of remittances and instruments of value between neutral countries for enemy benefit. Neither has anything been said of its work in preventing the realization in neutral countries of enemy-owned securities, and in frustrating the many ingenious devices of the enemy for keeping alive his foreign trade and for corresponding through neutral intermediaries with his agents and branches abroad. In these directions the work of the Censorship has been of vital service to the blockade, and has contributed in no small degree to the throttling of enemy trade all over the world.Note.-The total value represented by the instruments and documents facilitating the transfer of funds for enemy account which have been detained by the Postal Censor amounts to approximately  79,000,000, It is not, of course, possible to know in respect of what proportion of this amount the transfer was effectively prevented for the duration of the war by the detention of the documents, but in view of the completeness of control both over cables and over sea-borne mails, there can be no doubt that the proportion was a sub-stantial one. It must moreover be borne in mind that even though the detention of such documents may not always have involved direct loss to the enemy, the indirect effect in dislocating and paralysing his financial and commercial operations must have been very great.
PART II.THE  CENSORSHIP AS A MEANS  OF  CONTROLLING TRADE  IN TIME OF  PEACE.How far the Censorship would be an essential adjunct, to the machinery of control in peace-time depends of course entirely upon the scope and nature of that control. To form any correct estimate of the extent to which the existing restrictions upon trade will outlast the period of the war is at the present juncture very difficult. There are four outstanding factors which it is necessary to bear in mind when considering this gigantic subject : (1.) Shortage of actual supplies.(2.) Tonnage.(3.) Exchange.(4.) The possibility of a continued boycott against the Central Powers.Each one of these factors is closely interconnected with all the rest, and, while on the one hand it is futile to consider one apart from the other, it is almost impossible to obtain at the present time a comprehensive survey of the innumerable connecting-links by which the whole are subtly interwoven together. The most that can be attempted is to consider certain hypothetical policies and to indicate in the most general manner the kind of machinery that each would involve.In the event of a general pooling of raw materials with the consent of all the nations of the world controlling the sources of supply, it is clear that no censorship would be necessary, since there would be one world price, and no free market anywhere and the speculator whose activities are the chief cause which renders the Censorship necessary for the control of trade would be finally eliminated. Much as the workfs outlook has been changed in the last few years, it seems unlikely that this sweeping solution will be arrived at during the present generation.The question is whether any half-way house is attainable in the unprecedented conditions that have arisen out of the war, and it is a question which for the purposes of this memorandum it is necessary to consider since, in the event of an agreement between a group of States for permanently controlling the exportable surplus of their raw materials, it is doubtful whether the fulfilment of such an agreement could be effectively supervised without at least a continued examination of cables.The chief obstacle to all schemes of this kind, and one which is apt to be overlooked, is that raw materials do not at present belong to States but to private individuals, and that the desire to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market is one that cannot be easily eradicated from the human breast. As long as free markets exist in any part of the world all barriers which shut off the producer from them are, bound to be causes of internal and international friction, and of a general desire on the pan of the trading public in the countries concerned to evade them by every possible means.It is not within the scope of this memorandum to gauge the weight of this and the many other difficulties in the way of an international pooling of raw materials, but it seems on the whole improbable that any control that is maintained beyond the declaration of peace will be more than a temporary control over a few essential commodities kept in existence hy the force of necessit)7&apos;, and the following observations wnth regard to the need of a continued Censorship are based on this assumption.Such control would presumably be confined to raw materials of which there was an actual or anticipated shortage, fur it is understood that, if peace negotiations last for six months, no lack of tonnage is likely to exist when peace is declared. It would also presumably be confined to commodities in the case of which either Great Britain alone, or Great Britain and the nations associated with her, control the main source or
162-sources of supply for restrictions on private trade in a commodity when any of the sources of supply were beyond control would, as regards the produce of the uncontrolled markets, involve the exclusion of the British trader from world competition, since neutrals would purchase direct instead of purchasing through London. This is a very serious consideration, for it is obviously of paramount importance that British trade should not be placed at any disadvantage in the period of intense competition that will follow the war. Even in the case of articles of which Great Britain owns the principal or only source of supply the difficulties in the way of such a temporary control will be very great, but it is possible that the necessity for controlling them will be so urgent as to ensure for a time the acquiescence of the trade interests concerned.  .It may therefore be advisable, in order to form a clear opinion as to the necessity of a continued Censorship, to consider the position as regards a few of those commodities which are the most susceptible of control and in the case of which some sort of control J is likely to be found essential.The following statements are based upon informal expressions of opinion elicited from various well-informed quarters, and the conclusions arrived at in respect of each article are believed to represent in a general way the opinion of the authorities princi-pally concerned.Cereals. The question of the control of cereals during the period following the cessation of hostilities is one of extreme importance. While, on the one hand, there is no reason to anticipate any actual shortage of supplies, the hunger of Central Europe will create a demand of such an abnormal character that, if speculation were allowed to run wild during the transition period, prices would soar beyond bounds and the gravest consequences might ensue. If it is remembered that the growth of Bolshevism in all countries is likely to bear a close relation to the shortage of bread, the importance of preventing such a catastrophe is obvious. Under present conditions the Allies between them may, as regards wheat at any rate, be said to control all the main sources of supply. The Indian output is controlled; the Australian crops have been largely purchased by the Executive. An agreement has been entered into with the Argentine Government, fixing minimum and maximum prices for wheat in that market j and securing the last crop to the Allies at a price between the fixed limits, and negotiations are in progress for a similar arrangement with regard to the 1918 1919 j crop. The position as regards B/ussia and Roiimania is, of course, a matter of complete J uncertainty.The&apos; British grain trade has practically become a distributing-agencjr for the I Government. The control of prices in the United Kingdom, the United States and I many other countries, coupled with the huge Government holdings at present existing I both at home and abroad, makes it unlikely that the trade will resume its normal j activities in foreign markets for a considerable time.All these considerations point to the likelihood that, in order to keep down the \ prices of essential foodstuffs, the control of cereals will be continued for a substantial \ period after the conclusion of peace.   If this assumption is correct, and if control is to \ be continued on the present lines, there can be no doubt that the abolition of the Censor- \ ship would be a very serious matter to the Purchasing Executive, for not only would it jj be deprived of a great deal of useful knowledge, but without the examination of j terminal cables members of the grain trade could not be prevented from entering into ji speculative operations, which might seriously interfere with the Governments measures I of control.   It is probable that for these reasons the Executive would press for a continued examination of terminal cables for a certain period after the final declaration of peace, i.e., as long as the control lasts.   It is also, in the opinion of those concerned, imperative that the censoring of transit cables should be continued, at any rate, until peace is concluded.Oil Seeds. Oil seeds are an important foodstuff, being an essential ingredient in many articles of food necessary both for human and for animal consumption. As regards post-war control they stand on much the same footing as cereals. The contemplated purchase of the Dutch East Indian crop and the co-operation of Holland on the Purchasing Executive will secure for the Executive control of the main sources of supply for some time to come, and it is not improbable that control over trade in this commodity will last for a substantial period beyond the final declaration of peace. During the transition period that has now begun, i.e., for the next six months at least, the Censorship will be of even greater importance in connection with this control than it has been m the past, on account of the increased tendency to speculate in anticipation of free markets.   But, assuming that conditions have become more stable by the time
that peace is declared, a demand for its- continuance beyond that event would not appear to be justified;Meat. As regards post-war control, much the same considerations apply to meat as to other essential foodstuffs. During the transition period the Censorship will be even more important than it has been in the past, since, as soon as tonnage facilities increase and neutrals resume their normal trading and speculative activities which are at present impeded by tonnage difficulties, it will be more than ever essential that the purchasing-authority should have a clear insight into market conditions and the activities of its competitors.There is a further factor which wdl make the Censorship of special importance during the next few months, namely, that, as regards frozen meat, the contracts with foreign packers which are the means by which foreign sources of supply are controlled come to an end at the expiration of three months after the final signing of peace. The extension of these contracts is under negotiation, and, while the negotiations are proceeding, it is essential that the Inter-Allied purchasing authority should be apprised of any transactions contemplated by foreign packers with other buyers.It does not appear that, as regards frozen meat at any rate, a continuance of the Censorship for this purpose will be necessary beyond the final declaration of peace, by which time long-term contracts with the packers will it is hoped have been- concluded, and control more or less secured. In the case of tinned meats, however, where the contracts run from month to month and control must necessarily be less complete, there can be no doubt that the loss of the Censorship as a source of information will be a serious matter.Wool. The extent to which wool is likely to be controlled after the war is mainly a question of tonnage, for there seems little reason to anticipate any actual shortage of supplies. The quantity available to the United Kingdom depends largely on the amount of tonnage that can be obtained for the purpose of bringing over the large stocks accumulated for Government account in Australia and New Zealand.It may be necessary to continue for a time to ration neutral and Allied consumption by agreement or otherwise. The difficulties in the way of such a course would probably not be so great as in other cases, for in the not improbable event that the United States enter into an agreement to purchase the whole of the Argentine and Uruguayan wool clip for 1919, Great Britain and the United States together will control for the time being nearly all the important sources of supply. There would in such circumstances be very little margin left for private dealings in South America, which is tlie only important market besides Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In view of this fact, and in view also of the fact that the British trader is already shut out from the Australasian market for some time to come by the purchase of the Australasian clips, the injury to British trade would not be so serious a consideration as it would be if there were a larger free market, while neutrals would be compelled by force of circumstances to agree to the rationing principle. But, unless South Africa agrees to the purchase of her whole clip by His Majesty:s Government, which seems improbable, there will still be a free market in South Africa, and in these circumstances the examination of transit cables would be of particular importance, for by that means alone would it be possible for the authorities to form an accurate estimate of the operations of Japanese and other Allied and neutral traders in the South African and other less important free markets, and to obtain early information with regard to any concerted action for buying wool in those markets for storage on neutral or Allied account, and thus upsetting the rationing arrangements of the Allied Governments. The necessity for examining such cables would be even greater than it is at present, in view of the fact that the existence of free markets is now counteracted by tonnage restrictions which make those markets inaccessible.The examination of terminal cables would be of much less importance, since British firms would hardly import from free markets with a risk of having their imported wool requisitioned in this country at a price lower than that which they had paid for it. The examination of such cables would, however, be of considerable use in giving know-ledge of any purchases made by British firms in free markets for neutral consumption, and possibly the trade would object to Censorship less strongly if they knew that it was also being used as a means of supervising the operations of their neutral competitors.Jute. As   already stated,  this commodity  comes from  a  single  controlled source, namely, British India.   In France and Italy, the mills have largely come to \ a standstill during the war.    Imports have in consequence very greatly decreased,.
and on the return of peace conditions the demand in those countries will be enormous. Germany and Austria, who before the war imported 1,200,000 bales per annum, are now bereft of stocks. Add to these facts the possibility of a short crop in 1919, :9nd it becomes obvious that a tempo; ary rationing of the Indian export will be inevitable. Such a course would, it is understood, be much less difficult in the case of jute than in the case of many-other commodities, since the export of jute from&apos; India is a means of feeding foreign factories which subsequently compete with the Indian trade in manu-factured goods, and is not therefore regarded as an unmixed blessing by the Indian public.Assuming that a system is adopted under which a definite proportion is allotted to Allies and neutrals and the Central Powers are allowed the surplus, the problem will arise of how to prevent operations by or for the benefit of the Central Powers, e.g., attempts to purchase and store jute in India, induced either by the hope that restrictions, may be relaxed or by the fear that a short crop may lessen the possibility of securing the rationed quantity. It would perhaps be going too far to say that this cannot be done without the Censorship, for requisition might be resorted to, but there can be no doubt that the services of the Censorship would under such conditions be of even greater importance than they have been during the period of the war, and that if deprived of the information obtained from cable intercepts, the Authorities would be without any precise knowledge of the extent of those operations against which it would be imperative for them to guard.If it were decided that effective control without censorship was impracticable, it is probable that an examination of terminal cables would sufficiently meet the case, since London is the centre for distribution,Hides and leather. Hides and leather furnish an example of that class of commodity which, owing to the many free sources of supply, is least susceptible of lasting control. Hides were in 1916 imported from as many as 55 different sources, and leather, which, though the raw material of the boot-making industry, is itself a manufactured article, is exported by many of the countries possessing a tanning industry. On the other hand, there is a very serious shortage of stocks of certain qualities of leather, and continuance of control will be vitally necessary until such time as stocks have been replenished in order to prevent prices from becoming excessive. Negotiations were in progress before the armistice (and are still continuing) for controlling the price of hides in neutral markets by agreement between the Allies as to the price each should pay, and the existing tonnage restrictions have induced certain neutrals to intimate their desire to co-operate in this matter, though it is doubtful if this desire will continue after the withdrawal of the blockade. It is thought that the transition period, during which such control would be necessary, would not last for long beyond the conclusion of peace, assuming that peace negotiations last for six months from the present time, and that after that it will be gradually relaxed. In these circumstances it may be safely said that, although the maintenance of the Censor-ship during the armistice would be of great importance of even greater importance, in fact, than has been the case during the time that shortage of tonnage has blocked the ordinary channels of trade and discouraged speculation its continuance beyond the final declaration of peace is not, as regards the control of leather and hides, likely to be considered a vital necessity.Goal. It is thought that control over coal mines will not improbably last for another eighteen months at least, but, although the Censorship is exceedingly useful as a means of detecting evasions of the restrictions with regard to price, it cannot be said to. be so essential to the exercise of control as to justify a demand for its continuance beyond the transition period.Timber. The control over timber will certainly last during the transition period, i.e., for at least six months, and during that time the assistance of the Censorship will be even more important than it has been in the past, for without it there would be no means of preventing attempts to buy and hold in neutral markets, which might seriously put up prices abroad. This is particularly important, for, while in the past it has not been thought advisable to sell to the manufacturer below the current market price upon which existing contracts have been based and thereby to put money into the pockets of the manufacturer without benefiting the ultimate consumer, the price, as at present fixed, is an abnormal one, and, in view of the great importance of this material to industry, it is not improbable that measures may shortly be taken to reduce it. Any action by private individuals in this country which tends to put up prices abroad would seriously impede such measures.   It
is possible that the control may be continued for a further period of six months or even longer after peace is declared, but although the discontinuance of the Censorship would make the control less effective than it is at present, the necessity for an absolutely watertight control would not, it is thought, be sufficiently great after that time to justify the retention of the Censorship.Raw cotton&apos; There can be little doubt that the control over speculative dealings in cotton will be continued during the transition period preceding the final conclusion of peace, for it will be necessary in order to prevent attempts by persons in Central Europe to manipulate the future market through neutrals. As already stated, the Censorship provides the only means of detection, and the continued examination of cables at any rate will therefore be essential.It seems improbable, however, that the restrictions on dealings in futures will outlast the declaration of peace. After that period any control exercised is likely to be confined to the continued prohibition of the export of raw cotton except under licence. For enforcing such a prohibition no Censorship is necessary ; control over the movement of the actual goods would be sufficient.Much the same may be said with regard to hemp, sugar and other articles of which Great Britain does not control the sources of supply. In such cases penal restrictions on private dealings are unlikely to last beyond the final conclusion of peace and, if- by that time the tonnage position has adjusted itself, there seems to be no reason to anticipate prolonged control.Rationing.Having considered the functions of the Censorship in assisting controlled purchase, it is necessary to examine its use in assisting distribution and its importance in relation to various possible methods of controlling the allocation of essential foodstuffs and raw materials, for the question whether it is or is not an absolutely essential instrument of control must necessarily depend to a great extent upon the type of rationing policy adopted.One conceivable course would be the rationing of exports from Allied sources only, carried out by a system of export prohibitions, a scheme confined to the allocation of exports as between the countries to which they are directly consigned, and not taking into consideration the ultimate destination of the goods. Under such a scheme Holland, for instance, would be told in effect that she could have so much and no more, and that if she wished to send it on to Germany she might do so, but that, if she wished to guard against such a leakage of her limited supplies, she must legislate accordingly. In a scheme of this kind the Censorship would not be an essential instrument for rationing purposes, since control over the actual goods would suffice.Another possible policy would be the rationing of neutrals for a certain period by agreement as regards their imports both from Allied and neutral sources; brother words, a prolongation of the arrangements under which the Allies and certain neutral countries have combined to purchase essential foodstuffs through a single channel, and under which the Neutral Associations, established for the purpose, are the only legitimate consignees to whom goods may be shipped or for whom shipments may be financed. In this case the Censorship would provide a valuable check, and would be of great assistance in securing the due observance of agreements, but it is doubtful whether it could be regarded as an absolutely essential instrument of control.The only policy which would clearly and undeniably involve the continued existence of the Censorship as a rationing instrument would be a policy involving differentiation between consignees, i.e., a boycott in any form against Central Europe.If any attempt were made to prevent, by force majeure, the passage of neutral (e.g., South American) produce through neutral European countries to Central Europe the same methods of evasion would have to be guarded against as those which have so often been attempted during the existence of the present blockade and the control for enforcing the restrictions would be greatly weakened, if not completely destroyed by the abolition of the Censorship. Without the examination of both transit and terminal cables and mails differentiation between neutral consignees could only be carried out on the basis of existing Black Lists and of existing reports These would quickly become effete, and it would be impossible for any intelligence service abroad, however well organized, to keep track of the ever-increasing crowd of new cloaks and covers which would quickly take the place of those whose activities have been detected during-the war.
-   164It must be remembered that after the war Central Europe will be a vacuum exercising a very powerful attraction over the movement of merchandize. Although, no doubt, a large number possibly a large majority of firms in the United Kingdom will be unwilling to do business with the Central Powers, trade as a whole will tend to resume its cosmopolitan and utilitarian attitude. There can be little doubt that a considerable number of firms in this country will want to get the best possible price for their goods, and the best possible price will be obtainable from Germany. It will be difficult in any circumstances to prevent this movement of merchandize towards Central Europe, for the energies of neutral merchants will be extensively devoted to its furtherance, and, if negotiations in respect of such trade can be carried on with ease and with impunity by means of letters and cables the machinery for preventing it will be immeasurably weakened. For example, one of the safest standards in such circum-stances for judging the ultimate destination of goods is the price offered by the neutral intermediary, but if the buyer&apos;s correspondence passed through unexamined. this would not be known.Without control of transit cables and mails it would be impossible to prevent supplies reaching Germany indirectly from neutral sources, e.g., South America, for there would be no means of determining with any certainty whether goods ostensibly consigned to A were not in reality for B, who would send them to Germany, whereas, while the Censorship exists, though leakage may take place, a regular course of trade through neutral cloaks or covers is certain in the long run to be detected.Financial Control.Assuming that the financial blockade is to continue until the final conclusion of peace, the cable and postal Censorships will be more than ever essential to its effective exercise, for, although the hanks have loyally co-operated in this matter during the war, it could not safely be assumed that, now that the war is over, they would all maintain the same vigilance and avoid illegitimate transactions with the. same scrupulousness if they knew that their business was no longer under the eye of the Censor. Without the Censorship there would be, for instance, no effective means of ensuring that the Treasury&apos;s request to the banks not to open &quot; finance credits &quot; is duly observed, and of preventing the financing over London of goods purchased for unknown uses. Again, if the restrictions on the financing of purchases for post-war delivery are to be maintained during the transition period, the continuance of the Censorship would be essential for ensuring that such restrictions were duly observed by those concerned.The maintenance of this financial control beyond the declaration of peace is doubtful, for the advantage of bringing as much business as possible to London, and of avoiding any unnecessary restrictions upon banking enterprise, is obvious. Moreover, if the actual movement of goods is controlled by rationing agreements or otherwise, e.g., if they can only be consigned to the established neutral associations whose duty it is to see that they are used for neutral requirements, it will matter a good deal less what transactions are financed by London bankers.The possible necessity for a continuance of the Censorship as a means of enforcing Defence of the Realm Regulation 41d, and of preventing the passage of money abroad is a matter which will require serious consideration. It is thought that the immediate withdrawal of the regulation might have undesirable financial effects, e.g., upon the exchanges, but there will in all probability be a very strong public agitation against it. It seems probable that the regulation will be maintained for at least a year after the cessation of hostilities but that during that period it will be gradually relaxed, licences being more and more freely granted. Although the Censorship is essential to a strict enforcement, the mere existence of the regulation might in such circumstances be thought sufficient, since law-abiding subjects would regard themselves as bound by.it. It would: however, if the Censorship were withdrawn, be open to the same objection as all unenforceable regulations, namely, that they penalise law-abiding persons while leaving unaffected or in some cases actually benefiting the less scrupulous section of the community.A further and still more difficult problem arises in connection with the proposed system of Allied and enemy clearing-houses for the settlement of pre-war debts as between enemies and Allies. In order to bring this system into being it will be necessary, firstly, to secure enemy consent to it at the Peace Table, and, secondly, to pass, both in allied and enemy countries, such laws as may be requisite in order to make the clearing-hous^e the only channel for recovering debts of the kind in question and in order to make its receipt a bar to actions.(6574) v
In the meantime, although the payment of debts would remain prohibited by the Trading with the Enemy Act until the necessary Order in Council was made releasing them (see Section 7 of Trading with the Enemy Amendment Act. of 1916), debtors would, in the absence of Censorship control be able to pay and compromise debts freely, as their individual interests dictated, and the main objects of the clearing-house system, viz., to provide for the adjustment of claims as between the various countries, would be largely frustrated. For this reason it is clear that for the present the Trading with the Enemy Laws must be strictly enforced and that the Censorship will be essential for the purpose. If any substantial period intervenes between the declaration of peace and the passing of the laws that wiU enable existing restrictions to be removed, the lack of any means of controlling private transactions of the kind above referred to will give rise to a problem of considerable difficulty.It is not improbable that the restrictions contained in Defence of the Realm Regulation 30bb on transfers of property and undertakings to aliens may be continued in some form after the declaration of peace. Such restrictions would be greatly weakened by the abolition of the Censorship, but, in view of the fact that the transfers would in many cases eventually have to come forward for registration, its preservation as a means of detecting offences would perhaps not be regarded as essential.Conclusions.This memorandum does not pretend to be in any way exhaustive or to deal with more than a few of the subjects upon which the Censorship has furnished important and, in many cases, vital information. The facts contained in it point, it is thought, irresistibly to the three following conclusions : (1.) That any relaxation of Censorship control either cable or postal during the transition period preceding the final declaration of peace would be most dangerous, since apart from its utility in other respects to the various purchasing authorities there would without it be no means of preventing the Central Powers from rushing into every free market, thereby putting up prices against the Allies, and greatly increasing the difficulty of arriving at a proper distribution of essential foodstuffs, neither would there be any effective means of detecting movements of securities and funds from enemy countries vid neutral countries in Europe to neutral countries overseas, which, for obvious reasons, it is particularly desirable to prevent at the present time.(2.) That the necessity for the maintenance of the Censorship after the conclusion of peace depends largely upon the duration of peace negotiations, i.e., upon whether they are prolonged until the conditions as regards shipping and the distribution of raw materials are so far improved as to make stringent control less essential.(3.) That, if the control of essential raw materials and foodstuffs is to be continued in any form after the conclusion of peace, the Censorship cannot safely be abolished without consulting aU the departments of control and the purchasing authorities immediately concerned, and that before the form which such control is to take is finally determined each of those bodies should be asked how far control on the proposed lines can be effective without censorship.The facts also point, though less clearly perhaps, to a fourth conclusion, viz., that provided no attempt is made to maintain an actual boycott against the Central Powers and provided absolute restrictions on private dealings in commodities are withdrawn, the only form of Censorship which need be contemplated after the final conclusion of peace would be the control or examination of cables, since, although in many cases, e.g., meat, the mails supply an important source of information, operations in large staple commodities are mainly effected by cable. It must, however, be borne in mind that, if, as is understood, the Treasury desire to maintain Defence of the Realm Regula-tions 41d and 7c, d, and e, for some time beyond that date, a stringent enforcement of these Regulations will not be possible without the co-operation of both the Cable and Postal Censorships.However vital the need of the Censorship may appear to the Authorities concerned, the following objections to its continuance in any form beyond the final conclusion of Peace must not be underrated : l. In all cases where the British trader is competing with neutrals in a free market the delay of his cables, even for a few hours, is a fatal impediment to successful enterprise, unless his competitors&apos; cables are subjected to similar interference, and in order that British or allied traders should not suffer by delay due to censorship it
165mio-ht be necessary to confine interference with their cable correspondence to examina-tion of messages after transmission, thus losing many of the advantages of control. Even this modified form of censorship would undoubtedly meet with great hostility from the trading public on the ground that it involved the violation of the secrecy of their communications.2. It is obvious that neutrals will not voluntarily consent to have restrictions placed upon their cable communications with free markets, except possibly in cases where they agree to be rationed in respect of their imports from such markets, and to control the dealings of their own subjects. In the absence of such consent it seems very doubtful whether a full control of cables, such as is at present exercised, could be enforced against them after the discontinuance of the blockade.3. Although post-war control may be confined to a few raw materials any form of cable censorship would necessitate the examination of all cablegrams, domestic as well as commercial, thus applying to all classes of the community.4. It would undoubtedly be a matter of great difficulty to arrive at an agreement between the different Allied nations concerned with regard to the extent and character of the control to be exercised over cables and wireless such as would secure the essential uniformity of action.5. In face of the reaction which is sure to set in after the war against bureaucratic regulations of all kinds, it will be difficult enough in any case to persuade the public of the necessity of continued restrictions on trade, but the difficulty of obtaining public acquiescence in any scheme of temporary control would be greatly increased if it involved the maintenance of the Censorship, an institution which in peace time would be regarded as nothing more or less than a system of Government espionage.6. It seems probable that most, if not all, of those direct penal restrictions on private dealings with foreign countries which have been enforced during the war by means of the Censorship and for the continued enforcement of which the Censorship is essential, will cease upon the final declaration of peace, and a control without such restrictions, i.e., a control which does not aim at the complete suppression of speculative operations but confines itself to import and export restrictions, internal requisition, &amp;c, though it would be greatly assisted by the use of the Censorship as a source of information, would not be rendered wholly inoperative by its abolition.7. It might be possible and necessary in spite of these considerations to continue for a short time the examination of terminal and transit cables in certain cases, but the continuance of the Postal Censorship after the declaration of peace would, it is thought, present almost insuperable difficulties.The public have acquiesced in its - existence as a necessity of war. They have recognized that it has been well organized and well run, and that its services as a war weapon have more than compensated for the hardships that it has caused to individuals. Submission to its regulations has been regarded as a mattei\of patriotism. But imagine in time of peace the existence of a system under which the most urgent private letter was liable to detention because it was suspected of containing code, and no one could cross the Straits of Dover without being searched to the skin in order to ascertain that they were not carrying correspondence relating to raw materials. This is no exaggera-tion, for traders would no longer be deterred by patriotism from adopting subterfuges. They would probably, most of them, make a point of defeating a method of control which they regarded as oppressive, and would send their correspondence by channels that did not come under the eye of Government officials The examination of mails would therefore be fruitless, unless provision was made for a thorough search of every passenger entering and leaving the United Kingdom, and if an efficient port control of this kind is a matter of difficulty now, when passengers are few, it can be well imagined what the difficulties would be under normal conditions. Eor the same reason private letters, as well as trade correspondence, would have to be examined.It must, however, be borne in mind that a cable censorship alone could not possibly be so effective as it would be with the co-operation of a postal censorship. The mere knowledge that cables were examined would lead to a more extensive use of the post for certain classes of negotiation which it was desired to conceal from the authorities.7. There is a further important aspect of this question which must not be lost sight of, viz., that the Censorship will presumably form an essential part of the executive machinery of the proposed League of Nations.It seems inevitable that, if the League is to be an effective institution, a system of economic boycott must form part of the machinery by which its decisions will be enforced against peace breakers. The experience of the present war makes it obvious that where control has to be exercised over trade and communications through an
fintermediate State not actively co-operating in such control, the&apos; Censorship is ait absolutely essential weapon of blockade. It is of great importance that this factshould-receive recognition when the executive machinery of the League is framed, for- if any essential part of that machinery is left tu be improvised when the need arises, it is: obvious that the power of the League to enforce its decrees effectively and with precision will be proportionately impaired... Measures for securing the instant establish-ment of an effective Censorship under certain conditions &quot;must, it is thought, form part of the constitution of the League,, and receive public sanction as&apos;such;It will certainly be far easier to persuade the public to allow Parliament to agree to the re-establishment in certain eventualities of.a Censorship for.the purpose of enforcing the will of the League if the impression of this institution left upi m the public mind is that of an effective and well-proved &quot;weapon&quot;of blockade-and not of a detestable mechanism for curtailing freedom of contract. From&apos; this&apos; point of view it would seem imperative that, when peace is finally concluded, the Censorship should not be maintained, a moment longer than is essential for the purpose of securing an equitable distribution of food-stuffs arid raw materials&apos; and of obviating the panic conditions which would ensue&apos;if the channels of trade communication were, at the present critical juncture; thrown open to unrestricted speculative operations.
