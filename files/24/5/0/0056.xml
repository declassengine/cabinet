[This Document is the Property of His Britanmc Majesty&apos;8 GovflrnmeafcjPrinted for the War Cabinet.  July 1919.404SECRET. G.-254.WAR  CABINET.f 89COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAY.Second Interim Report.Pay and Pensions of other Ranks Army and Royal Air Force. (Previous Papers No. G.-252 and 252a.)1. IN their first report the Committee dealt, as far as they were able to do so, with the pay, allowances, retired pay, and half pay of officers. They have now considered the pay and pensions of other ranks in the Army and Royal Air Force, and herewith submit their report under these heads.2. The future conditions of service in the Royal Navy had already been fully determined by the War Cabinet when they considered in May last the rates of pay and scales of pension proposed by the Jerram Committee. The position as regards the Army and Air Force was therefore to some extent prejudged.3. Pay. The rates of pay recommended are set out in Appendix I. As in the case of officers, men in the Army will in future be paid at the same rates in all branches, except in the case of men whose duties are those of special trade or profession.Rate of Pay for Private Soldier. It will be seen that the rate of pay recommended for a private soldier is as follows : s. d.2   9 per diem on entry.3   6 per diem after one year, and after passing qualifying tests fora trained soldier. 4   0 per diem after two years.In recommending these rates, the Committee have been guided by the fact that 2s. 9d. is the approved rate of pay of an ordinary seaman, R.N., and a Royal Marine recruit; and 4s. is the rate of an able seaman, R.N., continuous service, and a trained Royal Marine. The trained able seaman and marine are, however, eligible for increments of 3d. after 3, and Qd. after 6 years&apos; men&apos;s service; the Army rate is a fiat rate.It should be pointed out that the sailor was, before the war, paid at a higher rate than the soldier; the difference being approximately 20d. to 16d. If this differentiation were maintained, a rate of 3s. Qd. could perhaps be justified as the basic rate for a fully trained private soldier. Moreover, 3s. 6d. is the rate of the non-continuous service A.B. (Qd. less than the continuous-service sailor), and the term of engagement in the Army  7 years with the Colours and 5 years with the Reserve resembles more nearly the non-continuous term of engagement in the Navy.On the other hand, it is urged by the representatives of the War Office that it will be quite impossible to maintain a satisfactory and contented Army if the basic rate of pay therein is materially lower than that given to the Royal Navy and Royal Marines.After full consideration, the Committee have accepted the War Office view, and have accordingly recommended a basic rate of 4s. for the fully trained private soldier.4. Technical Branches.--Hitherto men in the technical branches of the Army have received pay according to the corps to which they belonged, whether the Royal Engineers, the Royal Army Service Corps, cr any other branch. For the future it is proposed that men practising the same trade should be subject to the same tests in all branches, and should be grouped according to their trades. Corps pay will then disappear, and a man will receive the pay of the group wh ch includes the trade he [196] B
practises. This system already holds in the case of the Navy and the Royal Air Force, and the Committee are of the opinion that its extension to the Army possess great advantages. At the same time it appears highly desirable that men of the same trades in the three Services should be required to reach the same standard, and that the grouping of the trades should correspond in the three Services ; and the Committee feel that these questions could best be arranged by a conference of the technical experts of the Service departments with representatives of the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury. At the same time, in view of the urgencj7 of publishing the pay proposals for the Royal Air Force, the Committee recommend that the Air Ministry should be authorised to engage men on the present system of grouping, pending the revision of the groups by the Inter-Departmental Conference.The rates proposed for the various groups in the Army and Royal Air Force are not identical, the main difference being that the Army scales provide for annual increments for ranks below Corporal, while the Royal Air Force scales provide for triennial increments for ranks from Aircraftman I to Flight Serjeant inclusive. In the case of the Army the scale is based upon the increments granted to the combatant branches, and it is felt that it is not possible to adopt different systems of increments for fighting and technical men, as they are intermingled in the same arms of the Service.5. Good-conduct Pay. The system of good-conduct pay which at one time existed in the Army has been more recently succeeded by a system of proficiency pay, depending upon service and qualifying tests. In the case of the Royal Air Force the system of good-conduct pay has never obtained. The reinstitution in the Army of good-conduct pay on the Naval system and the question of its application to the Royal Air Force have been carefully considered by the Committee, and the principle commends itself to them as tending to the preservation of discipline and to greater efficiency in the Forces. They feel further that good-conduct pay, when granted, should be sufficient to induce a man to strive hard not only to obtain a badge, but to keep it when obtained, and for this purpose they think that the Naval rate of 3d. per badge should be applied to the other two Services, and that badges should be granted after three, eight, and thirteen years&apos; service. The present system of proficiency pay in the Army will then cease.6. Recruitment of the Royal Air Force. The Committee doubt whether it is sufficiently widely realised that the Royal Air Force, unlike the Navy and Army, does not exist except on a temporary basis ; and that the chief concern of the Air Ministry at the present time is the creation of a permanent force. Demobilisation in the Army is likely to be accelerated in the near future, and, although legally possible, it will in fact be impracticable to retain in the Royal Air Force large numbers of men who will then also wish to leave the Service. In order to obtain men and, what is more important, in order to attract men who during the war have made good, it will be necessary to offer special inducements, and the Committee feel that the Air Ministry should be authorised to recruit men for the various groups, not only at the lowest rates of pay applicable, but also at the intermediate and higher rates in the right proportions to the strength of the Force.In this connection the Committee desire to draw attention to the possibilities of obtaining recruits for the technical branches of all three Services from the technical schools. Headmasters of these shools complain that they are unable to place out their pupils in advantageous positions ; but, with the conditions of service now, offered a real career is open to these boys in either the Navy, the Army, or the Air Force. At the same time, the Committee feel that the Services would gain considerably by taking well-qualified students from the technical schools, and they would therefore recommend that the three departments should keep in touch with the technical institutions with this end in view.7. Separation Allowances. The decision of the War Cabinet in regard to separa-tion allowance for the Navj&apos; is that it should be continued at existing rates until the close of the present calendar year ; the future of these allowances from that date to be the subject of further consideration, regard being had to the cost of living in determining the question.The Committee think it is inevitable that the War Cabinet decision should also apply to separation allowance in the Army and Air Force, namely, that it should continue at existing rates until the end of the calendar year.   The existing separation
allowance rates for the Army and Air Force are, however, higher than the existing Navy rates in view of the fact that the sailor has hitherto been in receipt of higher rates of pay than the soldier, and has therefore been able to afford to contribute a larger sum to support his family. The administrative difficulties in making any reduction in the rates of separation allowance for the soldier and airman during the intervening months would, it is considered, be insurmountable ; and it is understood that the Admiralty, in view of the fact that the Navy has had the benefit of their increased pay since the 1st February, would not press that Naval separation allowances should be revised in an upward direction in consequence of the decision to bring the soldier&apos;s pay on of the same level as that of the sailor. If separation allowance is to continue until the end of the present calendar year it must be at the existing rates. The Committee are strongly of the opinion, however, that if it should be continued thereafter the rates and conditions of grant should be identical in all three Services.8. Pensions. The new pension scheme for the Royal Air Force is given in Appendix II. The method of assessment is identical with that recently approved for the Navy, and the basic rate of l\d. a day adopted in that Service is recommended for the Royal Air Force.It is not possible to state the number of men in the Royal Air Force who will beeome entitled to a pension, but the Air Ministry anticipate that they will not exceed 10 per cent, of the recruits entering the Service annually.The War Office have been unable in the time available to produce a detailed scheme of Army pensions; but the Committee recommend that pensions in the Army should be equivalent to those proposed for the Royal Air Force.9. Dates of Increases. The Committee recommend that the new rates of pay for the Army should take effect from the 1st July, 1919.Attention has already been drawn to the necessity of attracting good men into the Air Force, and particularly of inducing those who have proved themselves during the war to remain in it. The rates of pay now recommended, however, are, in a few cases, lower than those at present obtaining ; and the Committee therefore recommend that the new rates of pay for the Royal Air Force should come into force from the 1st August, 1919, subject to the following reservations : (a.) Men on regular engagements may draw their present rates of pay plus bonus,if more beneficial than the new rates, up to the 31st March, 1920.This will include ,men now serving who may, without a break in theirservice, re-engage or sign regular engagements. (6.) New Enlistments. All men enlisting on or after the 1st August, 1919, whetherwith previous service or not, will comeon the new rates of pay forthwith, (c.) Men Serving for Occupation Period. These men, if not on regular engage-ments, retain the old rates plus bonus until discharge, if more favourable.Summary of Recommendations.The Committee recommend : 1. The rates of pay set forth in Appendix I.2. The scheme of pensions for the Royal Air Force set out in Appendix II.3. That the new scheme of pensions for the Army should be equivalent to that recommended for the Royal Air Force.4. That the system of good-conduct pay be reintroduced into the Army and introduced into the Royal Air Force on the lines proposed; and that proficiency pay in the Army should thereupon cease.   .5. That persons performing the duties of a-particular trade should be subject to similar tests in the three Services; and that the technical experts of the Board of Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry should confer together with representatives of the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury with a view to a similar grouping of the various trades in the three Services. In the meantime, the Air Ministry should be authorised to engage men on the present system of grouping pending the revision of the groups by the Inter-Departmental Conference.6. That the Air Ministry should be authorised to recruit men in the various groups at all ranks in the right proportion to the strength of the Force.7. That separation allowance in the Army and Royal Air Force should, as in the case of the Navy, be continued at existing rates until the end of the present calendar
year, and should then be reviewed in accordance with the previous decision of the War Cabinet. Should it be decided to continue separation allowance after 1st January, 1920, it should be brought to the same rates for all three Services.8. The new rates of pay for the Army should take effect from 1st July, 1919.The new rates of pay for the Royal Air Force should come into force from 1st August, 1919, subject to the following reservations: Men on regular engagements may draw their present rates of pay plus bonus, if more beneficial than the new rates, up to 31st March, 1920.This will include men now serving who may, without a break in their service, re-engage or sign regular engagements. New Enlistments.- All men enlisting on or after 1st August, 1919, whetherwith previous service or not, wiU come on the new rates of pay forthwith. Men Serving for Occupation Period. These men, if not on regular engage-in ents, retain the old rates plus bonus until discharge, if more favourable.H. A. L. FISHER (Chairman).G.

The pension will be granted on the basis of a daily rate for each complete year of service in each rank, with proportionate amounts for completed months. The daily rate will be uniform for all branches.The daily rate proposed is as follows: d.Aircraftsman .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..   l- Corporal       .. .. .. ,. .. .. .. 2Sergeant      .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..   %\Fight sergeant .. .. -. .. .. .. 33.
