ent is the Property-of His Britasraie Majesfc/s QoYemmBn^JPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1918.SECRET.G.-204. ;     KiWAR CABINET.AMENDMENT OF THE MILITARY SERVICE ACTS.Extract from Minutes of War Cabinet 377, held on March  9, 1918.&quot; The War Cabinet decided to appoint the following Committee to consider the draft of the Military Service Bill (Paper G.T.-4057):- / ,Sir George Cms (Chairman), /Lord Milner,Sir Auckland Geddes,Mr. Duke,Mr. Munro,Mr. Hayes Fisher,Mr. Roberts;Mr. T. Jones (Secretary);and that the Committee should have power to summon any representatives of Depart-ments concerned.&quot;Report of the Committee.(Reference War Cabinet 377, Minute 11.)The Committee have considered and settled the accompanying draft Bill (G.T.-4124),* upon which they desire to make the following observations: 1. Age Limit. The age limit is fixed by the Bill at from 18 to 50, except that, as regards members of the medical profession (for whom there is an urgent demand) the limit is raised to 55. Power is taken to raise the general limit to 55 either generally or for a class by Order in Council.2. Exceptions. The existing exception for men in holy orders and ministers of religion is abolished, but it is provided that these persons shall not, except with their consent, be called up for combatant service, but may be required to perform any pre-scribed work in connection with the service of the sick and wounded, whether in the fighting line or elsewhere. The Committee are of opinion that means should be found, in consultation with the proper authorities, for securing so far as the emergency permits, the maintenance of religious ministrations in the country. As regards the other exceptions in Schedule I to the principal Military Service Act, some modifications are made.3. Volunteers. The Bill contains a provision under which boys from 17 to 18 years of age shall be required to. perform service in the Volunteer Force. As to the desirability of inserting this provision, there was some difference of opinion in the Committee, and the matter is left to the War Cabinet to decide.[362]* Printed at end.B
4. Exemptions. The Committee have considered the grouping system proposed by the Ministry of National Service, which would involve the practical abolition of the Military Service Tribunals, and the arguments of the President of the Local Government Board and the Secretary for Scotland, for the retention of those tribunals; and they have come to the conclusion that&apos; the end which the Cabinet have in view, namely, the effective and rapid mobilisation of our man-power, can best be attained by (a) enabling His Majesty, in case of urgent necessity, to with-draw all or any of the certificates of exemption granted by the tribunals, and (6) extending the power to regulate tribunals by Order in Council. They have accord ingly inserted in the draft Bill provisions for the above purposes.The Director-General of National Service already has power under the Militar Service Act, 1918, to withdraw all certificates granted on occupational grounds and Clause 3 of the Bill would enable the Government in a time of great emergenc\ to cancel certificates granted on personal grounds up to any age which might be specified.   In the meantime the new regulations to be made would speed up the work of the tribunals.5. Ireland. As regards the application of the Military Service Acts to Ireland (a question which is understood to be reserved for decision by the War Cabinet) the draft Bill is in alternative forms.Under one form the Bill applies to the whole of the United Kingdom, provision being made for the modifications which will be necessary in its application t( Ireland.Under the alternative form, power is taken by Order in Council to apply the Act to Ireland, with such modifications as may be necessary. This form has the advantage that the provisions for special tribunals, &amp;c, which are necessary if the Act is to be applied to Ireland, will not be inserted in the Bill, but will appear in the Order in Council. Further, time would be allowed for voluntary recruiting &amp;c, before the Act is put in force in Ireland.The proposal, which was put before the Cabinet, for a scheme of compulsory enrolment by ballot for the purpose of completing and maintaining the Irish regi ments of the line, did not commend itself to the military authorities, and has not been included in the draft Bill; but a clause has been inserted for giving effect to the pro posal of the Chief Secretary for Ireland under which men drilling in rebel volunteer organisations would be deemed to be enlisted for general service with the colours.6. Aliens. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the application of the new age limit to aliens liable to conscription under the Conventions with Allied States subject to the extension (when necessary) of the terms of the Conventions.(Signed)        G. CAVE,Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., April 3, 1918.
G.T.-4070.Minutes of the First Meeting of the Committee, held at the Home Office,Friday March 29, at 4 p.m.Present:The Rt. Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman). The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Miiner, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. The Rt. Hon. Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B., M.P. The Rt. Hon. H. E. Duke, K.C., M.P. The Rt. Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P.The following also attended:The Rt. Hon. Sir A. Stanley, M.P.Mr. A. C. Beck, M.P.Sir J. Sevmour Lloyd, K.B.E., C.M.G.Sir II. Monro, K.C.B.Mr. I. G. Gibbon,Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison.Mr. T. Jones (Secretary).The Committee proceeded to consider the draft Bill which had been circulated by the Minister of National Service (G.T.-4057).- 1. Age Limits.   -Boys of 17. The Chairman indicated that in the view of the Cabinet it should be compulsory for boys of 17 to be enrolled in Class C of the Volunteers, and to attend the number of drills laid down for this class. (War Cabinet 377, Minute 8.)The Committee agreed (a.) That the Bill should &quot; deem boys of 17 to have become Volunteers,&quot; and the number of drills could be stated in a schedule.18 50.        (b.) The next group should be from 18 to 50, i.e., to the attain-ment of the 51st birthday. 51 55.        (c.) The next group, 51 to 55, should be deemed to be Volunteerswith power by Order in Council to deem them to be enlisted. Doctors.       (d.) That a special Order might be made to meet the need fordoctors.With reference to (c) above, Sir A. Geddes said that he was confronted with a serious problem in connection with the supply of men for units of the Labour Corps and such corps as the Royal Marine Engineers. From next autumn onwards the con-tracts of the indentured labourers would rapidly expire, and owing to tonnage difficulties a fresh supply would not be returned. Between the ages of 51 and 55 there were some 200,000 men per annum available, about half of whom would be fit for labour in France. Without using these abroad, it was hard to discover an adequate supply to take the place of the indentured labourers.Mr. Hayes Fisher thought the House of Commons would press for the retention of the men of the group 51 to 55 within the Home Forces.2. Exceptions.The Committee&apos;reviewed the exceptions now in force under the Military Service Acts, and agreed that . (a.) The first exception should read &quot;men ordinarily resident in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions abroad.&quot; (b.) The second exception should remain as at present.(c.) The third exception should read &apos;; men serving in the navy, or the Roval Marines.&quot;
(d.) The fourth exception, which deals with ministers of religion, should be amended so as to provide that men in holy orders or regular ministers of any religious denomination should be compulsorily recruited for duties in connection with the care of the sick and wounded, unless they offered themselves for combatant duty.(e.) The fifth exception, as altered by the Military Service (Review of Excep-tions) Act, 1917, should not be further altered, and the House of Commons should be informed that no disturbance of the pledge given under this head was contemplated.(/.) The exception dealing with prisoners of war should be repealed (M.S. Act, Session 2, Section 8).3. Tribunals and, Exemptions.The Committee next considered the proposals dealing with the granting of certificates of exemption and the machinery for granting them.Sir A. Geddes explained that he had not contemplated dispersing the present personnel of the tribunals. In the next place he wished the authority, whether the present tribunals or some readjustment of them, should work to a definite code. The recruiting machine should work subject to safeguards, three, any one of which might delav a man&apos;s call for military service.(a.) His medical fitness.  That was a question for a medical board. (b.) His occupational value to the State.(c.) His individual position, which would be affected by occupational or social considerations or both; e.g., a man might be a pivotal man in a business, the last male in the family, or have many dependants..Each area would be allotted its quota starting with Group I, then Group II, and so on till Group V was reached, if found necessary. The function of the local authority would be to adjudicate on individual considerations (c)&apos; above and they would do so on the basis of a definite code of instructions. Decisions as to the fitness of men would fall to the medical authorities, and cases of occupation (&amp;) above  to the Reserved Occupations Committee. No man would appeal for consideration of his individual position until it was published that his particular group and grade were being called. The function of the local tribunal machinery would still be to save the right man from the recruiting machine.In reply to questions, Sir A. Geddes stated that there was an enormous amount of physical unfitness in the nation. Between 18 and 43 there were (after excepting certain industries from which men cannot be taken) still about 900,000 fit men in civil life. His Department had started out to obtain 450,000 this year. Excluding boys, some 120,000 had been obtained since January. Of the 450,000, perhaps, not more than 300,000 would be in Grade I. An extra 450,000 &quot;or 500,000 had now to be found during this year, but this assumed raising the upper age limit of 43.To meet criticism it might be possible to retain the present tribunals, and take power to issue new regulations for putting in force the procedure indicated above. The personnel of the tribunals would certainly be used.The Committee requested the Minister of National Service to modify the form of the Bill so that it would appear less- menacing to the social organisations of the country, and also meet the criticism which had been made that the Bill completely disestablished the present tribunals.4. Conscientious Objectors.With reference to conscientious objectors, the Committee agreed that exemption should only be from combatant service and subject to power being taken by Order in Council or by regulation to prescribe the work to be done.5. Application to Ireland.Mr. Duke explained the strong objections to applying conscription to Ireland, and his preference for a system of ballot, following upon opportunity for voluntary enlistment with special inducements of separation allowances, choice of corps, &amp;c. He had drafted a suitable clause (G.T.-4052).
The Committee were agreed that whether conscription on the English model, or Mr. Duke&apos;s alternative method, was adopted, the Irish tribunals would have to be nominated bodies, with a substantial military element, and they would have to work in close co-operation with the Royal Irish Constabulary.The Committee adiourned until Saturday, the 30th March, at 11.30 a.m.G.T.-4076.Minutes of the Second Meeting of the Committee, held at the Home Office onSaturday, March 30, 1918, at 11.30 a.m.Present:The Rt. Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman). The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Milner, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. The Rt. Hon. Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B., M.P. The Rt. Hon. H. E. Duke, K.C., M.P. The Rt. Hon. R. Munro, K.C., M.P. The Rt. Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. The Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P.The following also attended:The Rt. Hon. Sir A. Stanley, M.P. Mr. E. C. Beck, M.P. Sir J. Seymour Lloyd, K.B.E., C.M.G. Sir J. M. Dodds, K.C.B. Sir H. Monro. K.C.B. Mr. I. G. Gibbon. Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison-Mr. P. Rose.Mr. T. Jones (Secretary).1. Minutes.The Minutes of the First Meeting were amended and approved.2. Revised Draft Bill.The Committee proceeded to consider the draft Bill as revised in the light of the discussion which had taken place at the First Meeting of the Committee, and agreed to the following changes, together with others of a minor or verbal character: Section 1 (1).&quot; Great Britain &quot; should be retained as the alternative to &quot; United Kingdom,&quot; and &quot;British Isles &quot; should be omitted. *&quot; For the purpose of the successful prosecution of the war &quot; should read &quot; for the purpose of the defence of the realm.&quot;The age of doctors and their liability for service should be dealt with by specific provisions in the Bill.Section 1 (2). Ministers of Religion.The provision for ministers of religion and for conscientious objectors should be separate.It was agreed that the words &quot; in connection with the service of the sick&quot; and wounded &quot; unduly restricted the field of non-combatant duty which it was desirable to prescribe to ministers of religion, and various additions to follow the words &quot; sick and wounded &quot; were suggested, such as: &apos;&quot; or other non-combatant service&quot;; &quot; or other non-combatant duty which may from time to time be assigned to him &quot;; &quot; within the limits prescribed by the Geneva Convention.&quot;[362] C
The draughtsman was requested to insert some words which would enlarge the sense along the lines indicated.Section 2 (1). Age Limits.Mr. Roberts stated that he and his Labour colleagues in the Government were strongly opposed to lowering the age of military service to 17, and were hardly less strongly opposed to the recruiting of boys of 17 compulsorily for the Volunteer Force. He agreed that the matter was one of policy for the War Cabinet rather than for this Committee.The Committee agreed to omit the reference to ages 51 to 56, and to make the sub-section read: &quot; Subject to the provisions of this section, every male British subject for the time being in the United Kingdom (Great Britain) who has attained the age of seventeen years, but has not attained the age of eighteen years, shall be liable to perform such service in the Volunteer Force as may be prescribed.&quot;It was agreed, more especially in view of rural conditions, to be undesirable to compel all members of the age group 51-56 to join the Volunteer Force, but that the Bill should give power to the Minister of National Service to impose conditions by regulations on postponed men. This provision might appear in the next Section as 3 (1) (/).Section 3 (1). Tribunals and Exemptions.Mr. Munro, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Hayes Fisher were united in opposing the removal of the present machinery of tribunals, though willing to see the machinery modified and improved in various directions.In Scotland, Mr. Munro maintained, the present system had conclusively demonstrated its great value, and now commanded general confidence. Its opera-tions could no doubt be expedited, but to scrap it would be a piece of Parliamentary vandalism. In England the area of the appeal court was the county, but in Scotland it was the sheriffdom, which sometimes covered several counties. There was a stand-ing chairman, viz., the Sheriff, who was a responsible public official, and it was certain that the tribunals in Scotland would not stand having their decisions overridden by officers of the Ministry of National Service. He particularly wished to know whether the powers of the new authorities were to be advisory or judicial.Mr. Hayes Fisher urged that the House of Commons would be strongly opposed to handing over the tribunals entirely to the Ministry of National Service, because the Local Government Board was generally regarded as a buffer between the public and the Army authorities. He thought, too, that the House of Commons would scrutinise most critically the proposal to standardise individual conditions like domestic or financial hardships.Mr. Roberts said that he was willing to curtail the present procedure by not allowing appeal except with the consent of the tribunal.Sir A. Geddes reminded the Committee that he had been charged by the War Cabinet with the task of finding a very large number of recruits at a time of grave national emergency. He had to prepare machinery to enable him to make what was practically a levy en masse, and to do this with the least possible damage to the&apos; industrial fabric of the country. He had never suggested that the personnel of the tribunals should be dispersed, but that they should be retained as advisory bodies, to deal with individual applications on the basis of a definite code of standardised individual conditions. They would apply certain prescribed principles to particular cases, and within those limits they would not be interfered with. They would have no power of exemption, because exemptions would be abolished, but they would have the power of postponing a man from one group to another group. Men will be placed in their groups as a result of their occupational value and age, and graded according to the result of their medical examination. The advisory bodies will have no cognisance of a man&apos;s medical fitness. A man unfit medically would not receive a calling-up notice, and until he received a calling-up notice he would not wish to come before the advisory bodies or tribunals. So long as tribunals were allowed to retain powers of exempt-ing men, he did not see how the numbers required by the War Cabinet were to be obtained. On his plan classified groups would be published, indicating the occupa-tions, ages, and medical grades of the men required, and there would be a right of
appeal to be postponed to a later group. The work of-the advisory bodies or tribunals would be confined to the adjustment of individual cases that came before them, and it was essential that this work should be done with great speed, as the in-take of the recruiting machine would be enormously increased. Provided the urgency and magnitude of this task were realised and fully met, he had no objection to the responsibility for the work remaining with the Local Government Board. The tribunals would have to sit continuously, and small panels would be necessary to deal with accumulations of work. With regard to existing certificates of exemption, they would remain valid until fresh calling-up notices were served. The great majority of exemptions were at present under the Ministry of National Service; considerably less than a million had been exempted by the tribunals.Sir A. Stanley called attention to the position of the 700,000 railwaymen, who, in view of a pledge given by the Government, could only be called up by arrangement with the Railway Executive. These railwaymen were protected by individual certificates, and they would be apprehensive lest the present Bill should be deemed to cancel the Government pledge.Lord Milner stated that in his opinion the proposed alteration in the law would not revoke the pledge.The Committee were agreed that the present tribunal system should be retained, but that the duties of the tribunals should be altered so as to carry out the functions indicated above by Sir A. Geddes; the power to grant exemption should be cancelled; the right of appeal should be modified; and steps should be taken to speed up the operation of the tribunals.The Committee adjourned until 3 p.m.G.T.-4091.Minutes of the Third Meeting of the Committee held at the Home Office onSaturday, March 30, 1918, at 3 p.m.Present:The Rt. Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman). The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Milner, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. The Rt. Hon. Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B., M.P. The Rt. Hon. H. E. Duke, K.C., M.P. The Rt. Hon. R. Munro, KG, M.P. The Rt. Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. The Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P.The following were also attended:Mr. A. C. Beck, M.P.Sir J. Seymour Lloyd, K.B.E., C.M.G.Sir J. M. Dodds, K.C.B.Sir H. Munro, K.C.B.Mr. 1. G. Gibbon.Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison.Mr. P. Rose.Mr. T. Jones (Secretary).1.   The Committee resumed the consideration of the revised draft Bill.Section 3 (3).2. Conscientious Objectors.The Committee considered various methods of dealing with conscientious objectors. The effect of 3 (3) as drafted was to give power to call up conscientious objectors, but an assurance could be given to the House of Commons that they would
not, in fact, be called up. Conscientious objection could be dealt with as a standarised ground for postponement into a late group, or, in addition to the proposed five groups a sixth group could&apos; be created into which all persons permanently unfit for military service could be put, and conscientious objectors could be placed apart in a special class in this sixth group. (In any case, in view of the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, it was necessary to have them definitely labelled.) Another method would be to make the existing provisions for conscientious objectors apply to persons deemed to be enlisted under the present Bill.Ultimately it was agreed that (cl) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the first Military Service Act should not be repealed, and that A section 3 (3) of the new Bill should stand as drafted with the omission of the words Granted or renewed before the passing of this Act.&quot;Section 4.3. Application of Act to Ireland.Mr. Duke suggested that if compulsory service were applied to Ireland there were at least three possible courses worth considering: (a.) The Bill might contain a section extending the provisions to Ireland simpliciter, with the addition of arrangements for tribunals.(b.) Power might be taken to apply the Act to Ireland by Order in Council, after a short period of grace during which voluntary enlistment might be stimulated.(c.) His Majesty might by Order in Council provide for the selection of men by ballot to maintain the effective strength of the Irish regiments.Mr. Duke thought, and the Committee generally concurred, that there was much to be said for adopting the second course, and it was agreed to submit (&amp;), together with (ft), for the consideration of the War Cabinet.As to the precise method of giving effect in the Bill to the course adopted, the following alternatives were discussed: (a.) To include Ireland in section 1 of the Bill as part of the general applica-tion of the Bill to the United Kingdom, and to make a subsequent modifi-cation in the Bill when providing for the Irish case.(b.) To omit Ireland in section 1 and insert later a substantive section dealing with Ireland.The first course was the more logical, but the general opinion was in favour of (b) on Parliamentary grounds. If Ireland were included in the first section opposi-tion would begin at once before any progress had been made with the Bill; whereas if the Irish clause came later it would be possible to postpone in some degree any opposition to the extension of the Bill to Ireland.Section 4(1).4. Selection by Ballot.It was agreed to omit this sub-section and also the consequential second schedule.Section 4 (2).5. Drilling of Rebel Volunteers. The sub-section was approved.6. It was agreed that the Bill should be redrafted as above amended and circulated on Tuesday.The Committee adjourned until Tuesday, April 2, at 4 p.m.
..... l:i&amp;dSlHMi&amp;iSiiG.T.-4113.Minutes of the Fourth Meeting of the Committee, held at the Home Office onTuesday, April 2nd, 1918, at 4 p.m.Present:The Rt. Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman). The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Milner, G.C.B., G.C.M.G. The Rt. Hon. Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B., M.P. The Rt., Hon. H. E. Duke, K.C., M.P. The Rt. Hon.. R. Munro, K.C., M.P. The Rt, Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. The Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P.The following also attended:Mr. A. C. Beck, M.P.Sir J. Seymour Lloyd, K.B.E.. C*M.G.Sir J. M. Dodds, K.C.B.Sir H. Monro, K.C.B.Mr. I. G. Gibbon.Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison.Mr. P. Rose.Sir H. Llewellyn Smith, K.C.B. Mr. S. J. Chapman, C.B.E.Mr..T. Jones (Secretary).1. Minutes.The Minutes of the Second and Third Meetings were amended and approved.2. Draft Bill (Second Revise).The Committee proceeded to consider the Draft Bill as revised in the light of the discussion which had taken place at the Second and Third Meetings of the Committee.Section .1(1).It was agreed to alter the definition of &quot;appointed date&quot; (1 (3)), and to omit &quot;for the time being &quot; in line 11.Section 1 (1) (&amp;),, Doctors.   . It was agreed to leave this proviso as drafted.Sir A. Geddes explained that doctors should not be limited to rendering medical service. The power of assigning them to military service should be available. He based this opinion on the ground of experience and after consultation with members of the General Medical Council. At present doctors were very unequally distributed, and certain areas were avoided by older men. It would be necessary to move the older practitioners into such areas in order to release younger men.Section 1 (4). Released Prisoners of War.It was agreed that words should be added to cover official pledges that released prisoners should not fight again.[362] D
Section 2 (1) and (2). Powers of the Director-General of National Service toGroup, &amp;c.After discussion it was agreed that Section 2(1) and (2) should be entirely recast so as to make quite clear that it is the intention of the Director-General of National Service to group the recruitable population, that consequent upon such grouping, exemptions (except in the case of conscientious objectors) will disappear, but every person on being called out for service will be free to apply to a tribunal to have his group postponed, on the grounds set forth in a Schedule to the Bill.Sir A.. Geddes explained that in order to avoid delay and inevitable omissions, it was not desirable to give a statutory right to an individual to a calling-up notice. The statutory notice should be by Public Proclamation with a right of appeal within 7 days of publication. At the same time it was hoped to be able to serve individual notices, and a general promise to that effect could be given in the House of Commons.Section 2 (3). Conscientious Objectors.It was pointed out that there were administrative difficulties in the way of giving effect to the Committee&apos;s previous decisions with regard to conscientious objectors.The Committee agreed that the present Bill should provide (1) for continuing in force the existing certificates of exemption to conscientious objectors, (2) for extending to persons brought in under the new Bill the same rights of appeal to tribunals and of exemption as are now enjoyed by conscientious objectors..Section 3. Ireland.It was agreed that this raised questions of policy for decision by the War Cabinet.Section 4 (1). Young Volunteers.It was agreed that the first alternative was preferable to the second, and that the Section raised a question of policy for decision by the War Cabinet.3. Men for the Navy.Sir A. Geddes explained that it was desirable to provide in the Bill power to compel men to serve in the Navy. By the Military Service Act, 1916, Section 3, the Admiralty had first call on men who had expressed a, preference for naval service. Under the Air Force (Constitution) Act, 1917, there was power to make men called up for military service serve in the Air Force.It was agreed to adopt Sir A. Geddes&apos;s suggestion, and to alter the title of the present Bill so that it should read: &quot; A Bill to make further provision with respect to service in His Majesty&apos;s forces during the present war.&quot;The Committee adjourned until Wednesday, the 3rd April, 1918, at noon.
G.T.-4117. .Minutes of the Fifth Meeting of the Committee, held at the Home Office on Wednesday, April 3, 1918, at 12.30 p.m.Present:The Rt. Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. (In the Chair). The Rt. Hon. R. Munro, KG, M.P. The Rt. Hon. G. H. Roberts, M.P.The following also attended:Mr. A. C. Beck, M.P.Mr. I. G. Gibbon.Major P. Llovd-Greame, M.C.Sir H. Llewellvn Smith. K.C.B.Mr. S. J.

The Chairman explained that Sir G. Cave, Lord Milner, Mr. Duke, and Sir A. Geddes were detained at a meeting of the War Cabinet.2. Draft Bill (Third Revise).The Committee proceeded to consider the Draft Bill as revised in the light of the discussion which had taken place at the previous meeting.Section 1 (1).It was agreed to substitute the following for lines 8 to 12: &quot; and who at the date of the passing of this Act has attained the age of eighteen years and has not attained the age of fifty-one years, or who at any subsequent date attains the age of eighteen years, shall, unless he is for the time being within the exceptions set out in the First Schedule to this Act, be deemed, as from the date of the passing of the Act, or as from that subsequent date, as the case may be, to have been duly enlisted, &amp;c.&quot;Section 1 (3). Men for the Navy.Objection was taken to the inclusion of the words &quot;or who having voluntarily enlisted in the regular forces have been so transferred &quot; on the ground that they included the &quot; Derby &quot; men and the &quot; new old &quot; men, and did not include the younger men.Section 1 (4). Definition of &quot; The Appointed Date.&apos;-&apos;-It was agreed to omit this sub-section.Section 1 (5). Prisoners of War.This was agreed to.The Committee adjourned until 3 p.m. the same day.
f12G.T.-4125.Minutes of the Sixth Meeting of the Committee held at the Home Office onWednesdayi&apos;April 3, 1918, at 3 p.m.Present:The Et. Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman). The Et. Hon. The Viscount Milner, G.C.B, G.C.M.G. The Et. Hon. Sir Auckland Geddes, K.C.B, M.P. The Et.. Hon. H. E. Duke, EC, M.P. The Et, Hon. W. Hayes Fisher, M.P. The Et. Hon. E. Munro. K.C, M.P. The Et. Hon.

Dodds, K.C.B.Sir J. Seymour Lloyd, K.B.E, CMG.Lieutenant G. Locker-Lampson, M.P.Mr. P. Eose.Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison. Mr. T. Jones (Secretary).1. Minutes.The Minutes of the Fourth Meeting were amended and approved.2. Draft Bill (Third Revise).Section 1 (2). Ministers of Religion.In view of the importance of preserving religious ministrations in the country, it was agreed that provision for the purpose should be made in consultation with the leaders of the different denominations, the necessary power being provided for by the power to prescribe grounds of application under Section 3.Section 1 (3). Men for the Navy.Mr. Hayes Fisher said he was in favour of omitting this sub-section. The country would always give all the forces required for the navy, and Parliament would in any Case of emergency be ready to pass a Bill to that end.Mr. Eoberts agreed, and thought public opinion would resertt any proposal for applying conscription to the navy.Mr. Munro suggested, and the Committee agreed, that the sub-section should be extended to cover men conscripted under the existing Acts, as well as those con-scripted under the Bill.The Chairman thought it was not desirable to change the short title of the Act. even if this sub-section were retained.The Committee agreed to draw the special attention of the War Cabinet, and of the Admiralty, to the proposal.3. Conventions with Allied States.The clause making the Military Service (Conventions with Allied States) Act, 1917, applicable to the present Bill was agreed to.4. Tribunals and Exemptions.Sir A. Geddes said that, after consultation with his Eecruiting Department, he regretted to have to advise against the acceptance of the arrangements for tribunals and exemptions, which the Committee had approved on the previous day.He briefly reviewed the stages through which the discussion had passed. His instructions from the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 371, Minute 9) had been to carry
out what almost amounted to a levy en masse, subject to as little industrial disloca-tion as possible. In the original draft of the Bill, to give effect to this (G.T.-4057), he had proposed to withdraw all existing exemptions and all power to grant exemp-tions, and to supersede tribunals by advisory bodies, which would act primarily in the interest of the recruiting authority, but whose advice the Minister of National Service would not be bound to follow. In the Bill as it emerged from the Committee on the previous evening, the tribunal system remained, with right of application from individuals, with statutory rights to the publication of schemes, &amp;c. He was advised that with such machinery there would be a break in the flow of men to the colours, especially in the period of transition from the present system to the new system. In any case so long as any weight was given to tribunals, the working of the recruit -ing machine would be arrested. From the standpoint of rapid recruiting his Depart -ment would be better off with its present powers of cancellation under the Military Service Act, 1918, coupled with certain modifications in the method of exemption, than under the Committee&apos;s proposals.Sir J. Seymour Lloyd said that the present Committee&apos;s scheme, in effect, im-posed fresh machinery on the recruiting authority, when what was wanted was a simplification of the existing machinery. The original proposal of the Minister of National Service had been to retain the personnel of the tribunals in an advisory capacity, and to give them little or no power of delaying the flow of men.Sir A. Geddes recommended that in the Third Revise of the Draft Bill now under discussion, the Committee.should delete Section 2 (1) and (2), retaining (3) with some drafting changes, modifying 2 (4), and.in the Second Schedule deleting the cancellation of Section 2 of the Military Service Act, 1918. The effect of this would be to scrap the proposed group system. The Director-General of National Service would retain his present power to cancel exemptions on occupational grounds, but the grounds of appeal to the tribunals would be narrowed to those of conscientious objection, and of individual hardship. These latter would be defined and standardised. This scheme was not substantially different from what had been sug-gested by the President of the Local Government Board, and the Secretary for Scot-land in. their memoranda to the War Cabinet (G.T.-4055 and 4058). In order to obtain the maximum number of men at a pinch, he still held it would be better to be rid of tribunals and to sweep away all individual rights of exemption. But, perhaps, the Government had &quot; missed the tide &quot; for launching such a scheme, and in view of possible parliamentary opposition, it might now be preferable to move on to the lines originally indicated by Mr. Hayes Fisher and Mr. Munro.Considerable discussion took place as to whether the Committee should adhere substantially to the Bill as now drafted, and should send it forward to the War Cabinet together with a fresh alternative clause embodying the scheme now put for--ward by Sir A. Geddes.Mr. Hayes Fisher, Mr. Munro, Mr. Duke, and Mr. Roberts were all in favour of retaining the system of tribunals, and believed that such a course would, on the whole, furnish most men for the forces. It was also pointed out that the scheme of the Bill did substantially carry out the purposes originally put forward- by the Minister of National Service, except that instead of advisory bodies a modified tribunal system, with machinery for speeding up, w&amp;s retained. It was also urged that the real crux of the problem was not the tribunal exemptions but the men in protected industries.Lord Milner, who arrived at the meeting at this stage, represented to the Com-mittee the supreme necessity of obtaining the maximum number of men, and said the War Cabinet were quite prepared to face serious Parliamentary trouble in order to obtain the men. At the same time it was very desirable that the Committee should send forward to the Cabinet one set of proposals and not two.Mr. Gibbon suggested that a compromise might be reached by putting in the Bill a, clause empowering His Majesty by Order in Council, in a case of grave national emergency, to cancel or withdraw all certificates of exemption, or any particular class of such certificates.Sir A. Geddes said if this suggestion were adopted he would then be prepared to drop his proposal.Sir J. Seymour Lloyd pointed out that the position would then be that in a grave and abnormal national situation, a Proclamation would be issued cancelling ail certi-hcates, and making it possible to call up men automatically. Such cancellation would apply to personal and occupational exemptions, and to exemptions on conscientious grounds.[362] E

Rose.Mr. W. M. Graham Harrison. Captain A. G. James.Mr. Thomas Jones (Secretary).1. Minutes.The Minutes of the Fifth and Sixth Meetings were amended and approved.2. Draft BUI (Fourth Revise).The Chairman explained that as a result of the discussion which had taken place at the War Cabinet that morning (War Cabinet 383, Minute 8), certain altera-tions some of them important would have to be made in the Bill as drafted by the Committee (G.T.-4124).The War Cabinet had approved of the following changes : Section 1 (1).  United Kingdom or Great Britain. Omit &quot; United Kingdom &quot; and read &quot; Great Britain.&quot;Section 1 (2). Ministers of Religion. Omit from &quot; but may be required &quot; (line 10) to the end.Section 1 (3). Men from the Navy.In accordance with the wishes expressed by the Board of Admiralty, this section to be omitted.Section 2. Power by Proclamation to Withdraw Certificates of Exemption.Substitute for this section a revised version, circulated at the meeting of the War Cabinet, by Sir A. Geddes.The Committee agreed to insert a further drafting amendment suggested by Mr. Gibbon.The Committee agreed to insert in the Bill a clause giving power by proclamation to withdraw certificates of exemption in the case of grave national emergency.5. Report to the War Cabinet,The Committee amended and approved a draft Report for submission to the War Cabinet (G.-204), to accompany the Bill as now amended. .
Section 3.Insert a sub-section dealing with legal proceedings under the Reserve Forces Acts, and a sub-section dealing with power to call up men for medical examination.Section 4. Application to Ireland. Reject the first alternative.Section 5. Obligation of Young Men to Serve.Omit this section, in view of probable widespread opposition and of the loss of the industrial services of the young men.3. Tribunals and Exemptions.The Chairman next stated that the War Cabinet had very strongly expressed the view that the tribunal system was the cause of considerable delay in the recruiting of men, and that there could not be one system of tribunals for Great Britain and another for Ireland. The Cabinet had therefore requested the Committee to re-assemble in order to devise a tribunal machinery applicable to the whole of the United Kingdom in its essential features. The Chairman suggested that perhaps rhe Cahinefs wish could be met by making Section (3) lb) read : &quot; For determining the constitution and the powers of the tribunals, &amp;c.&quot; This would enable the tribunals to be made nominative throughout the United Kingdom.Mr. Hayes Fisher hoped that the Cabinet realised that delay in obtaining recruits is mainly due to the fact that the decisions of the tribunals and appeal tribunals are constantly being set aside by the issue of protecting certificates. He could not allow the charge to go unchallenged in the House of Commons that the tribunals were the cause of delay.Sir A. Geddes thought in Ireland it should be possible to appoint a Commis-sioner for each county, with Sub-Commissioners, to act as tribunals. Such Com-missioners should have power to postpone the calling up of men and to grant what in effect would be permanent exemption.Considerable discussion ensued as to the best type of tribunal, and it was ulti-mately agreed to be desirable to retain the appeal tribunals, and to take power to make the local tribunals nominative, to reduce their size, and limit fhe right of appeal. This general scheme could be applied to Ireland, but there would neces-sarily be considerable differences in working it in Ireland.Mr. Duke thought it would be possible to staff the Irish tribunals largely with officials of the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, together with representatives of the army and the police.The Committee proceeded to redraft Section 3 of the Bill, so as to give effect to the above decision, and provide, inter alia, for determining the constitution and powers of tribunals, the establishment of special tribunals, the grant or renewal or review of certificates of exemption, and the regulation and limitation of applications for exemption.[362]F
