[This Document is the Property .of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]139Printed for the War Gabinet.^ September 1918.SECRET. G.-221.n&apos;2WAR  CABINET.APPRENTICESHIP INTERRUPTED BY WAR SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.THE problem of dealing with apprentices whose period of indenture or training has been interrupted through military service is one which is being constantly forced on the notice of the Ministries of Labour and Pensions by trade organisations, and is one which requires speedy solution. .Its urgency has been represented to us by employers&apos; associations, including the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, a number of the local advisory committees attached to the employment exchanges, and by other bodies. The problem has been the subject of enquiry by the Ministry of Reconstruction, and has been the subject of careful consideration by the Labour Resettlement Committee. The scheme for dealing with the matter, which I am&apos; now laying before the Cabinet, has been approved by that body, and also, by a conference of the various Departments concerned, including the Ministry of Reconstruction, the Board of Education, Ministry of Pensions, Ministry of Munitions, the War Office, and the Admiralty. That scheme is set out in full in Appendix (A), but I desire to explain generally the nature of the problem and of the solution proposed.We have been advised that legally any indenture of apprenticeship is rendered void by the interruption caused by military service (though the term &quot; apprenticeship,&quot; as used in this memorandum, is applied not only to apprenticeship under indenture, but to any man who was, prior to his being called up for military service, actually employed in a skilled trade and receiving instruction therein with a view to becoming a journey-man). In the case of an apprentice who is discharged from the army under the age of &apos;21, and who therefore has still a portion of his period of training to serve, no great difficulty is found to arise. Various trades seem ready to pay such an apprentice the rate appropriate to the age which he has reached; but the case of the apprentice who is over 21 when discharged, and who has lost two or three years of his training, presents a serious problem. A man of such an age is not willing to revert to an apprenticed wage, and the Ministry of Pensions have no power to give him assistance in order to enable him to complete his training if he is physically capable of resuming his previous occupation, because training grants under the Royal Warrant are confined to men who owing to their disability are unable to resume their pre-war occupation. On the evidence before the Ministry of Pensions, the Ministry of Reconstruction, and the Ministry of Labour, it seems clear that two conditions are necessary to induce a man over 21 to resume his interrupted apprenticeship, viz. : -(].) That he shall receive a man&apos;s wage and not a boy&apos;s wage ; and (2.) That he shall receive as much, or nearly as much, as he could earn by taking up unskilled or semi-skilled work.This especially holds true in the case of the large number of apprentices who married in the interval. The discharged apprentice will not, however, be economically worth more than an apprentices wage. Unless, therefore, he is given some assistance which will enable him to complete his training, he must lose his opportunity of becoming a skilled man, to his own detriment and to that of industry, which will require as many skilled men as possible after the war. If it is assumed, as I think it must be, that thisj is a very undesirable result of the service which the man has rendered to his country,! it becomes a question whether the necessary assistance should be afforded to him by the employer or by the State. It may therefore be useful to examine the problem from the point of view (l) of the employer ; (2) of the trade union ; (3) of the State.L782] &quot; &apos; V B
1. The Employers Point of View.-Some of the largest and wealthiest firms are prepared to bear the whole cost themselves, but the smaller firms (who often give the best training to apprentices) admit that they are unable to bear the extra cost which would be immediately unremunerative to them. In fact, it may be said that the general view of the employers is that it would pay them better to push on the younger men of 18 and under rather than take back the demobilised apprentices over 21. They would, of course, have to pay the former more than they have paid them in the past, in order to attract them from semi-skilled and unskilled work, but they claim that it would pay them better to give a rather higher sum to the boys of 18 and under rather than pay the wages of an adult to their discharged apprentices over 21, about whose capacity for training thev sometimes profess to be uncertain. They claim that the loss which has been caused by the State calling on these men to enlist should be borne by the State, and unless this is done they will put their discharged apprentices on semi-skilled or specialised work, which will give them good wages, but will not qualify them to become skilled men.2. The Trade Union Point of View. The present attitude of the trade unions may be described as one of suspended judgment. To the suggestion of the employers that the loss should be borne by the State some are inclined to agree, while others protest that the employer is trying to escape his responsibility. Many of them, however, adopt the attitude taken by the Chairman of the A.S.E., that in common fairness the loss ought to be borne by the State and not by the employer, and many are apprehensive that if the whole cost is put on the latter the result will be that the discharged apprentice will not get an all-round training, and that there will not be sufficient unanimity among trade unionists to force employers to give such a training.3. The State Point of View. In justice it seems difficult to deny that the State should bear the loss. If it is claimed that the employer should bear it because he will ultimately benefit, his answer is that he can obtain the skilled men whom he requires by recruiting from the lads of 18 and under. The discharged apprentice himself may justly claim that his future career should not suffer because of his patriotism. Public opinion will certainly be on his side when it realises that he is unable to go back to his own trade because the wages offered are not sufficient to maintain him, while his place as a craftsman is taken by younger men who were never asked to enlist. From the national point of view it is desirable that the adult demobilised man should be given hie opportunity of becoming a craftsman. There is no reason why he should not, with assistance, he made a well-trained and competent worker, and such a method seems clearly preferable to forcing unduly the training of younger lads to meet the shortage of apprentices created by war conditions. Unless some considered action is taken at once, there is a grave possibility that the pressure of public opinion, backed up by Parliament, will force the State to intervene and U try, when it will be too late, to devise a scientific or comprehensive scheme with results which would be to the advantage neither of the employer nor of the discharged apprentice nor of the State.On these grounds the Labour Resettlement Committee and the Departmental Conference referred to above unanimously decided that State assistance on the lines indicated in Appendix (A) was necessary. It is based on the evidence furnished by the enquiries made, which go to show that the discharged apprentice over 21 must receive at least three-fourths of the standard district rate in order to induce him to complete his training in his own trade. It is proposed that State assistance shall be confined to skilled trades as defined in clause 1 ;(6), in which a scheme of training has been agreed upon by the Joint Industrial Council or other body representing the employers and workpeople in the trade and approved by the Ministry of Labour. No scheme will be approved unless the unexpired period of apprenticeship shall have been reduced by at least one-third, and the employer must undertake to pay not less than seven-twelfths during the first twelve months and not less than two-thirds during the second twelve months ioi the district rate, plus war bonus, if any, while the State will contribute the difference between the wage payable by the employer and three-fourths during the first twelve months and five-sixths during the second twelve months of the district rate, plus war bonus. Where an apprentice is to receive a whole-time training in a technical school a maintenance grant, not exceeding 27s. Qd. a week, may be paid for a period not exceeding forty weeks, this amount being the same as that paid by the Ministry .of Pensions to disabled soldiers in training.It is not possible to form any reliable estimate as to the number of discharged apprentices who are likely to avail themselves of the scheme. An estimate has, how-ever, been attempted in Appendix.(B) of the maximum number of those who can avail themselves of the offer.   It is calculated that 200,000 is the outside number affected,
140APPENDIX (A).Draft Outline Scheme of Financial Assistance from the State for Apprenticeship interrupted by War Service.1. Definitions.(a.) Apprenticeship.THE term &quot; apprentice&quot; as hereinafter used means any male who prior to being called up for war service was actually employed in a skilled manual trade and receiving instruction therein with a view to becoming a journeyman, and who was in England, Wales, and Ireland under the age of 21, and in Scotland under 23, at the time of being called up. Such apprenticeship may have been either (a) indentured; (b) written; (c) formal; (d) tacit; or (e) customary.The term &quot;apprenticeship&quot; shall not include any period after the recognised apprenticeship is finished, and during which a man is counted as an improver. It is not limited to those who acquire their trade in a single firm, but may cover those who work for a number of employers during their period of training.(b.) Skilled Manual Trades.By skilled manual trades are meant the trades set forth in the accompanying schedule, and any other trades which the Minister of Labour may hereinafter add to such a schedule. In preparing such a schedule, the Minister of Labour shall have regard to the following consideration : &quot; That it was customary before the war that a person before being admitted as a journeyman should normally be required to undergo a course of training in the work of the trade or processes at which he was to be employed as a journeyman, for a period definitely fixed in advance, and of not less than three years&apos; duration, and that such training should terminate not earlier than the commencement of the 20th year of age.&quot;2. State assistance shall be confined to skilled trades, as defined in clause 1 (6), in which a scheme of training has been agreed upon by the Joint Industrial Council,on the assumption that all skilled trades avail themselves of the scheme. . From the evidence available, however, it is clear that this assumption is not likely to be realised in practice. In the printing and painting trades the employers have already agreed to pay discharged apprentices three-fourths of the district rate, so that these trades would not be eligible for assistance. In the shipbuilding trade arrangements have been made for apprentices who enlisted before the 1st January. 1918, and in the case of several other trades a considerable number of firms will probably prefer to pay the whole cost rather than submit to the State inspection involved in the scheme. Moreover, it is probable that many of the apprentices will prefer to take up work of a semi-skilled type, which will bring them an immediately higher rate of pay, rather than continue their training. It is not improbable therefore that the number who will actually avail themselves of the scheme may be nearer 100,000 than 200,000.As regards cost, it will be seen from Appendix (B) that the total net cost for 200,000 apprentices should not exceed 6,000,000i., exclusive of administrative expenses, and the cost for 100,000 would be half this sum. The administrative expenses are estimated at 300,0001. for 200,000 apprentices, and 200,000/. for 100,000 apprentices.The question is, as I have said, one of immediate urgency, because apprentices are being discharged from the army every week, and are unable to resume their training for the reasons explained above. The Ministry of Pensions lay great stress on the need for introducing the scheme at the earliest possible moment. I therefore propose, if the War Cabinet approves, to include clauses in the Bill providing for the out-of-work donation for demobilised soldiers, giving the Ministry of Labour the necessary powers for putting the scheme proposed into operation, and I hope that it may be possible to introduce and pass this Bill during the autumn Session. -GEO. H. ROBERTS.September 4, 1918.
fInterim Industrial Reconstruction Committee, or other bodies representing the employers and workpeople in the particular trade in question, and approved by the the Minister of Labour. No grant shall be paid to any apprentice in any trade, except in accordance with such a scheme. Schemes involving attendance at a technical school or involving training subject to inspection by an educational authority shall also be approved by the Government Department for Education concerned.3. Such persons shall be eligible for a grant who have served in His Majesty&apos;s forces at any time during the present war, and who can prove to the satisfaction of the Minister of Labour that they have prior to their enlistment been apprentices as defined above.4. No grant shall be paid to any apprentice until he has reached the age at which he would normally have completed his apprenticeship, provided that in no case shall such age exceed 23 years in Scotland and 21 years elsewhere.5. No grant in respect of training in a factory or workshop shall be paid to any apprentice who was in his last year of apprenticeship when called up for service with the colours.6. No scheme of training shall be approved unless the unexpired period of apprenticeship shall have been reduced by at least one-third, subject to the conditions that the period to be served (if any) from the time of his return until he reached the age at which he would normally have completed his apprenticeship shall not count, and unless a further reduction shall be made to the satisfaction of the Minister of Labour for the service (if any) of the apprentice at his trade in a technical unit whilst under the colours.7. It shall be a condition of any scheme being approved (see clause 2), that the employer shall undertake to pay in wages to the apprentice during his resumed apprenticeship not less than seven-twelfths during the first twelve months, and not less than two-thirds during the second twelve months (if any) of the fixed wage as herein-after defined: The fixed wage shall be the standard rate of a journeyman current in the particular district, plus the war bonus (if any) current in the particular district for that class of work.If during the period of training a change is made either in the standard rate of a journeyman current in the district or in the war bonus (if any) current in the district for that class of work, the Minister of Labour shall have power to vary the fixed wage.8. Under any scheme the weekly sum payable by the State shall be the difference between the weekly wage payable by the employer under clause 7, and three-quarters during the first twelve months, and five-sixths during the second twelve months (if any) of the fixed wage.9. This weekly grant shall be payable to the apprentice from the time that he has reached the age at which he would normally have completed his apprenticeship (see section 4) until the time that his apprenticeship has expired under an approved scheme, provided that in no case shall the weekly grant be payable for a period exceeding-two years.10. Where in the opinion of the Minister it is desirable that the apprentice should receive whole-time training in a technical school, a maintenance grant not exceeding the sum of 27s. 6d. per week may be paid to such apprentices for a maximum period of forty weeks in lieu of the wages and State assistance as laid down in clauses 7 and 8 for such period, and where a part of the apprenticed time is spent in a technical school, a maintenance grant in lieu of the weekly sum payable by the State under clause 8 may be paid proportionate to the amount of time so spent for a period not exceeding one year, a proportionate reduction being made in the wages as set out in clauses 7 and 8.11. The Ministry of Labour shall be empowered to pay such fees as may be approved by the Board of Education or other Government Department regulating fees for apprentices attending technical schools under an approved scheme.12. The Minister of Labour shall have power at any period during the course of training to discontinue or vary any such grants, fees, or maintenance allowances, if in his opinion the training which is being given is not of a satisfactory nature. Any such action in connection with schemes involving attendance at a technical school or involving training subject to inspection by an education authority shall also be approved by the Government Department for Education concerned.

The total number of apprentices between the ages of 14 and 20 in August 1914;(b.) The proportion of the total number of such apprentices who will return fromthe army and qualify for grants ; (c.) The average number of weeks for which grants will be paid; and (d.) The total cost of the scheme.2. In preparing these estimates the following assumptions have been made : (i.) That the war and the subsequent period of demobilisation will last roughlyfive years, and will be completed by the 4th August, 1919 ; (ii.) That the enlistment of apprentices from Ireland is negligible and can be leftout of the calculation ; (iii.) That the  number under 14 in  August 1914 who  were   subsequentlyapprenticed may also be neglected; (iv.) That all apprentices between 20 and 21 in August 1914 are excluded as beingin their last year of apprenticeship (Appendix A, Clause 5); and (v.) That every apprentice who enlisted did so at the earliest possible age,that is, at the age of 18, or at the outbreak of the war, if already overthat age.(A.) Total Number of Apprentices between 14 and 20 in August 1914.The trades likelv to come under this scheme* seem to fall into four classes : Apprenticeship Trades, recruited wholly or mainly from apprentices ; Partial Apprenticeship Trades, having a considerable number of, but recruited only partly from, apprentices;* It is known that in many trades few or no boys under this age have been apprenticed, at any rate since the ead of 1914; and the amount of grant payable in respect of them will in any case be low.Some trades are included here in addition to those in the schedule of skilled occupations in Appendix (B), as the question of their inclusion in the schedule is not yet decided.P
(0.) Average Number of Weeks for which Grants will be Paid.The average number of weeks has been arrived at as follows on the basis of conditions outlined in the memorandum : Age in August 1914.	Period of Service List till August 1919 and remaining to be served after the Age of 21.	Average Period of Grant, based on Eeduction of one-third in the Time to be Served after 21.19-20   .........	1-2 years.	52 weeks.18-19   ...	2-3	V      &quot;  87   &quot;,,17-18   ...

An addition of 3 per cent. (1 per cent, per annum) was then made to allow for growth of population up to 1914.   The figures are as follows : Number of Apprentices between the Ages of 14 and 20.1911-Apprenticeship trades ... ... ... ... ... ...   200,000Partial apprenticeship trades    ... ... ... ... ...   116,000Slight apprenticeship trades    ...        ...        ...        ...        ...    26,000Doubtful trades ... ... ... ... ... ...     17,000Total    ... ... ... ... ... ...   359,000Add 3 per cent, for growth of population      ... ... ... ...    11,0001914: Total       ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   370,000A similar estimate based on the 28 returns and the. Earnings and Hours Enquiry (1906-7) of the Board of Trade, yielded a total of from 380,000 to 400,000 apprentices of all ages, Ireland being included. Other estimates place the figures somewhat higher.(B.) Proportion of the Total Number of such Apprentices who will Return fromthe Army and Qualify for Grants.From the various estimates that have been made the following deductions from the total number of apprentices may safely be assumed : &apos;Per. Cent.Those who did not join the army owing- either to physical unfitness or to exemption...   30 Death, disablement, change of occupation, and emigration, calculated on the basis ofone-third of the total enlistment   ... ... ... ... ... ...   22^Service in technical units    ... ... ... ... ...   &apos;     ... j..    2\Total        ... ... ... ... ... ...   55In view of the heavy fighting of the present summer the percentage for casualties, &amp;c, may in fact be higher, and that for rejections and exemptions lower, as those given in the table are based on earlier estimates.The total qualifying will thus be 45 per cent, of 370,000 or about 170,000 ; and, after making all allowances for higher estimates, and for the effect of assumptions ii, iii, and iv, about 200,000 may be taken as the outside maximum to qualify. Reasons are given in the memorandum for suggesting that the actual number may be nearer 100,000 than 200,000.
.. - This average will be reduced owing to the fact.that many apprentices delayed their enlistment before the passing of the first Military Service Act, or received exemption for a time subsequently. Thus an apprentice of 18 who delayed for a year would receive grant for 69 instead of 104 weeks. Such delays will also bring some within the last year of their apprenticeship and disqualify them altogether (Appendix (A), clause 5). The effect of such reduction may be estimated to bring the average period down to sixty-five weeks.   The financial results of this are dealt with in section (d) below.(D.) Total Cost of the Scheme.The maximum rate payable by the State under the scheme is one-sixth of the standard rate in the trade or district concerned for the whole period for which grant is paid. In the vast majority of cases the weekly rate of wages will range from 40s. to 60s. For the purpose of this estimate, therefore, the average wage is taken at 50s. and the grant at 8s. Ad. per week.On the basis of the table in section (c) the average grant per man will then be : Grant per Man.Age in August 1914      s.   d.19-20 ... ... ... ... ... ...      22   0   018-19 17-18 16-17 15-16 14-1536   0 043   0 043   0 03,6   0 022   0 033 15 0The total cost for 200,000 apprentices will then be about 6,750,000Z.The effect of the reduction of the average period from eighty-one weeks to sixty-five, referred to in the last section, would be taken to make the cost per man.27Z., and the total cost 5,400,000Z., a reduction of 1,350,000Z.   -On the other side allowance must be made for the increased cost of technical training, which in the case of full-time training will amount to an additional cost of about 1Z. per week for forty weeks. From this a reduction must be made for more favourable conditions obtained from the employer in regard to subsequent training in the workshop, and the net increase in cost may be put at SOL per man. There is also an addition to be made for those who obtain part-time training. It is not anticipated that any technical training will be given in more than a minority of cases. Full-time training for forty weeks for 10 per cent, of the total (20,000) should cover both whole and part-time training in technical schools. This would involve an additional cost of some 600,0001.The total net cost for 200,000 apprentices, therefore, should not exceed 6,000,000Z., exclusive of administrative expenses.   This is shown by the iollowing summary, whichalso gives the total next cost for 150,000 and 100,000 apprentices.-,   ...    . ; :   -i :..    . :  , . ., . -. .

The additional cost for administrative expenses must be added to the above total. It is difficult to form any accurate estimate on this head, as much will depend on the amount of State inspection required. As an outside figure 300,000Z. may be given as the estimated cost for 200,000 apprentices, while the cost for 100,000 might be 200,000Z,
