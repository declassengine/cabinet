SECRET AND PERSONALSECRET.NOTE BY Mr. CHAMBERLAIN.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a Report by the Board of Inland Revenue on the Land Values Duties.The subject will certainly be raised during the Budget debates, and the Government must come to a decision as to the attitude that they will adopt.I do not think that we should have any chance of carrying legislation on the subject in the present state of opinion in the House of Commons. Any attempt to do so would inevitably revive the controversies of 1909-10, and would probably cause a sharp division in the Coalition. A careful enquiry by a Select Committee, bringing out all the facts, might afford material for agreed action next year, and I would propose that we either offer such an enquiry or agree to it if asked, as I think we probably should be, to grant it.It is not easy to see any solution of the problems raised, but not solved, by the Land Values Duties. As a means of raising revenue they are at present useless, and I do not see how they can be made effective without serious injustice. But the valuation itself should be maintained whatever the decision on the taxes, and one object of the enquiry should be to secure that it is made on right lines.(Initialled)      A.

G-239.WAR CABINET.LAND VALUES DUTIES AND THE VALUATION UNDER PART I OFTHE FINANCE (1909-10) ACT, 1910.Board of Inland Revenue, Somerset House.Chancellor of the Exchequer,WE submit for your consideration a memorandum on the subject of the Land Values Duties and the Valuation under Part I of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.&quot; (Signed)     N. F. WARREN FISHER. H. P. HAMILTON.NOTE BY THE BOARD OF INLAND REVENUE.1. The object of this Memorandum is to set forth as briefly as possible the present position of the Valuation and the Land Values Duties prescribed by the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, and to examine the reasons which have led to their present unsatisfactory state, and the various questions which have to be considered in this connection at the termination of the war.(A.) The Present Position of the Valuation and the Causes leadingthereto.2. Under the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, the Board of Inland Revenue are required to make a valuation of aR land in the United Kingdom as at 30th April, 1909.3. In connection with the work af completing this valuation, three main stages may be distinguished: (a.) The making of the separate valuations.(b.) The issue of the valuations to the owners and other persons interested in the land.(c.) The settlement of objections and appeals entered against the valuations.4. The general difficulties which have been encountered by the Board in con-nection with the work of valuation may be summarised as follows: (a.) The necessity of assessing and collecting the Land Values Duties (two of which were based upon the values to be fixed in the general valuation) simultaneously with the process of making the valuation, thus diverting the time and energies of the staff from the work of valuation to work in connection with the duties. &apos;(6.) The unusual nature of the values which have to be ascertained under the Statute, values of a completely new character, with which neither expert valuers nor the public were familiar.(c.) The prolonged and organised opposition which was offered by the public and inevitably led to legal, and technical points of all kinds being raised against the valuations, even when these would, if sustained, be of but doubtful benefit to the taxpayer.Further, there were difficulties of a technical character which experience has shown to be innate in the provisions of the Act itself.   These tended to create delay [1526] B
and prevent an early completion of the work (e.g., the determination of the unit of valuation, minus site value, deductions in respect of value attributable to land appropriated for roads, &amp;c).5. In spite of these difficulties, some of which continue and will delay the final completion of the valuation if it is to be undertaken, steady progress was made with the valuation up to&quot; 1914.6. In February of that year, however, a decision of the High Courts known as the Scrutton judgment laid, down that the basis adopted by the Board in valuing land in which an agricultural element was present, was incorrect. As the basis indicated as correct by the Court was one to which it was impracticable to give effect, the only course was to pass legislation reinstating the Board&apos;s interpretation of the law. Legislation with this object was introduced in the Revenue Bill of 1914, . which was dropped and none has been reintroduced during the war. The result has been that since February 1914 valuations of land in which an element of agri-cultural value was present could no longer be issued to owners and others.7. Moreover, Mr. Pretyman, on behalf of the Land Union, represented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Lloyd George) shortly after the outbreak of war that in many cases the man (i.e., landowners, their agents, &amp;c.) who had the necessary information to deal with the provisional valuations that were being served were absent on military service, and asked that the service of valuation should be suspended for the time being, and that the period during which notice of objection or appeal against a valuation could be made should be extended. The Chancellor did not consent to suspend the service of valuations, but agreed that in the case of all pro-visional valuations served within sixty days prior to the date of mobilisation, or served after that date, the time for giving notice of objection should be extended until sixty days subsequent to a date to be notified thereafter. No such date has been fixed. (See Appendix A.)8. The present position of the valuation of land in Great Britain* is as follows:-The making of the valuations has been practically completed; but those in which an element of agricultural value is present in the land have been made upon a basis which the Court has pronounced to be bad.The issue of the valuations to owners and others interested in the land has been practically completed with the exception of those made after February 1914, in which an element of agricultural value is present.The settlement of objections and appeals against the valuations has been com-pleted in about 60 per cent, of the cases; but these so-called settled cases contain a certain number of valuations made upon the basis which has been condemned by the Court. The remaining 40 per cent, represent the (few) cases in which valuations have not been issued, and those (the great majority) in which the valuations, though issued, are still open, either because the objections and appeals have not yet been disposed of, or because no date has yet been fixed prior to which notice of objection or appeal must be given (see paragraph 7).9. The valuation of minerals under the provisions of the Act proceeds upon a different basis to that of the valuation of the surface. Minerals which were being worked or were in lease at 30th April, 1909, do not fall to be valued until they cease to be worked or leased. As regards minerals, however, which were not being worked or in lease at that date, the Act provides that the owner is to be given an opportunity of making a return of their nature and value. If he makes such a return a valuation has to he made by the Board and settled with the owner in the ordinary course pre-scribed for the settlement of valuation of the surface; if lie returns no value or makes no return the value of the minerals is automatically fixed at nil.In spite of very difficult problems arising in connection with the valuation of minerals (e.g., the unit of valuation, the allocation of value as between surface and minerals, the valuation of minerals under copyhold land), the settlement of mineral valuations was proceeding regularly up to the outbreak of war.In many of the cases, however, which still remain to be dealt with, a satisfactory solution of these and other difficulties has still to be found, and judicial decisions and drastic legislation will almost certainly be required on several points. Further, mineral valuations afford a fruitful ground for raising technical and legal points on appeal if the owner or his advisers are so disposed.* The position in Ireland is different and need not be considered in this memorandum.
Moreover, under the decision given in the House of Lords in the Foran case, it would appear to be necessary, in order to comply with the provisions of the statute, to give all owners who have not made a return in respect of their minerals a further opportunity of stating the nature and value of these minerals. If this is to be carried1 out, it will involve a general issue of Forms of Return throughout the country, somewhat on the analogy of the issue of the famous Form 4.(B.) The Present Position of the Land Values Duties and the Causesleading thereto.10. It is proposed under this heading to examine the position of three of the four Land Values Duties the Undeveloped Land Duty, the Increment Value Duty, and the Reversion Duty. (The Mineral Rights Duty is referred to in paragraph 50 below.)Of these duties the assessment and collection of Undeveloped Land Duty is wholby, and of the Increment Value Duty and Reversion Duty partially, suspended.11. Before examining the particular difficulties which arise in connection with each of these duties, the more general causes contributing to their failure from the administrative point of view may be indicated.The basis for assessment of the Undeveloped Land Duty and the Increment Value Duty is the valuation as at 30th. April, 1909. The fact that this valuation was not ascertained before, but had to be undertaken concurrently with, the assess-ment and collection of these duties rendered administration of the duties exceedingly difficult; and this difficulty, which still exists, becomes more accentuated as time elapses and the original valuation is still uncompleted.The complexity of these duties, especially of the Increment Value Duty, is such that it is impossible for the taxpayer, except in the simplest cases, to form even an approximate estimate of what duty he will be called upon to pay; and when he has received the assessment, it is impossible in very many cases for him to grasp how it is computed without incurring the expense of employing expert assistance. This consideration in itself is bound to make a tax more than usually unpopular and to render its administration difficult.The organised opposition to the valuation has been extended also to the assess-ment and collection of the duties. The smooth administration of taxation must to a great extent depend upon the consent of the public to bear the taxes imposed upon it. In the case of the Land Values Duties such consent has never been apparent on the part of the bulk of the taxpayers affected.12. The Undeveloped Land Duty. (Total net yield to 31st December, 1918^  412,000.)Since February 1914 the assessment and collection of this duty has been wholly suspended in consequence of the judicial decision which laid dowm that the basis of valuation adopted by the Board in the case of land in which there was an agricultural element was bad. As has already been pointed out, the basis indicated by the Courts was not one to which in practice effect could be given.As a further consequence the re-valuation of land for Undeveloped Land Duty purposes prescribed by section 28 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, which was due to be undertaken in 1914, has not been carried out.13. Moreover, in so far as the duty has been operative, it has failed to achieve its object, viz., to tax land which was ripe for building, but which was held up for other purposes. &apos;In practice most of the land which is ripe escapes, and the tendency is for the duty to fall chiefly on ripening land round towns and cities, which for the present is not required for building and which is used, and properly used, for agriculture, but has attained a capital value in excess of its agricultural value on account of its prospective requirements for urban purposes.The causes of this are to be found in the exemptions and allowances granted undler the Act principally the exemption of land used in connection with busi-nesses, the exemption of land occupied together with a dwelling-house, and the allowance for expenditure on roads and sewers.14. Apart from these drawbacks, the duty has proved both difficult and expensive to administer.The Act grants many exemptions and allowances, the applicability of several of which depends in individual cases largely on facts only in the knowledge of the
owner, but which must be ascertained and allowed by the Board, whether evidence of right to such reliefs is furnished or not. The applicability of these may vary from month to month, and constant inspection and knowledge of local circum-stances and conditions become almost essential.The allowances, moreover, often ^affect only part of a separately valued here-ditament, and in these cases there arises the necessity to apportion the site value  requiring in strict law a formal apportionment to be served upon the owner with a fixed period for giving notice of objection and a further period for giving notice of appeal.15. Experience has shown that a tax of this character does not lend itself to administration as a centralised tax.The duty involves a very large number of assessments each year, the amount of each assessment being small, varying from 6q. upwards, and consequently its collection requires a very large staff, the cost of which, together with the time and labour involved, is quite disproportionate to the yield of the duty.16. The Increment Value Duty. (Total net yield to 31st December, 1918^  447,000.)The assessment and collection of this duty is partially suspended in conse-quence of the non-completion of the original valuation, which forms the basis for the computation of liability, and of a Ministerial pledge arising out of the Lumsden case, under which cases in which there is no genuine increase in site value are sus-pended pending legislation^ (see Appendix B).17. No action has been taken towards the assessment and collection of the periodical Increment Value Duty in the case of property held by bodies corporate or unincorporated This, under section 6 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, was due to be undertaken in 1914. Even before the war it was not considered practicable to undertake this task whilst the original valuation was incomplete, and a proposal to postpone it until 1919 was included in the Revenue Bills of 1913 and 1914, both of which were dropped. During the war it has of course been even more impractic-able.   The amount of money involved is negligible.18. The complexity of the Increment Value Duty and the consequent difficulty of administration, owing to the^ inability of the taxpayer to forecast the amount he may be called upon to pay, have been referred to above. Administration is further rendered difficult because in the case of a very large, number of assessments it is necessary to make difficult mathematical calculations and apportionments both of increment value which arose and of duty paid or deemed to have been paid on previous &quot; occasions,&quot; and to apply highly scientific principles for ascertaining the amount of duty payable. All this tends to unavoidable delay in disposing of cases and the delay is increased by the necessity of keeping accurate records, and of constant inspection of areas and boundaries of the land.19. The -necessity of apportioning the. site value of an original hereditament when a portion of that hereditament is the subject of charge is in itself a fruitful source of difficulty. The problem of apportioning such value as at April 1909 some eight or more years after that date is sufficiently obvious, and is accentuated by the fact that the&apos; Act gives little indication of the method, to be adopted. As time elapses, constant apportionments and reapportionments and amalgamations of previous apportionments are multiplied and lead to still further complications.20. The scheme of the duty is such that it enables the taxpayer if he so desires to raise on any assessment a number of difficult and contentious points. The basis of each assessment is a valuation arrived at by reference to the consideration passing on the &quot;occasion.&quot; It is consequently possible to raise, on practically every &quot; occasion,&quot; some of the complicated valuation problems, which have to be faced in connection with the settlement of the original valuation; and this difficulty is particularly acute, in connection with mineral valuations.21. Other problems which constantly are raised in connection with the duty are to be found in the creation of fixed charges, in the ascertainment of site value of flats, offices, &amp;c, and in questions arising in mineral areas.   Each of these in* The. Board under a decision of the Courts in a subsequent case-known as tin- Plymouth case might have proceeded to assess and collect duty in a type of case which they had hitherto treated as coming within this pledge; but by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. McKenna) they refrained from taking any steps. If the duty is continued, it will be a matter for consideration whether the legislation exempting Lumsden cases should cover Plymouth cases as well.
itself tends to delay the settlement of liability and clog the machinery of administra-tion.   Cumulatively, their effect is overwhelming.22. The annual increment value duty charged upon minerals which are com-prised in a mining lease, is one which except in a limited number of cases produces the most inequitable results, and yields no appreciable amount of duty. Drastic amendment is necessary, if this is to be rendered workable.23. The Reversion Duty.-(Total net yield to 31st December, 1918 =  254,000.)This duty has been for some time partially in abeyance in consequence of the decision of the Courts in the Camden case. The principle involved in this case has been the subject of further litigation, and although a decision favourable to the Crown was given in the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeal have recently decided adversely to the Crown&apos;s contention. There is of course a right of appeal to the House of Lords, and if it is decided to continue the duty, an appeal could be entered within six months after the decision of the Court of Appeal. Mean-while collection of the duty must continue to remain in abeyance.If the question at issue is ultimately decided against the Crown, the duty  failing remedial legislation may be regarded as killed. If the Crown is successful or remedial legislation obtained the annual yield to be expected from the duty may he put at about  130,000.Some difficulties of a technical character are found in connection with this duty, which will have to be. set right by legislation if the duty is continued.24. It will be seen from the foregoing remarks that these three Land Values Duties, which have been in force for over eight years, have resulted in a negligible yield of revenue, have been received with widespread hostility by the public, and have been found extremely difficult and laborious to work even in a partial manner. They are at present either wholly or partially in suspense.25. Moreover, the hostility of the taxpayer in this connection has reacted unfavourably on his attitude in the sphere of the other taxes under the management of the Board of Inland Revenue; and it may safely be assumed that any attempt now made to resuscitate these duties would prove a considerable handicap to the Depart-ment at a time when it is responsible for raising an enormous revenue from tax-payers, who now that the war is over are as a body becoming more critical and less disposed to pay.(C.) Necessary Legislation.26. Whether the valuation and the duties are continued, or not, legislation will be required.If they are continued, the legislation required will be considerable in amount and of a complex and highly technical character; if they are discontinued, the amount of legislation required will be small and comparatively simple.In either case legislation will be* necessary (inter alia) with reference to (a^ certain statutory functions which have had to be suspended through force of circum-stance (e.g., the revaluation of undeveloped land in 1914), and (b) the question of arrears and possibly repayment (see (E) below).(a) Legislation required, if the Valuation and Duties are continued:27. Legislation amending the Land Values Duties was introduced in the Revenue Bills of 1913 and 1914, both of which were dropped. No further action has been taken during the war (as an element in the party truce).28. Experience has shown that the legislation proposed in the Revenue Bill of 1914 would be in itself quite insufficient to render the completion of the valuation practicable and to enable the duties to be worked. If any amending legislation is to be introduced, it must be of such a comprehensive character as will dispose of all the major and at least the bulk of the minor difficulties.29. Valuation. Legislation must be passed, on the lines of clause 2 of the Revenue Bill 1914, reinstating the basis adopted by the Board in valuing land in which an agricultural element is present. Other points affecting the basis of valuation will also require to be considered in detail when legislation is introduced.Legislation will also be required in connection with the valuation of minerals. This will be of a highly technical character, and will require careful consideration.[15261 C
30. Even if the legislation suggested in the preceding paragraph is passed, some considerable, time must elapse before the valuation can be finally completed, owing to the necessity of disposing of objections and appeals against the valuation. How long this would take would depend largely on the attitude of the public and the amount of organised opposition to the valuation and the duties that would be met.31. Undeveloped Land Duty. As indicated above, this duty is one which does not lend itself to administration as a centralised tax.If, however, it were decided to continue it^ no progress could in any case be made with its assessment and collection until legislation had been obtained(a) reinstating the basis adopted by the Hoard prior to the Scrutton judgmentin valuing land in which an element of agricultural value is present; and(b) providing for a revaluation of undeveloped land for Undeveloped LandDuty purposes in (say) 1920, as it would be manifestly absurd to assess duty in future by reference to a valuation made as at 30th April, 1909.Moreover, unless the difficulty referred to in paragraph 11, of undertaking concurrently the work of valuation and assessment is to be repeated, provision would have to be made that Undeveloped Land Duty should not be charged until the revaluation has been completed.These considerations lead to the conclusion that the only possible course would be entirely to suspend the operation of the duty pending revaluation and then to make a fresh start. It will be seen (paragraphs 40 to 49) that the position as to the arrears of this duty strongly reinforces the case for suspension.32. Continuance also involves a drastic revision of the exemptions and allow-ances which the taxpayer can claim under sections 16 and 17 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, if in future the tax is to achieve its object (see paragraph 13).33. Provision will be required as well to give the Board power to make informal apportionments of an original unit of valuation as may be necessary without being under the obligation of serving a formal apportionment upon the owner, with the subsequent opportunities for objection and appeal.34. Increment Value Duty. Legislation must be introduced on the lines of clause 4 of the Revenue Bill of 1914 to carry out the promise made by Ministers to remedy the situation arising out of the Lumsden case (see paragraph 16 and Appendix B).In addition, legislation of a highly technical character will be required on various points, including those which are referred to above.The annual increment value duty on minerals, if it is not repealed, will require drastic alteration.Provision must also be made to postpone the periodical Increment Value Duty on property in the hands of corporate and unincorporate bodies.35. It may here, however, be repeated in connection with this duty and the Undeveloped Land Duty, that even if the suggested legislation is passed, the same fundamental difficulty will continue for some time, viz., the concurrent tasks of assessing and collecting the duties and of determining the valuations, which con-stitutc the basis of liability. So long as these two tasks have to be undertaken simultaneously difficulty and delay are inevitable.36. The Reversion Duty. If an appeal to the House of Lords is lodged in the case recently decided by the Court of Appeal and the Crown is successful, a small amount of legislation of a technical character in addition to that contained in the Revenue Bill of 1914 is likely to be necessary.If an appeal is not lodged, or if the Crown is unsuccessful, legislation confirming the Crown&apos;s contention will also be required as well as the technical legislation referred to above.(b) Legislation required, if the Valuation and Duties are discontinued. 37. Legislation would be required  (1.) repealing the Land Values Duties;(2.) enacting that no further action should be taken towards the completion of the valuation;(3.) enabling the valuation, so far as completed, to be made available for public information, if it were decided that this should be done;
s -      -7(4.) continuing the machinery under which particulars of conveyances, leases, &amp;c, of land are presented to the Inland Revenue Department. This would enable the Valuation Office to keep up to date its record of owner-ship, tenure of land, current market values, &amp;c, so that it would be in a position to undertake a new up-to-date valuation, if required.m) Question of repealing the Duties, but completing the Valuation.38. The possible courses for dealing with the valuation and the duties examined above have proceeded upon the assumption that both will either be con-tinned or discontinued. If the duties are continued the valuation&apos;upon which they are based must of course be continued. It would, however, be practicable to discontinue the duties but complete the valuation.39. But once the duties were repealed, the valuation as contemplated by the Act would cease to have any fiscal significance or at this date to serve any other useful purpose. Even if a new scheme of land values taxation were introduced in the near future, the completion of the valuation would not prove of any material assist-ance. Any new scheme, whether imperial or local, would have to proceed upon an up-to-date valuation and not upon one that dates back to 1909. Moreover, the Valuation Office has already in its possession the records of tenure, ownership boun-daries of land, &amp;c, up-to-date, and if the machinery by which this information is obtained is continued, as suggested in paragraph 37 above, the Department will in the future have at their disposal the bulk of the material upon which to commence the work of a new and up-to-date, valuation.(E.)-Arrears.40. TJie suspension in whole or part of the three duties has resulted in  he accumulation of large arrears; and the question of their treatment is one that has to be faced whether the duties are continued or not.41. Undeveloped Land Duty. The assessed  arrears outstanding at 31st 1 December, 1918, amounted to  320,000: in addition there are considerable amounts of unassessed arrears.So far as duty has been assessed but not collected before the Scrutton judgment was delivered in February 1914, it has been impossible to proceed to collection, as the Court decided that the basis of the valuation on which the assessments rested was incorrect. For the same reason no progress has been made since that date with assessment in cases of unassessed liability arising either before or after that judgment.42. Under section 19 of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, no Undeveloped Land Duty can be assessed more than three years after the expiration of the year for which it is charged. Thus no duty could be assessed in the year 1919/20 in respect of a liability arising prior to the year 1916/17, and the persons liable in such cases on whom no assessment has yet been made must in any event escape. *On the other hand, Undeveloped Land Duty when once assessed is payable at any time by the &quot;owner of the land for the time being,&quot; this phrase in the Law Officers&quot; view connoting the owner at the moment when the Inland Revenue Depart-ment proceeds to collect the duty, notwithstanding that the land may not have been his when the liability first arose. Theoretically therefore duty, when once assessed, can always be collected, however old the liability.Thus, as regards arrears arising prior to 1916/17, the position during the next financial year will be (on the basis of the law as it stands at present) that the unassessed portion will automatically disappear and that the assessed portion can in theory be collected. But it would seem indefensible in the circumstances apart from practical difficulties to discriminate between taxpayers, according as their liability to duty happens to have, or not to have, been assessed. It follows that both assessed and unassessed arrears arising prior to 1916/17 must be given up.43. There remains the question&apos; of the arrears (all unassessed) arising from 1916/17 onwards.The steps that would be necessary to resuscitate the duty have been explained in paragraphs 31 to 33 above; the Scrutton judgment wouid have to. be -reversed* It i* assumed that, the qnestion of extending the period of three years need not be considered, as it would mean placing the taxpayer in a worse position than he is under the existing law.
and a revaluation made of all undeveloped land. Similar measures would be necessary before any progress could be made with the unassessed arrears, the alter-native being for Parliament to authorise the assessment and collection of duty on the basis of the official valuation as at 30th April, 1909 (which is still in many cases not yet finally settled), notwithstanding the provision made in the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, that such a revaluation should take place every five years.If it were decided to repeal the duty, it is presumed that legislation, on the lines indicated, solely for the purpose of the collection of arrears, is out of the question. If on the other hand the duty is to be continued only as from a date which would allow- the completion of a revaluation, say, some date in 1920, not only would this revaluation have to be made, but another ad hoc revaluation would be necessary as at (say) some date in 1916, in order to clear up all unassessed arrears arising between 1st April, 1916, and the date of suspension of the duty. It is submitted that any such course is impracticable.The conclusion is that all arrears of the Undeveloped Land Duty must be abandoned.44. If, as suggested above, it is decided to give up all arrears of Undeveloped Land Duty, the, position of those persons who happen to have paid this tax in respect of the years 1913/14 inclusive must be considered. Mr. J. King, on the 11th April, 1916, asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether in consideration of many persons having paid for those )-ears. it was intended &quot; to demand payment of those who have been served with demands but who have not paid, or to refund payments made to those who have paid.&quot; The Chancellor (Mr. McKenna) in reply undertook that there should be no eventual discrimination. (Copy of question and answer set out in Appendix C to this memorandum.)In the event of the abandonment of arrears, this pledge may very well give rise to a demand for the refund of all Undeveloped Land Duty paid, amounting to some  400,000, which would be difficult, if not impossible, to resist.The amount of duty involved in an assessment is usually so small that the number of cases that would be involved in repayment of  400,000 is extremely large; and the task of making repayment would be enormous, even if so long a period had not elapsed since the duty was paid. If the demand is conceded, a possible course might perhaps be that repayment should only be made at the request of the &quot;tax-payer. Many taxpayers might not trouble to make a claim, having regard to the small amount of money involved.45. Increment Value Duty. The assessed arrears outstanding at the 31st December, 1918, amounted to  146,000; there is also a very large number of unassessed arrears.The arrears fall into the following classes (which overlap) : (1.) Lumsden cases (see paragraph 16) on which, by Ministerial instructions,no action has been taken pending the promised legislation. (2.) Cases covered by the concession contained in the Revenue Bill, 1914,exempting small owners. (3.) Cases in which the non-completion of the original valuation rendered afinal assessment impossible, but in which a provisional assessment eitherhas or could have been made.These comprise: (a.) Cases in which objections to the original valuation are not yetfinally disposed of. (b.) Cases in which notice of objection to the original valuationmay still be given (see paragraph 7). (c.) Cases affected by the Scrutton judgment.(4.) Cases in which duty is irrecoverable e.g., pwing to lapse of time. (5.) Cases in which coUection is proceeding normally.(6.) Mineral cases depending on valuations not yet made or not yet settled owing to the impracticability of finding a reasonable basis of valuation.46. It is assumed that whether the duties are continued or not, no further action would be taken in regard to the arrears coming within the first two classes, seeing that if the war had not occurred, legislation would presumably have been passed declaring that no charge arose in these cases.
As regards cases falling within 3 (a) and 3 (6), there is no reason at any rate in theory why the necessary original and &quot; occasion &apos;-&apos; valuations should not be completed in due course and the duty assessed and collected. If it were decided not to complete the original valuation, it would be a matter for consideration whether it would be desirable to complete it so far as necessary for the purpose of clearing up some inconsiderable arrears of Increment Value Duty.It would be impossible to proceed with cases within 3 (c) unless legislation were obtained reversing the Scrutton judgment. If such amending legislation were obtained it would theoretically be possible to assess and collect the duty.Cases falling within classes (4) and (5) present no difficulty, but the bulk of the mineral arrears (class (6) ) would have to be abandoned, inasmuch as if the valuation and the duties were to continue and to apply to minerals, the provisions relating to minerals would require to be completely remodelled.47. Here again, in cases covered by class (1), the question of the freatment of persons who have paid duty must be considered. It will be seen from Appendix B that soon after the outbreak of war the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Lloyd George) instructed the Inland Revenue Department to hold in abeyance cases in which the relief claimed by the taxpayer is such as would have been granted under the legislation promised by the Prime Minister (Mr. Asquith) on the 23rd July, 1914. This legislation was intended to apply to &quot;occasions&quot; arising since 7th May, 1913 (thef date of introduction of the first legislation dealing with the Lumsden case, viz., the Revenue Bill, 1913). Subsequently pressure was brought to bear on the Government to suspend action .in all Lumsden cases, and&apos; ultimately the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. McKenna), by letter to Sir Ernest Pollock, dated 10th May, 1916 (see Appendix B), agreed that no action should be taken whether the duty became payable before or after the 7th May, 1913. If then all arrears in Lumsden cases (and possibly in Plymouth cases see footnote to para-graph 16) are given up, it would seem difficult to resist a demand, if it arose, for repayment of all duty paid in these cases since the inception of the duty. Much the same practical difficulties of repayment would arise as in the case of Undeveloped Land Duty, and it is suggested that the same solution should be adopted, viz.. to make repayment only on application by the taxpayer.48. Reversion Duty. The assessed arrears outstanding at 31st December, 1918, amounted to  83*,000; there are also large unassessed arrears amounting to some  500,000.The arrears fall into the following classes: (1.) Camden cases which are held up pending a final decision of the Courts in the case recently decided adversely to the Crown by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 23).(2.) Cases covered by the concessions contained in clause 11 of the Revenue Bill, 1914, relating to leases granted to charities or to existing lessees.(3.) Irrecoverable arrears.(4.) Cases m which collection is proceeding normally.49. If the decision in the House of Lords is in favour of the Crown, the collec-tion of the arrears included in class (1) will present little difficulty; if against the Crown, then, failing remedial legislation, the claims for duty will lapse. If the duty is to continue, this legislation must be obtained; but if it is to be repealed, no question of amending legislation arises, and these charges to duty lapse.Arrears within class (2) will presumably not be pursued, as&apos; whether the duty goes on or not, the fact that the Government&apos;intended in the Revenue Bill, 1914, to relieve the taxpayer of duty in such cases would render it impossible to revive the claims.Cases falling within classes (3) and (4) present no difficulty.(F.) Mineral Rights Duty.50. This duty is easy to assess and collect, and presents practically no diffi-culties. It is chargeable at the rate of Is. in the   upon owners of minerals on the royalties received where the minerals are leased, and on the rental value of the minerals where they are worked by the owner. The annual yield of this duty  which diminishes with every increase in the rate of income tax on account of the latter tax being a deduction in computing liability is about  260,000 at the pre-sent rate of income tax (6s. in the  ). With income tax at Is. 2d. in the   it produced about  320,000 per annum.[1526]D
APPENDIX A.The Land Union.St. Stephens House, Westminster, London,August 6, 1914.Dear Lloyd George,Many enquiries are reaching us here about provisional valuations now being served, and those who are receiving them say that they cannot deal with them because men in their offices are mobilized and no one else has the necessary information. Under these circumstances I hope you will suspend the; service of valuations for the present, and assent to the sixty days being extended in the case of any valuations where that period was unexpired when mobilization took place. We desire here to cease all controversial work in the present emergency, and are willing to place this office and staff at the disposal of the Government for any national purpose connected with the security of the nation or the preservation of its resources.Yours very truly, (Signed)     E. G. PRETYMAN.August 8, 1914.Dear Pretyman,1 think that the position of persons on whom provisional valuations are now being served would be sufficiently safeguarded by extending the period within which objections to them could be made. I am proposing to give instructions to this effect, and they will apply to all valuations served within sixty days prior to the date of mobilization as well as those served afterwards.The Government will bear, in mind your offer of the office and staff of the Land Union, for which they are very grateful.Yours sincerely, (Signed)     D. LLOYD GEORGE.St. Stephens House, Westminster, London,August 10, 1914.The Rt. Hon. D. Lloyd George.Dear Sir, The Land Union.On behalf of Mr! Pretyman, I beg to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 8th instant, and for your kind promise contained therein to extend the time within which objections to provisional valuations could be made.I have received a letter this morning from a member of the Land Union, in which he makes a suggestion that the time for objections to provisional valuations should not run against those actually engaged in the war, including Territorials. I assume that the instructions which you kindly propose to give will cover this, but if not I shall be grateful for your consideration of this point.Yours faithfully, (Signed)     C. H. KENDERDINE.C. H. Kenderdine, Esq., Secretary, The Land Union. August 17, 1914.Dear Sir,In reply to your letter of the 10th instant, I am desired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say that, in the case of all provisional valuations served within sixty days prior to the date of mobilization or served after that date, the time for giving notice of objection will be extended until sixty days subsequent to a date to be notified hereafter.I enclose a copy of a slip which it is proposed to affix to the provisional valua-tions affected.Yours faithfully, (Signed)      H. P. HAMILTON.
301APPENDIX B.1. Clause 4 of Revenue Bill, 1914.WHERE it appears to the Commissioners on any occasion for the collection of increment value duty, which is a transfer on sale of the fee-simple of land, or of any interest in land, or the grant of any lease of land, that the land has been utilised by the erection of buildings, or for the purpose of the erection of buildings, or in con-nection with buildings, the site value of the land on the occasion, if the person chargeable with duty so requires, not later than thirty days after the Commissioners have given notice to him of the assessment of duty, shall, instead of being calculated under section 2 of the principal Act, be taken to be the site value of the land estimated as on that occasion, in accordance with the general provisions of the prin-cipal Act as to valuation, with the substitution of the date of the occasion for the thirtieth day of April, nineteen hundred and nine.2. House of Commons, 23rd July, 1914. (Official Report, Vol. 65, Col. 631.)Mr. Chamberlain asked the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to the termination of the appeal in the Lumsden case . . . . ; whether he is aware that legislation was promised on this subject by the Government on 1st August last year; and whether, as the Revenuie Bill is dropped, the Government will introduce and pass through the House a one-clause Bill giving the promised relief to those who are affected by this decision.Mr. Asquith, I understand that this case .... has nowr been decided in favour of the Crown by the House of Lords. As regards the last part of the question, the Government are prepared to introduce and pass this session a one-clause Bill as suggested, provided the measure be treated as unopposed.3. Copy Correspondence between Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Pretyman.August 28, 1914.Dear Lloyd George,You were kind enough, in reply to a request by me, to arrange that provision should be made for extending the time in which objection could be made to provisional valuations.I shall be much obliged if you will let me know whether you could also arrange either that the issue of assessments to Increment Value Duty now being made should for the present be suspended, or that time for making an appeal against these assess-ments shall not run, but shall be extended, as in the case of provisional valuations, to thirty days from a date to be afterwards announced.I make this request as, owing to the war, it has not been possible to pass the One-Clause Bill, promised by the Prime Minister, to meet the hardships consequent on the Lumsden Judgment, and I quite understand that it may not be possible at the present time for the Government to proceed with this Bill.Claims for Increment Value Duty are now being pressed by the Valuation Department against builders, owners and others, under circumstances of some doubt and of considerable hardship, and unless the course I suggest is adopted they will have no alternative but reluctantly to incur costs in entering formal appeals against the assessments so that their future interests may not be- prejudiced.I am sure you will agree that further litigation should if possible be avoided under present circumstances, and that the best thing we can do is to preserve the status quo till normal times return.Yours verv truly, (Signed)      E. G. PRETYMAN.[1526]E
December 22, 1914.Dear Pretyrnan,*****Your letter reminded me that you wrote me some time ago suggesting that the issue of assessments to Increment Value Duty should for the present be suspended or, alternatively, that the time for making an appeal against the assessments should be extended to thirty days from a date to be fixed hereafter. I am afraid the Government could not possibly see their way to suspend the assessment and collection of Increment Value Duty generally, but they are prepared to instruct the Inland Revenue to hold in abeyance cases in which the relief claimed by the taxpayer is such as wotdd have been granted under the legislation promised by the Prime Minister. Such cases could then be allowed to stand over until a date to be hereafter fixed.Special consideration will, of course, be shown in the case of persons liable to Increment Value Duty who are serving with H.M. Forces.Yours sincerely, (Signed)     D. LLOYD GEORGE.December 24, 1914.Dear Lloyd George,I am much obliged for your letter received this morning, and am very glad to hear that you have instructed the Inland Revenue to hold in abeyance cases in which relief would have been obtained by the taxpayer from Increment Value Duty under the legislation promised by the Prime Minister.I should be glad to have permission to publish that part of your letter, as there are a good many cases which will be affected, and where notice of appeal has been given in consequence of the Prime Ministers pledge. It will be a relief to the appellants to know that these claims will remain in abeyance for the time being.Unless I hear from you to the contrary within a few days, I shall assume that I may communicate your letter to the Press.Yours very truly, (Signed)      E. G. PRETYMAN.4. House of Commons: March 21, 1916.   (Official Report, Vol. 81, Col. 51.)Mr. Peto asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that he has been unable to introduce the One-Clause Bill to deal with the Lumsden Judgment, as promised on July 23, 1914, instructions have been issued to the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to allow claims for Increment Value Duty in such cases to remain in abeyance, and if not, whether he will take steps to see that no claims for Increment Value&apos; Duty are pressed which are based upon the decision in the Lumsden case?Mr. Lloyd George. The amending legislation referred to was intended to give effect to the principal of clause 2* of the Revenue Bill, introduced on the 7th May, 1913, and was to apply to occasions arising since that date. In cases which would have been relieved by the proposed legislation claims for duty are held in abeyance.5. Letter dated May 10, 1916, from Mr. McKenna (Chancellor of the Exchequer)to Mr. Pollock, M.P.I HAVE again given the most careful consideration to the question of the collection of duty in cases affected by the Lumsden Judgment, and / think that the best course will he to leave matters as they are at the present time, until Parliament has decided how far the promised legislation is to be made retrospective. The Board of Inland Revenue will therefore allow payment of Increment Value Duty to remain in suspense in cases which would be covered by the legislation promised by the Prime Minister, whether such duty became payable on an occasion arising before or after the 7th May, 1913.* Afterwards clause 1 in Revenue Hill of 1914.
ISAPPENDIX C. Undeveloped Land Duty. House of Commons: April 11, 1916.  (Official Report, Vol. 81, Cols. 1606-7.)Mr. King asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether undeveloped land taxation is now payable on those assessments in respect of which demands were made for the years 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, and whether, in consideration of many persons having paid in respect of these assessments, it is intended either to demand payment of those who have not paid or to refund payments made to those who have paid moneys paid on a demand which has not been equally and impartially urged?Mr. McKenna, I can add nothing to the reply given to my hon. friend on 28th March* by my right hon. friend the Financial Secretary, beyond saying that there will be no eventual discrimination.* Extract from Mr. Montagu&apos;s reply on the 28th March, 1916 : &quot; In consequence of a judicial decision affecting the principles of valuation of land liable to Undeveloped Land Duty, the assessment and collection of this duty has been suspended as from the end of February 1914. Legislation confirming the basis of valuation adopted by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue was proposed in the Revenue Bill, 1914, which was postponed in consequence of the outbreak of war.&quot;3G2o
