[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,]Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1918.SECRET.G.-214. 14GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENTS AND THE WHITLEY REPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.(Previous Paper G-213.)THE paper (G.-213) circulated to the War Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 21st instant recognises that, in applying the Whitley scheme to public establishments, &quot; the Government and the Departments should endeavour to secure the greatest possible measure of uniformity as to the main principles by which the Departments should guide themselves in preparing schemes for their respective establishments,&quot; and formulates certain conditions with which such schemes should comply. With those conditions, so far as they go, I agree ; but I fear that if the action of the War Cabinet is limited to approving the recommendations of the Chancellors paper, each Department will consider itself free to proceed on its own lines, subject to the observation of the Treasury conditions. It is, in my opinion, urgently necessary to avoid such independent action./&quot;The whole theory of the Whitley Report rests on the assumption that employers, as well as employees, will be adequately organised and will act together. In public establishments there is, as the Treasury paper says, only one employer, but experience makes it abundantly clear that the employer speaks with different voices. There is not any approach to a common basis of labour policy in the many Government Departments employing industrial labour, nor is there any effective co-ordination of action in such matters. Thus, to take a single instance, while the War Qffiee bases its action as far as possible on the Fair Wages Resolution of the House of Commons, which requires that wages and conditions of employment shall be determined with reference to those obtaining in practice among good employers in the particular trade and district, the Admiralty finds the Resolution largely inapplicable and favours the principle of uniform Admiralty rates, irrespective of locality. There is in consequence continual divergence between Admiralty and W^ar Office practice in the same district, with the result that rates of wages tend everywhere to a maximum.The essential feature of the Whitley scheme is that the relations between employer and employed in each industry should be regulated uniformly in each district, so avoiding the constant unrest arising out of inequality of treatment by different employers in the same neighbourhood.If the Government in applying the scheme perpetuates the existing differences of labour policy in its various Establishments in the same area and intensifies these differences by setting up Whitley Councils with different constitutions, this most valuable feature will be missed, and the result is likely to create more disputes than it avoids. It therefore seems to me necessary to consider whether any Whitley organi-sation in Government Establishments should not include provision for effectively co-ordinating the action of different Departments employing industrial labour, both in local areas and nationally.The subject is full of difficulties, but it seems to me essential to face them, and I suggest that the War Cabinet should direct the appointment of a strong inter-depart-mental Committee to deal with the question.MILNER.June 26, 1918.
