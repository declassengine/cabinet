Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I append a report on the application of the Whitley Report to the administrative and clerical branches of the Civil Service, for the approval and confirmation of the Cabinet.It will be remembered that a Sub-Committee of the Inter-departmental Committee, on the Application of the Whitley Report to Government Establishments, presented a draft scheme to the Cabinet on 7th March, 1919 ; that this scheme was approved ; and that afterwards the scheme was referred to a conference of representatives of Government Departments and of Civil Service Associations, held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on 8th April. The Chancellor of the Exchequer presided at the Conference, and a resolution was moved and adopted, remitting this draft scheme (and any other reports dealing with the matter) to a National Joint Committee.It is the agreed Report of this Committee which is now circulated.It is laid down in the Report that the main objects of establishing Joint Whitley Bodies for the administrative departments are : 1. To secure a greater measure of co-operation between the State in its capacity as employer and the general bod3&apos; of Civil Servants in matters affecting the Civil Service, with a view to increased efficiency in the Public Service combined with the well-being of those employed.2. To provide machinery for dealing with grievances, and generally to bring together the experience and different points of view of representatives of the administrative, clerical, and manipulative Civil Service.The following different grades of bodies are contemplated :  (1) A National Council;   &apos; (2) Departmental Councils ; (3) District and Office (or Works) Committees.It is assumed that the Civil Service Arbitration Board will continue in being ; should disagreement on matters of remuneration arise on the National Council, the Arbitration Board will be consulted.The National Council will consist of 54 members (including four secretaries) to be appointed as to one-half by the Government and as to the other half by groups of Staff Associations.   The functions will include : (1) Provision of the best means of utilising the ideas and experience of the staff.(2) Determination of the general principle governing conditions of service, e.g., recruitment, hours, promotion, discipline, tenure, remuneration, and superannuation.(3) Further education of Civil Servants.(4) Improvement of office machinery, etc.(13S6)   Wt.867/117  6/19   150   D.St.fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet, June, 1919.WAR CABINET. 69REPORT ON THE APPLICATION OF THE WHITLEY REPORT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCHES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The discussion of promotion and discipline will be restricted to general principles.The decisions of the Council must be arrived at by agreement between the two sides, be signed by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and be reported to the Cabinet, and thereupon become operative.On this question it should be understood that in the course of the discussion of the subject upon the National Council the representatives of the Government will necessarily have to take the instructions of the Minister or Ministers concerned, and will not agree to any settlement except in accordance with these instructions. The effect of this will be that the Government will in fact have agreed to the decision being so taken before the matter is settled upon the National Council, and, consequently, the decision can become operative.No definite recommendations have been made on the subject of the establishment of a separate National Council for Ireland, but it is pointed out that the constitution provides for the establishment of special Committees to deal with special matters, and the affairs peculiar to Irish Civil Servants might be regarded as special.tThe Departmental Councils are only generally outlined, the details being left to the Departments concerned.The National Council will not act as a Court of Appeal from a Departmental Council, but it will be open to a Departmental Council to ask the National Council for advice in cases of difficulty.The general constitution and functions of Departmental Councils will be analogous to those of the National Council, but will only deal with matters peculiar to a Depart-ment. It will be within the competence of the Departmental Council to discuss any promotion in regard to which it is represented by the Staff side that the principles of promotion determined by the National Council have been violated. It will also be within the competence of Departmental Councils to discuss any case in which disciplinary action has been taken if it is represented by the Staff side that such a course is desirable.The decision of the Departmental Councils will be signed by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman and reported to the Head of the Department, and shall thereupon become operative.It will be possible for the Treasury to be represented on any Departmental Council if desirable.The establishment of District and Office (or Works) Committees is left as a matter to be dealt with by the Departmental Council when constituted.The Report is unanimous, and is signed by the Chairman, Sir Malcolm G. Ramsay, of the Treasury, and Vice-Chairman, Mr. G. H. Stuart Bunning, O.B.E., on behalf of the whole of the Committee. Another National Conference is to be convened, and 3rd July has been provisionally agreed upon for this Conference.The question is regarded as of the highest importance by the whole of the Civil Service, and there is widespread desire that effect may be given to the Report by the establishment of the National Council as soon as possible, in order that it may consider certain important questions affecting the Service.I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will see their way to sanction the proposals of this Report at an early date, so that the necessary invitations to the Conference may be issued.Signed)   R. S. HORNE.June 2nd, 1919.
Report of the National Provisional Joint Committee on the Application of the Whitley Report to the Administrative Departments of the Civil Service.1. On 8th April, 1919, a Conference was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, to consider the Report dated 7th March, 1919, on the Application of the Whitley Report to the Administrative t)epartmehts of the Civil Service.The Conference resolved : &quot; That the portion of Section 45 of the above-named Report, setting up a National Joint Committee to consider a Whitley scheme for the clerical and administrative branches of the Civil Service, be accepted.&quot; That this Report (and any other Reports dealing with the matter) be remitted to it for information.&quot; That the Provisional National Joint Committee so set up report not later than the 31st May, 1919.&quot;2. In pursuance of this resolution a Provisional National Joint Committee, consisting of 30 members (15 official representatives and 15 representatives of the Civil Service Associations), was finally constituted as follows : Official Representatives :Sir Laurence N. Guillemard, K.C.B.Sir Henry Gibson, K.C.B.Sir Malcolm G. Ramsay, K.C.B.Sir David J. Shackleton, K.C.B.Sir Claud Schuster, K.C.Sir Edmund B. Phipps, C.B.N. F. Warren Fisher, Esq., C.B.J.

Owing to the inability, on account of public engagements, of the Minister of Labour to take the Chair, it was decided that Sir Malcolm Ramsay, K.C.B., should be Chairman, and Mr. Stuart Bunning, O.B.E., should be Vice-Chairman of the Committee.3. During the course of their enquiry the Committee have held ten Meetings and now beg to submit the following Report: 4. We have not found it necessary to take oral evidence, but have carefully examined the above-named Report of 7th March and all the draft Whitley Reports drawn up by the various Civil Service Associations which have been submitted to us by express invitation, as well as certain memoranda, etc., bearing upon the problems before us.5. We have from the outset agreed that the main objects of establishing a system of Joint Whitley Bodies for the Administrative Departments are to secure a greater measure of co-operation between the State, in its capacity as employer, and the general body of Civil Servants in matters affecting the Civil Service, with a view to increased efficiency in the public service combined with the well-being of those employed ; to provide machinery for dealing with grievances and generally to bring together the experience and different points of view of representatives of the administrative, clerical, and manipulative Civil Service.6. For the purposes of this Report we have assumed that the Civil Service Arbitration Board will continue in being.7. We feel that, in the absence of experience of the working of any strictly comparable arrangements, any proposals and suggestions for applying the principles of the Whitley Report to the Administrative Departments of the Civil Service must necessarily be tentative and exploratory. Experience will no doubt show the lines on which the.activities of the Joint Civil Service Bodies can best develop, and for this reason we feel it inadvisable to attempt to lay down hard and fast rules in advance or to enter into details further than the exigencies of the moment seem to require.In these circumstances we suggest that if our recommendations are adopted it should be on the understanding that they are subject to such modifications as time and experience may show to be necessary or desirable. In the course of our enquiry we have had to deal with several highly contentious questions, but as a result of full discussion and the clearer appreciation which has resulted from the consideration of our different points of view, we have been able to arrive at the unanimous conclusions embodied in this report. This happy result augurs well for the future success of the Civil Service Joint Bodies, and our experience leads us to express the confident expectation that if the members of those bodies will apply themselves to the task before them with a resolute determination to overcome difficulties and will contribute their common knowledge and experience towards the solution of present and future problems, the main objects for which the Joint Bodies are to be established will be attained.8. Our proposals are based on the establishment of Joint Bodies falling into the following categories : I.   A National Council. II.   Departmental Councils. .   III.   District and Office (or Works) Committees.9. We proceed to set out the Constitution of the National Council followed by some notes explanatory of certain provisions in that constitution and then to indicate in broader outline our recommendations respecting the Departmental Councils and the District and Office (or Works) Committees.10.   We recommend the following constitution for the National Council: CONSTITUTION OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.Membership.11. The Council shaU consist of 54 members (including four Secretaries) to be appointed as to one-half by the Government (the official side), and as to the other half by groups of Staff Associations (the staff side).12. The Official Side. The members of the official side of the Council shall he persons of standing (who may or may not be Civil Servants) and shall include at
least one representative of the Treasury and one representative of the Ministry of Labour.13. The Staff Side. The staff side shall consist of persons of standing (who may or may not be Civil Servants) appointed by the under-mentioned Groups of Staff Associations: 1. Post Office Associations.2. Civil Service Federation.3. Civil Service Alliance.4. Society of Civil Servants and Association of First Division Civil Servants.5. Institution of Professional Civil Servants.6. Temporary Staff Associations.14. It shall be open to the authorities appointing the respective sides of the Council to vary their representatives.15. The first Council shall be appointed to serve until the close of the Annual Meeting in 1921.Casual vacancies shall be filled by the authority concerned, which shall appoint a member to serve for the remainder of the term for which the outgoing member was appointed.Officers. *16. Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The Chairman of the Council shall be a member of the official side; the Vice-Chairman shall be a member of the staff side of the Council.17. Secretaries. Each side of the Council shall appoint two of its members to act as Secretaries.18.   Quorum. The quorum shall be 14 members on each side of the Council.19. Meetings, etc. The ordinary meetings of the Council shall be held as often as necessary and not less than once a quarter. The meeting in the month of October shall be the annual meeting. An agenda shall be circulated to all members not less than 14 days before the meetings of the Council. Business not on the agenda shall only be taken by permission of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. A special meeting of the Council shall be called by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman as required. The business to be discussed at such meetings shall be limited to matters stated upon the notice summoning the meeting.20. The Council shall draw up such standing orders and rules for the conduct of its business as it may deem necessary.OBJECTS AND FUNCTIONS.21. General Objects. The objects of the National Council shall be to secure the greatest measure of co-operation between the State in its capacity as employer, and the general body of Civil Servants in matters affecting the Civil Service, with a view to increased efficiency in the public service combined with the well-being of those employed ; to provide machinery for dealing with grievances, and generally to bring together the experience and different points of view of representatives of the administrative, clerical and manipulative Civil Service.Functions.22. The scope of the National Council shall comprise all matters which affect the conditions of service of the staff.23.   The functions of the National Council shall include the following :-(i) Provision of the best means for utilising the ideas and experience of the staff.(ii) Means for securing to the staff a greater share in and responsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions under which their duties are carried out.(iii) Determination of the general principles governing conditions of service, e.g., recruitment, hours, promotion, discipline, tenure, remuneration and superannuation.In the National Council the discussion of promotion shall be restricted to the general aspects of the matter and the principles upon which promotions in general should rest. In no circumstances shall individual cases be taken into consideration.(1336)  Wt.867/117 6/19 150 D.St.
It shall be open to the National Council to discuss the general principles underlying disciplinary action, but there shall be no discussion of individual cases.(iv) The encouragement of the further education of Civil Servants and their training in higher administration and organisation.(v) Improvement of office machinery and organisation and the provision of opportunities for the full consideration of suggestions by the staff on this subject.(vi) Proposed legislation so far as it has a bearing upon the position of Civil Servants in relation to their employment.Committees.24. The National Council may appoint Standing Committees, Special Com-mittees, and Grade Committees and may delegate special powers to any Committee so appointed.The members of the Standing Committee shall be members of the Council. The Council may appoint on Special Committees such persons not necessarily being members of the Council as may serve the special purposes of the Council. Grade Committees shall consist of representatives of the grade concerned and official repre-sentatives, such persons not necessarily being members of the Council.Remuneration of Certain Classes.25. The National Council shall be the only Joint Body to determine questions of remuneration affecting a class employed in two or more Departments. Such questions affecting Treasury Classes shall be referred by the Council to Grade Com-mittees of that Council. In the case of other classes the National Council shall determine whether reference should be to Grade Committees of the National Council or to a joint meeting of the Departmental Councils concerned.Decisions.26. The decisions of the Council shall be arrived at. by agreement between the two sides, shall be signed by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, shall be reported to the Cabinet, and thereupon shall become operative.Publication of Proceedings of National Council.27. Only statements issued under the authority of the Council shall be published, and such statements shall be as full and informative as possible.Minutes.28.   The Council shall keep Minutes of its proceedings.Finance.29. Each side of the Council shall be responsible for its own expenses; the common expenses shall be defrayed in equal proportions by the Government and the Staff Associations.Amendment of the Constitution.30. The Constitution of the Council may only be amended at an Annual Meeting. Notice of amendment of the Constitution must be given and circulated to the members of the Council at least one month before the meeting.Notes on the above Constitution.31. The National Council for the Administrative Departments should cover all Civil Servants not covered by the Joint Bodies for the Government Industrial Estabhshments. It will no doubt be necessary for certain grades to elect whether they will come within one or other of the two systems. It is indeed possible that in certain cases a grade may be under one system for certain purposes and under the other system for other purposes.32. There may be problems of common interest to the Civil Servants covered by the Joint Bodies for the Administrative Departments and the Civil Servants covered by the Joint Bodies for the Industrial EstabUshments.   Experience will
-   369indicate the best kind of machinery for the consideration of such problems, and the National Council will, we anticipate, keep in touch with the Joint Bodies for the Industrial Establishments when questions of this kind arise.33. Membership.   We recommend that in the first instance there should be equality of numbers on the two sides of the National Council. After the fullest consideration we think that an aggregate initial membership of 54 will provide a body, the staff side of which should be representative of the Civil Service as a whole. While we have refrained from making any definite recommendations as to the direct representation of women by women on the National Council, women will be eligible for appointment to the Official side of the Council, and it is understood that certain groups of Associations will include women among their members on the Council.34. Separate Bodies need not be set up to deal with questions of Remuneration.  W7e are of opinion that the conditions in the Administrative Departments do not call for the establishment of separate Joint Bodies (analogous to the Trade Joint Councils in the Scheme for the Government Industrial Establishments) whose special function would be the consideration of wages questions. It will be observed that under the Constitution questions of remuneration affecting a class employed in two or more departments will normally be dealt with by Grade Committees of the National Council. We contemplate that as a rule the National Council will give formal approval to the findings of these Grade Committees.35. Agreement (Procedure). It will be observed that the Constitution provides that the decisions of the National Council shall be arrived at by agreement between the two sides representing respectively the Government and Civil Servants, shall be signed by the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, shall be reported to the Cabinet and shall thereupon become operative. It will be the duty of the Chairman to see that the decisions reach the proper executive authority without delay.36. Disagreement. We have carefully considered the position which may arise should the two sides of the Council fail to agree. If the question at issue is one of remuneration and so within the terms of reference of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, it will be remitted to that Board for adjudication. It has been, suggested that fixed machinery should be created to deal with other questions on which agreement has not been arrived at and which are outside the Board&apos;s terms of reference. We feel, however, that it is undesirable to suggest any fixed machinery for the solution of differences as its existence would necessarily impair the influence and authority of the National Council. Moreover, these questions will vary consider-ably in their nature and importance, and will in our judgment call for varying treatment. A way out of a deadlock may in some cases be found by informal consultation between the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman, in others by referring the matter to an informal Committee, consisting of the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman and the four Secretaries. In other cases some other solution may be feasible. In view of these considerations we have not thought it necessary or desirable to make specific provision in the constitution of the National Council for cases of disagreement, and we are satisfied that the best course will be to leave such cases to be dealt with individually as and when they arise, and not to attempt to lay down in advance any hard and fast rules.37. The National Council will not act as a Court of Appeal from a Departmental Council, but it will be open to a Departmental Council to ask the National Council for advice in cases of difficulty.38. Special Leave. We recommend that Civil Servants who are members of the staff side of the National Council should be given special leave with pay when attending meetings of that Council, and that the cost of their substitutes should be borne out of public funds.39. We have received representations from various Irish Civil Service Associations on the subject of the establishment of a separate National Council for Ireland. After full consideration we have come to the conclusion that it is not competent for us, under our terms of reference, to make any definite recommendation on the subject, and we accordingly limit ourselves to expressing the opinion that questions exclusively affecting the conditions of service of Irish Civil Servants must be dealt with by Joint Bodies on which Irish Civil Servants have full and direct representation, and to pointing out that our recommendations respecting Special Committees of the National Council provide machinery for giving effect to this suggestion.
40. We have not thought it our dut3^ to make any recommendation as to the allocation of seats to the specific groups on the staff side, but we are informed that the allocation will be as follows : Post Office Associations   ..      ..      .. .. .. 10Civil Service Alliance      ..      ..      .. .. .. .. 6Civil Service Federation  ..      ..      .. .. .. .. 5Society of Civil Servants and Association of First DivisionCivil Servants   ..      ..      ..      .. .. .. .. 2Institution of Professional Civil Servants .. .. .. 2Temporary Staff Associations    ..      .. .. .. .. 2DEPARTMENTAL COUNCILS. 41. We think that it is neither possible nor desirable to prescribe in detail a form of constitution for the individual Administrative Departments which differ from one another in size, in organisation, and in the nature of the duties they exist to perform. We confine ourselves to indicating in broad outline the principles on which the Constitutions of the Departmental Joint Bodies should, in our judgment, be framed, leaving each Department free to work out for itself the particular constitution best suited to its own peculiar conditions and requirements.42. As a general rule there should be one Departmental Council set up in each Department. In Departments which are large, or which contain interests of a varied or possibly diverse character, more than one Departmental Council may be necessary ; some Departments on the other hand are so small that they may not need all the machinery of Councils.43. A joint meeting of official representatives and representatives of the Staff ssociations having members employed in the Department should be called in each epartment to decide the number and character of the Joint Bodies to be set up in the Department and to settle their written constitutions. These should then be submitted to the National Council for approval: at the same time it is our opinion that the National Council should not scrutinize the individual constitutions beyond the point necessary to secure that they are in harmony with Whitley principles, and are, as far as may be, on uniform lines. We think it advisable that substantial amendments of the constitutions should be dealt with on the same lines.44. Numbers-It is important that the size of the Departmental Councils should be kept as small as is consistent with efficiency and with the preservation of their representative character. The number of members on each side should be settled by each Department and need not be equal or constant. It should be open to each side to vary their representatives.45. Treasury Representation. The constitution of a Departmental Council should provide for the addition to the official side of the Council, on the invitation of the Chairman, of a representative appointed by the Treasury as occasion may require. Treasury representation on Joint Bodies other than the National and Departmental Councils is not contemplated.46. Chairman and Vice-Chairman. The Chairman at every meeting of the Departmental Council should be a member of the official side of the Council. The Vice-Chairman should be a member of the staff side of the Council.47. Representation. The official side of a Departmental Council should be appointed by the Minister or the permanent Head of the Department. Members of the staff side should be elected by the Associations or groups of Associations having members employed in the particular Department.Where an Association has members outside as well as inside a Department, the electorate for that Department should be the members of the Association in the Department, and, if necessary, special machinery should be set up by the Association to ensure the carrying into effect of this arrangement. It will be open to the electorate so constituted to choose as their representative any member or official of the Associa-tion who is employed in the Civil Service or, if not a person so employed, is a full time officer of the Association. The election should in all cases be under the authority of the Association concerned. Although certain questions relating to classes employed in two or more Departments will be dealt with by special Grade Committees of the National Council, this fact should not preclude members in those classes from being elected to serve on the Departmental Councils.
48. Functions. The objects and functions of Departmental Councils will be those indicated for the National Council (paras. 21, 22, 23), so far as they have a special application to the particular Department, subject to the conditions that the determination of general questions is reserved for the National Council, and that questions common to two or more Departments, not being general questions, should be reported to the National Council, which may request the Departmental Councils concerned to meet and endeavour to agree on the subject under discussion. If desired by the Departmental Councils, the National Council may appoint a Chairman for such meetings.49. Committees. A Departmental Council may appoint Standing Committees, Special Committees, and Grade Committees and may delegate special powers to any Committee so appointed.The members of the Standing Committees shall be members of the Council. The Council may appoint on Special Committees such persons not necessarily being members of the Council as may serve the special purposes of the Council. Grade Committees shall consist of representatives of the grade concerned and official representatives, such persons not necessarily being members of the Council.50. Promotion. It shall be within the competence of a Departmental Council to discuss any promotion in regard to which it is represented by the staff side that the principles of promotion accepted by or with the sanction of the National Council have been violated. To ensure satisfactory working of this arrangement steps will have to be taken to acquaint the staff with the nature of the accepted principles of promotion. It has been urged upon us that the wide and early publicity of all vacancies is desirable, but in our opinion this is a matter which will properly fall to be considered by each Departmental Council, and we consequently content ourselves with recording the suggestion.51. Discipline. It shall be within the competence of the Departmental Council to discuss any case in which disciplinary action has been taken if it is represented by the staff side that such a course is desirable.52. Decisions. The decisions of Departmental Councils shall be arrived at by agreement between the two sides, shall be signed by the Chairman and Vice-Chairman, shall be reported to the Head of the Department and shall be operative. Our recommendations (para. 36) respecting cases of disagreement on the National Council apply to cases in which Departmental Councils fail to reach agreement on questions which they are competent to decide.53. Only statements issued under the authority of the Departmental Council should be published, and such statements should be as full and informative as possible54.   Minutes. The Departmental Council should keep Minutes of its proceedings.55. Finance. Each side of the Departmental Council shall be responsible for its own expenses ; the common expenses shall be defrayed in equal proportions by the Government and the staff associations. We recommend that Civil Servants, who are members of the staff side of a Departmental Council, should be given special leave with pay when attending meetings of the Council, the Associations bearing the cost of substitution where incurred.DISTRICT AND OFFICE (OR WORKS) COMMITTEES.56. The establishment and functions of such Joint Bodies, if not decided at the joint meetings called in pursuance of our recommendation in para. 43 above, will be a matter for the decision of the Departmental Council concerned when constituted.Like the Departmental Councils, these Joint Bodies should have written Con-stitutions defining their functions and regulating their powers and proceedings.We do not recommend that these Joint Bodies should discuss individual cases&quot; of promotion and discipline whether such cases fall within paras. 50 and 51 above or not.57. We desire to express our appreciation of the valuable services rendered by the Secretaries, Messrs. Chase, Howorth, Milne, and Wilson.Signed on behalf of the National Provisional Joint Committee,Malcolm G. Ramsay,Chairman. G. H. Stuart Bunning, 28th May, 1919. Vice-Chairman.
