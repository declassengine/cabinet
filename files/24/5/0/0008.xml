REPORTOF THESECOND CHAMBER CONFERENCE,PART I.Dear Prime Minister,&quot;1. I HAVE much pleasure in informing you that the Second Chamber Conference appointed by you on the 25th of August, 1917, has now completed its work, and that I am authorised to report to you the conclusions at which it has arrived. The examination, begun on October 2nd, 1917, of the numerous and intricate questions which it raised has occupied us more than six months, within which period we were able, although most of us were also occupied by work connected with the War, to hold forty-eight sittings, discussing these questions in their practical aspects and endeavouring to reach practical conclusions. The problems we had to deal with presented difficulties which can hardly be appreciated except by those who have steadily applied themselves to a prolonged study of the various issues involved. We had to adapt an ancient institution to new needs, fitting it in to a system which presents new conditions, and seeking to overcome prejudices and antagonisms which generations of party conflict had made acute. In particular we have been obliged to undertake the grave task of finding a basis for any Second Chamber which should be different in type and composition from the popular assembly, by including other elements which might be complementary to those which give its character to the House of Commons. Not less difficult was it to adjust the respective functions and powers of the two Chambers, vesting in the Second Chamber strength sufficient to enable it to act as a moderating influence in the conduct of national affairs, and yet not so much power of delay as to clog the machinery of Government, or dispose that Chamber to embark on controversies for the sake of asserting its own power. These were problems which, although frequently and carefully examined, had still remained unsolved, nor had the mind of the nation ever been fully addressed to them.2. The Terms of Reference were taken by the Conference to cover everything bearing on the functions of the House of Lords as a Legislative Body, but not covering anything that relates to the rights and privileges either of the Peerage as an Order, or of any individual as a Peer, nor anything that relates to the judicial functions of the House of Lords, whether as an ultimate Court of Appeal or otherwise. Within these limits the Terms of Reference have been understood in their widest seuse, as including everything conducive to the creation of an efficient Second Chamber, either by modifying the composition and varying the powers of the present House of Lords, or by constituting what would be a practically new Second Chamber. Not thinking it necessary to enter either into the history of the House of Lords or into the various schemes heretofore suggested for its reconstruction, the Conference has surveyed the whole constitutional problem as it stands at this moment, and has not deemed its task to be limited, as in some previous cases, to comparatively small reforms in the structure of the existing House. In so doing it has derived benefit from a study of existing Second Chambers both in foreign countries and in the British self-governing Dominions. We desire in this connection to acknowledge the help extended to us by the kindness of the Secretary of State for loreign Affairs, who furnished us with information obtained through His Majesty&apos;s representatives abroad, and also to express our cordial thanks to five distinguished French publicists, high authorities in constitutional questions, who supplied to us(16182.)

much, detailed information as to the composition and working of the Senate in France a body which they regard as playing a useful and important part in the political system of their country.   These gentlemen are .Professor Joseph Barthelemy (Professor of the Faculty of Law of Paris, Professor at the, Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques) ; M. Maurice Caudel (Professor at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques) ; M. d&apos;Eichthal (Member of the Academic Francaise, Director of the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques) ; M. Jules Dietz (formerly Professor at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, a Director of the &quot; Journal des Debats &quot;) ; M. Andre&apos; Lebon (formerly Minister of the Colonies, and Minister of Commerce, Chef de Cabinet du Parquet du Senat).3. It may be mentioned .at this point that we have to congratulate ourselves, not only on the full and regular attendance which was rendered almost throughout the whole of the long period that covered our work, but also on the fact that none of our members found it necessary, owing to such divergence of views as from time to time arose, to withdraw from our deliberations.On the other hand I have to record with regret the retirement, on his elevation to the Judicial Bench, of Mr. Clavell Salter, K.C., who was however replaced by Mr. Austen Chamberlain, and the unavoidable absence of Mr. T. P. 0&apos;Connor, who has been oblio-ed to remain in America until now.We desire here to express our high appreciation of the services rendered by our Secretary, Mr. G. F. M. Campion, one of the .Clerks of the House of Commons. His abilities and diligence, as well as his wide and accurate knowledge of parliamentary institutions at home and abroad, have been extremely helpful to us.4. The Scheme here submitted requires some explanation and comments. These may be conveniently given if I begin by setting forth in the first place the matters in agree -ment from which the Conference started, by then proceeding to trace the lines upon which its deliberations moved, and by indicating the considerations which led it to the recommendations embodied in the Scheme.   The Scheme itself appears in Part II.5. The Conference entered on its task by considering how far its members were agreed as to the functions appropriate to a Second Chamber, as to the elements that ought to he present in it, and as to the place it ought to fill in the scheme of the Constitution, and it wras found that agreement existed upon the following points : Functions Appropriate to a Second Chamber.6. (1) The examination and revision of Bills brought from the House&apos;of Commons, a function which has become more needed since, on many occasions, during the last thirty years, the House of Commons has been obliged to act under special rules limiting debate.(2) The initiation of Bills dealing with subjects of a comparatively non-controversia! character which may have an easier passage through the House of Commons if they have been fully discussed and put into a well-considered shape before being submitted to it.(3) The interposition of so much delay (and no more) in the passing of a Bill into law as may be needed to enable the opinion of the nation to be adequately expressed upon it. This would be specially needed as regards Bills which affect the fundamentals of the Constitution or introduce new principles of legislation, or which raise issues whereon the opinion of the country may appear to be almost equally divided.(4) Full and free discussion of large and important questions, such as those of foreign policy, at moments when the House of Commons may happen to be so much occupied that it cannot find sufficient time for them. Such discussions may often be all the more useful if conducted in an Assembly whose debates and divisions do not involve the fate of the Executive Government.Elements that ought to find a place in the Second Chamber.7. (1) Persons of experience in various forms of public work, such as judicial, work. Local Government work, Civil Service work, Parliamentary work ; persons possessing special knowledge of important departments of the national life, such as Agriculture. Commerce, Industry, Finance, Education, Naval and Military Affairs ; and persons who possess a like special knowledge of what are called Imperial Questions such as foreign affairs and matters affecting the Over-Seas Dominions.. (2) Persons who, while likely to serve efficiently in a Second Chamber, may not have the physical vigour needed to bear the increasing strain which candidacy for a seat in the House of Commons, and service in it involve.
(3) A certain proportion of persons who are not extreme partizans, but of a cast of mind which enables them to judge political questions with calmness and comparative freedom from prejudice or bias. No Assembly can be expected to escape party spirit, but the excesses of that spirit usually can be moderated by the presence of a good many who do not yield to it.Position which the Second Chamber ought to hold in our ConstitutionalSystem.8. It was agreed that a Second Chamber ought not to have equal powers with the House of Commons, nor aim at becoming a rival of that assembly. In particular, it should not have the power of making or unmaking Ministeries, or enjoy equal rights in dealing with finance. This was prescribed not only by long-established custom and tradition, but also by the form of our Constitution, which makes the Executive depend upon the support of the House of Commons, and would be seriously affected in its working by extending to a Second Chamber the power of dismissing a Government.All precautions that could be taken ought to be taken to secure that in a Reformed Second Chamber no one set of political opinions should be likely to have a marked and permanent predominance, and that the Chamber should be so composed as not to incur the charge of habitually acting under the influence of party motives.The Second Chamber should aim at ascertaining the mind and views of the nation as a whole, and should recognise its full responsibility to the people, not setting itself to oppose the people&apos;s will, but only to comprehend and give effect to that will when adequately expressed.It should possess that moral authority which an assembly derives not only from the fact that its members have been specially chosen to discharge important public duties but also from their personal eminence, from their acknowledged capacity to serve the nation, and from the confidence which their characters and careers are fitted to inspire.It should, by the exercise of this authority, and especially by evincing a superiority to factious motives, endeavour to enlighten and influence the people through its debates, and be recognised by the people as qualified, when a proper occasion arose, to require the reconsideration of important measures on which their opinion had not been fully ascertained.Lastly, the Conference was also of opinion that it would enhance the authority of the Second Chamber, and would be in line with the whole constitutional history of this country, which has been marked by a steady and gradual development, broken by no sudden and violent change, that so far as is possible a continuity should be preserved between the ancient House of Lords and the new Second Chamber, the best traditions of the former being handed on to the new body, so as to enhance its dignity, and make a seat in it an object of legitimate ambition. The Great Council of the Nation from which the House of Lords directty descends, the House of Commons having been added to it in the thirteenth century, is the oldest and most venerable of all British institutions, reaching back beyond the Norman Conquest, and beyond King Alfred, into the shadowy regions of Teutonic antiquity.COMPOSITION OF THE SECOND CHAMBER.9. Of the three topics to which the Reference directed its attention, the Conference thought it best to begin with that which relates to the composition of the Second Chamber. It is the most difficult of these topics. It was debated at the greatest length, and it provided the most frequent occasions for reconciling divergent views.10. The principle of endeavouring to preserve some real measure of continuity between the House of Lords and the new Second Chamber, a principle accepted by all, though some members attached more importance to it than did others, suggested that a certain portion of the Chamber should be taken from the existing peerage, but the other principle that three important requisites for the strength of the Chamber would be found in its having popular authority behind it, in its opening to the whole of His Majesty&apos;s subjects free and equal access to the Chamber, and in its being made responsive to the thoughts and sentiments of the people, also prescribed that the large majority of the members should be so chosen as to enjoy that popular authority. It is with the constitution of this majority that this narrative begins.11. The Conference rejected the idea of having a Chamber elected on the basis of a property qualification, possessed by a privileged class of voters, and also that of requiring a property qualification for the persons to be elected, restrictions which have been adopted
in some countries, but which were deemed unsuitable to modern conditions. Neither was it thought that the plan (sometimes suggested) that the persons chosen to sit should be taken from certain prescribed categories (e.g. from those who had filled some public office) would work well, for it would be very difficult to draw up any satisfactory list of categories which niight not be either too large to be useful, or too restricted to permit many men of eminence and worth to be admitted as nominees. The Conference then proceeded to examine five methods that might be adopted for constituting that popular element in the Chamber which it had been agreed to make predominant.Various Alternative methods of Composition. i. Nomination.12. The first method was that of nomination by the Crown acting through its ministers. This plan appeared unlikely to find favour with the country, because it did not provide any guarantees for the fitness of the persons who might be nominated, and because it would be liable to be frequently employed as a reward for political party services. Nor was it held that a provision requiring that the persons to be nominated should be taken from certain prescribed categories would furnish an answer to these objections.ii. Direct Election.IB. The second method was Direct Election by the same voters as those who choose the House of Commons.   Strong arguments were advanced for this plan.It would produce a Chamber both homogeneous and directly responsible to the people, and with the weight of their will behind it. Coining straight from the people it would enjoy their confidence and mirror their views and ideas. If the elections took place frequently, there would be a constant ascertainment and renewal of the most recent public opinion, refreshing and strengthening the Second Chamber.14. On the other hand it Avas forcibly urged that a Chamber elected on the same franchise as the House of Commons would inevitably become a rival ot the House of Commons, and would, because it had an equal &quot;mandate&quot; from the people, he likely to claim equal financial powers, and tend to fall into conflict with that principle of the Constitution which assigns to the House of Commons rhe function of making and unmaking Administrations. Ministers would have two masters to serve and to fear. The persons directly elected would be presumably of the same general type as those elected to the House of Commons, so that no new element such as is admittedly desirable would thereby be introduced into the Legislature. The Second Chamber would in fact be little more than a duplicate of the House of Commons, and might either, as being the less attractive body, come to be composed mainly of the surplus material of the latter, or (alternatively) by the longer tenure of its members become ultimately the more attractive, possibly the more influential legislative body. The constituencies which would have to be created for a comparatively small body such as the new Second Chamber would be so much larger than the constituencies which now-elect members to the House of Commons, that they would be more readily controlled by party organizations. As the expense of contesting these larger constituencies would also be heavier, an advantage would thus be given to wealthy candidates.These considerations led the Conference as a whole to decide against the scheme ol Direct Election, and we accordingly passed on to consider methods of Indirect Election. Several such methods presented themselves.iii. Election by Local Authorities.15. It was suggested that the choice of members of the Second Chamber might be entrusted to Local Authorities, grouped in local areas of suitable size. The Councils of counties and of county boroughs, possibly with the addition of Councils of the larger non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural districts, might constitute such electing bodies, or delegates from these Local Authorities might be formed into what are called &apos; electoral colleges&apos; for certain local territorial areas. In this way an electorate of picked men, chosen by the people in their several local government areas, and in so far qualified to represent the people, might be created ; and these would select for the Second Chamber men of local influence and practical experience in affairs. Such elections might be conducted without the cost and the partisanship which seem inseparable from direct elections, and might give as good, or even a better, result in the quality of the persons selected. .
8816. Although this plan had the great attraction of providing a new basis for a Second Chamber, several objections wrere taken to it. It was argued that it would certainly introduce party politics into the elections of those County Councils and Borough Councils which had hitherto been conducted on non-party lines, and would intensify party spirit in. those local elections where that spirit already existed in a mild form, or in those wrhich turn upon issues different from the issues raised iu Parliamentary contests. The result would be to lead local government voters to think, when they were voting, more of a canclidate&apos;s political opinions than of his fitness for local work, while it would cause the Councils themselves to be divided, in the discharge of their proper functions of local administration, upon party lines, and would thus impair their efficiency. As the members of local government bodies are now selected for duties which have little to do with national politics, there was no solid ground for thrusting upon them the very different duty of choosing a body fitted to dischai*ge the political functions of a Second Chamber. In many large districts of Great Britain, the local borough and county councils are composed predominantly of members of some one political party, so that in those districts that party, whichever it w*as, would capture almost the whole of the representation in the Second Chamber, the men of merit who did not belong to that party being passed over, and the voters belonging to it being left unrepresented. Even the adoption of proportional representation would not remedy this evil.These latter arguments ultimately prevailed.iy. Selection by a Joint Standing Committee of both Houses..17. A fourth plan was then examined. It was that of placing the selection of the Second Chamber in the hands of some weighty, impartial and independent authority, constituted in accordance with the proposal made at para. 27 of this Report for the selection of those Members of the Second Chamber who will be taken in the first instance from the Peerage.Those who supported these views recommended that the Members of the Second Chamber, whether selected from the Peerage or not, might be chosen by a Committee of Selection, drawn in equal or nearly equal numbers, from both Houses of Parliament ; that this Committee or Commission should be a small one, not exceeding 20 in number, that its Members might, in the first instance, be selected by agreement, and that the names of the original Members might be given in a schedule of the Bill for reconstituting the Second Chamber, and thus obtain the sanction of both Houses of Parliament. Two Members of the Commission might, it was thought, retire every year, and the vacancies thus created, as well as casual vacancies, might be filled by co-option. The names of the newr Members should be laid upon the Table of both Houses for 30 days iu order to afford Parliament an opportunity of taking exception to the proposed selection. If, in either House, a motion were made and carried that the nomination be not approved, it could be cancelled and a fresh nomination required.18. While the scheme thus outlined found considerable support in the Conference, the majority thought it essential to provide a broader basis for the Second Chamber than election by any Commission, even one set up and renewed by Parliament, could furnish. These members sought that broader basis in the election of a Second Chamber by Parliament itself. They urged that, while a commission such as that proposed would no doubt bring into the Second Chamber men of personal eminence, this fact alone was not sufficient to justify the method, as it was universally admitted that both high ability and personal eminence were to be amply found in the existing House of Lords. Nor, in their view, was it enough to secure that the new Second Chamber should be a balanced body. What was necessary was that it should be as far as possible a representative body. They held that since direct election by the voters had been ruled out by difficulties (already indicated) which had been deemed insuperable, the nearest approach to the advantages claimed for the method of direct election was to vest the selection of the bulk of members of the Second Chamber in the persons whom the voters had chosen to represent them in Parliament.v. Election by the House of Commons.19. There were two ways in which this might be done. The House of Commons might vote as a Avhole for the election of a Second Chamber, or it might be divided into groups, each of which would be entrusted with the election of a certain number of members of the Second Chamber. It was objected to the former course that an election by the whole of the House of Commons must inevitably become16182 A 4
a purely party contest, a contest which would be managed by the party Whips and would turn upon the party pledges or party services of the persons to be elected, too little regard being paid to their personal qualifications. Proportional Representation, it was thought, would not remove this objection, as it would not be practicable if applied to an election in which the list of candidates might contain several hundred names, and in which the quota would be so low that a very few electors could, by combining together, secure the return of any candidate. Such an election would, therefore, fail to secure the kind of Chamber which the country is believed to desire.20. On the other hand, if the members of the House of Commons were to be divided into groups representing certain large divisions of the country, and were to meet in such groups to elect the persons they held to be best fitted for the Second Chamber, the dangers just referred to would be less likely to arise. The members of Parliament composing the groups might be expected to know the men best fitted to represent the needs and wishes of the parts of the country from which they themselves come, and they would act under a sense of responsibility to their constituents which could not be enforced upon the House of Commons as a whole. They would be able to meet, in numbers not too large for friendly discussion and compromise, to select persons who would better represent the different political parties, and they might also reserve a number of seats for men who were not active party politicians, but seemed qualified to regard current questions in a fair and impartial spirit.21. These considerations secured a marked preponderance in the Conference for this plan over that of an election by the House of Commons acting as a whole, and when the question came to be between this second or &quot; Group&quot; scheme and the fourth plan, described in para, 17, that of election by an electoral Commission of Members of both Houses, the scheme of election by geographical groups of Members of the House of Commons obtained the larger support.22. Those, however, who supported this fourth plan remained unconvinced by the arguments used in favour of election by the House of Commons, even acting by groups, and desired to have it placed on record that they were opposed on the following grounds to the method of composition recommended by the majority of the Conference.^23. They held it improbable that election by groups of Members of Parliament would produce a body of men possessing the attributes required for a Second Chamber, or well qualified to assume the functions assigned to that body. Elected by men who were diemselves inevitably partisans, they could (so it was thought) scarcely be expected to be themselves free from partisanship. They would almost inevitably be chosen as party men and feel themselves bound by party ties. Apart from this it was feared so these members argued that the system would lend itself to transactions and bargains of the most undesirable kind. A very small number of the electors could by proportional machinery choose a member of the Second Chamber. There would often be an irresistible temptation to choose persons, not because of their eminence or their fitness to take part in the business of the Second Chamber, but because it was desired to reward them for party services, political or pecuniary, or even because of personal friendship. If it Avere open to the groups to choose sifting Members of the House of Commons, the opportunity could be used to place the seats of such Members at the disposal of party candidates, or in other cases, to get rid of a Member whose popularity was waning in order to replace him by one more enterprising and useful to his party. They apprehended that in all these transactions, which might take an infinite variety of shapes, the Party organization, supported by the large funds, derived from various sources, which it controls, would tend to make itself more felt than ever. They further urged that if the functions and position of the Second Chamber were to be those which the Conference had decided to assign to it, it ought to be different from the House of Commons in character and unlikely to become its rival, and that it would therefore be unwise to set up alongside of the House of Commons a Second Chamber founded upon the same elective principle as that which gives authority to the House of Commons, but possessing that authority in slighter measure and working through a machinery open to grave criticism. Being itself a creation of the House of Commons it would furnish an insufficient check on that body.24. In reply to these arguments it was contended that the responsibility of Members of the House of Commons, electing in groups, to their own constituents and to the great mass* The names of these members are as follows : Duke of Rutland, Marquess of Lansdowne, Earl of Dunraven, Earl Loreburn, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Lord Sydenham, Lord Hugh Cecil. Sir George Younger, while not supporting the fourth plan, desires to join in this dissent.
of voters of the large area which they would for this purpose represent, would restrain that partizanship which was so much feared. The groups would be anxious to return persons of high political standing, and also to study local sentiment. Thus they would not be subservient to the control of party managers and whips, and this responsibility would give a guarantee against the exercise of the kind of undue influence which was apprehended. Supposing such a centre of corrupting political influences to exist, it might reasonably, they argued, be maintained that a small Electoral Commission, even one appointed under the authority of Parliament and from members of Parliament, would be not less open to the action of such influences than would be the numerous and considerably larger electing bodies composed of members of the House of Commons which form the basis of the scheme here recommended. As to the need of a principle of differentiation between the Second Chamber and the House of Commons, which would prevent any tendency of the former to become a rival of the latter, they were agreed. They found such a principle not only in the indirectly representative character of a Second Chamber based upon election by the House of Commons but also in the other differences which were features of the scheme as a whole and are detailed below the proposed longer tenure, the different legislative and financial powers and the smaller size of that body. Moved by these considerations, the majority of the Conference adhered to the method of election by members of the House of&quot; Commons grouped in territorial areas which will be found set out in. Part II. of the Report.METHOD  OF COMPOSITION ADOPTED.25. The method of election by Members of the House of Commons grouped in large territorial areas having been thus adopted by the large majority of the Conference, the next step was to constitute the proposed geographical groups to which the function of electing should be assigned, and to settle the number of seats in the Second Chamber  which each group should elect, the respective populations  of the areas of these geographical  groups being taken as the basis. for the  number of seats to be allotted  to  each area.    It was necessary that the areas  should be com-paratively few, that the boundaries of counties should be respected, and that their respective populations should, so far as  possible,  be nearly equal.    The plan of voting by Proportional Representation, which was adopted because it would help to secure a due representation of all political parties, made it desirable that the number of seats to be filled by each group should be not less than five at each election.    Thus, assuming that the Chamber should be (as hereafter explained) renewed by one-third at a time, the total number of seats to be allotted to the area of each group would be not less than fifteen.   These considerations and an examination of the economic conditions, ao-ricultural, manufacturing, and commercial, of the different parts of Great Britain, and of the respective characters and affinities of their inhabitants, led us to a division of the Island into thirteen areas for the election of the Second Chamber.   All, or nearly all, of these areas have the advantage of being what may be called &quot; natural entities,&quot; the counties which compose each area having a certain natural connection with one another, and some of them even a measure of distinctive racial quality, corresponding to those ancient divisions of the country out of which the United Kingdom has grown.  These areas, with the populations of the several areas, the number of members of the House of Commons representing constituencies in each area, and the number of seats in the Second Chamber to be allotted to each area and elected by each Parliamentary Group, are set out in the Table on page 24.    The total number of members of the Second Chamber who would be chosen on this plan for Great Britain is 246.   The number to be allotted to Ireland, and the method by which Members of the Second Chamber coming therefrom were to be chosen was reserved, pending a settlement of the questions which affect the representation of Ireland in the House of Commons.26. The large majority of the Second Chamber having been thus constituted upon a principle which was deemed such as would give a thoroughly popular character to the Chamber as a whole, the Conference had next to consider the means by which the historical continuity of the reconstructed Second Chamber with the ancient House of Lords could be preserved. Two arguments enforced the desirability of avoiding a complete breach with the past. One has already been adverted to. The respect which it is desirable that the nation should feel for the Second Chamber will be all the greater if it be regarded as an ancient institution remodelled in accordance with modern views and feelings rather than as a brand new creation. The other consideration was, that among the existing peers there are many men of distinguished abil^ and long 16182 - a r,
experience in legislation and administration, men whose services the country would desire, to retain. It was accordingly determined, some few dissenting, that a part of the Second Chamber should be chosen from the peers. It was also deemed proper (though again with some difference of opinion) that among those to be thus selected a certain small number should be taken from the Episcopal Bench. The Spiritual Peers constitute one of the most ancient elements of the Great Council of the Nation, having sat in that Council before the Norman Conquest and formed at some moments before the Reformation, (including the mitred abbots) about one half of it. Thus, as the principle of continuity suggested their presence, so was it also urged by some members that the legal position which the Church of England holds, Parliament being the body which legislates for it, made it proper to have in the legislature persons entitled to speak on its behalf and directly conversant with the work social as well as religious, which it performs. In fixing the number to be taken from the existing House of Lords it was thought proper to make it somewhat larger at the outset, in order to find room for those peers who had been taking an active share in public business, than it need continue to be in future years. Accordingly the Conference recommends that the number of this Section should be fixed at eighty-one, that, in the first instance, the whole Section should be chosen from the Peers, but that subsequently, the number of Peers in this Section should be gradually reduced, in the manner described in paragraph 36, to thirty, the remaining fifty-one seats being thus thrown open to persons who need not be Peers. As will presently be seen it is thought necessary that both numbers, the temporary and the permanent, should be divisible by three.27. For the election of these Peerage Members two alternative courses were open. One was to let them be chosen by the whole body of peers. This was rejected largely for the same reasons as had prevailed against the election of Members of the Second Chamber by the House of Commons as a whole, namely, that the election would be likely to fall under the control of party motives and party managers. The alternative course was to create a Committee of Parliament, specially qualified for this delicate function. The Conference accordingly proposes that a Joint Standing Committee of both Houses of Parliament be set up to be composed of men of authority and experience, and representing every political party. Those members of this Commission, who would come at the^first election from the present House of Lords, and thereafter from the new Second Chamber, would be chosen by the Committee of Selection in that House. The members coming from the House of Commons might be chosen by the Speaker. It is suggested that five persons from each House would form a sufficiently large Electoral Commission or Committee. It would be set up at the beginning of each Parliament, and such vacancies as may occur in its membership would be filled up by the Second Chamber Committee of Selection, or by the Speaker of the House of Commons, as the case might be. Such a Committee might be trusted to see to it that due representation was given to every shade of political opinion.Pekiod of Tenure or a Seat in the Second Chamber.28. From the principle, generally accepted in this country and universally acted upon in other countries, that a Second Chamber shall, as compared with the larger and directly elected House, represent the more permanent mental attitude and tendencies of the nation, and be more exempt from sudden and violent fluctuations of opinion, two conclusions seemed to follow :First. That the tenure of a member of the Second Chamber shall be longer than that of a member of the House of Commons.Secondly. That the Second Chamber shall not be renewed in its entirety all at once, but as to a part only, a proportion of its members retiring at stated intervals.29. It is therefore recommended, applying these conclusions, that the tenure of a seat in the Second Chamber be fixed at twelve years for both the above-mentioned Sections ; and that one-third of each Section shall retire every fourth year.This plan seems to offer two advantages (a) that the Second Chamber, while not suddenly changing as a whole undera momentary popular impulse, shall be kept in constant touch with public opinion in a way which could not be secured under a scheme of Life Tenure, and(b) that it will always contain a considerable section of members Avho will haveacquired legislative experience and a mastery of public affairs bv a service of some length.

Persons elected by a Joint Stand-ing Committee of both Houses.	81	12 years (one-third to retire every 4 years).Necessary Modifications in the case of the Second Chamber to be firstconstituted.31. The system, here set forth for the composition of the Second Chamber does not admit of being applied in its entirety to the composition of the Second Chamber to be first constituted. An essential feature of this system is that not more than one-third of the major portion of the Chamber should be elected at any one time or by a single House of Commons. It is proposed to meet this difficulty which arises in the case of the initial constitution of the Second Chamber as follows : As Regards the Section to be Elected by the House of Commons.32. One third of this section should be elected by members of the present House of Commons grouped in territorial areas according to the plan proposed for all subsequent elections of the Second Chamber.   This third should retire at the end of four years.One third of this portion of the Second Chamber should be similarly elected by members of the next House of Commons, and retire at the end of eight years.The remaining third would be elected by the Joint Committee of both Houses already provided for the purpose of electing that portion of the Second Chamber in which members of the Peerage are to be represented.This remaining third should sit for the full period of twelve years. (See Table on page 12).On this system, at the end of four years the machinery of election by the House of Commons existing at the time when each quadrennial period ended would come into full operation, and at the end of twelve years, the whole of the Second Chamber would have been constituted according to the method here proposed, every elected member sitting for twelve years, and the Chamber being renewed by one-third every four years.33. It will be seen that it is assumed that a start will be made with the composition of the new Second Chamber during the life-time of the present House of Commons. If legislation for the constitution ot the Chamber were to be deferred until the next Parliament, certain modifications Avoulcl obviously have to be made.34. The question arises which of the three electing agencies proposed should elect its quota of a third of the Second Chamber first. It is conceived that the Joint Standing Commission should elect first, on the ground that such a body would be well qualified to have regard in making its choice to the country as a whole, and thus to include persons of eminence who might not have any connection with particular geographical areas.As Regards the Section to be Elected by the Joint Standing Commission.35. As the whole of this section is to be elected, on the first as on future occasions, by the Joint Commission, the Conference think that it may be left to the Commission to assign to the persons chosen a term of four, eight, or twelve years, respectively, as it may think fit.36. As stated above the election on this first occasion would be from the Peers exclusively.At the second and third elections, however, the principle above referred to of gradually throwing open the section to other persons besides Peers, should be put into operation, and at these elections half only of the vacancies should be reserved for Peers, while at subsequent elections the choice of the Joint Committee should be unrestricted, subject only to the provision that the number of Peers so selected sitting in th.2 Second Chamber should not fall below thirty.16182 A 6

Some other points relating to the composition of the Second Chamber remain to be mentioned. One of these relates to the Law Lords, who sit under the Appellate Juris-diction Acts, 1876 and 1887. It is thought, that if and so long as the Second Chamber continues to discharge the judicial functions now discharged by the House of Lords as Supreme Court of Appeal, these high judicial personages should continue to sit as ex officio members. Their presence will add to its deliberations an element of special knowledge and long experience which will doubtless be available in the future, as it has been in the past, for the purpose of revising Bills and securing that the form in which they pass shall be legally correct. The same considerations apply to the Lord Chancellor and to those ex-Lord Chancellors who take part in the judicial business of the House. It is suggested that they ought to remain ex ojjicio members while they sit as Judges of Appeal. It has long been the practice that members of the Royal House, created Peers, should sit in that capacity, though for some generations past they have neither joined in debate nor otherwise taken part in political life. The Conference thought that this practice might be so far continued as to allow the sons and grandsons of a Sovereign to sit in the Second Chamber.39. Doubts arose as to whether the Lord Chancellor should continue to act as Chairman of the Second Chamber by appointment of the Crown for, though he puts the question in the House of Lords, he is not responsible for keeping order there and does not call upon members to rise and speak, and, being a member of the Cabinet he joins in debate on behalf of the Government, and votes in a division. The view, however, prevailed that the traditions of his high office should continue to add dignity to the position of Speaker of the Chamber.-40. Several other questions relating to the composition of the Second Chamber require a brief mention.The disqualifications for membership of the House of Commons now by law existing, ought, for the most part, to be applied to the Second Chamber also, excepting however, those which exclude the Clergy of the Established Churches of England and Scotland, and of the Roman Catholic Church.* Whether the provisions which exclude, with certain important exceptions, persons holding offices of profit under the Crown, individuals or members of firms holding contracts with the Government, and also the holders of pensions paid out of public funds,.should be applied to the Second Chamber  these are questions which deserve serious examination. They are, however, of so delicate a nature, the law as regards contractors being in particular intricate, and in some points obscure, that it was thought better not to enter minutely into them, but to be content with commending them to the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, when they and their legal advisers proceed to draft a Bill for dealing with the matter.It was conceived that peers who have not been elected to the Second Chamber ought to be allowed to stand for the House of Commons, as Peers of Ireland have been since the Union in 1800.   The case of Lord Palmerston is a familiar one.* If clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Ireland are now disqualified (a point which seems to be in doubt) their disqualification also ought to be removed.
There seemed to be no reason why the ancient rule which requires a Member of the House of Commons desiring to resign his seat to do so by the fiction of accepting such an obsolete office as that of the stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds, or the stewardship of the Manor of Northstead, should be applied to the new Second Chamber; and it is accordingly suggested that its Members may retire by the simple method of addressing a formal letter of resignation to the President or Speaker of that Chamber.41. Three other points deserve careful consideration.   They are these :(a) Whether Ministers of the Crown ought to be allowed to speak in bothHouses of Parliament, of course with no right of voting except in the House to which they belong.(b) Whether salaries similar to those now paid to the Members of the House ofCommons should be paid to Members of the Second Chamber also.(c) What provisions should be made for the period of transition from theexisting House of Lords to the new Second Chamber so that the regular working of our constitutional machinery should go on through this period.These points, since they raise issues which the Conference did not seem called upon, or perhaps even empowered by the Terms of Reference, to deal with, are submitted to the judgment of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it was left to them to deal with various minor non-controversial matters relating to the requirements necessary for carrying out in detail the Scheme whose main lines have been laid down in Part II. of this Report. Among these would be the dates to be fixed for the election by the several groups of the Members of the House of Commons and the details to be settled respecting the filling up of vacancies, both casual and those which will arise at the expiring of the three quadrennial periods. In order not to encumber the scheme by these minor matters they are submitted to the judgment of the Government and of Parliament.   Some of them might, perhaps, be usefully dealt with by an Order in Council.42. Upon one interesting question which was discussed namely that of the possibility of turning the Second Chamber to good account for the purpose of including in it persons who might be qualified both to express the views of the Self-Governing Dominions and other parts of the British Overseas possessions, and to join with full knowledge in discussing questions affecting them, it was held by the Conference, after the matter had been debated with a full recognition of its importance, that they were precluded by their Terms of Reference from making recommendations which, if adopted, might affect the relations of the Parliament -of this country with the outlying parts of the Empire.* But the hope was expressed in the course of the discussion that this matter would receive the careful consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Conference then passed on to another of the three topics set out in the Terms of Reference, viz,, the legislative functions which the Second Chamber ought to exercise.LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE SECOND CHAMBER.43. Only in one respect does this subject present any serious difficult)7. It has always been understood in this country and this is the practice in nearly every country where a Second Chamber exists that the Second Chamber should be entitled to full power in&apos; the sphere of such legislation as is not of a financial character. It may revise and amend, and in some cases refuse to proceed with, a Bill brought to it from the other House. It may initiate ordinary Bills both Public and Private. It may discuss all questions of general domestic and imperial policy. In financial matters alone is its range of action limited by the long established superior rights of the popular House. Accordingly, it was with questions of finance and with these only that the Conference found it had to deal.44. The Conference was agreed in declining to attempt to recast as a whole the old rules which have determined the privileges of the House of Commons with regard to Finance. These are now a sort of labyrinth of historical, constitutional and legal controversies. Thus it was resolved to deal with one branch only of the subject the distinction to be drawn between Bills which are purely financial in effect as well as in form and those which though containing some financial provisions, are also calculated to attain non-financial objects, the method of discriminating between these two classes of bills, and the consequences which ought to follow from such discrimination.45. It is recognised on all hands that Bills of a purely financial nature belong to the House of Commons alone and ought not to be rejected or amended by the Second Chamber.But Avhat is a purely financial Bill ?A similar remark applies to a suggestion made by one of our members that, were a federation of the United Kingdom to be effected, it might by a transfer of legislative powers to subordinate parliaments so reduce the likelihood of disagreements between the two Houses as to make any large change in the composition of the Second Chamber unnecessary. This also was doomed to lie outside the Terms of Reference.
A Bill brought into the House of Commons whether to raise revenue or to appropriate revenue for particular public purposes may, while purporting to be concerned only with the raising and spending of money, have effects industrial, commercial, social or political effects more important and far reaching than would be its direct financial effects. Many large changes indeed some revolutionary changes might be carried through by measures purporting to be financial. The Conference thought that, if the new Second Chamber, elected as proposed, is to be of real service, its views ought to be heard regarding such changes. It would appear to be required, in the interests of the people, and that not merely as taxpayers, but as citizens also, that such measures should not be hastily hurried into law without due con-sideration : and a Second Chamber constituted as proposed would seem fitted to furnish a safeguard for this purpose. The jealousies and antagonisms which have in time past attached to the action of a non-representative House confined to the members of one, and that, for the most part, a wealthy, class, need not be expected to apply to the action, strictly limited as the Conference think it should be, of a Second Chamber so much changed in its composition and so popular in its character as it will be under the Scheme hereinbefore described. If this be admitted, the question is raised : How are purely financial Bills to be discriminated from others which, while to some extent and for some purposes financial, are also much more important in their non-financial effects than in those that relate merely and directty to the raising and spending of monev ?46. The obvious method might appear to be to find a clear and precise definition which could be inserted in a statute for distinguishing these two kinds of Bills. The Confer-ence spent many hours in trying to find such a definition, but without success. Some proved to be too wide, others too narrow. The complexity of the problem, and the variety of the cases which had to be provided for, were baffling; and very high authorities who were consulted declared that this had been their experience also. But an examina-tion of the cases of doubt which had arisen in this country and elsewhere, showed that most, perhaps nearly all of them, could have been disposed of after a not very protracted discussion round a table by a dozen practical fair-minded men ; and the Conference was thus led to believe that the best method of treating these doubtful and disputable Bills would be to refer them to a small carefullv selected Joint Standing Committee of both Houses of Parliament, making its decision final. Such an arrangement for deciding these delicate questions seemed preferable to that contained in the Parliament Act, which does not cover all the cases likely to arise, and which places on the Speaker responsibilities with which it is not desirable to load an office whose perfect impartialit)7 every one desires to preserve. The Conference accordingly recommends that such a Finance Committee, which ought not to exceed in number seven members from each House, be set up at the beginning of each Parliament, and that either House should be entitled to refer to it any financial Bill containing provisions which raise serious issues that may be thought to be not solely of a financial nature. It would be the duty of such a Committee to consider not only the professed objects, but.also the underlying purpose and the probable effects of such a Bill, in order to determine its character and to report which (if any) of its clauses are, as being strictly financial, fit to be dealt with by the House of Commons alone, and which (if any) may properly be subjected to examination and amendment by the Second Chamber in respect of the economic or social results to be expected from them, these being matters of general national policy. Should the Committee report in the latter sense, such provisions as were declared to be non-financial, would be open to rejection and amendment by the Second Chamber, subject always to the ancient rule that no amendments should be made by the Second Chamber which could increase any charge upon the people. If amendments were made in bills declared to be non-financial, and these were not accepted by the House of Commons, the differences between the two Houses would fall to be adjusted in the manner (to which I now pass) provided for the case of an ordinary non-financial Bill.ADJUSTMENT  OF DIFFERENCES  BETWEEN THE  TWO  HOUSES.47. The Conference then reached the last of the three subjects mentioned in our Terms of Reference, viz., the Adjustment of differences between the two Houses. This has long been regarded as one of the most difficult of all the questions affecting the position and powers of a Second Chamber.   It divides itself into two branches :(a) The methods of conciliation and compromise by which differences may besettled without any ultimate trial of strength.(b) Some plan for final settlement when no  compromise  has  been  foundattainable.
48. (a) Conferences between the two Houses to settle their differences have been an old part of Parliamentary machinery. They have however been of comparatively slight value, and little used in recent years, because the rules which governed them were stiff and cumbrous. It is therefore proposed to apply a simpler and more elastic method, which is really new, though it may fitly be called by the old name of Free Conference. The suggestion is that a small number of the most experienced, most judicious and most trusted members of each House be chosen at the beginning of each Parliament, due representation being given to all the parties that may exist in each House, to form a Standing Conference Committee, and that another smaller number be added by each House of persons who, while possessing the same merits as belong to the permanent element, should also possess in addition a special knowledge of the particular matter to be dealt with in the particular controversy. The permanent number might, it was thought, be twenty from each House, in order that.the body should not be too large for easy and informal discussion and should not be liable to be moved by that warmth of feeling which is apt to increase with the numbers of any assembly. The number of additional members to be added pro re natd in respect of special knowledge would be determined bv the magnitude of the issue involved, but ought not (it was deemed) to exceed ten from each House, so that the total number of the body should not in any case exceed sixty.49. When the Free Conference Committee thus constituted had been set up, any amendments made by either House to a Bill passed hy the other, would, if they were not accepted by that other House, stand referred at the request of either House, to the Free Conference. The Free Conference would then address itself to the solution of the con-troversy by friendly methods, exploring the various points involved and seeking to find a way out of the difficulty either by compromise or by discovering some new plan which might prove more acceptable to both Houses than that contained in the Bill passed by one House, or in the amendments passed by the other. If and when agreement is reached by the Free Conference its terms would be reported to both Houses. Each House would then consider them and accept them or reject them. If they were accepted by both Houses en bloc the controversy would be at an end, and the Bill would be in a position to receive the assent of the Crown. If, however, the Bill (as reported by the Free Conference) was accepted by one House but rejected by the other, some further method of effecting an adjustment wrould be required.   To this point I return below.50. It may be asked whether the Free Conference should sit in private or in public. The view taken was that its proceedings should be conducted in secret, for only thus can perfect freedom of discussion be secured. Its members ought to be at liberty to make suggestions for compromise without prejudice to their owrn subsequent action in further sittings or when the matter comes before each House as a whole. A record of the proceedings wrould be kept, and would state, unless the Free Conference should otherwise determine, the numbers voting in each division, but would not give the names of Members voting. Whether this record should be published along with the Report might be left to the Free Conference to determine.51. Another question is, Should it be open to either House to require the reference to the Joint Standing Committee of a Bill rejected in toto by the other House ?We hope and believe that when the system of Free Conferences has been established, rejections of a Bill will rarely occur. It would be generally felt more desirable that objections taken to a Bill should be set forth in amendments made to it. But if a Bill were rejected, and either House wished the issues raised to be referred to a Free Conference, it was thought that this method of endeavouring to secure agreement need not be ruled out.52. (b) The question remains to be considered whether, in the event of a corn-promise having been found unattainable by means of a Free Conference, some other, and, if so, what plan should be resorted to for the purpose of obtaining a final settlement of differences between the two Houses.Suppose, for instance, that the proposals for adjustment reported by the Free Con-ference have been accepted by one House and rejected by the other, what further steps would be required to solve the deadlock ?Three such methods were put forward for consideration and were very carefully examined.53. The first was that the House which accepted the Bill as reported by the Free Conference should have the right of referring it to a Joint Sitting of both Houses. The Bill would then be discussed by the members of both Houses united together (as they were before the Lords and Commons began to sit apart) in the Great Council of the Nation in Parliament assembled, and, if not there settled by agreement, its fate would be decided by a vote of the whole united body.   This plan had obtained influential
support some years ago when the subject was considered by a Committee of the House of Lords. But though some advantages it presented were recognised, obvious objections presented themselves in respect of the great size of the united body, the various difficulties attending its procedure, and the possibility that its presence in the back-ground might make agreement in a Free Conference less probable. Thus it finally failed to command general assent.54. A second plan was that of referring the matters in controversj&apos; between the Houses to the country by means of a Referendum or popular vote of all the registered electors. This proposal received considerable support, and some who favoured it remain of opinion that it is the best method of solving deadlocks. They desire that when the two Houses have failed to agree to a Bill as reported from the Free Conference it should be open to the House of Commons to submit the Bill as approved by the Free Conference to a vote of the people&apos;. The vote might take place at a date to be fixed by Order in Council not less than sixty days after the House of Commons had passed the Resolution asking for a Referendum, or, if it were judged convenient by the Government, the Order in Council might fix the next General Election as the time for the vote. If the result of the vote were adverse to the Bill, the Bill would be dead. If the result of the vote were favour-able, the House of Commons would have authority to submit the Bill to Royal Assent without the concurrence of the Second Chamber, By this method it was thought, the essential principle of self government that the people must in the last resort themselves decide what legislation they desire, would be applied without invading the representative character of the House of Commons or diminishing its proper authority as a representa-tive assembly. It was further urged, in support of this plan, that the knowledge that the possibility of a reference to the people might ultimately be resorted to would greatly stimulate and strengthen conciliatory influences within the Free Conference and commonly lead to the adjustment of differences by mutual concession between the contending parties55. The majority of the Conference, however, did not approve this plan on the ground (among others) that the use of die Referendum once introduced could not be confined to the cases for which it was in this instance proposed, tnat it might tend to lower the authority and dignity of Parliament, and that it was unsuited to the conditions of a large country, and especially of the United Kingdom, for different parts of which different legislation is sometimes required.56. When it appeared that the judgment of the Conference as a whole did not favour either of the two plans above stated, it became necessary to search for some other method of adjustment. This was at last discovered by returning to and carrying further that mode of proceeding by Free Conference which has been already outlined.It has been already observed that if a Bill reported from a Free Conference had been accepted by one House but rejected by the other some further step would be required. This step would be to send the Bill back to the Free Conference, which would take up the matter again in the Session next following that in which the Bill originated, if the Free Conference should then, after further consideration, again report the Bill to the Houses in the same form in which it had been previously reported, the Houses would again consider the Bill.If they both agreed to it, it would pass ; if they both disagreed to it, or if the House of Commons alone disagreed, it would lapse. If, however, the House of Commons alone agreed to the Bill, and it had been reported by the Free Conference by a majority of not less than three of the members present and voting, it would be submitted for the Royal Assent.Should the Free Conference however fail to agree to report the Bill again in the same form, or if the majority by which it agreed to report it should be less than three the Bill would lapse, unless of course it was accepted by both Houses as reported.57. It will be clear that the effect of this procedure would be on the one hand to secure that full opportunity should be given for reconciling different views by amendments and methods of compromise generally, and on the other hand to provide that nothing less than a majority of three in the Free Conference (which will itself consist of selected members of both Houses) a majority which would be substantial having regard to the numbers of the Conference would suffice to determine the points in issue. This would, it is submitted, safeguard the rights of both Houses, for the Second Chamber would not be overruled, unless a considerable proportion of those who represented it in the Free Conference had voted in favour of the Bill, while the ultimate control of the more popular House would be respected.58. It is believed that by this method of Free Conferences, applied in a calmer atmosphere than could be expected in either House as a whole, the arguments on which each
party relied, would be better appreciated. Many controversies might thus be amicably settled, and even where they were not wholly settled, the matters in dispute would probably be reduced in number, so that, when the plan proposed for decision in the last resort had to be applied, the issues to be submitted to such final arbitrament wrould have become fewrer and more clearly defined.59. In order to prevent any possibility of confusion between the three different Joint Committees of both Houses recommended for different purposes by the Conference, i.e.1. The Joint Committee for the election of a portion of the Second Chamber.2. The Joint Committee for deciding questions with regard to Financial Bills.3. The Joint Committee (or Free Conference) for conferring about differences of opinion Avith regard to questions of general legislation,the following Table, in which their functions, method of composition, &amp;c, are detailed, is given.It may be added in support of this extended application of the machinery of Joint Committees that the Conference hoped that by such means there might be attained a better understanding and closer co-operation between the tAvo Houses of Parliament, than it has in the past been found possible to secure..Table of Joint Standing Committees recommended to be Set Up, showingtheir Composition, Functions, &amp;c.Title.

Some of these wall, it is to be hoped, be dropped, or reduced in force, Avhen the explanations given have been duly considered and Avhen each part of the scheme is regarded in its relation to the whole, and apart from any bias Avhich may have arisen from former controversies. If other objections still remain, the best answer to them will be found in the fact that among the Second Chambers Avhich exist in other countries there is not one Avhose composition cannot be attacked on grounds at least as grave as any that can be brought against this scheme, yet there is none among these Chambers wdnch does not, in the opinion of its own people, contribute to the goud government and tranquillity of the Country Avhere it exists. Perfection is not to be expected in any Chamber or in any frame of gOA^ernment. The true test is Avhether it is so constructed as to offer a reasonable prospect of so discharging the functions for which it is designed as to contribute to the excellence of legislation and the Avelfare of the whole body politic.61. Those avuo criticise will, Ave trust, appreciate the nature, and weigh the difficulties, of the task imposed upon us. We had to reconcile the sentiment of attachment to a venerable institution wuth the needs of new social conditions and the demands of neAv phases of thought.   There wrere two principles on which a Second Chamber might be
constructed. One was tbat of filling a House with the largest available number of capable and experienced men whose presence would win for it that kind of authority which comes from personal eminence. The other principle was that of creating a Chamber which should be most quickly resjDonsive and most fully responsible to public opinion, drawing its strength from the fact that it had been popularly elected. It was impossible to give full scope and application to either of these principles and to secure in ample measure the benefit of either source of strength without losing some of the merits to be expected from the other. We had, therefore, to find means whereby to combine as many as possible of the advantages with as few as possible of the defects of either course, and we had to remember that a plan which philosophers might approve would not necessarily find like favour with the bodies by whose will it would have to pass into law. So, too, when the powers of the Second Chamber had to be defined, similar perplexities asose. It was generally agreed that a Second Chamber would be of little use unless it were strong enough to differ from the House of Commons when a proper occasion arose a proper occasion being one in which there was reason to believe that some decision of the Commons did not express the full and deliberate will of the people. But it was also agreed that the Second Chamber ought not to be so strongly entrenched as to dispose it to &quot;engage in frequent contests with the House of Commons, so as to embarrass the Executive and clog the wheels of legislation. It thus became necessary to steer a middle course between these extremes, assigning to the Second Chamber such powers only as the interests of the nation seem to require and finding expedients by which differences between the Houses might he adjusted with the minimum of friction and delay, avoiding conflicts by methods of conciliation.62. On a subject which presents so many aspects as that we have had to deal with there must needs be differences of opinion. All political parties were represented in the Conference. But such divergences of view as from time to time arose did not often spring from or correspond to divergences of political opinion. They were due rather to the greater or less weight wmich our members respectively attached to principles they all admitted, and also to the diverse conjectures that were formed about the probable working out in practice of the various plans presented. In such matters a diversity of views is inevitable among men of independent minds. It has not prevented the great majority of the Conference from recommending the scheme here drawn out, though some members dissent, as mentioned in paragraph 22, from the plan of election by Members of the House of Commons acting in geographical groups, and other members have respectively preferred various other methods of election which have not received the support of the majority of the Conference, while one or two members thought that the powers of the Second Chamber should be more restricted than the majority deemed requisite.63. I may perhaps be permitted to add a word as Chairman of the Conference. One of the things that most struck me in presiding over the long and animated discussions of the Conference, was that every member was not only scrupulously careful to avoid recrimination over past controversies, but also recognised, above and beyond all differences of opinion, the fairness and goodwill of his colleagues, and gave to each and all of them the credit of honestly and sincerely seeking what was best for the country without thought of the special interest of his own class or party. Whatever judgment may be passed on our labours we hope that the Conference will be felt to have addressed itself with a single and an earnest mind to the duty that was assigned to it the duty of trying to reconstruct upon lines fitted to the conditions of our time an important part of that ancient and famous Constitution which many nations have taken as a model and which has for more than seven centuries safeguarded the liberties and advanced the greatness of the British people.Commending the conclusions embodied in this Report to the consideration of your-self and your colleagues,I have the honour to be, my dear Prime Minister,Very faithfully yours,April, 1918. BRYCE.

B.  POWERS OF THE SECOND CHAMBER WITH REGARD TOFINANCIAL BILLS.1. The Second. Chamber shall not have power ta amend or reject a Financial Bill as hereinafter defined.2. Any Bill which has been ordered by the House of Commons to be brought in upon Resolutions reported from the Committee of Ways and Means, or from a Committee of the whole House (to the appointment of which Committee the Royal recommendation has been signified) shall, if at any time before the Third Reading in the House of Commons the Member ia charge of the Bill, or the House of Commons by Resolution claims that it is a Financial Bill, be deemed to be a Financial Bill, unless the Appointed Authority (constituted as hereinafter provided) decides that the Bill is not a Financial Bill.3. If the Member in charge of the Bill claims that a Bill is a Financial Bill, he shall announce that claim to the House of Commons before the Bill passes its Third Reading, and Mr. Speaker shall cause that claim to be entered in the Journals of the House, and when the Bill is sent to the Second Chamber, the Clerk of the House of Commons shall inform the Second Chamber that the Bill is claimed to be a Financial Bill.4. Either House may by resolution, at any time when the Bill is before it, refer a Bill which is claimed to be a Financial Bill, to the Appointed Authority to consider-(a) Whether such Bill contains provisions of a non-financial character which shouldmore properly be introduced as a separate Bill or Bills.(b) Whether the Bill, though in form a Financial Bill, is of such a character thatits non-financial effects are more important than are those of a purely financial nature.5. (a) If the Appointed Authority is of opinion that the Bill contains ncn-financial provisions which should be separated from the financial provisions, it, shall order the Bill to be divided so as to bring the non-financial provisions together into a separate Bill. And, in that case, the Bills shall proceed in all further stages as separate Bills, the one a Bill which the Second Chamber cannot reject or amend, the other a Bill which the Second Chamber can reject or amend.(b) If the Appointed Authority is of opinion that the Bill is of such a character that the non-financial effects are more important than are those of a purely financial nature, it shall report that the Bill is not a Financial Bill within the meaning of this provision, and iii that case the Second Chamber may deal with the Bill as a Non-Financial Bill, but shall not have power so to amend the Bill as to increase any charge on the people or on the public funds.In either ease the Appointed Authority may, without making any order, indicate the provisions which it would be necessary to omit or amend in order that the Bill shall be treated as a Financial Bill.6. The Second Chamber shall not have power to initiate any Bill, which if brought in in the House of Commons, would have been brought in on Resolutions (as specified in Section 2). Any Bill initiated in the Second Chamber may be referred by either House, while the Bill is before it, to the Appointed Authority for its decision whether it is or is not a Financial Bill.7. The decision of the Appointed Authority shall be reported to both Houses and shall be final.8. The above recommendations shall apply mutatis mutandis to financial provisions contained in a Bill as well as to any Bill as a whole, the test as to what is or is not a financial provision being the same in both cases.9. For the purpose of the above recommendations., Bills and provisions dealing with local rates shall not be held to fall within the category of Financial Bills or financial provisions, and the Second Chamber shall have, power to deal with matters affecting local rates.Constitution of Appointed Authority.10. The Authority referred to above shall be constituted as follows : At the beginning of every Session each House shall appoint seven members, who shall together constitute the &quot; Joint Committee on Financial Bills,&quot; for the purpose of reporting on Bills that may be referred them in the manner mentioned above.
11. The Joint Committee shall choose their own Chairman who either may be one of their own body, in which case he shall have a second or casting vote, or may be chosen from outside from members of either House of Parliament, in which case he shall vote only when the voices are equal.C.  ADJUSTMENT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES.iFREE CONFERENCES.I. When a Bill passed by one House has been rejected by the other House, or passed by it with amendments to which the first House has refused to agree, either House may by Resolution demand the reference of the Bill to a Free Conference.2. When either House has passed such a Resolution, the Bill shall thereupon stand referred to a Free Conference, which shall be constituted in the manner provided for below.Appointment of Free Conferences. 3. A Free Conference shall consist of(a) Twenty members of each House appointed at the beginning of each Parliamentby the Committee of Selection in each House, in such a manner as to enable expression to be given to the various sections of opinion in that House. This body shall be entitled the &quot; Joint Standing Committee of Conferences.&quot;(b) Ten members of each House, added by the Committee of Selection to theJoint Standing Committee on the occasion of the reference of any particular Bill, to form with the Joint Standing Committee the &quot; Free Conference &quot; on the Bill.4. The proceedings in a Free Conference shall be secret, but it shall be open to the Conference to decide what report, if any, of any particular proceedings shall ultimately be made public.5. An official Record shall be kept of all the proceedings of a Free Conference and shall be printed.6. The Report of a Free Conference shall be made to both Houses simultaneously, and shall contain the recommendations of the Free Conference with regard to a suggested basis of agreement between the two Houses in the form of a Bill, and shall state whether its conclusions have been reached unanimously or by a majority, and shall state the numbers but not the names of members voting on either side in any division that may have been taken in the Free Conference.7. When a Bill has been referred to a Free Conference, the Free Conference shall have power to deal with the Bill as a whole in such manner as may seem to them calculated to bring about an agreement between the two Houses.8. After a Bill has been referred to the Free Conference and the Free Conference has reported it with or without amendment to the two Houses, neither House may amend the Bill, and the only question that shall be put on the Bill shall be, &quot; That this House agrees with the Bill as reported by the Free Conference.&quot; This question shall be put to both Houses, and if it passes in both Houses in the affirmative, the Bill in the form in which it was reported from the Free Conference shall be presented to His Majesty for the Royal Assent.9. If the Bill as leported by the Free Conference is accepted by one House but rejected by the other House, it shall be referred back to the Free Conference in the Session next following that in which the Bill originated ; and if the Free Conference then reports that it has accepted the Bill in the same form by a majority of not less than three of those present and voting, the Bill, if then approved by both Houses or by the House of Commons alone, shall be presented to His Majesty for the Royal Assent.10. If the Free Conference fails to pass the Bill again in the same form or passes it by a majority of less than three, the Bill shall lapse, unless both Houses accept the Bill as reported by the Free Conference.II. If a prorogation of Parliament occurs at a time when a Bill has been referred to a Free Conference, such Bill shall be carried over to the following Session, without any suspensory Order being necessary, and proceedings upon it may be resumed and shall be brought to a conclusion, including the final stage of presentation to His Majesty for the Royal Assent, in that Session.12, The Clerk of the Parliaments shall act as Clerk to the Free Conference.
