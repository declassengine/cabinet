August 1918.SECRET.G.-217.WAR CABINET.SOLDIERS&apos; AND SAILORS&apos; PAY COMMITTEE.Sixth and Supplementary Report.Previous papers G.-154, G.-172, G.-188, G.-193, G.-207, G.T.-5148, G.T.-5203, and War Cabinet 235 (13), 280 (11), 320 (8), 349 (10), 364 (13), 435 (10), 449 (15), and 451 (10).Covering Note by Chairman, Mr. G. N. Barnes, M.P.(G.-217A.)HEREWITH I circulate a report of the above Committee re separation ailow-ances. The matter is perfectly plain as regards wives and children, 45. Qd. being added on to the children&apos;s allowances where there are two or more children, the mother with one child getting 2s. Qd. more than at present. The wife without children remains as at present.We have discussed very fully the much-vexed question of the parents&apos; allowance. The claim which has always been put up is that of the parents of the young man who joined in the early days of the war, and whose wages, had he remained in civil life, would have been sufficient by the time of the Conscription Act coming into operation to have contributed to the support of the parents. I thought the matter could have been adjusted by powers being given to the Local Pensions Committees and the Pensions Special Grants Committee to deal with cases on merit, and on application. There was general agreement, however, on the part of the Admiralty, War Office. Air Ministry, and Ministry of Pensions that this was impossible. The accumula-tion was too great, and the machine was quite unfitted for the work. We had therefore to face the question of the flat rate and the alternative proposition, as between 3s. Qd. and 5s. to the parents of young men on attaining 21 years of age, or up to 23 if the young man had joined before that age. The Committee adopted the 3s. Qd. because that is now a well-known figure and because it was felt that the granting of a separation allowance to the parents as a right (but only on application being made) would lead to a demand for pensions to parents whose sons had been killed. The figure of separation allowance would determine the figure of pension. On the other hand,the 3s. 6^. will leave a great deal of work of an administrative character in the way of supplementation, and will involve delay in dealing with individual applications.. It -was felt, however, that the lesser evil would be to impose such additional work on the Local Pensions Committee and the Special Grants Committee, rather than risk a demand for the larger amount being paid as pension.Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Eorster have put in minority reports, as they are not convinced that a case has been made out for any addition on the flat rate basis; they felt, however, that further effort should be made to deal with individual cases by administrative machinery.(Initialled.)

REPORT. (G.-217.)1. In this Sixth and Supplementary Report the Committee deals with the questions of an increase in separation allowance and the issue of separation allow-ance to the parents of unmarried apprentices, students, and youths on progressive wages.The Committee was reassembled in accordance with War Cabinet 411, minute 26, when the War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which stated that he had promised the House of Commons that the Government would consider the question of the rate of separation allowances now being paid to the wives and dependants of soldiers and sailors.2. The Committee ;have held four meetings, and now submit the following report.3. The Committee considered that it was desirable to deal with the two questions of a general increase in the rate of separation allowances now paid and the payment of separation allowances to the parents of apprentices, &amp;c, separately, the latter question being one which had not. been.previously dealt with.I. Wives and Children.4. In view of the grants already payable, and the amount of annual commit-ments which they entailed, the Committee decided to review the present scale of allowances now payable.After due consideration of all the figures put forward by the Admiralty and War Office, the Committee summarise their recommendations under this heading as follows: (a.) That no alteration should be made in the rates laid down for a wife only, orfor children over 14 years of age. (6.) That where there is one child under the age of 14 in the family, the weeklyrate of separation allowance shall be increased by 2s. Qd. (c.) That where there are two or more children under the age of 14 in thefamily, the weekly rate of separation allowance shall be increasedby&apos;4s. U.(d.) For motherless children under 14 years of age the weekly rate of separation allowance for one child maintained in a home shall be increased by 3s.(e.) That the weekly rate, of separation allowance for the second and subse-quent motherless children maintained in one home shall be increased by Is. for each child.(/.) That these increased allowances shall be payable as from the first pay-dav in October, 1918.It is estimated that-the cost of the above proposals will be approximately 14,000,0007. a year for the three Services.II.-Issue of Allowances to the Parents of Unmarried Asp-prentices, Students, andYouths on Progressive Wages.5:. Fjependants&apos; allowance is based on the net contribution made by the soldier to the parents before enlistment.In &quot;the. early days of the war many lads joined the Colours before they had begun to earn sufficiently, whether by.reason of apprenticeship, secondary education, or other causes, and no dependants&apos; allowance therefore was issuable to their parents-Many others remained in civil life until called up under the Military Service Acts. Wages had risen rapidly meanwhile, and they were able to make substantial weekly payments to their parents before enlistment, and dependants&apos; allowance was payable on their becoming soldiers.Thus the parent of the lad who waited; till conscripted is entitled to an allow-ance, while the parent of the lad who volunteered early in the war is not so entitled,
except in so far as the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions grant allowances to parents of unmarried men who at the time of enlistment were appren-tices or students. These allowances are given where a contribution is shown to be necessary for the upkeep of the home.This is felt to be a great hardship, and the hardship is accentuated by the fact that pension on the soldier&apos;s death depends on the allowance his parents drew while he was alive. Broadly speaking, where there was no allowance in life, there is no pension on death, except in so far as that if at any time either or both of the parents is or are wholly or partly incapable of self-support from infirmity or age and they are in pecuniary need, they may be granted a pension. Here, again, the parent of the early volunteer is worse off that the parent of the later conscript, and public feeling is deeply moved.But so long as pre-enlistment contribution is maintained as the basis of the parents&apos; allowance, the grievance cannot fully be remedied. We have therefore come to the conclusion that an exception should be made in the class of case alluded to above, and we recommend that when the soldier has attained 21 years of age, by which time he would have been able to make some contributions to the family income, some allowance should be paid to the parents.The Committee very carefully considered the possibility of investigation of individual cases. Such investigations could only be made by the Special Grants Committee and the Local War Pensions Committees. After full consideration and having consulted the Minister of Pensions it was agreed that not only was there not sufficient staff and accommodation available to deal with the very large amount of extra work involved, but that the inevitable delay in adjudicating on all cases would be so great that much agitation would arise.The Committee felt therefore that there was no alternative but to recommend that an allowance on a flat rate should be given to the parents of all sailors, soldiers, and airmen over the age of 21 and under the age of 23.No one can say with certainty what contribution the non-wage-earning lad would have been able to make had he remained in civil life. We therefore recommend that an allowance of 3s. Qd.* a week should be paid in respect of him.Consequent upon this it will be necessary to bring up to the same level the allowances of less amount which are at present paid, since it would be illogical to allow less to parents whose sons had contributed to their support than to those whose sons had not. In result, we recommend a minimum flat rate for the &quot; parents&apos; allow-ance&quot; of Zs. Qd.* a week. We also recommend that the Special Grants Committee&apos;s powers shall be extended to enable them to grant allowances up to the full State Separation Allowance limit in any case where a parent can show that an allowance is necessary, and that an unmarried son who enlisted under the age of 23 would, if in civil life, have been in receipt of wages sufficient to enable him to make a contribu-tion or a larger contribution to his parent. The actual amount of. the allowance given by the Special Grants Committee would be governed by the circumstances of the case.We consider that the flat rate allowance should be limited to those soldiers who have attained 21 years of age and who were under 23 on enlistment. Older men would have been in a position to earn full wages and to make full contribution to their parents&apos; support.The cost of this proposal is roughly estimated to amount to 4,500,0007.*It will follow that the parents will qualify for pension on their son&apos;s death, and the present grievance will be remedied.The cost of pensions is estimated at 2,200,000^.* for the year 1919-20, which will approximate to the maximum annual cost.We recommend that the allowances should date from the first pay day in October, but it must be recognised that owing to the immense number of cases to be dealt with it will not be possible for the Army to begin payment before the 1st November, and it will be several months after that date before the revision of Army allowances is completed.6. The Committee summarise their recommendations, under this heading, as follows: (a.) That a minimum allowance of 3s. 6e .* a week shall be payable on account of every soldier, sailor, or airman when he reaches the age of 21 while* See Note by the Secretary at end of Report.

serving, or if he joins after that age and under 23, and that the allow-ance already being given on the basis of dependence, if less than that amount, should be made up to it in the case of men fulfilling the foregoing conditions.(b.) That this allowance should cease on marriage, and will not be given if other dependants&apos; allowance is issued in respect of the sailor, soldier, or airman.(c.) That this separation allowance is not payable except on application from the sailor, soldier, or airman, or his parents.(d.) That the Special Grants Committee, part II, regulation 9 (b) shall be extended so as to cover all cases where a parent can show that an allow-ance is necessary, and that the son would have been receiving wages which would have enabled him to make a contribution if he had remained in civil life.(e.) That,this allowance shall be payable as from the first pay day in October 1918, and that the extension of the Special Grants Committee&apos;s regula-tions 9 (b) shall take effect from the same date.(f.) That the present rules governing the amount of maximum separation allow-ance payable on behalf of several men serving, in respect of each individual dependant, shall not be affected by reason of the establishment of this new allowance.(g.) That the word &quot;parent&quot; includes the grandparent or other person who has been in the place of a parent to a sailor, soldier, or airman, and has wholly or mainly supported him for not less than one year before enlist-ment.III. Supplementation of Separation Allowances.7. In taking into consideration the present rates of separation allowances payable to wives or dependants of sailors, soldiers, or airmen, the Committee had due regard to the present supplementation of separation allowances paid by the Special Grants Committee and the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee.A.- Cases dealt with by the Special Grants Committees and Local War Pensions Committees.(i.) These cases are dealt with by the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions, application being made to the Local Pensions Committee. The allow-ance to wives towards rent, insurance premiums, and other contractual obligations, is made up to a maximum of 12s., but not to exceed the difference between present income of the household and the pre-enlistment income, after allowing for the saving resulting from the man&apos;s enlistment. Where the contractual obligations exceed 125. a, week, the case is dealt with by the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee.(ii.) Similar allowances are made to dependants other than wives, but limited to the difference between the separation allowance paid and the dependence existing when the man joined.(iii.) In addition to allowances under (i) and (ii) the Committee can give an allowance up to IGs. a week, if there is still a difference between the present income and the income before the outbreak of war; after allowing for the saving from the man&apos;s enlistment.(iv.) An allowance is made to childless wives and dependants unable to work, not exceeding 45. a week, and in the case of dependants, two-thirds of dependence assessed for separation allowance purposes.(v.) An allowance is made for children over fourteen who are physically unfit, or are at school, or are apprentices.(vi.) The motherless children rate of 7s. can be raised to a sum not exceed-ing 95. 2d. When a&apos; motherless child requires special -medical care, the amount can be raised to 125. Qd.(vii.) The number of cases dealt with up to date cannot be given, as the Civil Liabilities Department, up to a recent date, dealt with all cases of contractual obliga-tions; but the expenditure of the Special Grants Committee for the above purposes, inclusive up to date, has been 1.393,9Q0Z.
B. Cases when the contractual obligations exceed V2s. a week are dealt with, as stated above, by the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Departmenti which is empowered to grant assistance in respect of: Rent.Interest and instalments payable in respect of loans, including mortgages. Instalments payable under agreements for the purchase of businesspremises, a dwelling house, furniture, and the like. Rates and taxes. Insurance premiums; and School fees.Grants may not be made at a rate exceeding 104Z. a year.(i.) Applications for assistance are investigated locally by barrister commis-sioners who report to the Department; the Department is assisted in dealing with applications by an Advisory Committee who frame general rules as to the basis of considering application, and decide the amount of grant to be awarded in special cases.(ii.) The regulations governing the Civil Liabilities Scheme provide that assis-tance may only be granted in cases of serious hardship, and the Advisory Committee have framed general working rules to serve as a test whether serious hardship arises in any case.(iii.) The Department has dealt with 407,300 cases and awarded grants in 292,000 cases (including cases of under 12s. a week now dealt with by the Pensions Committee).The present annual commitments amount to 4,628,000Z.8. Two Minority Reports are attached, one by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and one by the Financial Secretary to the War Office.(Initialled)        G. N. B.2. Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, July IQth, 1918. &apos;(Paper No. 80.)MINORITY REPORT NO. I. Note by Financial Secretary to Treasury.I regret to be unable to agree with the proposal to give separation allowance at the rate of 3s. 6^. a week to the parents of every unmarried sailor, soldier, or airman of the ages from 21 to 26.This wholesale grant, without any discrimination between cases in which special consideration is needed, and those in which the parents are in no need of assistance, would be unnecessarily expensive.No sufficient evidence has been produced to justify this expenditure. It is notorious that the parents of thousands upon thousands of young unmarried men serving in the forces have never been, and never would have been, supported by them, are in full vigour and earning good wages, and not in the least in need of further support.The number of cases which require special consideration must be relatively small. To give to all because it is difficult to set up machinery for the selection of the few deserving cases is a confession of administrative failure which is bound to have disastrous results.The grant would probably have effects similar to the first grant of 12^ per cent, to munitions workmen. It would spread beyond the extensive class to which it is now proposed to give it, and end by costing double or treble the original sum, estimated now at three million.There is nothing easier than to get local bodies to pass resolutions asking for additional expenditure at the expense of the Exchequer. To yield to such solicita-tions in the manner proposed is to set a public example of extravagance which will
be widely known, because advertised in hundreds of thousands of well-to-do house-holds, and will contrast very deplorably with the Government professions of economy.(Initialled)        S. B.Treasury, S.W., July 15, 1918.MINORITY REPORT NO. II.Note by Mr. Forster. I agree generally with Mr. Baldwin&apos;s note.With regard to the allowance for wives and children, I thing it right to direct attention to the fact that in a number of cases where there are two or more children, the increase proposed will bring the separation allowance to a sum higher than the full wages the soldier was able to earn in civil life. This is generally the case with agricultural labourers. The result is that the family will be substantially worse off when the soldier is discharged, and has to feed and find himself as well as his family out of the reduced income. This may well breed trouble in the future, and should not be overlooked.I consider that the necessities of the family could have been met by authorising Local Pension Committees to make the additional grants recommended in this report when they were satisfied that the need existed, and where the current rate of wages in the branch of industry in which the man had formerly worked is substantially in excess of the amount of the allowance.(Initialled)        H. W. F.War Office,July 16, 1918.Note by the Secretary.The Sixth and Supplementary Report was considered by the War Cabinet on the 19th and 24th July, 1918 (War Cabinets 449/15 and 451/10), and the following decisions were arrived at: (a.) The recommendations of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee dealing with the increased allowances for children as put forward under the heading &quot;Wives and Children &quot; in the Sixth and Supplementary Report of the Committee should be approved.(b.) That the recommendations of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee under the heading of &quot; Issue of Allowances to the parents of unmarried apprentices, students, and youths on progressive w^ages,&quot; as put forward in paragraph 5 of the Sixth and Supplementary Report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (G.-217) should be approved, subject to the amendment that the minimum fiat rate of parents&apos; allowances should be 5s. per week instead of 3s. Qd.The decision under (b) will increase the approximate cost of the proposal under paragraph II of the Report to 9,000,000Z., and the cost of pensions to an estimated sum of 2,600,000Z. for the year 1919-20, which will approximate to the maximum annual cost.LESLIE WILSON, Secretary,Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee.2, Whitehall Garden, S.W., July 25, 1918.
