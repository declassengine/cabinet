[This Document is the PropertyM His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1918.SECRET.G-212.THE IRISH QUESTION AND FEDERALISM.Note by Mr. Chamberlain.IN view of the discussion on Irish policy which must shortly take place in the Cabinet I would ask my colleagues to consider the following observations on the suggested federal solution of the problem. I understand and sympathise with the reluctance of men who are already overworked to take action upon problems of this novelty and magnitude. At the beginning of the war it was generally agreed that all contentious questions should be postponed till its conclusion, but it was not then foreseen how long the war would last, how many new problems would be created by it, or how great their urgency would be. Circumstances are too strong for us. We have been driven from this attitude in more than one matter, and we must recognise that it is no longer tenable.(1.) The Position of the Government..The Irish policy of the Government was announced just before I joined the Cabinet. It was the enforcement of conscription and the introduction of a measure -of Home Rule. These two measures were declared to be independent of one another except in point of time. But in point of ,time, at any rate as regards the first active steps in each, they were to be simultaneous. It is not now possible to proceed with either for the present. Looking back upon what has happened it is easy to say that the only chance for conscription was that the whole plan of the Government should have been carefully prepared before any announcement was made, and that it should have been enforced the moment the necessary powers were secured. It must be admitted, however, that the late Irish Administration had kept the Government very ill-informed about the real position of affairs, and that the time which has elapsed since the declaration was made lias rendered the situation infinitely more difficult. The position, therefore, nowT is that until the authority of Government has been re-estab-lished in Ireland and the rebellious conspiracy has been crushed, it is impossible to take any but voluntary measures for recruitment, and equally impossible, in face of the reaction of all sections of public opinion from even that measure of agreement which was reached by the Convention, to produce any scheme of Irish Government which was accepted by any Irish party.The declared policy of the Government is therefore for the moment impossible. Simply to abandon it or to postpone it indefinitely seems to me both humiliating and dangerous. The only other course open to us is to present the problem in a new light, or, better still, to present a new- and wider issue which will swallow up the old controversies.(2.) The Irish Problem.At least three attempts to solve the Irish problem by itself have now been made by purely Home Rule Governments. All of them have failed. More than one attempt has been made by recent Coalition Governments under Mr. Asquith and the present Prime Minister. They, too, have been unsuccessful. And I am convinced that our last effort, if it ever sees the light, will be equally unfortunate. I submit that this sequence of failure is not due to the incapacity of the Governments which have dealt with the subject, but to the impossibility of finding any solution of the problem within the limits which they set themselves. As long as Ireland is treated in isolation there is no answer to the interminable wrangle about Irish representation at Westminster. If the representation is maintained, it can be proved that it is unjust to Great Britain.   If it
is abolished it can be proved that it is merely disguised separation. This difficulty did much to wreck Mr.&apos;Gladstone^ two Bills, and it recurs at every consideration of the question. I mention it only as one illustration of the difficulties which spring from treating the Irish problem as a thing apart.But the problem set to the last Drafting Committee was much more difficult and even less capable of satisfactory solution. We were instructed to frame a Bill amending the Act of 1914, so as to bring it into harmony with the Report of the Irish Convention as modified by the decisions laid clown in the Prime Ministers letter. No one who has not gone through the Convention Report for this purpose will know how many questions it left wholly unsettled, or is likely to have clearly in mind the very qualified assent which many of the propositions in the Report received, and the very small majority of votes by which they were supported. On the other hand, the Act of 1914 is unworkable and is incompatible both with the conclusions of the Convention and with the decisions of the Prime Ministers letter. The result is that in ch-afting the Bill we -were forced to begin by taking away a great deal that was conceded iu the Act of 1914, then to depart widely from the recommendations of the Convention and then to invent a solution of questions which the Convention deliberately avoided because there was no hope of agreement being reached upon them. No Bill produced in these circumstances and subject to these conditions will give satisfaction to anyone concerned. Every contentious issue is raised in the most contentious form. It implies a series of compromises without any argumentative basis, and it results in a solution which at best can only be presented as a pis aller, and with no prospect of any general agreement.Considering, therefore, the question from the point of view of Irish Government only, I have come to the conclusion that the difficulties inherent in any attempt to -solve it by itself are so great that they will prevent success in the future as they have prevented success in the past. And again, I urge that our only chance of dealing satisfactorily with the matter is to present the problem in an entirely new form which, though it raises difficulties of its own, carries us beyond the narrow and embittered limits of past controversies.(3.) The British Problem.But now I would invite the Cabinet to dismiss Ireland for the moment and to consider the purely British position. We must all of us be impressed by the magnitude and diversity of the problems which the war has created. Mauy of the questions upon which political parties were concentrated before the war have lost their interest. A new order of questions has taken their place. The industrial and social reconstruction of the country and of society after the war, the restoration to civil life of the masses of men who have been withdrawn for military service, who will return with new ideas and new aspirations, and in many cases will be reluctant to re-enter the old grooves ; the bare provision, in the world shortage which the war has caused, of the supplies of food and raw materials required for the existence of our people these are problems of the first magnitude requiring the closest study and attention, and involving new, difficult, and complicated legislative and administrative action. How is it possible for one Government and one Parliament to deal adequately with all these matters and at the same time perform their functions as the great central organs of Government of the Empire &apos;? Mr. Long has dwelt upon the danger to our relations with the Dominions of the growing sense on the part of their Statesmen that we are too much involved in domestic difficulties to give proper attention to Imperial questions. But there is another danger which I think at least as great-The whole world is in ferment, and revolutionary ideas are stirring. It will be difficult enough to keep this movement within safe bounds under any circumstances, but if the task of Parliament is not lightened it will be found that it not merely does not pass urgently required legislation, but that it cannot even find time to discuss many of the problems involved. If that happens I believe that the effect upon our parliamentary institutions and our national life may be most serious. When parlia-mentary institutions break down, whether from lack of authority or from overwork, Bolshevism has its opportunity. Unless means can be found to devolve a part of its responsibilities on other bodies, and to set the Imperial Parliament free for the work which it alone can do, I think we shall be in grave danger of revolution before many years are passed.(4.J Advantages of dealing with both problems at the same time.I am led, therefore, to the conclusion that devolution has now become a necessity for Great Britain no less than for Ireland.   If this is so, there is every advantage in
treating the two problems together instead of attempting to solve them independently. Not only is [the present Irish demand far in excess of anything which any Liberal statesman has ever been prepared to grant, but it is wholly incompatible with a federal constitution. The Report of the Convention and the Act of 1914 are only one degree less incompatible with federal principles, but as long as the Irish problem is treated by itself the provisions of the Act of 1914 and the conclusions of the Convention will be the standards by which the provisions of any new Bill are judged. On the other hand, if the problem of the United Kingdom is treated as a whole, Irish demands will be seen in their true perspective, and many questions about which we should otherwise be involved in interminable argument will be settled by the logic of facts. It is, for instance, arguable that customs might be conferred upon Ireland. It is easier to make a case for granting the Irish Government power over excise. But it is impossible to conceive of a federal system for the United Kingdom under which the control of both customs and excise was not retained by the Central Government. Again, it is quite possible to confer upon the Irish Parliament complete control over the income tax, though that would give rise to many inconveniences, but it would be quite impossible for the Central Government to surrender the power of raising an income tax in England and Scotland. As it is with finance, so it is with other matters. The moment that it is agreed that the object is to establish a general federal system a limit is set to the possibility of disagreement as to the powers which can be devolved.(5.) Character of the Change involved.It is objected that this is a much bigger problem for which we are much less well prepared by previous discussion. I have already observed that in my view the very fact that the Irish question has been so much discussed and so long fought over renders any solution on the old lines infinitely more difficult. But I would add that I think the difficulty of treating the question as a whole, and even the greatness of the change involved, are exaggerated. It does not seem to be realised how far we have gone both in administration and legislation along this path of separation between the national forces of the three great divisions of the United Kingdom, and, in a lesser degree, of Wales. Most of the affairs to be devolved are already the subject of different laws and distinct administrations.t   It is true that these administrations aret Lord Selborne and Mr. Oliver have printed privately a scheme for federal devolution. From their pamphlet I take the following list of powers which it is suggested should be devolved. Those marked with an asterisk (i.e., ninetet-n out of their twenty-four heads) are already administered separately for Scotland and England.   Many are governed by separate laws.1.   Finance as limited by the Act.2. *Civil rights; property in land and other property in the Kingdom.3. *Local Government (including Poor Law) and municipal and other like institutions.4. *Publio Health and Quarantine.n. *Housing and town planning.6.   National Health and Unemployment Insurance.7. Industrial legislation, including the regulation, conditions, and wages of labour in shops, workshops, and factories, mines and other places ; trade and other industrial combinations, and the prevention or settle-ment of industrial disputes; labour exchanges, friendly and building societies, and all like matters.S.   Old Age Pensions.9. * Education in all branches. 10. *Franchise and elections, subject, to certain limitations.11. *The acquisition of property in the Kingdom, or by any public authority therein. 12. *Agriculture, including the regulation of importation for the sole purpose of preventing contagious diseases.13. *Inland waters and the navigation thereof.14. *Sea coast and inland fisheries, and the preservation of game.15. *Ecclesiastical affairs.   (lre&apos;and having no power to establish, endow, or disendow a church). 16. *The administration of justice, except in the Supreme Courts, including the constitution, maintenance,&apos; organisation, and procedure of those courts. 17. * Police.18. *Regulation of trade in intoxicating liquors.19. *Local works and undertakings within the Kingdom, unless declared by the Parliament of the United Kingdom national works.20. *The establishment and maintenance and management of hospitals, asylums, and charities in and for the United Kingdom, and the control of the insane and feeble-minded.,21.- *The establishment, maintenance, and management of public reformatories and prisons in and for the Kingdom.22. The imposition of punishments for enforcing any law of the Kingdom made in relation to.the above subjects.23. *Generally, all matters of merely local or private nature in the Kingdom. 24.   Any other subject delegated to the Kingdom legislatures by Parliament.
f4responsible to, and the laws are passed by, a single Parliament, but in practice they are for the most part governed by the separate national sentiment of the countries with which they deal, i think it will be found that as regards division of powers there would be no great difficulty in arriving at agreement. The problem which has not yet been considered, and which specially requires consideration, is of another order. It is in the first place what financial resources can be placed at the disposal of these new bodies, and in the second place what the constitution of the local Parliaments should be. The first is a point which might be examined by a strong financial committee ; the second is one upon which we might invite the assistance of something in the nature of a convention or conference either separately constituted for England, Scotland, and Wales, or in one body dealing with them all.(6.) Conclusions.The conclusions to which I invite the assent of the Cabinet are therefore 1. That the attempt to solve the Irish question in isolation has always failed and is doomed to failure.2. That the problem of decentralisation is no longer an Irish problem only, but that such decentralisation would be required by Great Britain even if there were no Irish question.3. That the change involved, great as it is, is much less than is commonly supposed, that this deferentiation already exists largely in the sphere both of legislative and executive action, and that its recognition by the establish-ment of local Parliaments is a less formidable task than is generally supposed.Under these circumstances, and as it is impossible under any circumstances to proceed with the Irish Bill at the present time, I would urge that the opportunity should be taken to frame a federal scheme for the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that we should appoint a Commission to enquire into the advisability of a federal solution. I see no advantage in this course. I do not think that any of us would be much influenced by the report of a Commission upon questions of general expediency, which we are as competent to judge as the members of the Commission themselves. A roving enquiry into the theoretical advantages or disadvantages of a federal system and the precise applicability of this or that foreign analogy to our own circumstances would settle nothing, and at the conclusion of it we should have made no advance. If, on the other hand, a Commission is instructed to take as a working hypothesis that a federal solution is desirable, and to prepare upon this basis the most suitable scheme for the United Kingdom, we shall then have practical and definite proposals before us upon which action can be taken if it is desired.I have only to add that I have employed the word federalism because I find it in common use to describe the thing which I mean. It has been objected that it is inapplicable to the reform by decentralisation of a centralised Government and only fittingly employed for the contrary process of creating a central organ of Government for previously independent States. It seems to me that this is an unimportant question of terminology. Travellers may proceed along the great North Road northwards from London or southwards from Edinburgh. They will meet somewhere en route, and the name of their meeting place will not be affected by the direction from which they come. The process which we are asked to consider is one of decentralisation or devolution. The process in Australia and South Africa was one of decentralisation, but the result in both cases is a federal constitution.A. C.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., June 17, 1918.o
