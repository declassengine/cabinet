[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Mqjeatys Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1919.SECRET. G.-240.WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON A PHYSICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTION FOR THENAVY.(Reference War Cabinet 479 (12).)Terms of Reference.1. The terms of our reference were to enquire into the proposal of the Admiralty that a Physical Research Institution be established for the Navy. We were directed to have regard in our enquiry to the work of existing institutions, such as the National Physical Laboratory, to the steps now being taken for the furtherance of Research under the schemes of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to the requirements of other War departments, and to the possibilities of amalgamating research work common to these services.. Introductory.2. In pursuance of our enquiry, we obtained from the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, and the Ministry of Munitions, respectively, statements as to their existing facilities for research work, with details of the Institutions they maintained or utilised for research. We also got from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research particulars of the various activities of that department.We have received evidence from: Sir H. Frank Heath, K.C.B.; Sir Ernest Rutherford, F.R.S.; Sir Richard Threlfall K.B.E., F.R.S.; Sir Alfred Keogh, G.C.B.; Sir Robert Robertson, K.B.E., F.R.S.; Sir Dugald Clerk, K.B.E., F.R.S.; and Major-General R. M. Ruck, C.B.We have discussed the organisation of research from the point of view of the War Services, the co-ordination of the research work which these services require, and arrangements by which they could obtain a large measure of advantage from the current researches carried on for general, scientific, or industrial purposes. These are matters of moment, and we have set down as an appendix to this report the considerations and suggestions which arise on our review of the position. All that has come before us points to the need for greater co-ordination, but we have not explored the matter sufficiently to enahle us to make a definite recommendation with j regard to this. 13. We have taken special cognisance of these considerations as applied to the requirements to which the Admiralty have drawn attention, and we find that the field for investigation in physics and in the applications of physical principles includes a considerable area in which naval interests are so immediate and so dominant that provision for the necessary research work should be made under the naval authorities. Our recommendations as to the nature and extent of this special provision are conditioned by the increasing encouragement which is being afforded otherwise for scientific research, by the special nature of the facilities which arc; required for many researches connected with the sea, and by the certainty that some of the results of such researches will be of great material benefit to national maritime interests other than those of the Navy.
The Proposed Physical Research Institution for the Navy.- 4. The essential basis of the proposal for a Physical Research Institution for the Navy is given in the following extract from the Admiraltv Memorandum of the 16th September, 1918 (G.T.-5702):-&quot; It will be difficult in the future to maintain naval supremacy, or keep abreast of developments in other countries, unless the fullest and most immediate use is made of all possible applications of science, and it is obvious that the submarine menace would have been much less serious and less difficult to combat had a complete study been made, prior to the war of, for example, the principles of the transmission of sound and the penetration of electrical radiation through water. Such principles require exhaustive study on the purely scientific side before their applicability to naval purposes can be established, and this study should be made in close co-operation with the Navy &apos; and under conditions which secure a reasonable degree of secrecy.&quot; In order that the fullest facilities for research work of such vast importance to naval effort should be available, it is considered essential that the Navy should have an institution of its own, which could survey the whole field of physics for principles suitable for application to naval problems, and could make, further researches to test whether such principles show promise of utility.&quot; Such fundamental researches would be of a more varied and general character than the existing scientific departments of the Navy could undertake, and, in view of the magnitude of the undeveloped field for research, the absence of commercial inducements likely to attract private enterprise to this branch of study and the necessity of the institution being confidentially informed as to naval policy, it is thought that a separate institution for the Navy is a necessity, although its work would be carried on in close connection with the National Physical Laboratory, which devotes its energies to research and investigation for the benefit of manufacturers generally, and various commercial interest which employ it.&quot;*5. In their Memorandum of the 15th May, 1918, on Naval Research Laboratories for Physics, Sir J. J. Thomson, Sir E. Rutherford, and Sir R. Threlfall discussed with some detail the nature and advantages of such an organisation as the Admiralty propose to establish. Referring to the purely scientific side of research in physics, they say: &quot; . . . it is important that the Navy should have a department of its own for such work. This department would have two functions: (1) to survey the whole field of physics for principles suitable for application to naval problems, (2) to make further researches to test whether these principles show promise of utility. Such fundamental researches would be of a more varied and general character than is possible to undertake in existing scientific departments of the Navy.&quot;In their statement developing the idea of such an institution they included the following suggestions, which we cite in illustration of the purposes for which provision is desired, and of the methods by which these might be promoted: (a.) A Naval Research Laboratory for Physics should be established within easy access of London, and facilities should be provided for experimental work at sea stations and at sea.(&amp;.) The director of the laboratory should be kept informed as to naval policy so as to be in a position to direct research along the right lines.(c.) The scientific staff should maintain close contact with the technical departments and with the officers of the Navy, in order to know their requirements and to advise on scientific matters generally.(d.) The officers of the Navy should be encouraged to interest themselves in the scientific methods ana principles underlying the technical appliances with which they, have to deal, and adequate facilities should be offered to selected naval officers who have shown scientific promise to undertake investigations under the direction of the department.* See also as to the National Physical Laboratory in $ 7 of the Appendix to this Report, (p. 7.)
(e.) The laboratory should avail itself of the services pf the National Physical Laboratory for investigations of the types which have been specially developed in that institution.6. We concur fully in the aims of the proposals thus outlined and largely in the methods suggested.The evidence which we have received has made clear the main difficulties which have to be overcome. Naval officers who are face to face with naval practice are not sufficiently acquainted with the existing or possible resources of science to put the question as to requirements in the way of improved or new methods. Men of science are not in touch with naval problems and are thus not in a position to ask themselves whether this or that physical principle might not find useful application in naval practice; nor have they much chance of determining what specific regions of physical science are more likely than others to hold principles worthy of research in view of maritime applications. For technical advance in such service as that of the Navy there is indeed first the difficulty of getting the question put, and then the problem of answering it.&quot; Pure scientific research and discovery supply the principles and necessary data which serve, so to speak, as the raw material for invention,&apos;and it is clear that many of the problems that are now recognised as offering promise of advance in the work of the Navy and of navigation generally lie in regions of physics, which have been relatively neglected in modern exploratory research.7. We are of opinion that there are strong reasons for establishing under the Admiralty an effective organisation for fostering physical research in directions likely to benefit the naval service. The director of this organisation should be a physicist, distinguished for his ability as an investigator and of capacity as an organiser and administrator. The staff and material facilities required in this-organisation fall to be considered under two heads: (1) an institution for pure physical research and (2) a sea station.On careful review and consideration of the conditions, we have come to the conclusion that these must be regarded as closely related. The station at Shandon. which now affords facilities for much experimental work, should be utilised also for research work, for which access to the sea is necessary.. A central laboratory is an essential part of the scheme, but on the grounds indicated in the following section we are of opinion that this part of the organisation need not be established on the large scale proposed in the Admiralty Memorandum; much of the work there contemplated for the Naval Research Institution can, we believe, be carried out in other laboratories.Provision for Pure Physical Research.8. The great mass of research in pure science has been carried on by individual men of science working in universities, colleges, and scientific institutions, or in private laboratories. The free development of ability in research appears to be fostered by the conditions of work in universities and other teaching institutions, but more should be done to facilitate research work in such laboratories. The. need for great increase in the direct and indirect encouragement of individual researches has recently received close attention, and considerable funds have been made available for the purpose through the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. It is not too much to expect that, with the provision now established for meeting the many expenses involved by research, physicists of high scientific ability throughout the country will find themselves able to carry through research work of a pioneer type on a scale hitherto impossible.On the other hand, we attach great importance to the advantage of the Admiralty having, in the inner circle of their staff, an officer who, as himself a physicist of high rank and keeping in touch with current developments in physical science, could look with the eye of a trained man of science at the changes in practice contemplated within the service. Such an officer would thus be in a position to see from time to time points on which science might possibly lend assistance beyond what was already recognised as its liability. He could then suggest each particular problem to one of the men best qualified to tackle it. In making arrangements for such pioneer work by professors and other research workers at their own institutions, he would act on lines determined in conference with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.* From the Memorandum quoted in paragraph 5 above.    &apos;
9. A well-equipped physical laboratory for the Navy is required for investiga-tions, which could not be adequately provided for in the laboratories at Shandon, or in the National Physical Laboratory, or in the laboratories which would be at the disposal of individual men of science working in their own institutions. Such a laboratory would be necessary for investigations in pure physics arising on results of practical tests elsewhere which called for special enquiry by qualified men working in immediate relation with the director. Again, it would be available at any time for special research at headquarters which required the guidance of outside experts available only in a centre of scientific work. It would gradually accumulate special equipment for investigations depending on conditions special to Navy problems, and this would render it economical in the provision of facilities, which might be placed temporarily at the disposal of an outside expert retained for a particular research.This laboratory need not, so far as we foresee, be a large one, nor need it have a large staff. There would probably be advantage in having its staff, to some extent, interchangeable with the scientific staff of the sea station at Shandon.The Sea Station.10. In the course of our enquiry, the Treasury referred to us certain questions touching the establishment of the experimental station at Shandon, and we have considered the usefulness of that station as a part of the general proposition before us. There is much advantage of combining at Shandon the sea aspect of physical research and the varied experimental work for wdiich it was originally secured and arranged.Shandon affords excellent facilities for sea experimental work arising in researches on pure physics, and the personnel and appliances maintained there for experimental work of a technical kind would, no doubt, be largely available for corresponding research work. The association of the sea research station staff with the experimental officers engaged, on technical work would afford a ready and effective means of establishing the touch desired between the two types. The com-bined station would indeed do much to promote the indirect advantages to wdiich importance is attached in the Admiralty proposal, and the selection of naval officers for work within the research establishment would be facilitated by the opportunities which such a station would afford for discovering aptitude for research. It should also be noted that researches in pure physics in regions most likely to influence maritime interests are sure to be suggested from time to time by observations or incidents in experimental wrork directed towards definite practical applications.11. We desire to emphasise the fact that physical research in matters relating to the sea has national interest in several fields besides that of warfare, and that while much of it falls to the initiative of the Navy, the results of successful research are, in many cases, directly applicable to navigation generally. On this we may quote the following statement submitted to us by the scientific adviser to the Admiralty: &quot; In working out scientific measures to handle the naval problems, it has been found that many of the mechanisms have a distinct application in improving and rendering safer navigation for the mercantile marine. As concrete cases of such applications, the following may be cited: &quot; Submarine sound ranging and directional wireless for locating ships&apos; positions.&quot; Leader gear for establishing in and out lanes of traffic in rivers or entrances to harbours; when this method has been perfected, it should be impossible for collisions to occur on a river like the St. Lawrence, even in fogs.&quot; Supersonic and echo methods of detection for locating submerged or float-ing vessels; when developed, should prove an effective safeguard against collisions at sea in foggy weather, whether with ships, icebergs, or rocks.&quot; The value of these discoveries and developments in lowering insurance rates (and consequently freights) and the cost of transportation will vastly exceed in a short time the total expenditure of experiment and research in the Navy.&quot;The Institution as a Whole.12. We regard the &apos;: Institution for Physical Research for the Navy &quot; as a combination of personnel and facilities, and we conceive those as distributed between
-   305Recommendations.1. That physical research work for the Navy should be placed under the control of a director with capacity as an organiser and administrator, and distinguished for his ability as an investigator, who would keep in touch with the most advanced developments of physical science in Great Britain and elsewhere.2. That the director should be in close relation with the naval staff at ths Admiralty, so that he may direct research along lines in consonance with current naval policy.3. That the station at Shandon should be maintained and developed as a naval experimental station, and that facilities be provided there for work on the sea aspects of physical research.4. That the director should have at his disposal a central laboratory where results of scientific research which appear to be of special interest to the Navy may be tested and brought to a stage at which they can be passed on to the station at Shandon for naval developments or for experimental tests under naval conditions.5. That the director should be in a position to maintain active touch with the Royal Society and kindred scientific and technical societies, with the department of scientific and industrial research, the national physical laboratory and research centres in universities and technical colleges.That he should use the central laboratory as a clearing-house, with reference to research which may bear on naval interests and as to the work of individual investigators, whose services it might be desirable to utilise from time to time by the organisation he controls.6. That while these activities cover a wide range, they would be developed most safely, as well as most effectively, by establishing as the staff of the central laboratory a carefully selected nucleus, which might grow as its usefulness was recognised.That for the work of such a staff, and for the functions of this laboratory, in relation to Shandon and to the university or other laboratories utilised for physical investigations for the Navy, a laboratory of moderate dimensions would suffice.(Signed) H.

OGILVIE (Secretary).APPENDIXResearch in relation to the War Services1. On the organisation of research from the point of view of the War Services, the problems to be faced are very definitely indicated in the following passage quoted from the Note which Lord Weir submitted to the War Cabinet on 19th October 1918 in relation to the proposed establishment of a physical research in-stitution for the Navy: &quot; In many directions it will be found that the three Services have an equal interest in research, pre-eminent instances perhaps being the cases of wireless telegraphy and the study of explosives. In such cases, research should clearly be conducted on behalf of all three Services, but the best results will only be achieved if, not merely in these cases, but in all cases, research is con-ducted not by an institution attached to one department only, but to a central - institution working on behalf of all the departments concerned. It may very [1604] Cthe Shandon Station and the laboratories for pure physical research. We have in view that much of the research in pure physics which the original proposal contemplated would be carried on in other laboratories and by men of science, not on the staff at Shandon or in the Navy Laboratory, which we have sketched in J 9. Thus, so far as the central laboratory is concerned, a moderate provision would suffice.
well be that departments other than the fighting services may wish to utilise the services of such a Government research institution, and it is clearly a matter for consideration whether research should be confined to physics alone, but should not include chemistry and other objects.&quot; During the war the Government has secured an immense advantage from the co-operation of all research institutions and of all individual experience throughout the country. The result has been that any particular piece of re-search has been placed in the hands of the Research Institution, or of the man most suited by experience or resource to deal with it. It will be equally of immense advantage if this co-operation can be maintained after the war, and it should not be difficult to devise means whereby this can be achieved in view of the example which the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research affords. It is true that it may be necessary in certain instances to maintain secrecy. The Admiralty appear to over-emphasize the importance of this arid the difficulty of securing it. The necessity for secrecy arises more in the tech-nical application of the principle than in the discovery of the principle itself, but where secret researches are essential, they can be safely entrusted to the National Physical Laboratory or other Government research institution which may be created.&quot; The Air Ministry would, therefore, wish the Committee to consider whether, to satisfy the needs of the Navy, Army and Air Service, and of other departments if the need is proved, a central authority should not be established for the furtherance of physical and other scientific research by means of in-vestigations directly conducted in a Government institution and by means of subsidies granted to outside institutions -or to individuals for the conduct of the specific enquiries.&quot;2. Our consideration of the information which the War Departments have given us as to the research work carried on for them during the war and of the evidence we have received on matters pertinent to that, has completely borne out the state-ments made by Lord Weir in that passage. We give below some illustrations of the position and of the possibilities in these matters, and we indicate the need for some provision by which the research work required by the several War Departments might be duly co-ordinated. In the following paragraph, however, we set down some considerations which we believe affect the arrangements in several directions that are vital to success in the solution of the problem as a whole.3. The history of the war from 1914 to 1918 and the achievements of the belli-gerents in the continuous development of new appliances and methods for attack and defence, have shown clearly that research, production, and training before war are not more important than capacity for intensive activity in these respects after the outbreak of war. So far as research is concerned this capacity will turn very largely upon the extent to which research for War Services is linked up with a strong and well-directed national activity in research generally. The War Services should take care in future to keep in close touch with all scientific and industrial research, work going on in the country, and the mechanism now started makes it easy to keep this touch. Through the Department of Scientific and Industrial Re-search these Services will have a ready means of noting new departures or important developments arising in the course of a large proportion of the investigations carried on in this country, and in the records of these they will be able to identify such as are of interest, or of possible interest, in war.Whatever national research institutions are established would be fully avail-able to the War Services for reference, for enquiries or for researches within their fields. Each War Service should be in a position to maintain facilities for re-searches or experimental investigations special to its own needs or arising as special extensions of work that is being carried on for other purposes elsewhere. For groups of war requirements common to two or more War Departments central provi-sion should be made for the common needs of these services; the Research Depart-ment at Woolwich illustrates a joint arrangement of this kind.4. Each War Service should be at pains to encourage in its personnel the in-terest in scientific work which is likely to make for general efficiency and which will enable the Service to pick for special duties men whose qualifications fit them for the development of applications of science in warfare. In following out such a policy they will no doubt find it necessary to extend the existing facilities for officers to spend occasional periods on definite further training or experience in the course of their first (say) 10 or 15 years of service.  It will no doubt be a matter
of consideration by the War Services how they can best encourage their officers to prosecute the study of the scientific aspects of their professional work.The centres for Service experimental investigations on the mechanical and scientific appliances required for war purposes would afford opportunities for con-tinued scientific work in relation to adopted materials or machines as well as in the Service tests of those under preliminary trial. The distribution of this experience ought to be arranged so that a considerable proportion of the officers who showed promise in the later professional training courses would have the benefit of it.5. Many technical matters in which the War Services find enquiry necessary are of industrial interest, and are thus likely to be made subjects of investigation quite apart from Service requirements. In cases where such independent provision for investigation has already been made the War Departments should make use of it. Where this provision is not available they might take part with other interests in arranging and carrying out the necessary enquiries so far as these are common to both sets of need. * The general adoption of this practice would do much to promote (a) economy and efficiency in national provision for research; (b) readiness in securing for War Services the benefit of the best products of out-side scientific and industrial researches; and (c) touch between officers at work in the &quot;forces and professional men engaged in research work or in specific technical developments of inventions.The experience of war organizations has afforded examples of many modes of establishing effective relations between different sets of men engaged on cognate pursuits but looking at particular enquiries from different points of view.6. The number of men qualified to conduct fundamental research is not large, and there is at present a narrow limit to the numbers of those who can direct or carry out the research work required for the application of known principles of physical, chemical, and biological science in the many problems which arise in engineering, manufactures, the conditions of life and the development of natural resources. It is waste of talent to occupy in any grade of research work men who are not up to the standard of aptitude and training required for it. Economy of scientific ability is indeed a national necessity, and accordingly care should be taken to avoid wherever possible the duplication of effort in the provision for research, whether by the State or otherwise.7. The following Institutions may be cited as illustrations of combinations of service or of effort which have proved effective in making provision for research work in connection with War Services: Research Department, Woolwich. An organization of long standing, greatly enlarged to meet the War requirements of Army, Navy, and Air Force in respect of research and investigations in explosives, ballistics and metallurgy. (As a result of these investigations many millions of pounds were saved for the State during the war). The field of the Department has now been extended to include research on the use of gas in war. Research work on these subjects requires special labora-tories, and proposals have been put forward by the. War Office for continuing it at Woolwich and Porton after the war. Much of the investigation which is carried on in these laboratories in the interest of the War Services may also greatly benefit both Civil Services and industrial enterprise.National Physical Laboratory: The prominent example of a National Institu-tion established with special relation to scientific enquiries and the applications of physical principles in the Arts, has given greatly enlarged help to the War Ser-vices in many branches of Science and, as the central standardising institution, has rendered invaluable service in connection with the manufacture and testing of mechanical standards during the War.Meteorological Office. The centre on and from which the War meteorological services developed. (The permanent relation of these services is now under dis-cussion.)-&quot; Signals Experimental.&quot;-Orga,mzed under the War Office, has served the Army and the Air Force, and to a small extent the Navy in respect of telegraphic and other methods of communication. Represents the type of institution for re-searches in wireless telegraphy, so far as common to these services and to the Post Office.Chemical Warfare Department. In its final state of development an example of the combination of research work by the Army with the assistance of a large number of chemists outside the Service.Munitions Inventions Department.-^ central establishment which among other
functions cleared up questions of possible, use of inventions or suggestions submitted to it, and in special cases worked up suggestions which appeared to promise useful results.Fuel Research Board. An example of an organization for carrying out re-searches of primary interest to the Navy and in the industries, but of wide applica-tion beyond these.8. While co-operation in technical researches has already been evolved in many sections of activity, there has necessarily been much duplication in detail. It often happened that investigators in different Departments who were engaged on similar enquiries ultimately came into contact and compared notes. There can be little doubt but that even in these cases the Service suffered by the lack of co-ordination. In many sections of the work a great deal was gained by the appointment of com-mittees, including individual members, who were in continuous touch with corres-ponding enquiries in other relations. This system began in a tentative way early in the period of the war and later on it extended greatly. The Air Ministry, on its establishment as a distinct Department adopted this system as a fundamental ele-ment in its departmental machinery for research.9. The provision required and in part already available for research in appli-cations of Science in which the War Services are interested may be classified as follows:Research in Application of Science.I. Common to War Services and Industrial Interests.(For much of the provision indicated under this heading the Department of. Scientific and Industrial Research administers the public funds available and thus forms a central authority to which the War Departments can refer for information as to the institutions or individuals at work in particular parts of the field.)(a.) Various Institutions and public services, e.g. Existing Institutions: National Physical Laboratory. Research Department, Woolwich. Government Laboratories (Chemical). Fuel Research Station.&apos; Meteorology.Possible Institutions: Wireless Telegraphy (in so far as common to War Services, PostOffice and Commercial interests). Aeronautics (in so far as common to War Services and Industrialinterests).(&amp;.) Individual Investigators and Research Centres. (c.) Industrial Research Associations.II. Special to War Services.A Central War Service Organization for Research, co-ordinating institutions under joint control of the Services concerned single control if only one is con-cerned, e.g.Joint Control: Explosives for war purposes. Ballistics special to war purposes. Searchlights. Gas warfare.Airships and aeroplanes in war.Sound location and sound ranging appliances.Single Control:  Naval Gunnery.Signalling in so far as special to each Service.Torpedoes and mining.Applications of physics in sea warfare.o
