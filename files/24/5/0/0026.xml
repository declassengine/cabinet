The Committee was appointed by the War Cabinet in consequence of the strong objections raised not only by Members of Parliament and the press, but also by the Dominion troops themselves, to the issue of any decoration to Dominion troops which would not also be conferred on their British comrades, who shared the same dangers and hardships in the same theatre of war.2. The Committee considered fully various alternative proposals, in particular, the suggestion that a special decoration should be granted for the operation in Gallipoli. They came to the conclusion that it was impossible to grant a separate decoration for any particular operation without creating anomalies even more serious than those [994]
which exist at present.   The Committee, however, understand from the War Office representatives that clasps for particular operations, to be granted on the war medal, will include a clasp for Gallipoli. v      3. The Committee recommend : (1.) That the 1914 Star, retaining its distinctive date, should be granted under the conditions now approved as defined in Army Order 350 of 1917.(2.) That the 1914 Star, with the same riband, but bearing an altered date 1914-15, should be extended to all those ineligible for the 1914 Star who served in the campaign in a theatre of war up to and including the 31st December, 1915, and that it should be granted to all those who arrived in such theatre of war on duty and with proper authority prior to that date. The 1914-15 Star, like the 1914 Star, will have no clasps.(3.) That the term &quot; Theatre of War &quot; should be defined by the Army Council, in consultation with the Admiralty and Air Council. The proposal would then include, amongst others-(a.) All the Australian and New Zealand troops who fought in Gaflipoli, aswell as all the British and Indian troops who were on the Peninsula,with very few exceptions, (b.) The Canadian troops who fought at the second battle of Ypres, atthe battle of Festubert, and subsequent operations in France andFlanders.(c.) All those who fought in German South-West Africa, and nearly all theIndian troops who fought in East Africa. (d.) All the British, Dominion, and Indian troops who fought in the defenceof Egypt.(e.) All troops who fought in the Bismarck Archipelago as defined in Army Council Instruction 336 of 1918.(/.) All officers and men of the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines who served in a ship of war at aea, and all officers and men of the Mercantile Marine serving afloat in ships under Admiralty agreement, i.e., officers and men who signed on Form T. 3 24 and its variants, from the 4th August, 1914, to 31st December, 1915.(g.) All members of the Flying services fulfilling the prescribed conditions. Seeing that, during the period referred to, the R.A.F. was divided between the Naval and Military wings, the conditions of eligibility for officers and men of each wing should be settled, on the recom-mendation of the Air Council, on the same lines as are recommended above for officers and men of the Navy and Army.4. In making the recommendations above, the Committee have fully realised the objections to any extension of the grant of the 1914 Star, not only in the interests of the present holders, but also because of the possibility of demands for further extensions. But, in view of the fact that the decoration has already been given to nearly 400,000 persons, many of whom had not seen service in the fighting line, they consider that its extension to include those who fought in the operations at Gallipoli, and in the second battle of Ypres and the battle of Loos, cannot be held to detract from the distinction which it carries. Although, in their opinion, the period 1914-15 is a reasonable one in which to group those who responded early to the call. The Committee wish to make it clear that the date they have proposed, namely, 31st December, 1915, represents no turning point in the progress of the war. They do not wish to submit their proposals without emphasising this fact, which may give rise to criticism, because they consider it essential that, whatever limits and conditions are now approved, must be adhered to in the face of criticism, and that no exception should be admitted. Under the circumstances, after full consideration of the various alternatives (which are dealt with in an appendix), the Committee are of opinion that the solution they recommend is the best one.5. The solution recommended by the Committee can only be adopted with the concurrence of the Dominion Government, as the 1914-15 Star would take the place of the special Dominion decoration already approved by the King. The Committee hope this concurrence may be secured, since they are confident that the grant of one decoration to all those who shared the same dangers and hardships will be more acceptable to the troops than any distinctive decoration confined to men of one Dominion.
-   154APPENDIX.THE considerations which led the Committee to put forward the recommendations contained in their report were as follows : Existing Situation,The 1914 Star is now granted to all officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, home on the establishment of a unit of the British Expeditionary Forces who served in France between the 5th August, 1914, and midnight the 22nd/23rd November, 1914. These conditions, as defined in Army Order 350 of 1917, exclude practically the whole of the Dominion Forces, who came forward voluntarily at the beginning of the war and took part in important operations at an early stage of the war, notably the first landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The objections to this arrangement were represented at the Conference of Prime Ministers in 1917, and it was agreed that each of the Dominions might issue a decoration to their own troops with the full assent of the Home Government.The objection to this proposal, involving the issue of separate decorations to Dominion troops for particular campaign for which the British troops engaged received none, have hitherto prevented any action being taken.It was to recommend a solution to this situation, having due regard to the claims of the Dominion Forces and the present holders of the 1914 Star, that this Committee has been formed.Proposals Considered,1. The first proposal considered by the Committee was to issue a separate decoration for the Gallipoli campaign which should be common to all the troops, British, Dominion, and Indian, who took part in the campaign. After full consideration, they came to the conclusion that it would be impossible to authorise a special decoration to the Australians and other troops who served in Gallipoli, and at the same time to refuse the grant of a similar special decoration to the Canadian and other troops who took part in the battle of Festubert. If separate decorations were granted in each of these cases, irresistible demands for the issue of an indefinite number of further campaign decorations would be made on behalf of the troops who served in Mesopotamia, Africa, &amp;c. In short, the difficulty of selecting particular campaigns for the granting of a special decoration and the anomalies that would be. created by any such selection are so great that this proposal is considered impracticable.2. The second proposal was to encourage the Dominion Governments to issue a special Dominion Star to their own troops, a similar decoration being issued by the British Government to the British or Indian troops who served during the same period. Enquiries were made with a view to obtaining a representative opinion from the Australian, New Zealand; Canadian, South African, and Newfoundland authorities, as to whether they would prefer a special Dominion Star to a decoration which would be held in common by all troops, British, Indian, and Dominion.It is ascertained that both General Turner and General Smuts had stated most emphatically that they were certain that all the Canadian and South African troops would far rather have a decoration which could be shared by the British and Indian troops who served with them. On this point they were most insistent, both saying that many officers and men would prefer to have no decorations at all than to have one which was not also given to their comrades. They also both agreed that the 1914 Star extended to 1915, would, in itself, be more acceptable than any special Dominion decoration, and this view is understood to be shared by the Newfoundland troops.As regards the Australians and New Zealanders, from enquiries made, it appears that they take the same view with the one possible exception that they would prefer a Dominion riband to the riband of the 1914 Star.The Committee realises to the full that great objection may be raised to any solution proposed, and that it might, in fact, probably would be far better not to issue any decoration on the lines of the 1914 Star owing to &quot;the fact that continual extensions might be demanded, but after full consideration, they are satisfied that their present proposals contain the only satisfactory solution of the existing situation.
Advantages of Proposals.The advantages of these proposals are-1. That they entirely remove the anomaly of troops serving in the same theatre of war, side by side, not receiving the same reward for their services.2. That they give to nearly all those who first responded to the call of duty, a decoration which would be extremely highly prized, and which hitherto has been confined only to those who rendered this service in France. To this the Committee attach the greatest importance.3. That they remove the existing anomaly, by which the 1914 Star is issued to many thousands of officers and men whose duties kept them at a base in France far away from the fighting line, whereas those who offered their services at the beginning of the war, and took part in the fighting at Gallipoli, Festubert, or Loos, are ineligible for any special decoration.J 4. That the grant, by the King himself, of one decoration to British, Dominion and Indian troops alike symbolises the unity of the Empire.
