[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.].Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1919.&apos;. 64WAR  CABINET.A MINISTRY OF RESEARCH.SECRET. G.-234.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.1. I WISH to bring before the notice of the Cabinet some considerations bearing upon the establishment of a Ministry of Research, an issue, which quite apart from the recommendations of the Committee on the Machinery of Government, must necessarily force itself before long upon the attention of Parliament and the public by reason of the large sums which are now being spent, and of the still larger sums which will shortly be required for the advancement of scientific discovery in every department of knowledge.2. It will be generally recognised that while each of the great administrative departments of Government should possess an intelligence and research section, the formation of a central organ for scientific discovery and information is also essential.3. It is also clear that, whatever other characteristics this Central Department of Research should possess, it should be framed with reference to three principles : It should be&apos; unembarrassed by the burden of ordinary administrative work; it should be empowered tu promote research for the whole United Kingdom ; and it should be able easily and naturally to co-ordinate its scientific activities with the analogous activities in the Dominions, the Colonies, and the Empire. In a word, it should be an organ of intelligence for the whole Empire, unburdened, by the routine of current adminis-tration.4. For these reasons there is much to be said for accepting the Committee of the Privy Council for Industrial and Scientific Research as our central organ for research and intelligence. It conforms to each of the three principles which have been mentioned.5. On the other hand, the arrangement under which the Lord President of the Council is the responsible Minister for Research is clearly wrong in principle. The Lord President is generally one of the older statesmen. He may be, and often is, unversed in science and out of sympathy with scientific development. He may again be well qualified to discharge the duties of the post, but heavily burdened by other work, as is notoriously the case with the present holder of the office. If the Depart-ment is to exercise its legitimate influence and to realise all the advantages of which it is capable, then it should be presided over by a Minister who is chosen because of his peculiar fitness to deal with this special type of work. Any Lord President of the Council may be such a person, but he clearly does not acquire the necessary qualities ex-ojfficio.6. It may be urged that the Lord President may delegate all or part of this work to some other Privy Councillor, e.g., the President of the Board of Education, but this too is an unsatisfactory arrangement, for no Minister who is ultimately responsible for a Department can delegate his responsibility in full, and shared responsibility must make in the end for bad and languid administration. I have been attempting to cope with the work of the Committee for the past few months, but I am fully conscious that, owing to the heavy calls of my own Department, I have not been able to give to industrial and scientific research the attention which it deserves.7. r or these reasons it would, in my opinion, be well that an early opportunity should be taken of giving a statutory basis to the position of the Privy Councillor who is entrusted with the actual work of directing the Department of Research. His title, emoluments, and duties should be defined by Parliament. Just as there was a Vice-President of the Council for Education, so there should now be a Vice-President of the Council or Vice-Chairman of the Council for Research.8. I am not prepared to say that it would not be possible, as it would undoubtedfv[1028] ^ &quot; J
be economical, to combine this post for the present with one of the lighter offices of the Government, but I am convinced that in the course of a few years the work of the Department will require the full time of a Minister. Here, for instance, is an outline of the possible branches of a Department of Research, each branch to be organised under an Advisory Council of its own, and many of the branches to be connected with Research Boards in executive control of research industries : I. Scientific and Industrial Research. This branch already deals with the encouragement of pure science in all scientific subjects not already provided for by other State organisations: &apos; Further, it deals with industrial research of all kinds not covered by other organisations, such as the Development Commission or the Medical Research Committee. The proposed future organisation for aero-nautical research would come under the purview of this branch.II. Geophysics Research. This branch will deal with the pure sciences related to geophysics, and on&quot;its applied side to the geological surveys, including the Geological Museum, the Meteorological Office, and in course of time no doubt also with geography, oceanography, and geodesy.III. Medical Research.  This branch would deal with the present and future wi rk of the present Medical Research Committee.IV. Agricultural Research.- This branch would deal with the pure sciences which have a bearing upon agriculture and with such fundamental applied investigations as would be carried out by, e.g., an Institute of Animal Nutrition and an Institute of Comparative Pathology. Both these institutes would also be cl-sely connected with the branch for medical research, since the nutrition and diseases of animals are now seen to be of great importance in connection with the nutrition and diseases of man. Neither can be satisfactorily investigated apart from the other.V. Statistical Research. This branch would deal with problems of statistics in relation probably to the public well-being, and would for the first time work out a system of vital statistics in close touch with the Medical Research Branch. It would also, no doubt, be in a position to arrange with the statistical branches of the various Government Departments for the presentation in a convenient form of collected statistics&apos; of the work of these Departments on a uniform basis. At present no attempt whatever has been made in this direction.VI. Economic Research. This branch would deal with the encouragement of research in pure economics, but also with a number of pressing problems in the application of science, such as costings.9. It will be seen that all the functions enumerated above are concerned with original investigation, and are directed to the discovery of new truth. It has been suggested that the Ministry should also be entrusted with the duty of collecting sociological and political information. It is probable, however, that this function would be best discharged in the first instance by the departmental organs of enquiry that the Home Office, for instance, should contribute information with respect to the cost of factory legislation abroad; the Board of Education with respect to educational changes ; the Ministry of Health with respect to questions of public hygiene. In any case, the creMtion of effective departmental organs for this type of enquiry is prior in urgency to the creation of a central bureau of sociological information.10. It is not necessary that the Minister of Research should be a great man of science, distinguished for original contributions to knowledge, but obviously it is desirable that he should not be entirely ignorant of science or out of touch with it, A man of wide scientific interests, acquainted with academic machinery and the scientific personnel of the country, and at the same time gifted with administrative ability, would be the sort of man who might be expected to fill the office to the greatest advantage. The work of the Department will fall into so many branches, each of them highly specialised, that no specialist Minister could hope to&apos; form a personal opinion of any value upon the great mass of the recommendations coming up to him. He would have to trust to Specialist Committees, and he ou^ht at least to possess a lively interest in all the great scientific developments of the time. It may be asked whether the Minister for Research should combine with his strictly scientific&apos; duties some of the functions recently delegated to the Minister of Reconstruction. Should the new Ministry, in other words, be asked to skirmish ahead of the Government of the day, to explore the social problems of the future, and to prepare plans for legislation ? These functions imply qualities differing from those which properly belong to
a Minister of Scientific Research, and I doubt whether it would be wise to burden the Department with the task of framing suggestions for legislation, except in so far as those suggestions may be directly connected with the march of physical science. Experience indeed has shown that the influence of the existing Department of Scientific and Industrial Research on the industries, and even more perhaps on the administrative departments of State, depends upon its detachment from all problems of exploitation and from administrative policy. The Department is coming to be recognised as completely unbiassed, and concerned only with the discovery of scientific truth and its dissemination. The application of the results obtained rests either with the industries concerned or with the Department for whom the investigation has been made. 1 think this is an important principle, from which it would be dangerous to depart.(Signed) H. A. L. FISHER.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., January 29, 1919.
