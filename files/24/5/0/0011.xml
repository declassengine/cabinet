SECRET.WAR CABINET.IN view of the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, Lord Milner thinks that the attached memorandum (which has been prepared for the confidential information of Home Ministers) may be of value as affording a summary of the political situation in each Dominion, and an outline of the main events which have occurred since the last session of the Imperial War Cabinet. Lord Milner thinks that a perusal of the paper will enable Home Ministers to appreciate the present position in each oversea country and the interests for which the Ministers, whom they are shortly to meet, stand.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., June 6, 1918.[511-1]
- [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government JPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June -1018.60MEMORANDUM ON THE POLITICAL POSITION IN THE DOMINIONS.(Prepared for the confidential information of Home Ministers in connection with the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.) ,(Previous Paper No. 0.-13.6.)IN view of the meetings&quot; of the Imperial War Cabinet, the following summary of the position of politics and parties in the Dominions, and the relation-ship thereto of the individual Dominion Delegates, has been prepared for the use of Home Ministers.CANADA.When Sir- Robert Borden visited London last year for the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet and Conference he was Leader of the Conservative party in the Dominion Parliament with a majority over his Liberal opponents, led by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, of nearly 50. The Conservative majority was made up of both English-speaking and Erench-speaking Conservatives, the latter numbering about 20. The whole of the French-Canadian Liberals, of course, were associated with Sir Wilfrid Laurier.On the return of Sir Robert Borden from England, his &quot;Cabinet decided that it was impossible to maintain the strength of the Canadian divisions at the front under the existing system of voluntary recruiting. The infantry enlistments for April and May 1917, had only totalled 3,&quot;000 as against 21,300 casualties; and in June Sir Robert Borden introduced the Bill to provide for compulsory service of men between the ages of 20 and 45. It was at once seen that the issue of conscription would create a division in the parties as hitherto. constituted, and many important English-speaking Liberals ranged themselves under Sir Robert Borden&apos;s banner, with the result that the Second Reading of the Military Service Bill in the House of Commons was carried by a majority of 63, which included 26 English-speaking Liberals-representing in the main the Western and Maritime Provinces. Only 12 English-speaking Liberals voted with Sir Wilfrid Laurier against-the Bill, but, on the other hand, only 5 of the French-Canadian Conservatives went into the Division Lobby with Sir Robert Borden.It will thus be seen that the conscription issue was responsible for a division of parties very largely upon racial lines.In July of 1917 Sir Robert Borden had introduced a motion to extend the life of Parliament, but as this was not supported unanimously, and a good many con-scriptionist Liberals voted against it, it was decided to hold a General Election. Before this took place, however, Sir Robert Borden determined to make every effort to form a Government which would be representative of the Conservatives and Liberals who supported conscription, and after various conferences, a Union Cabinet was ultimately formed in October 1917, comprising 13 Conservatives, 9 Liberals, and 1 Labour. The Prime Minister gave the reason for this combination in these words:-&quot; Impressed by the urgent necessity of putting aside all minor considera-tions, of sinking all party difference, and of presenting a united front at this solemn and momentous juncture in the nation&apos;s history, the Members of the Union Government have come together in the duty of service to the national interest.&quot;SECRET. G.-211.
The Liberal Members of the Government included only three Members of the then House of Commons, but amongst these was Mr. Carveil, whose name had been recently canvassed as the successor of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, when the latter contemplated retiring from the Leadership of the Liberals.The new Cabinet, however, contained three Liberals who had been very prominent in provincial politics, viz., Mr. A. -L. Sifton (up till then Premier of Alberta), Mr. N. W. Rowell, and Mr. J. A. Calder; and the two last named accompany Sir Robert Borden to London.^ Mr. Rowellt had been up till then (from thevyear 1911) the Leader of the Liberals in the Ontario Provincial Parliament; while at the time of the offer of a seat in the Dominion Cabinet, Mr. Calderi was a Member of the Provincial Legislature of Saskatchewan.Unfortunately, Sir Robert Borden could not induce any French-Canadian Liberals to join his administration, but he reappointed his two French-Canadian Conservative Ministers (Messrs. Blondin and Sevigny) to Cabinet positions.After the successful formation of the Union Government, Sir Robert Borden appealed to the country. In his election manifesto the Union Prime Minister recognised to the full the achievement of voluntary enlistment which had enrolled over 400,000 men, but, he declared, &quot; there was no thought of compulsion until com-pulsion became imperative.&quot;The opposition to compulsion brought together the French-Canadian Liberals, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and the French-Canadian Nationalists, under Mr. Bourassa, and this was declared by Mr. Rowell to be an attempt to dictate the policy of Canada by the Quebec majority. The policy of the Opposition was declared to be the suspension of the Military Service Act and its reference to a referendum. The rejoinder of Sir Robert Borden was &quot; if we are going to take a referendum to see whether we should stand by our men at the front, why should not the men take a referendum to see whether they should stand by us.&quot;The result of the General Election was a magnificent triumph for Sir Robert Borden, and confirmed the Union Government in power with a majority of 70,^ in a House of 235 Members. That the soldiers at the front supported the Union Govern-ment&apos;s war measures was shown by the fact that 93.62 per cent, of the soldiers&apos; vote was given in support of the Government.Apart from the sweeping success of the Government, the most striking fact connected with the election was the solid front presented by French-Canada in the Province of Quebec, where Sir Wilfrid Laurier secured 62 of the 65 seats. The two French-Canadian Conservative Ministers suffered defeat, jj and indeed the three seats secured by the Government in Quebec Province were all in Montreal City. While it is not possible to analyse in this paper the various causes which were responsible for the attitude of Quebec, it may be pointed out that in the recent General Election the reapportionment of constituencies by reason of increased population was put into practice for the first time, and this gave to Western Canada 56 representatives in the new Parliament as against 34 in the old. On the same basis of increase of population the West would be entitled to 80 representatives in six years&apos; time, and this being about one-third of the total Membership of the House of Commons, would control the policy of the country to a greater extent even than a &quot;solid Quebec/&apos;Unfortunate as it is that French-Canada is not represented in the Union* The other delegate, Mr. Meighen, is 42 years of age, and after occupying the post of Solicitor-General in Sir Robert Borden&apos;s Conservative Government for four years, during the latter part of which he greatly enhanced his reputation by the way in which he assisted in piloting the Military Service Bill and other measures through Parliament, he joined the Union Government as Minister of the Interior. Mr. Meighen was one of Sir Robert Borden&apos;s principal supporters in his efforts to form a Union Government.t Born in 1867, Mr. Rowell was a leading K.C. of the Provincial Bar.X Mr. Calder was born in 1868, and, after being called to the Bar, entered Provincial politics, and occupied the posts of Provincial Treasurer and Commissioner of Education, and, later, Minister of Railways in Liberal Governments of Saskatchewan.^ There is still one seat to be declared in the Yukon, where there has been a controversy as to whether the soldiers&apos; votes, which were cast after nomination day, could be included. The Opposition candidate won on the civilian vote, and the Government nominee when the soldiers&apos; votes were counted; but as Parliament has now decided that the soldiers&apos; votes are to be included, the Unionist will be returned.II One of the French-Canadian Ministers resigned in consequence, but Mr. Blondin, who is serving at the front, still remains Postmaster-General.
Government,^ the opposition of Quebec Province to the war measures of the Union Government should not be exaggerated. It is true that certain riots occurred in connection with the calling-up of men under the Military Service Act, &quot;but these were confined to Quebec City and were speedily controlled by the firm action of the- Government in calling-up the rioters regardless of any exemption claims they might have, and the judicious use of military forces, which included French-Canadian troops. The criticism of other provinces regarding the meagre enlistments from Quebec and other matters was, no doubt, mainly responsible for the motion in the Quebec Legislature indicating that the province would be willing to stand out of the Confederation if it was thought by the other provinces that this course would, be of advantage to the Dominion, but the motion had very little support and the Premier of the Province declared that Confederation was the only method of Government for Canada. This attitude was subsequently endorsed by Sir Wilfrid Laurier.It may be said, therefore, that notwithstanding the hostile anti-Empire attitude of Mr. Bourassa, the situation in Quebec Province is now quiet, and the men are enlisting under the Military Service Act in much the same way as in other provinces.Soon after the formation of the Union Government, the Prime Minister found it advisable to form two Committees of&apos; the Cabinet one termed a War Committee, for the conduct of war matters, and- the other for the purpose of dealing with questions of reconstruction and development.Amongst the important measures decided upon by the Government since it came into office have been the abolition of exemptions of all men between 20 and 22 and an amendment of the Military Service Act enabling men of 19 to be called up, in order to provide adequate reinforcements after the 1st July; the prohibition of the importation and manufacture of intoxicating liquor (except Ontario native wine and Quebec beer) for the duration of the war and one year afterwardst; the establish-ment of a War Trade Board and a Food Board; control of railways; the establish-ment of a Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment; Civil Service reform (abolishing political patronage); control of the award of titles to residents in Canada; an important shipbuilding programme; National Registration; woman franchise, &amp;c. In the last named connection it may be mentioned that the Union Cabinet recently met the representatives of various women&apos;s interests in conference and this resulted in steps being taken to organise more effectively the woman power of the Dominion.In the same way the Union Government have taken special steps to get into closer touch with Labour interests. Though Labour is scarcely represented in Dominion politics, Sir Robert Borden appointed a Labour Senator to a seat in the Cabinet. The Government also arranged for special conferences with Labour representatives in relation to food production, and they also sent a mission to the United States in order to study Labour conditions and to examine the methods of obtaining the best results&apos; from labour in producing foodstuffs and raw material.Foreign Questions and Representation. The relationship of the Dominion to foreign countries has naturally been emphasised during the present war. This, perhaps, has been most clearly noticeable in regard to the United States, and the appointment of a War Mission to supervise Canadian affairs in that country clearly demonstrated that the interests of the Dominion had reached a stage where individual attention was necessary. Though acting in the closest co-operation with the British authorities at Washington, the Canadian Mission deals with negotiations, particularly regarding trade, which purely concern Canada.The most direct question of foreign policy in which the Dominion is concerned, in regard to territorial readjustments, is that which relates to the future of the French islands of St. Pierre, Miquelon, and Langley. The Dominion Ministers have intimated to the British Government that any rearrangement which handed these islands over to the United States would be viewed with grave concern in Canada. In addition to their strategic value, on account of their proximity to the coast of* There is only one French-Canadian supporter of the Union Government in the new House of Commons Dr. Chabot. This gentleman was offered the Deputy Speakership, but he refused to take office.t All the provinces having enacted prohibition and such enactments having come into force everywhere except in certain portions of Quebec (where postponement for a year was arranged), the Dominion Government passed an Order in Council prohibiting importation into Canada of intoxicating liquor for beverages, and also prohibiting the manufacture of liquor in, and transportation of liquor to, provinces where prohibition was actually in effect.
&quot;Newfoundland and to their position at the principal entrance to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, their acquisition by the United States would, in the view of Dominion Ministers, prove a constant source of irritation to Newfoundland and, in a lesser degree to Canada, from a commercial standpoint. Therefore, in anv territorial re-adjiistments with France, the Dominion Government have expresed tne hope that the islands, together with the fishing rights on the coast of Newfoundland, will be acquired for Canada.The above examples furnish, perhaps, the most obvious instances of questions of foreign policy, affecting the Dominion, arising more particularly out of the present war. The necessity of consultation with the Dominions upon foreign affairs has been constantly referred to, both publicly and privately, by Sir Robert Borden, and the Canadian Prime Ministers latest statements have emphasised that which he made in 1912, namely: &quot; It has been declared that in the past, and even during recent years, that the responsibility for foreign policy could not be shared by Great Britain with the Dominions. In my humble opinion adherence to such a decision could have but one, and that a most disastrous, result.&quot;That Members of the Canadian House of Commons are alive to the importance of more adequate and continuous representation of the Dominion in foreign questions, vitally affecting their interests, is shown by the resolution that was recently put down by a private Member for consideration in the Canadian Parliament.The terms of this resolution were as follows: &quot; That a readjustment of the constitutional relations of the component parts of the Empire is desirable, and that such readjustments, while thoroughly preserving all the existing powers of self-government and complete control of domestic affairs, should be based upon the full recognition of the Dominion as an autonomous nation of the Imperial Commonwealth, should recognise the rights of the Dominions and India to an adequate voice in foreign policy and foreign relations, and should provide effective arrangements for continuous consultation in all important matters of common Imperial concern, and for such necessary concerted action founded on such consultations as the several Govern-ments may-determine.&quot;Though the above resolution is in practically the same terms as that passed by the assembled Ministers at the Imperial War Conference last year it is to be observed that the Conference Resolution was passed before the statement of Mr. Lloyd George regarding annual meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. The reference, therefore, to the necessity of&quot; continuous consultation&quot; in the above resolution would appear to indicate the desire for some closer means of consultation on foreign and other Imperial affairs between the annual meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.
NEWFOUNDLAND.The most important event in Newfoundland during the period which has elapsed since the meeting of the last Imperial War Cabinet was the resignation of the Prime Minister (Sir Edward, now Lord, Morris) which took place towards the end of last year.At the General Election of 1913, Sir Edward Morris, as Leader of the Conserva-tive or People&apos;s party, defeated the combination of Liberals and Fishermen&apos;s Union parties, the latter being practically the Labour party of the country, and far larger numerically than the Liberal party. Though Sir Edward Morris had a majority of about ten in the House of Representatives, he invited the Opposition to join with him in the formation of a National Government for war purposes, and Dr. Lloyd,* who had become Leader of the joint parties in Opposition, took office in a Cabinet which had six representatives from each side. Though the matter of conscription had not till then been in direct issue, it had been seen for some time past that in certain districts of the country the full quota of men who should have enlisted had not done so, and members of the Conservative party realised that some form of compulsion would be necessary. As, however, about 90 per cent, of the then remaining young men of the country were fishermen, the Fishermen&apos;s Union party did not at that time feel able to take a definite line upon the subject of compulsory service. In August of last year the life of Parliament was extended on the understanding that a General Election should take place in 1918, but when it was seen that the conscrip-tion issue must be raised together with other issues upon which the parties were divided, Sir Edward Morris decided to retire in order that national unity might be secured, and that there should be no difference between the parties upon vital issues affecting the prosecution of the war. On Sir Edward Morris&apos;s retirement, Dr. Lloyd, who had been acting Prime Minister during Sir Edward Morris&apos;s absence in England, was, on the recommendation of the retiring Prime Minister, sent for by the Governor and succeeded in forming a Ministry.In April of this year the Newfoundland Government, under Dr. Lloyd, decided to introduce a measure of compulsory service, and the necessity for this step was disclosed to a secret session of Parliament.&apos; Under the Bill, compulsion was upon a selective basis, but confined to unmarried men and widowers (without children) between the ages of 19 and 39. Though it will be seen from the above that there was some party difference on the question of conscription in the past, the pressure of circumstances brought about by the German offensive caused any difference of opinion on the subject to be swept away, and the Conscription Bill was passed through both Branches of the Legislature unanimously, and came into operation on Empire Day (24th May), 1918. iForeign Questions. The question of foreign policy which naturally interests Newfoundland most closely is that relating to the control of the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon. It is well to bear in mind that the Newfoundland Government and the Newfoundland people regard any alteration in the jurisdiction over these islands as most important. Early in the war a despatch was sent by the late Prime Minister (Lord Morris), pointing out the importance of St. Pierre and Miquelon being ceded entirely to Great Britain in the event of the peace negotiations making it possible to effect this. Further, at the proceedings of the Sub-Committee of the Imperial War Cabinet last year, which dealt with territorial changes (under the chairmanship of Lord Curzon), Lord Morris amplified this view very strongly. It was also understood that Canada would strongly favour the removal of the smuggling centre of St. Pierre and Miquelon.It is well to recall the fact that St. Pierre and Miquelon were ceded to the French under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, and that this treaty gives the right of the islands to the French Government only for the purpose of shelter for their fishermen. There is a special provision against making the islands an object of jealousy between the two countries by forbidding any military organisation or any fortifications. Their value as a shelter or base for French fishermen has been considerably lessened of late years as, owing to the Anglo-French Treaty of 1904, by which the British Government bought out all the French fishing rights in Newfound-land, including all fixed establishments, the fishery is no longer carried on by the* The Eight Hon. W. R Lloyd, D.C.L., before he became Leader of the joint parties, was Leader of the Liberal party.
Trench from the Newfoundland coast or on the Newfoundland strand. French fishermen have now no right to land on the coasts or shores of Newfoundland.It should also be understood that the Anglo-French Treaty of 1904 in no way curtailed the French rights at St. Pierre and Miquelon. Previous.to 1904, the French had fishing rights from Cape Ray, on the south coast of Newfoundland, down through the Straits of Belle Isle and round to Cape John; they claimed this as an exclusive right, and it was the insistence of this right which led to the difficulties which were crystalised in the phrase of &quot; the French shore question.&quot;
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.It is unnecessary to review at any length the circumstances which prevented the attendance of Mr. Hughes and his colleagues at the session of the imperial War Cabinet last year, but it is convenient to recall that it was the split in the ranks of the Labour party (hitherto led by Mr. Hughes) on the issue of conscription, and the subsequent formation of a coalition between Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook* (the Leader of the Liberal Party) with the resulting general election, which kept Mr. Hughes in Australia.For a period prior to the election of May 1917, Mr. Hughes had remained in office by the help of the Liberal party, for, on his committing himself to conscription, he was left with only some twelve supporters out of about forty Labour representatives in the Lower House. However, as a result of the general election, the combination of the Liberals and the section of the Labour party following Mr. Hughes (now termed the Nationalist Party) were able to meet the new Parliament with a majority in the lower House of about thirty (in a Plouse of a little more than 70 members) over the party which then became known as the Official Labour party. The majority in the upper House was about twelve in a House of somewhat over thirty members..The line taken by Mr. Hughes at the general election was to pledge his followers that no conscription measure would be passed by Parliament without specially referring the matter to the people, as had been done in October 1916. But it was soon seen by the Nationalist Government that it was impossible to maintain the necessary reinforcements for the Australian divisions at the front under the syste?n of voluntary recruiting, and they decided, therefore, to hold another Conscription Referendum- which took place on the 20th December last.It was, of course, entirely open to the Prime Minister to take the Referendum on this single issue, and, if defeated, still to remain in Office. But owing very largely, no doubt, to the influence of that section of the Nationalist party, led by Sir William Irvine,t who might be termed uncompromising conscriptionists, the Government decided to stake their existence upon the result of the Referendum. Mr. Hughes announced therefore that if unsuccessful in the Referendum his party could not be responsible for carrying on the government of the country. The attitude of the anti-conscription opposition of the Official Labour party, generally speaking, was that it was more important for Australia to provide foodstuffs than men, that conscription would injure the industries of the country, and that Australia had already done her fair share in the war by voluntarily enlisting over 383,900 men out of a population of less than five millions, situated 12,000 miles away from the war zone.The actual proposals of the Government were less ambitious than those previously submitted to the people, for it was only suggested that power should be given to conscript, single men between the ages of 20 and 44 (including widowers or divorced men without children), of whom, it was estimated, there were about 150,000 available for service.The conscription campaign was carried on with intense vigour and no little personal animosity, and in the result the proposals of the Government were defeated by a majority of 159,895. The soldiers at the various fronts voted, and their vote alone showed a small majority in favour of conscription.Without attempting to analyse in any detail the various causes which led to the defeat of the Government proposals, it may be said that the selfish interests of the farmers, who desired to keep their men for productive purposes, and pointed out that great reserves of man-power were available in the United States within closer reach of the seat of war, and also the influence of the Irish Catholics, led by Archbishop Mannix (with whom the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Tudor, publicly identified himself) played no inconsiderable part.Though it is true that ceTtain disloyal elements in the country individually supported the Official Labour party, yet it is equally true to say that the Labour* Mr. Cook, who accompanies Mr. Hughes to England, is Minister for the Navy in the Coalition Government. As Leader of the Liberal party, Mr. Cook was Prime Minister from 1913-14 (having previously held the offices of Minister for Defence, Postmaster-General, &amp;c, in prior administra-tions) when Mr. Andrew Fisher defeated him at the election of September 1914, and came into office with Mr. Hughes as his Attorney-General. Mr. Cook was born in England in 1860, but left for Australia as a young man, and has never since visited this country. Sir Robert Garran (who accompanies the Prime Minister) is a Parliamentary draughtsman, and an authority on constitutional questions. After occupying the post of Secretary to the Attorney-GeneraPs Department, he was recently made Solicitor-General a new office, not involving ministerial rank, and mainly created for the purpose of dealing with the various legal questions arising out of the war.f Sir William Irvine has since been made the Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria.
party stoutly asserted that they were as anxious to win the war as their opponents,, though opposed to the policy of compulsion for service overseas.It is interesting to note that notwithstanding the declaration of the Govern-ment that they would stand or fall by the result of the Referendum, many voters, who would have ordinarily supported Mr.. Hughes or Mr. Cook at an election, voted against conscription, with the knowledge, of course, that the vote might involve the assumption of office by Official Labour. For example, in New South Wales, in purely Liberal seats which returned a majority of votes for the National-ist party at the last election of 80,106, at the Referendum showed a majority against conscription of 26,412, or an increase to Labour of 106,518 in Liberal constituencies.On the result of the Referendum poll becoming known, an interesting political development took place. In accordance with his pledge, Mr. Hughes placed his resignation before the Governor-General and offered no advice as to the appoint-ment of a successor. In considering the question of a dissolution the Governor-General felt it his duty to ascertain the extent of the support likely to be given in - Parliament to an alternative Government, as it was clear that no useful purpose would be served in authorising a dissolution with the prospect of a general election resulting in the return of parties of similar strength to a new Parliament. Sir R. Munro-Ferguson consulted, therefore, not only with the Leaders of the Nationalist and the Official Labour parties, but also with those who were leading the different groups of the Nationalist party, * and in the result he came to the con-clusion that the only person likely to form a stable Government was Mr. Hughes, and therefore recommissioned him to form an administration. The action of the Governor-General was criticised by Official Labour leaders, who argued that the constitutional thing was to invite Mr. Tudor to form an administration. How-ever, Mr., Hughes accepted office, and nominated all his former colleagues; and, though the Official Labour party attacked his action as amounting to a breach of his undertaking to resign, Mr. Hughes&apos; acceptance of office was endorsed by the Nationalist party caucus by sixty votes to eleven.In this decision the Nationalist party were influenced by the fear that their handing over the government to the Official Labour party would mean a weakening in the Commonwealth war policy. At the same time, however, both Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook offered to retire from the Government if such action would assist in promoting a new National Government which the Opposition Leaders would join. But the Labour Leaders appeared to think that this would involve the absorption of Labour by the Nationalists, and in any case the caucus which controls the action of the Official Labour Opposition were apparently not in favour of a coalition taking place.In the programme of the new Government, Mr. Hughes put first and foremost the matter of providing reinforcements, and in order to get rid of party controversy as to the number required he appointed an impartial tribunal, headed by the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, to report upon the number of men necessary to main-tain the Australian divisions at full strength and to consider the position in regard to casualties. While this assisted in removing the whole question of reinforce-ments from the sphere of party controversy, there is no doubt that the Conference called by the Governor-General to consider recruiting questions did a great deal more, for the Leader of the Opposition was amongst those present, and the follow-ing resolution was unanimously passed: &quot; That this Conference, meeting at a time of unparalleled emergency, resolves to make all possible efforts to avert defeat at the hands of German militarism, and urges the people of Australia to join in a whole-hearted effort to secure the necessary reinforcements under the voluntary system.&quot;In pursuance of the above resolution Mr. Tudor has appeared on the same platform with the acting Prime Minister, Mr. Watt, in advocating further voluntary enlistments, since the departure of Mr. Hughes for England.Besides this action in the direction of providing reinforcements, Mr. Hughes announced in February last that the Government would give immediate attention to matters of shipbuilding, to the reorganisation of industry, and to industrial legislation.With regard to the organisation of industry, the proposals made by Mr. Hughes involved a scheme setting up an association of each primary and secondary industry, a General Council of Commerce, a Department of Commerce with a Minister at the head, &apos;a Science Bureau, and trade representatives for the oversea markets. The scheme is being backed by the Commonwealth and by every industry, and the general support of the Opposition has been promised.-  * The Leaders of the sections! of the Nationalist Party were Sir W. Irvine, Mr. Cook, Sir John-(now Lord) Forrest, and Mr. Hughes.
The attitude of Mr. Hughes with reference to the economic policy for the Commonwealth in relation to trade with Germany after the war is given in these words: &quot; The foolish assertion that after the war Australia is not going to giveup German markets.....may be answered in a few words.   What-ever other nations or parts of the British Empire may do, Australia has neither the desire nor the intention of resuming her relations with Germany. Australia can get on quite well without Germany&apos;s goods of high reputation, but Germany cannot get on without wool and metals. Australia can sell her raw material, wool, metals, &amp;c, to Great Britain and her Allies, and she will ----  most certainly do so.&quot;With regard to shipbuilding, not only is naval shipbuilding proceeding at Cockatoo Island, where the Admiralty have advised the Commonwealth as to the best class of ships (recommending the building of destroyers in preference to submarines), but a number of steel freight steamers are being built for the Common-wealth Government in various parts of Australia. The shipbuilding project was the result of many long and difficult conferences with the Unions. Mr. Hughes, by personal ascendency alone, induced the delegates from the Unions to consent to his propositions. The Federal Ministers recently decided to requisition the inter-State snipping for ocean service, and to appoint a Shipping Controller and Board of Management.As regards returned soldiers, both the Federal and State Governments have devoted considerable attention to this subject with the idea of providing for the settlement of both Australian and British soldiers on the land, and a conference recently called by the Minister of Repatriation to consider the training of dis-charged soldiers recommended the appointment of district committees for the purpose of considering training facilities, opportunity of employment, suitability of applicants, &amp;c.Foreign Questions and Representation. The main question in the sphere of foreign politics which affects the&apos;vital interests of the Commonwealth is that in relation to the Pacific. Though Mr. Hughes has clearly shewn in his speeches that he fully realises that the future of Australia and New Zealand in the. Pacific will be determined not by what the people in those places desire, but by the Peace Conference, there is no doubt that the attitude of his Government towards any proposal to return captured territory to Germany is a particularly firm one. Indeed, Mr. Hughes declared on the 18th May, 1917: &quot; We cannot contemplate peace that would mean a restoration to Germany of an opportunity to create at our very doors, means for further onslaughts on Australia. The destiny of Australasia depends upon the control of the Pacific being in the hands of the Empire and its Allies.&quot; In his latest reported speech, delivered in the United States en route for England, Mr. Hughes emphasised the necessity of an Australasian Monroe Doctrine in the South Pacific, and, according to press cable reports, he appealed to the United States to support the Commonwealth in maintaining this doctrine. Again,, just before the delegates left Australia, Mr. Cook, who will represent Australia with Mr. Hughes, said:-&quot; If Germany could carry out her proclaimed programme and get the Pacific Colonies back, they would train the natives for defensive purposes, and Australia would have to keep up a huge standing army. It was treasonable,&quot; he said, &quot; for any person to advocate restoring the islands to Germany while the enemy were thundering at their gates, and he would stancl behind Mr. Hughes in London in urging the retention of the islands to the last gasp, as they were vital to Australia&apos;s security.&quot;Since the departure of Mr. Hughes, the able Acting-Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has declared that if Australia and New Zealand were to constitute the great white outpost of the Southern Seas, they must keep the captured adjacent islands from Germany and retain them in the possession of the Allies.There is practically no difference of opinion in the Commonwealth as to the importance of keeping Germany out of the Pacific, for the Official Labour party have also realised the German menace and declared in their official statement last year: &quot; Recent developments in aerial and submarine warfare indicate the perils which would threaten this continent if a potential enemy were permitted to acquire or resume sovereignty of the islands adjacent to Australia. In enemv control those islands would furnish numerous bases of operations for incessant raids on our coasts.&quot;
It was the danger to Australia of the re-establishment of Germany in the Pacific that caused the Commonwealth Senate to pass in August last the following resolution: &quot; That the Senate expresses its unqualified appreciation and approval of the statement made on 31st January last by the Colonial Secretary (Mr. Walter Long) which emphatically sets forth that none of the captured colonial possessions of the German Empire will, in any circumstances, be returned to that Power; and, furthermore, resolves that any proposal to restore the captured German territories in the vicinity of the Australian Continent will be particu-larly distasteful to the people of the Commonwealth, and prejudicial to their interests, as well as to the future peace of the world.&quot;It is perhaps difficult for those on this side of the world to realise how much the ambitions of the British communities in the southern seas are directed towards the Pacific; but the recent Report of the Commonwealth Inter-State Commission (a body set up under the Commonwealth of Australia Act to deal with matters of Trade and Commerce) clearly showed the direction of responsible opinion in the suggestion that the time was ripe for settling the question as to whether some form -of federated control could be devised, involving a High Commissionership of the Pacific, either held or not held in conjunction with the Governor-Generalship of the Commonwealth. I.t; was submitted that Australia would be the suitable kernel from which a Federation would naturally grow, and that any form of federated control should have Sydney as the central seat..As to the New Hebrides, the above-mentioned Report of the Inter-State Corn-mission declared that the Condominium was satisfactory neither to Great Britain nor to France, and that it is necessary to devise measures to arrest the decrease of the native population, to train the natives, and to teach them English. The Commission further reported that it is impossible to develop trade in order to compete with foreign countries without considerable subsidies, and they pointed out that the Commonwealth could, with considerable commercial advantage, afford to allow most of the Pacific productions to enter Australia free of duty.As to the more adequate representation of the Commonwealth in the foreign affairs which affect her interests, it is interesting to note that the attitude of the Official Labour party is influenced in the main by the fear that any closer arrange-ments for consultation might interfere with the self-governing powers at present possessed by Australia.   Last year the Leader of the Opposition declared: - &quot; Labour is not, and never has been, opposed to the representation of Australia at the Imperial Conference, but considers that decisions affecting the Commonwealth should be submitted to the Federal Parliament for ratification, and the delegates going should be instructed to oppose any curtailment of the powers of self-government that are now enjoyed by the people of Australia.&quot;The jealous regard for the maintenance of autonomous rights which is illus-trated by the above extract is also fully appreciated by the Nationalist party, who, however, do not seem to regard the methods of consultation involved by meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet or Conference as in any way likely to trespass upon Australia^ rights as a nation. Indeed, Mr. Hughes has more than once indicated how essential it is for the interests of Australia to be adequately represented in the settlement of those affairs which will decide her future in regard to foreign countries. Further, he has notified his desire to raise at the forthcoming meetings in London the question of the channels of communication between the Dominions and the United Kingdom.The Official Labour party have not made any criticism on the policy of the representation of the Commonwealth at the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet except in the direction of moving a resolution that Mr. Hughes and Mr. Cook could not effectively represent Australian public opinion. This, how-ever, did not receive more than small support in the House of Representatives. While certain Official Labour Leaders, including Mr. Tudor&apos;s principal lieutenant in the Lower House, Mr. Higgs, have declared in favour of &quot; Peace by negotiation,&quot; the Leader of the Federal Opposition in the Senate and other Labour Leaders have announced their entire opposition to any policy of this character. So though it may be said that the Official Labour party contains strong Pacifists, the party is by no means exclusively composed of the Pacifist element.
NEW ZEALAND.The political affairs in New Zealand from the domestic standpoint have not undergone any considerable changes since the last session of the Imperial War Cabinet. The National Government of Mr: Massey and Sir Joseph Ward, which was formed in 1915, has continued to receive the support of Parliament, though in August last, owing to certain criticisms in Parliament, the Prime Minister expressed his willingness to agree to a General Election if the idea was supported by a sufficiently representative body of opinion in the House. Mr. Massey declared, how-ever, that the last Municipal Elections showed that during the war people did not desire to change the Government, and he himself believed that it was a wrong thing to hold an election while the country was fighting for its existence. The attitude of Mr. Massey was confirmed by a unanimous resolution of confidence in his leadership passed by his followers in the Reform Party, the resolution congratulating Mr. Massey &quot;on the valuable services rendered by him to the Empire during his recent visit to Great Britain, and assuring him of its continued loyalty and complete con-fidence in him as Prime Minister and Leader of the party.&quot;A similar resolution of loyalty to Sir Joseph Ward, who, as Minister of Finance, is Mr. Massey&apos;s colleague in the National Government, was passed by the Liberal party, who resolved: &quot; That this meeting desires to pledge its continued loyalty to Sir Joseph Ward, its Leader, and wishes to leave the settlement of all matters affecting the party to him.&quot;The conscription issue in New Zealand has not affected the position of political parties as it has done in Canada, Australia, and Newfoundland, for both political parties combined to pass the Military Service Act of August 1916, which was the first conscription measure passed by any Dominion Parliament. The only section of the community that has criticised the conscription measure were the Pacifists, who were represented in Parliament by a small number of Labour Members. Summary measures, however, were taken by the New Zealand Government regarding the Members of Parliament who actively opposed the operation of the conscription law. No provision was made for the exemption of Members of Parliament from the Act, and Mr. Webb, a Labour Member, who refused to put on uniform, was sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment, and Parliament subsequently declared his seat to be vacated.Foreign Questions and Representation. The strong feeling of the Dominion of New Zealand, regarding the retention of captured territory in the Pacific, was indicated by the representatives of the Dominion during the last session of the Imperial War Cabinet. Since these meetings took place, however, the position of the New Zealand Ministers has been emphasised from time to time, and has clearly been endorsed by public opinion. The statements of Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward on the subject have had relation more to the general question of the German menace in the Pacific Ocean than to the intrinsic value of the captured Pacific islands, and this was well illustrated in Mr. Massey&apos;s speech in Parliament on the 3rd July last, shortly after his return from England. He pointed out that there were far more important points to consider than the mere value of the German colonies, and he said: &quot; If these German colonies in the South Pacific are allowed to become what may be called pawns in the political game, and are given back at the end of the war and I do not think there is a chance of that now it would mean they would be occupied by our present enemy, by citizens of the German Empire; but, in addition to. that, it would mean that naval bases would be established in the Pacific; that wireless stations would be erected; that they would become the headquarters for submarines, and probably the headquarters of airships in some form.&quot; &apos;Mr. Massey expressed the belief that the Statesmen of Great Britain now thought a great deal more of the British interests in the Pacific than they did some years ago. &quot; They see,&quot; he said, &quot;there are now growing up in the Pacific young nations, such as Australia and New Zealand, that are likely to play no unimportant
fpart in British history, and, perhaps, in the history of the world in years to come.&quot; Later the Prime Minister called attention to the importance of the representation of Australasia at the Peace Conference, on account of the possibility of a peace being agreed upon which would involve the restoration of Samoa to Germany. This, he stated, would be nothing short of a national calamity from the standpoint of British interests in the Pacific.Sir Joseph Ward has been no less emphatic than Mr. Massey in regard to the retention of captured territory in the Pacific. In giving his account to Parliament, on the 3rd July, he said: &quot; It would be a crime against the people of the Oversea Dominions in the Pacific, if these islands were ever allowed to revert either to Germany or to any other foreign country. . . . . There is no misunderstanding on the part of the people of this Dominion as to what our views are as to the future of the islands in the Pacific. I believe that if you were to poll this country from one end to the other upon that very great question, and if the people were told that by now giving them up we might have to fight for it again, rather than give up the islands of the Pacific, they would prefer to carry on the conflict until such an awful possibility were eliminated.&quot;Later, on the 12th February last, in a speech at Christchurch, Sir Joseph Ward stated that the New Zealand representatives were attending the meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet as an imperative duty, and not as a matter of choice. He declared that the question of the Pacific islands was one of dominant importance, and that the Dominion representatives must help to prevent their reversion to Germany. Later he declared that if New Zealand were not represented in London, and arrangements were made for restoring the Pacific islands to Germany, it would be a worse calamity than the loss of twenty elections, and would mean for all time a danger overshadowing the Dominion.As to the representation of New Zealand generally in matters of foreign affairs affecting her interests, it was indicated both by Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward at the meetings of the Imperial War Conference last year that there ought to be continuous consultation with Dominion representatives by the War Cabinet (see Proceedings of Imperial War Conference of ninth and fourteenth days). At the same time it should be noted that there has been criticism in the Dominion as to the visit of the Prime Minister and Sir J. Ward to England, as following so closely upon the visit paid last year. While appreciating the necessity of adequate representation of their interests in Imperial, and more especially foreign, affairs, many representative men in the Dominions, which are situated so far away as New Zealand and Australia, consider the necessarily lengthy absence of their Prime Ministers for annual meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, a matter of serious importance, as they somewhat naturally look to the Prime Minister to attend to matters in his own Dominion as one of his first duties. For this reason the appoint-ment of a Cabinet Minister to look after the wider political interests of his Dominion in London, at any rate during the war, has been frequently suggested.
SOUTH AFRICA.The most outstanding and significant feature of the past twelve months in South Africa is undoubtedly the campaign in favour of an independent South African Republic carried on by the Nationalist party. So dangerous and virulent had this campaign, under the leadership of General Hertzog, become, that in June of last year the veteran statesman, Mr. J. X. Merriman, considered it advisable to intro-duce into Parliament a resolution condemning republican propaganda in the follow-ing terms: &quot; That this House, viewing with alarm several manifestations of a Repub-lican propaganda now being carried on in the country, desires to record its opinion that such manifestations, whether by speech, writing, or other methods, are directly, at variance with the Constitution of the country as laid down and agreed to in the South Africa Act, that they are opposed to the best interests of the people, and that, if persisted in, they must inevitably lead to fatal dissensions and the ultimate ruin of the European race in South Africa. This House therefore calls upon all those who are loyal to the Constitution to express the strongest disapproval of the dangerous efforts of those who seek to subvert the principles on which that Constitution is based.&quot;This resolution was debated in Parliament with some heat, and, in the course of the discussion, General Hertzog contended that there was nothing in the Constitu-tion which was opposed to his conducting a pro-Republician propaganda.   The resolution was ultimately passed by 72 votes to 21, the minority being solely composed of Nationalists. *   Immediately after the resolution was passed, the more public activities of the Republican propagandists to some extent slackened, though the agitation was still carried on with considerable effect throughout the country.   In March-April last it broke out in a more violent form, synchronising in an extra-ordinary way with the German offensive, when General Hertzog openly contended that the Nationalists had the fullest right to ask for an amendment to the Constitu-tion in order to obtain a Republic; while Dr. Malan, the editor of the leading nationalist organ, &quot; De Burger,&quot; &apos;declared that nobody Gould be a good South African who was not a Republican.   The immediate outcome was another warm debate in the House of Assembly, when General Botha was forced to make an earnest appeal to British-born South Africans not to expect from Dutch South Africans the same kind of enthusiasm that they expected from themselves, and to urge the Nationalists to put an end to Republican propaganda as it was leading to civil war.f General Hertzog, in his latest speeches, has completely altered his position.   The Nationalist Leader has latterly been advocating peaceful methods, and has denied that he ever spoke in favour of attaining any object by force of arms.   Indeed, realising that he had gone too far, General Hertzog has now declared that he will abandon his activities in favour of a Republic for the present.As to the arguments advanced by General Hertzog from time to time in justifica-tion of his anti-Empire attitude, these form a curious mixture of logical plausibility, and appeals to the narrowest racial prejudice. For example, in his contention that &quot; in the correct sense of the term an Empire you have not got. You have England, South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other Dominions. You do not stand under England nor England under you, but you stand under the English King. You stand on an equal footing with the other Dominions, but now people speak of the six Dominions as the British Empire, though there is no Imperial Parliament and no Imperial Government,&quot;* Though in a considerable minority in the House of Assembly, it should be noted that the power of the Nationalists in the country is a growing one, as may be seen if the votes cast for the Nationalists and the South African party at the General Election of 1913 are compared with those polled at the elections for the Provincial Councils last year. Before the General Election of October, 1915, the Nationalist party in the Lower House consisted of about 12 members. As a result of the election the number rose to 27; the supporters of General Botha., of the South African party, number-ing 54; the Unionists, under Sir Thomas Smartt, -40; Labour, 4; and Independent, 5.t It is to be noted that any active rebellion by the extreme Nationalists is unlikely. Not only has this been discountenanced by the leaders, but the Nationalists would be unable to obtain sufficient arms for a successful rebellion, owing to precautions which General Botha&apos;? Government -have taken since the rebellion of 1914.
&quot;General Hertzog is, in certain respects, logically accurate, and is able to exploit the incompleteness of the present Imperial connection to its fullest value for his own purposes. But in his contention that in all measures the interests of South Africa should be put before those of the general interests of the Empire, and that in the present war it was to South Africa&apos;s interest to remain neutral, the Nationalist leader carefully omitted to tell the Dutch farmer, who, perhaps, had never seen the sea. that he would be unable to find a market for his wool or a price for his produce if the British Empire to-day were not maintaining the command of the sea.But the doctrine of &apos;&apos; neutrality &apos;&apos; appealed naturally to those Dutchmen who may be forgiven for having no violent enthusiasms for an Empire with which they were only lately engaged in-deadly combat, and who, moreover, before the war had no particular reason to dislike the German traders in South Africa with whom they had dealings. General Hertzog, therefore, advocated the &quot; neutrality &quot; doctrine until he found that it served no longer as a &quot; vote-catching &quot; venture. General Botha&apos;s reply was that &quot; for a British subject to declare his neutrality in the present war was no more or less than a declaration of war against the British Empire of which they were a part. He could never be a party to such a state of affairs, and neutrality under the present circumstances was ridiculous.&quot;In replying to a question, General Botha said that &quot; when England is at war, South Africa is also ipso facto at war.&quot; This reply was soon seen to be estimated at its full weight, and the direct challenge later to General Hertzog to oppose the campaign in South-West Africa caused him to reconsider his position.    The Nationalist leader was astute enough to realise that a great many people saw in South-West Africa a chance of acquiring excellent farming land at a not too considerable cost, so the General found other directions in which to attack the British Empire and the Dutch Prime Minister and Government who were &apos;&apos; playing up &quot; to the terms of the Treaty of Vereeniging with such remarkable strength of character and such statesmanlike purpose.   The agreement between the Botha Government and the British authorities for the sale of the South African wool-clip at 55 per cent, advance on 1914-15 prices was seized upon by General Hertzog as providing   an   excellent   oportunity   of   showing   his   Dutch   followers   how &quot;Imperialism&quot; really worked.   The Nationalists, therefore, organised farmers&apos; meetings in the country districts to protest against the arrangement, and to demand an open market, which would enable them to sell the wool to the United States and Japan at higher prices.   So dangerous a factor in the situation did this agitation become, for it was seen that some of General Botha&apos;s followers in the South African party were by no means unsympathetic to the Nationalist arguments, that the British Government felt obliged to permit those farmers who wished it to withdraw from their contracts to sell to the British Government at the agreed price.   A certain number of farmers in consequence withdrew from their contracts; but, notwithstand-ing the arrangement permitting them to do so, General Hertzog criticised the conduct of General Botha&apos;s negotiations with the Home Government.  However, in the division upon the Nationalist motion in tnis connection, which took place in the House of Assembly, the minority consisted wholly of Nationalists.One of the principal protagonists on behalf of the Union Government in its defence against Nationalist attacks has been the able Minister of Railways, Mr. Burton, who will be a co-delegate with General Smuts as representing South Africa at the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet in London.* . In a speech delivered on the 12th April last in connection with the campaign of the Nationalists. Mr. Burton affirmed that the Government would not change their war policy even if they stood alone as ten men. He said there had been some talk by the Nationalists which was treachery to the Constitution and the Flag, and that all who valued the Constitution and the national honour should close up their ranks against treason. South Africa, Mr. Burton said, had no cause for dissatisfaction with Great Britain, who had carried out her&apos; promises to the full, and he declared that the Nationalists, like the Sinn Feiners, stood for nothing: but egotistical isolation.It is undoubtedly true that the differences between the South African party and the Nationalists, more especially in regard to the war, are acute, but a good deal of the bitterness and difficulty of working together has, no doubt, arisen from the* Mr. Burton was born in Cape Town in 1866, and before the Union Government was Attorney-General in the Cape Government.J
personal differences between General Hertzog and General Botha. However, it must not be forgotten that though in war measures the two parties are in strong opposition in many important directions, yet they may quite well act together in other matters. To take only one example, in the Transvaal Provincial Council not long ago, the question arose as to how a deficit on the year&apos;s estimates should be met, and the solution was found by the South African party and the Nationalists combining against the Unionist and Labour representatives in order to impose an additional income tax, a war-profits tax, and other taxes falling entirely on the urban popula-tion, although it was shown in the previous session of the Union Parliament that the farmers were not contributing anything like their fair quota of income tax.On the other hand, it cannot be said that there is any likelihood of a coalition taking place between the South African party and the Unionists, and General Botha declared at the General Congress of the South African party at Pretoria last year definitely against the policy of coalition. However, one of the Union Ministers (Sir Thomas Watt) publicly suggested some months ago that the Unionists should join the South African party, as the aims of the two parties were practically the same,, for both adhered to the Constitution, and wished to win the war.The position of the Leader of the Unionist party (Sir Thomas Smartt) was outlined during a tour of Natal at the end of last year, when he emphasised the attitude of the party by reiterating that, so long as the Union Government continued to support the British Government in&apos; its war measures, the Unionist party would give its support in the ,House regardless, of party advantage or political gain.Notwithstanding the distractions of local politics, the Union Government have thrown themselves into an active campaign to increase recruiting. This opened on the 8th April last, and in response to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s appeal to bring the South African Brigade up to strength without delay, General Botha declared:-&quot; I feel that while chivalry lives and honour remains, so long as duty has not become a bye-word, so long as a common destiny unites us to the Empire, such a call for help must, and will, be answered by the manhood of South Africa.&quot;A system of &quot;recruiting by * substitution &quot; was subsequently inaugurated, and all Ministers, all Unionist Members of the House of Assembly, and many of the South African party Members at once put down their names to find substitutes.During the past year, the economic position of South Africa has been very satisfactory. In a statement made in Parliament last February, the Minister of Railways said that in view of the extent to which the world&apos;s trade had been affected, the general trade of South Africa had continued surprisingly good. He observed that the people of South Africa had not sufficiently appreciated the remarkable freedom of the country from the acute effects of the war.Imperial Representation and Questions affecting Foreign Nations. It will have been seen that one of the arguments of the Nationalists has been in relation to the illogical position of South Africa within the Empire (see page 13), and a matter which General Hertzog has often seized upon as a means of criticising the Imperial relationship is the alleged subservience of South Africa to the British Parliament. Only recently he reiterated what he described as his objection to the doctrine of General Botha and his Ministers, that South Africa came under the British Parlia-ment. In reply, General Botha has been able to show that, since the Union received its Constitution, the British Government had never on a single occasion interfered with South Africa,^ and he has shown that the British Parliament does not in practice interfere with South African autonomy, tAs to an Empire Parliament, General Hertzog has declared that this would make the position &quot; a thousand times&quot; worse,&quot; and he has indicated a conference of Nationalist leaders to discuss the establishment of an Empire Parliament with which, he says, &quot;South Africa is threatened.&quot; There is no doubt that General Botha is opposed to the idea of an Imperial Federal Parliament,^: and he denied &quot; most emphatically &apos;&apos; that he was in favour of it^ in one of his speeches replying to General Hertzog some time ago. Indeed, he claimed that he had proved most clearly at the Imperial Conference of 1911 that he was against an Imperial Federal Parliament.* Speech in Parliament on Mr. Merriman&apos;s resolution, June, 1917. t May 1918.t See speech at Ermelo (bye-election) reported &quot; Weekly Cape Times,&quot; 3rd November, 1916. General Botha&apos;s attitude to an Imperial Parliament or Council was outlined at the Imperial Conference of 1911 (see Cd. 5745 at p. 69).151.1] F
The actual position of South Africa in the Empire was outlined by General Botha in a public speech of November 1913, when he described the Union as &quot; a .sister State of England.&quot; He denied that South Africa was a subject State, but stated that she was on an equality with the United Kingdom, and part of the British Empire. This standpoint was in accordance with the resolution put for-ward by General Botha at the 1911 Imperial Conference, to the effect &quot;that it is desirable that all matters relating to self-governing Dominions, as well as perma-nent secretariat of the Imperial Conference, be placed directly under the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.&quot;But though a Federal Parliament may not be acceptable to the South African Ministry, it is to be noted that the object of &quot; giving the various parts of the Empire a final say in questions of great importance, such as the declaration of war,&quot; has &quot;been commended by Mr. Burton (Minister of Railways) as an honest one; while Mr. F. S. Malan (Minister of Mines, Industries, and Education) has made an even more significant declaration, in the following words: &quot; If a council were to be formed only to discuss the questions of peace and war, the Dominions would gain, for then they would have a voice in the question of war, whereas now, if GreatBritain declared war, the Dominions were at war as part of the Empire, although they had no voice in declaring war.&quot;*As to the position of South Africa in relation to the various questions of foreign policy and territorial adjustment arising out of the war, General Botha is clearly anxious that South Africa should be represented at the Peace Conference.! Con-sidering that South African forces have captured more foreign territory than any other portion of the Empire, and that the Union is threatened on land by the ambitions of Germany in Africa, the feeling regarding captured territory is easily understood. The position of the Union Government in regard to German South-West Africa was stated by General Botha as follows: I&quot; Originally I said that I was not going to German South-West Africa with the object of land-grabbing. I must, however, say that this attitude has since been considerably altered, owing to the Kaiser&apos;s telegram, in which he said: &apos; I will not only acknowledge the independence of South Africa, but I will even guarantee it, provided rebellion is started immediately.&apos; In this it is possible to detect the German desire to possess the Union. For this reason I feel that, so far as I am concerned, it is impossible to return the territory to the Germans. If the territory were given back, endless difficulty would arise.&quot;. This view was supported by Mr. Burton, who declared: &quot;It is difficult to exaggerate the feeling of South Africa against any prospect of the return of the South-West Protectorate to Germany. If any concessions are finally made to German colonisation, we can never tolerate her as a neighbour again, especially after the revelations of the war as to her purpose and methods.&quot;The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) has been equally emphatic with regard to all captured territory, for he declared: $&quot; When the time comes for peace terms to be discussed at a conference table, we, in South Africa, shall naturally be concerned with its decisions in regard to the former German colonies in South-West and East Africa It is unthink-able that^the Allies would agree to these countries being handed back to the Power which has shown its incompetency to govern them in the interests of their native populations; and as the British Dominion which has been so closely associated with their conquest, and has such paramount interest in their proper government, we feel convinced that the voice of the loyal inhabitants of South Africa will receive that due consideration to which it is entitled.&quot;* See speech at Carnarvon, reported in &quot; Eand Daily Mail,&quot; the 12th December, 1916; and &quot; Weekly Cape Times,&quot; the 15th December, 1916. &apos;t See speeches delivered to his constituents in October 1917, and also a few weeks ago. J See speech of August 1915.5 See report of an interview, &quot; The Times &quot; (London), 17th January, 1918.
Even General Hertzog declared, on behalf of the Nationalists, in reference to South-West Africa:-&quot; South Africa has first claim on the territory, provided its people are willing to be annexed, and our people are also willing, it ought to be incorporated.&quot;But the whole attitude of responsible opinion in the Union regarding captured territory in Africa has been most clearly put by General Smuts in the following passages from the remarkable address he delivered in January of this year. That Germany&apos;s real ambitions in Africa are thoroughly appreciated in South Africa is shown by this extract from General Smuts&apos; address:-&quot; German colonial aims are really not colonial, but are entirely dominated by far-reaching conceptions of world politics. Not colonies, but military power and strategic possessions for exercising world-power in future are her real aims. . . . . This Central African block, the maps of which are now in course of preparation and printing at the Colonial Office in Berlin, is intended, in the first place, to supply the economic requirements and raw materials of German industry; and in the second, and far more important, place, to become the recruit-ing ground for vast native armies, the great value of which has been demonstrated in the tropical campaign of this war, and especially in East Africa, while the natural harbours on the Atlantic and Indian Oceans w^ould supply the naval and submarine bases from which both ocean routes would be dominated, and British and American sea-power would be brought to nought.&quot;In contrasting the aims of the British Empire in Africa, General Smuts said: &quot; The objects pursued by British policy on the African Continent areinherently pacific and defensive.....Looking at the future from thebroadest points of view, looking at the magnitude of its Imperial African interests, and the future welfare of the vast native populations, and its difficult-task of civilising the Dark Continent; looking, further, upon Africa as the half-way house to India and Australasia, the British Empire asks only for peace and security internal peace and security of its external communications. It cannot allow the return of conditions which mean the militarisation of the natives and their employment for schemes of world-power; it cannot allow naval and sub-marine bases to be organised on both sides of the African coast to the endangerment of the sea communications of the Empire, and the peace of the world. And it must insist on the maintenance of conditions which will guarantee through land communications for its territories from one end of the continent to the other.&quot; -Regarding the actual disposal of the captured German colonies, General Smuts pronounced as follows: &quot; As long as there is no real change of heart in Germany, and no final and irrevocable break with militarism, the law of self-preservation must be con-sidered paramount. No fresh extension of Prussian militarism to other continents and seas should be tolerated; and the conquered German colonies can only be regarded as guarantees for the security of the future peace of the world. This opinion will be shared, I feel sure, by the vast bulk of the young nations who form the Dominions of the British Empire.   They have no military aimsor ambitions; their tasks are solely the tasks of peace.....They shouldnof be asked to consent to the restoration to a militant Germany of fresh foot-holds for militarism in the southern hemisphere, and thus endanger the future of their young and rising communities, who are developing the waste spaces of the earth. They want a new Monroe Doctrine for the south, as there has been a Monroe Doctrine for the west, to protect it against European militarism.&quot;H. d&apos;E.June 1918.o
