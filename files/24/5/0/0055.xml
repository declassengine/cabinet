&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1919.SECRET. G.-253.REPORT OF COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE TH  QUESTION OF GOVERN -MENT MACHINERY FOR DEALING WITH TRADE AND COMMERCE.Terms of Reference.[War Cabinet 553, Minute 4.]TO examine the question of Government Machinery for dealing with Trade and Commerce, with special reference to paragraphs 24 to 27 of Section IV of the Report by Sir Auckland Geddes on Unemployment and the State of Trade (G.-237) as follows : &quot; Section IV. Government Machinery for Dealing with Trade and Commerce.&quot; 24. There are seven Government Departments or sub-Departments actively engaged in trade questions: &quot; The Board of Trade with its subsidiary the War Trade Department.&quot; The Foreign Office with the Ministry of Blockade and the War Trade IntelligenceDepartment. &quot; The Overseas Trade Department. &quot; The Ministry of Munitions.&quot; After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the control of our commercial and trade interests by so many Departments is radically unsound in principle. The Report of Lord Haldane&apos;s Committee on the Machinery of Government indicates clearly that one Department, and only one, should be primarily concerned in rendering a single service to the State. The violation of that principle in this case not only hampers administration, but, as will be seen, tends to confuse policy.&quot;25. In my opinion, much of our present difficulty in getting overseas trade restarted is the direct result of the complexity of our central machinery for dealing with commercial questions. Now that it is probable that the Board of Trade will lose many of its important functions to the Ministry of Ways and Communications, there is, I believe, an excellent opportunity presented for transforming it into what may be called a Ministry of Commerce. Such a Ministry must not be a machine which merely administers regulations, but a Department responsible for the formulation of our Trade policy, consciously doing ail in its power to stimulate internal trade and to foster and develop our commercial interests within and without the Empire. Obviously the Ministry of Commerce would be separate from the Foreign Office, and from the Ministry of Munitions (or Supply), in so far as the latter is concerned with producing and purchasing articles required by Government Departments.&quot; I therefore recommend : &quot; That the Board of Trade should absorb, not only the War Trade Department, but also the Overseas Trade Department and the War Trade Intelligence Department, and that it should take over from the Ministry of Supply, and from Departments, such as the War Office, which have functions to hand over to the Ministry of Supply, the control of raw materials that are held oil Government account, but which are required by our manufacturers and traders to re-establish their business.&quot; 26. It appears to me that all questions concerning the Consular Service, Commercial Attaches, &amp;c, belong primarily to the Ministry of Commerce, but clearly such services are also of the greatest interest and importance to the Foreign Office. Again in accordance with the principle laid down in the Machinery of Government Report, I recommend : -&quot; That some joint machinery, possibly of the nature of a Standing Inter-departmental Committee of the Foreign Office and Board of Trade, should be established to control these services.&quot; 27. In this manner I believe the present advantages which arise from the existence of the Overseas Trade Department will be retained, and the main disadvantages of its existence as a quasi-independent department obviated.&quot;&apos; 13?WAR CABINET.[192]B
Introductory.1. Our terms of reference are very wide, but we understand that we are required primarily to consider the recommendations in paragraphs 24-27 of the Report made by Sir Auckland Geddes (then Minister of Reconstruction and National Service) on Unemployment and the State of Trade (G.-237).We regret that the issue of our Report has been materially delayed owing to the absence of important witnesses in Paris.2. With regard to Sir Auckland Geddess proposal that the control of the raw materials mentioned in his Report should be transferred to the Board of Trade no difference of view has arisen ; and accordingly we have given our attention to the other questions raised by the Report, namely, (1) the machinery for commercial purposes in foreign countries, and particulary the Consular Service and Commercial Attaches, and (2) the organisation at home, and particularly the relations between the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, and the Department of Overseas Trade.We annex in Appendix (A) a list of witnesses heard by the Committee, and in Appendix (B) a statement as to the existing Government Machinery for dealing with Trade and Commerce.Control of Consular Service.3. Dealing first with the Consular Service, it appears now to be agreed on all sides that this service should remain under the control of the Foreign Office. Consuls, although largely concerned with commercial questions, have other and most important duties to perform, and indeed are, as representatives of the British Government, the guardians of the interests of British subjects in places where no diplomatic Mission is stationed. Even in relation to matters which are purely commercial the influence and prestige of the Consular Officer is dependent to a great extent on his connection with the diplomatic Mission to which he is immediately responsible.4. Nor do we consider it practicable permanently to place the appointment and control of Consuls under one Department and the supervision of their work of collecting commercial intelligence and safeguarding commercial interests under another.The Consular Officers and Commercial Secretaries who gave evidence before the Committee were unanimous in their opinion that Consuls jwould be placed in an impossible position if they were to be appointed and controlled by the Foreign Office, while their commercial work (which, it is hoped, will in the future form the most important part of their duties) would be carried out for another Department, and would pass through the Foreign Office, if at all, only as a channel of communication, with the result that the Department to which Consuls are responsible would not appreciate their work and would give them little credit for it. They urge that the Department which appoints, pays, promotes, and controls the Consuls should be in a position to take a live interest in the work which they have to do, and able to appreciate it at its proper value.There would also be an obvious danger in establishing a system under which the diplomatic and commercial representatives of this country abroad would be acting independently and sometimes in different directions.5. The evidence on this point is overwhelming, and the necessity of leaving to the Foreign Office the full control of the Consular Service is now niversally admitted. &quot; The Consular Service,&quot; said Sir Auckland Geddes (now President of the Board of Trade), &quot; is essentially a Foreign Office concern, and has so many functions in addition to trade that it would be quite wrong to put it under the Board of Trade.&quot;Improvement of Conditions of Consular Service.6. At the same time, we are convinced that an enlargement of the Consular staff and an improvement in its training and status are urgently required. We understand that the War Cabinet has recently approved a scheme put forward by Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland (G.-243), so far as it relates to the development of the Consular Service, including the creation of new posts, training, pay, and allowances, and we recommend that the parts of this scheme which have been so approved be brought into operation as early as possible. In this connection we venture to add that, while we appreciate the objection to sanctioning the payment to a particular class of Civil Servants of salaries free from income tax, we think that, in view of the rejection by the War Cabinet of this recommendation, the scale of pay will require revision.
Commercial Diplomatic Service.We also recommend the Cabinet to approve the recommendations contained in Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s scheme above referred to as to the number, pay, and recruiting of Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, but we do not consider that the&apos; proposal contained in the scheme for the amalgamation of the Trade Commissioner Service with the Commercial Diplomatic Service should be adopted.We approve the proposals contained on page 12 of the same report for periodical interchange between the staffs of the department at home and the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services abroad.Board of Trade Attaches.7. We have considered a proposal made by the President of the Board of Trade that permanent Board of Trade Attaches should be posted to British Embassies in foreign countries, on the analogy of the existing Naval and Military Attaches. We are unable to agree to this suggestion. We are of opinion that, as has been strongly represented to us by all the witnesses familiar with conditions in foreign capitals, it is essential that all British officials permanently stationed in foreign countries (other than those concerned entirely with purely naval and military matters) shall not only be attached to the staff of the British Ambassador, but shall also be under Foreign Office control. We think that any other arrangement would only produce friction and misunderstanding, and would hamper the work of such officials in their relations with the Government of the country in which they were stationed. Moreover, if Board of Trade Attaches were to be appointed to collect and classify the commercial intelligence obtained from consuls, and to survey economic conditions in the countries in which they were stationed, it would be but another instance of requiring consular officers to report to the officials of a Department to which they were not responsible, and would also involve a duplication of the work which is already being done by the commercial counsellors and other members of the Commercial Diplomatic Service.Temporary Missions.8. On the other hand, we see no objection to, and indeed every advantage in, the appointment, as occasion may arise, of temporary missions deputed by the Board of Trade for special purposes, such missions to be attached to and work under the British Ambassadors and Ministers abroad; and we understand that such an arrangement would be welcomed by the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office should be consulted as to the political expediency of any particular mission or visit and as to its personnel. Officers sent out in this way would throughout their visit keep in close touch with the Embassy or Legation, and would be amenable to the control of the Head of the Mission. It would be part of the recognised duty of the appropriate members of the Diplomatic or Consular staff to assist and promote the enquiries of these special agents and officials; and they would in suitable cases be given temporary rank as members of the mission.In order to ensure the adequate development of this method, it is essential that the Board of Trade should have free discretion within fixed financial limits with regard to sending its officers or other experts abroad without having to make out a case to the Treasury each time. A lump allowance should therefore be inscribed on the Board of Trade estimates for this purpose.Selection and Promotion Committees.We recommend that the Board of Trade shall be represented on the Selection Committee for candidates for the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services, and also on the Promotion Committee for both of these services.Labour Attaches.9. We have also considered the proposal that there should be attached to the British Missions in foreign countries permanent Labour Attaches, responsible to the Minister of Labour but working under the Ambassador or Minister.For the reasons given above we think it is undesirable that members of the permanent staff of a mission should be made responsible to a department other than the Foreign Office, and it appears to us that such enquiries as the Minister of Labour deems necessary should be made either through members of the Diplomatic Staff or by means of special missions of the character above described.
Chambers of Commerce.10. We think that full use should be made by the Diplomatic and Consular Service abroad of the opportunities for consultation with British traders which are given by the formation in many foreign countries of British Chambers of Commerce. These Chambers are generally energetic and efficient bodies, and it is obviously of importance that the spirit of combination and collective eifort which has sprung from the war should be maintained and utilised in the development of our interests after the war.Department of Overseas Trade.11. Passing now to the organisation at home, we proceed to consider the proposal in Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;s report that the Department of Overseas Trade should be absorbed by the Board of Trade. &quot;The duty of advising on the commercial policy of this country whether at home or overseas is clearly within the province of the Minister of Commerce ; and there is at first sight much to attract in the proposition that such a Minister should have the sole and unfettered control of a department dealing with trade abroad. Trade, wherever carried on by British subjects, is trade; and no very definite line can be drawn between the borne, colonial, and foreign transactions of a British house of business.View of Business Men.12. But when the proposal under discussion was put before business men, it became clear that there is in the business community of this country a strong body of opinion adverse to such a proposal.Evidence was given on behalf of the&apos; Associated Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of British Industries to the effect that business men attach great importance to being able to interest directly in foreign commercial questions that Department which has power to exercise diplomatic pressure in a foreign country. It is stated that British manufacturers are badly in need of more diplomatic support abroad, and that such support can only be secured by the intelligent combination of economic and political pressure; that the tendency to divorce commercial from political work would be disastrous, and that traders must have direct access to the Foreign Office. They do not want to go to another Department. They feel that it is always difficult to induce a Government Department, such as the Foreign Office, to take the same interest in business introduced by another Department, such as the Board of Trade, as it would take in business under its own control. They say that it frequently is only possible to obtain the desired diplomatic support by enlisting the assistance of the British Minister himself in a foreign country, and that this is more likely (to be obtained if the Foreign Office has itself been closely following the course of the business in question than if it is asked by another Department to take action.It is urged that what is really required is that the Foreign Office should be &quot;commercialised,&quot; and the control of our foreign commercial policy extended to that office.Recommendations by the Foreign Office.13. The arguments so put forward are pushed to their fullest limits by the Foreign Office, who claim, noc only, that they should control the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services and the collection and classification of economic and commercial intelligence, but also that they should be responsible for its issue to the public, and should be the department to which the public should look for information on foreign commercial matters; They accordingly suggest that the Department of Overseas Trade be transferred to and become a department of the Foreign Office.14. The Committee are unable to approve this suggestion. Apart altogether from the position in which such an enlargement of the powers of the Foreign Office would place the Board of Trade, it appears to us that the Foreign Office is not properly organised for this purpose, and that in view of the many other matters which daily engage the attention of that office, and of the large influence which purely political considerations must have on its decisions, it is undesirable that it should become as in fact it would become a Ministry of Foreign Commerce.The Foreign Office proposal would have the further inconvenience that, while the Board of Trade would supply to the public commercial information with regard to homo trade and trade with the Dominions, the public would have to go for information on trade with^ foreign countries to a department entirely unconnected with the Board. The Committee are of opinion that this severance is unsound in principle and cannot be recommended.
Reasons for Retaining the Overseas Trade Department.15. On the other hand, there axe strong reasons, apart from the view of business men to which we have referred, which tell against the proposal to abolish the Department of Overseas Trade or to allow it to be merged in the Board of Trade. It is admitted on all hands (as above mentioned) that the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services must remain under the Foreign Office ; and if the Department of Overseas Trade is to &quot; drop its Foreign Office functions &quot; and become wholly a department of the Board of Trade, the effect will be to revive evils which so recently as in 1917 led to the formation of that department. The link between the Board of Trade, on the one hand, and the Foreign Office and the Consular and Diplomatic Service on the other hand, which was then set up by agreement between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, and received the sanction of Parliament, would be at an end. The Board of Trade would lose touch with the British representatives abroad and would be compelled to act in all instances through the Foreign Office. Delay would be caused and the old complaints would recur.Obviously there must be a point of contact, and of close contact, between the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office. We endeavoured to obtain an agreement between the permanent officials of these two Departments whereby this contact should be secured without the interposition of the subsidiary Department of Overseas Trade, but without success.16. The arguments advanced in favour of retracing a step so recently taken are : (a) that the responsibility of the Department of Overseas Trade to two Government Departments is anomalous and inconvenient, and (b) that the Department has from time to time exceeded its powers as an organisation for obtaining and spreading commercial information and has trespassed on the sphere of policy. It does not appear to us that these objections have great weight. There are, no doubt, inconveniences from a Departmental point of view in the double responsibility referred to; but the trade evidence founded on experience of the Department was to ;the effect.that no practical inconvenience to the&quot; public had resulted. Again, it may be that the head of the Department has from time to time exercised his judgment on questions of policy ; and, indeed, it would be difficult for a capable and energetic Minister wholly to avoid that course, even if it were desirable that he should do so. But we are satisfied that Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland has made it his rule to refer toithe proper Department all questions which appeared to him to involve questions of policy; and he has l-egularly attended the &quot;morning meetings&quot; held at the Board of Trade for the purpose of discussing questions relating to the work of that Department.17. Apart from the above considerations, there is much;to be said for retaining at all events during the period of revival of trade a Department which has no duties other than that of fostering British trade overseas. The Department has covered a field previously unoccupied, and (notwithstanding some drawbacks, to which attention will be called hereafter) has accomplished valuable work. Our evidence has shown us that it has displayed a very praiseworthy activity in.the promotion and development of British trade abroad. The trade evidence from this country is to the effect that it has &quot; made a good beginning,&quot; and that traders have become accustomed to it and are giving it support, and Sir M. de Bunsen, speaking of his experiences in his recent mission to South America, informed us that he had frequently referred to the formation of a special Department for overseas trade and had found it a strong point with his hearers.Conclusion.18. The only.practical conclusion which emerges from these considerations is that the Department of Overseas Trade should continue as at present constituted, and should receive the full support of both of the parent Departments, and we so recom-mend. It will, of course, be for the Board of Trade to formulate the commercial policy of the country, and it will be the duty of the Department of Overseas Trade as a subordinate branch of the Board of Trade to carry it out so far as it relates to Overseas Trade.Housing of the Department.19. At the same time it appears to us that the efficiency of the Department of Overseas Trade can be increased by certain changes, and of these we put first the question of the housing of the Department.   The office accommodation provided has [192] * C
until recently been of a most unsuitable character. The headquarters of the Depart-ment were in the city, at 73, Basinghall Street, other sections were scattered in various other buildings in that neighbourhood, while the remainder of the staff was in Kingsway and in Sunderland House, Mayfair. The offices in the city were badlv overcrowded. In such conditions it was impossible to ensure that close and continuous consultation between the officials of the Department, and between the Department and the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, which is necessary in order that there shall be effective co-operation between these three Departments. The headquarters of the Department have within the last few weeks been transferred to Queen Anne&apos;s Gate: but this change can only be regarded as a temporary improvement and does not fulfil the condition of physical contiguity which appears to us to be in this case essential.We are convinced that matters can never be placed upon a satisfactory footing until the Department of Overseas Trade is housed in close contact and indeed under the same roof with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. We understand that the question of accommodation has already been pressed upon the Cabinet, and we desire to lay stress upon the fact that it is in our opinion the most important factor in the whole of the problem which has been referred to us.The urgency of the matter is such that it should not be allowed to wait until the general question of accommodation for the Staffs of Government offices is settled, but should be dealt with forthwith.Transfer of Consular and Commercial Departments.20. In the next place we think it desirable that the Consular and Commercial Departments of the Foreign Office should be transferred to the Department of Overseas Trade. We are informed that it was the intention of the Foreign Office to make this transfer when the Department of Overseas Trade was set up, but that owing to the fact that the offices of that Department were in the city, it has hitherto been held impossible to make the transfer.If the transfer is now made, no separate commercial branch need be set up in the Foreign Office, but enquiries and other matters relating to commercial questions can in most cases be dealt with in the appropriate geographical departments of that Office.21. We consider it desirable to urge that the Foreign Office shall take care that it is impressed upon His Majesty&apos;s Ministers and Consuls abroad that the Depart-ment of Overseas Trade is in fact a part of the Foreign Office and that they must look to that Department for instructions and guidance in commercial questions. We think it necessary to emphasise this for the reason that the Commercial Diplomatic witnesses who have appeared before us have complained that they do not know to whom to look for instructions and that the status of the Department of Overseas Trade is not appreciated or understood in several of the British Embassies in foreign capitals.War Trade Intelligence Department.22. We have considered the position of the War Trade Intelligence Department. It is evident that the War Trade Intelligence Department and the Department of Overseas Trade are both engaged in collecting information of a similar character, although for different purposes, and both distribute information to the public. It would probably be convenient that the greater part of the work at present being performed by the War Trade Intelligence Department should be transferred to the Department of Overseas Trade; but it is possible that some part of its activities may conveniently be transferred to the Economic Department of the Board of Trade. This is a matter for adjustment.Standing Committee or Board.23. Lastly, it appears to us that there is great need for closer co-operation, and more constant consultation betweeu the Departments concerned with Overseas Trade. The Head of the&apos; Overseas Trade Department has from time to time attended consultations, both at the Board of Trade and at the Foreign Office; but it has not been the practice of the three Departments to hold constant consultations on trade matters. We think that a Standing Committee or Board should be set up, consisting of the Heads of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade respectively (or their deputies), and the Head of the Department of Overseas Trade, with power to call into consultation the officials of other Departments, such as the Colonial Office, and the India Office, whenever necessity arises. This body should meet at regular intervals, and ail questions of policy relating to overseas trade should be brought before them.
40824. Certain minor points, which have arisen in connection with our enquiry, have been dealt with by direct communication with the Departments concerned.25. We have limited ourselves in this report to a consideration of the functions of the different Departments concerned with foreign commerce, and we have not thought it our duty to consider in detail the question of the enlargement of the powers of the Board of Trade so as to convert it into a Ministry of Commerce and Industry in the full sense. When this matter comes up for consideration it will be necessary to bear in mind the close connection between labour problems and commerce, and to consider the arguments for combining the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour in one Department.26. We feel greatly indebted to Mr. Pembroke Wicks (of the Offices of the War Cabinet), who has acted as our secretary, and has given us the greatest assistance in our work.We append a summary of our recommendations :  Summary of Recommendations.Abroad.I. That the Consular Service remain under the control of the Foreign Office (subject to Nos. 6 and 9, below).2. That the proposals in the Scheme for the Reform and Development of the Consular and Diplomatic Service (G.-243), other than those which relate to the Trade Commissioner Service and Labour Attaches, be adopted.3. That the Board of Trade be authorised from time to time, after consultation with the Foreign Office, to send temporary missions for special purposes to foreign countries, such missions to be under the control of the Embassy or Legation concerned, and that for this purpose a sum be included yearly in the Board of Trade estimates.4. That the Board of Trade be represented on the Selection and Promotion Committees for the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Service.5. That British representatives abroad be recommended to keep in touch with the British Chambers of Commerce formed in the countries to which they are accredited.At Home.6. That the Department of Overseas Trade continue as at present under the joint control of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade.7. That the Board of Trade remain responsible for general commercial policy, and that it be the duty of the Department of Overseas Trade to give effect to that policy overseas.8. That suitable office accommodation be forthwith provided for the Department of Overseas Trade in close proximity with the offices of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, and, if possible, that the three Departments be housed in the same building.9. That the Consular and Commercial Departments of the Foreign Office be trans-ferred to the Department of Overseas Trade.10. That the War Trade Intelligence Department be transferred to the Department of Overseas Trade except as to those branches which may be more conveniently trans-ferred to the Board of Trade.II. That a Standing Committee or Board be framed for the discussion of matters relating to Overseas Trade, to consist of the Heads of the Board of Trade, Foreign Office, and Department of Overseas Trade, with power to call in representatives of other Departments, and that such Standing Committee or Board meet at regular and frequent intervals.Pembroke Wicks, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., July 10, 1919.(Signed)      CAVE, Chairman.HORACE MONRO. KENNETH LEE.Mr. Dudley Docker has signed the following Minority Report:-
Brunswick House, Central Buildings, Westminster, S.W., July 10, 1919.The Secretary, War Cabinet. Sir,I regret that I do hot feel able to subscribe to the report of the majority of the Committee. While I am in agreement with a number of their recommendations, I am of opinion that they leave unhealed the malady for which we were asked to suggest a cure.I consider that the system of dual control of the Department of Overseas Trade is at the root of the trouble.   Any such system of dual control must be eradicated.From my own personal knowledge and after hearing the strong evidence put before us by the representatives of the Consular Service and the commercial world, I have come to the conclusion that the only remedy that I can recommend is the adoption of the principle that the Foreign Office must be responsible for establishing the lines upon which our foreign commercial policy should be framed. A similar conclusion was arrived at by the majority of the Committee presided over recently by Lord Farringdon, upon which I had the honour to serve.I have set out these views in the first three of the list of recommendations which I append.The rest are practically in accord with those contained in the majority report.I have, &amp;c. (Signed)        F. DUDLEY DOCKER.Recommendations.1. That the work of procuring economic intelligence from all foreign countries through the Commercial, Diplomatic, and Consular Services, and of analysing such intelligence, must be carried out by the Foreign Office in order to enable that Department to be in a .position to formulate the lines upon which our Foreign Trade Policy should be framed.2. That with a view to fitting the Foreign Office for the duties enumerated in (l) above, that Department must be strengthened by the absorption of the staff of the Department of Overseas Trade, and by the introduction of a commercial man of the highest calibre, who should be given a position only second to the Foreign Secretary. He should be authorised to appoint such additional staff as he may consider to be necessary.3. That the decisions of the Foreign Office as to the lines upon which our Toreign trade policy should be framed, should be referred to the Board of Trade, to assist that Department in formulating the general trade policy of this country.-4. That temporary missions from the Board of Trade should be attached, as &apos;occasibh arises, to British missions abroad, to be under the control of the head of the &quot;mission, butthat permanent Board of Trade Attaches shall not be appointed.5. That frequent and regular meetings for the discussion of business shall be held between the senior permanent officials of &quot;the Foreign Office, the Board of Trade, and &quot;the official whose appointment is recommended in 2. Such meetings to be attended by the heads of the sub-departments concerned for the business under discussion.6. I hat the salaries and allowances of Consular officers, which it is understood will be raised so as to yield the same amounts to the recipients as would be paid if they were free of income tax, should be made, commensurate with the greatly increased importance which their duties will assume in&apos;the future.7. That the extension of the Commercial Diplomatic Service be approved.8. That the Trade Commissioners&apos; Service shall not be amalgamated with the Commercial Diplomatic Service, but shall be graded equally with it.,9. That the staff of the War Trade Intelligence Department shall be absorbed by the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, according as the capacity of each individual officer may appear advisable.10. That opportunity shall be provided for the frequent interchange of officials of the Commerce and Industries Branch of the Board of Trade, and the corresponding Departments-of the Foreign Office; that officials of the Board of Trade and Foreign Office shall from time to time be attached to British missions in foreign countries, in order to acquire experience of economic conditions abroad, and that Consular Officers and members of the Commercial Diplomatic Service shall from time to time be attached
to the Foreign Office and Board of Trade in order to become familiar with the machinery of the Departments at home.11. That the scales of pay of the various grades should be similar in the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office.12. That means should be devised whereby the knowledge and experience of British Commercial men in foreign countries may be utilised by the British missions in tbose countries. Conversely, the knowledge and experience of business men in this country of foreign trade should be similarly utilised by the Foreign Office.(Signed)  F. DUDLEY DOCKER.July 10, 1919.[192]D

482EXISTING GOVERNMENT MACHINERY FOR DEALING WITH TRADEAND COMMERCE.    -THE following Departments are concerned with Trade and Commerce :-The Board of Trade.It is constitutionally the function of the Board of Trade to advise the Government on Commercial policy, and the Department has been recently reorganised with a view to give special prominence to that function. It is now divided into two independent branches, namely: The Commerce and Industry Department. The Public Services and Control Department.The Commerce and Industry Department of the Board of Trade is entirely concerned with the development of trade &quot;and with the duty of thinking out and assisting the commercial and industrial policy of the nation. It is organised in three sections : 1. The Commercial Department, which deals with the commercial aspect of treaties and relations with foreign countries, foreign and dominion tariffs, and trade regulations, and all other matters relating to the protection and furtherance of British commercial and shipping interests in foreign countries and other parts of the Empire, so far as they come within the scope of the Board of Trade.2. General Economic Department, which takes within its survey general economic conditions.3. Industries and Manufactures Department, which maintains a watch over the conditions of British industry, and directs the attention of the Government and the interests concerned to weaknesses in industry, and advises the Government on requests for Government action in support of any particular trade.Foreign Office.The Foreign Office deals with trade matters through its Commercial Department.The functions of the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office are not capable of precise definition. In theory it is supposed to deal with the political aspect of commercial questions, but in practice no definite limits have been assigned to it It has been expected to advise in a wide range of subjects of a miscellaneous character. These are set out as follows by Mr. Wellesley, the Controller of the Department, in his Memorandum on the reorganisation of the Foreign Office : 1. Commercial treaty negotiations including withdrawals and denunciations, and generally economic policy of the British Empire and foreign countries.2, Defence and support of British commercial interests in foreign countries, in so far as they are not vested interests.   This includes (a.) Investigation of complaints of traders.(o.) Diplomatic assistance to British firms and subjects.(c.) Enforcement of commercial treaty rights.(d.) Introduction of British subjects to His Majesty&apos;s diplomatic and consular officers abroad.(e.) Commercial interests of self-governing dominions in foreign countries. (/.) Status of British companies in foreign countries.3. Collection and distribution to other Government departments of information on the finances, trade, and industries of foreign countries, e.g., reports on bounties, subsidies, strikes, labour questions, railways, shipping, agriculture, fisheries.4. Tariffs and their effect on British trade, changes in foreign tariffs, &amp;c.5. Editing of Consular and Commercial Attaches reports.6.

A variety of other matters.The Commercial Department of the Foreign Office also acts as the channel through which commercial questions and commercial intelligence are referred by the Foreign Office to the Board of Trade.The Consular Department of the Foreign Office controls the administration of the Consular Service, including the appointment, promotion, and transfer of Consuls, but does not now deal with the commercial side of their work, which has been transferred to the Department of Overseas Trade. The Consular Department of the Foreign Office is quite separate from the Department of Overseas Trade, though nominally under the authority of the present Director of Overseas Trade, who, in his capachVy as Additional Parliamentary Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, is responsible for both the Commercial and Consular Departments of the Foreign Office.The Department of Overseas Trade is a subordinate Department under the joint control of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. It is primarily concerned with the collection of commercial intelligence from foreign countries, in which respect it has replaced the former Commercial Intelligence Branch of the Boai&apos;d of Trade.It deals with the collection and distribution of commercial information as to British trade abroad and the sources of supply at home.Tt supervises the commercial work of our Consuls abroad, though it does not appoint or control them.It is responsible for and controls the new Commercial Diplomatic Service. The Commercial Diplomatic Service consists of Counsellors and Commercial Secretaries attached to the various British Embassies in foreign countries, who are charged with the duty of looking after British commercial interests abroad and supervising the commercial work of the Consuls in their respective countries.The Department of Overseas Trade takes such action as may be possible to promote the development of British overseas trade, including the ordinary selling of merchandise and the establishing of enterprises in foreign countries under British leadership.It also endeavours by advice, information, and suggestion to encourage mauu-facturers at home to meet the special demands of foreign markets.The War Trade Intelligence Department is a subordinate branch of the Ministry of Blockade under the Foreign Office. It has been created during the war as an instrument of war for helping to enforce the blockade. It collects information for blockade purposes as to the status of traders, both abroad and in this country.It is also responsible for the collection of commercial intelligence in the wider economic aspect in relation to the production and distribution of world supplies, as contrasted with the Department of Overseas Trade which is concerned with such matters in their relation only to the trade development of this country.The information obtained by the War Trade Intelligence Branch has frequently *been communicated by it to business firms, and is at the disposal of the public except in so far as the source from which it was obtained does not prohibit this.Since the Armistice the War Trade Intelligence Department have also beeu occupied in collecting economic intelligence for the use of the British Section of the Supreme Economic Council, and are at present engaged in that work.The Ministry of Shipping is concerned with trade only in relation to shipping, but inasmuch as the vigorous promotion of British trade depends on an adequate supply of tonnage and low freights, the policy pursued by that Department has a close connection with the commercial development of the country, and, indeed, the Ministry of Shipping by its control of shipping is able in a practical way to encourage trade on particular routes and with particular countries. &apos;No mention has been made of the Ministry of Blockade, the Ministry of Munitions, the War Trade Department, the Contracts Department of the War Office, the Ministry of Reconstruction, or the Ministry of Food, all of which have been engaged either in collecting intelligence on commercial matters or in direct trade transactions, for the reason that their functions have either been transferred to other Departments or will shortly come to an end, and will not therefore form part of the permanent machinery of the Government for dealing with trade and commerce.Note. The Department of Overseas Trade was established at the end of 1917. A Committee was set up in January of that year by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, under the Chairmanship of Lord Faringdon, to enquire into the best organisation for promoting our foreign trade
403othrough representatives abroad, including the Consular Service. The Committee were unable to agree on the question whether the work of classifying and distributing foreign intelligence amongst the Commercial community in this country should continue to be performed by the Department of Commercial Intelligence of the Board of Trade, or should be dealt with by a Department to be created by the Foreign Office.In consequence of this divergence of views the Department of Overseas Trade was set up under an Agreement contained in a Memorandum signed by the Foreign Secretary and President of the Board of Trade. The new Department was to be subject to the joint control of the Foreign Office and Board of Trade under a new Parliamentary Under Secretary, who was to be responsible both to the Secretary of. State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade. For this purpose a special Act of Parliament was passed, authorising the appointment of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary.
