November 1918.SECRET.G.-225. ;     75WAR   CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PROVISION OF LAND FOR SETTLEMENT ANDOTHER PURPOSES.Interim Report.1. This Committee consisting of Sir George Cave (Chairman), Mr. Hayes Fisher, Mr. Munro, Dr. Addison, Mr. Prothero, Captain Pretyman, and Sir John Bradbury (representing the Treasury), was appointed by the War Cabinet on the 15th May, 1918 (War Cabinet Minute 412 (3)), to consider the provision of land for soldiers on demobilisation.2. The following documents were referred \o the Committee :-Memorandum of the 2nd October, 1917, by Mr. Prothero on Land Settlement (G.T. 2225).Memorandum by Dr. AddisOn on the provision of Small Holdings bv County&apos;Councils (G.T. 4479). Memorandum of the 9th May, 1918, on the same subject by Mr. Prothero(G.T. 4481).Joint Memorandum of the 10th May, 1918, on acquisition of land for land settlement and other purposes by Mr. Prothero and Dr. Addison (G.T. 4494).Note of the 2nd May, 1918, by Dr. Addison enclosing resolutions by his Advisory Council (Section IV) on housing in the country districts cf. 13/B/l (G.T. 4485).&quot;These documents cover the acquisition of land for various purposes, including settlement, reclamation and afforestation.3. Need for scheme of land settlement. The need for a broad policy of land settlement after the war is generally recognised, and the circumstances of the present war render such a policy specially desirable. On the One hand, the agricultural population of the country has been seriously depleted; for the Army has claimed most of the younger men, and the high wages paid in munition works have attracted many others from the country to the industrial centres. On the other hand the admitted need for an increased production of food can only be met by the application of additional labour to the land. A large number of the men who have joined the Army will not return to country life&quot; unless they can look forward to different eon-ditiohs from those which obtained before the war; but if this incentive is offered, a large and valuable contingent of agricultural labour may be obtainable on demobili-satioh.It must be borne in mind that the Mother Country will have to compete in this direction with the encouragement which will be held out to men to settle in the Dominions after the war. The Governments of the Dominions are alive to oppor-tuiiities which they will not be slow to seize, and the fact that men from the Dominions have played a great part in this war has no doubt done a great deal to make known the advantages offered by a colonial life. But it is of vital importance for the purpose of maintaining in this country a virile agricultural population, and of ensuring home supplies, to attract to the soil a large number of the men who will leave the Army on the conclusion of peace, and ho step should be omitted which may conduce to that result.4. Scope of scheme. In considering the question of land settlement, the Com-mittee have for the purposes of this report confined their attention to the needs of ex-service men, that is to say, sailors, soldiers, and members of the Air Force. After careful consideration of the facts they have come to the conclusion that the [932] B
needs of these men can best be met in three ways, namely, (1) by the provision of small holdings of from one to 50 acres, or not exceeding  50 in yearly value, (2) by the provision of smaller plots of land for cottage sites and gardens, and (3) by the provision of leasehold allotments of a fair size.5. Small holdings. The small holding is intended for those who propose to obtain their living by cultivating the land, either by their own labour or by working with other settlers under a co-operative or profit-sharing system. The principle is by no means a new one in this country, and much has already been accomplished under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act, 1908. The holdings provided under that Act number 13,109, and at the end of the year 1914 there were applications from 6,432 suitable persons and two Associations which could not be met by the local authorities owing to the difficulty of raising funds for the purpose. The Committee hope that, as soon as financial arrangements permit, the work of providing small holdings under this Act will be continued; but meanwhile the men who have been engaged in active service during the war have the first claim.The size of the small holding must vary with the character of the land and situation, but as a rough estimate for the purpose of their scheme the Committee have taken an average figure of ten acres per man. On this basis it is estimated that as much as a million acres may be required for the provision of small holdings for service men, but it is obvious that no reliable estimate can be given until it is known how many men will wish to take up holdings.6. Cottage sites and gardens. It is urged with much force that many men  perhaps, the majority-returning from active service will be more content to have a house and small garden within easy reach of a centre where they can get industrial or seasonal work than to settle on an agricultural holding and live the life of a small farmer. The Committee were much impressed by this view, and they recommend that suitable land should be obtained as sites and gardens for cottages as well as for small holdings. Land of this character would generally be more expensive than purely agricultural land, but the amount of land required would be smaller.7. Allotments. There may be some cases where a returned service man will have a cottage or other place of residence available, and will desire to have a piece of land for cultivation without the obligation of building or procuring the erection of a cottage upon it. In such cases allotments can be provided under the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908, but tenants should in suitable cases be allowed to take the land for a longer period than the yearly tenancy which is now customary. We do not think it necessary that the option of purchase proposed to be given to the tenant of a small holding or cottage should be extended to such an allottee.8. Number of men to be provided for. It is difficult at present to form any estimate of the number of men from the fighting services who may desire to settle on the land after the war. An attempt was made by means of a canvass of certain regiments, but it did not yield any reliable figures. Many men may express a wish to settle on the land, but may change their minds when details are entered into; and many of those who apply may prove unsuitable from previous training or mode of life. It is obvious that care is required in selecting the right type of men for land settlements, as any large number of failures might seriously jeopardise the whole FcheTr^.The Committee are of opinion that steps should be at once taken by the Board of Agriculture to obtain as accurate figures as possible on this point. As regards soldiers, the County Councils might be asked to communicate with their County Regiments and Pensions Committees on the subject; and as regards sailors and members of the Air Force, similar enquiries should be made through the appropriate authorities.9. Method of acquiring land. The method of acquiring the land for the purposes of the scheme needs careful consideration. A great deal depends on the attitude which landowners may adopt towards a State scheme. It would be very undesirable, if not impossible, to work a scheme which did not secure the co-operation and sym-pathv of the landowning interest. For this reason the Committee would prefer a svstem of voluntary acquisition so far as possible; and there are good grounds for believing; that a large area of land-possibly the greater part of the total amount re-quired may be made available by this method.The first quarter to which the State should turn its attention is the large estates held bv the Crown and bodies like the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and the Colleges of Oford and Cambridge. The total acreage represented by these owners is ap-proximately 720,000 acres.   In addition to these owners a large amount of land is
3 -     151Ueld by hospitals, charities, &amp;c, the acreage so held in England and Wales being about 230,000 acres. Another available reservoir is the glebe land which amounts to about 500,000 acres, and of which some is to be found in nearly every parish. There may also be a considerable area of land acquired by public departments under the Defence of the Realm Acts, and not required to be retained by the Departments concerned. Some of this land might be made available for land settlement. Further, landowners as a class are strongly in sympathy with the principle of land settlement for soldiers, and it is thought that many of them would be willing to provide land on reasonable terms for this purpose. The Committee think that the first step should be to ascertain to what extent the public bodies referred to, glebe owners, and the owners of private estates are willing to provide land for the special objects of this scheme These enquiries should be made by the Board of Agriculture or by the County Councils on their behalf; and, in order that as much land as possible should-be obtained by voluntary means, a strong appeal should be made to the landowners, . and their co-operation should be actively sought. If the result of such an appeal should be inadequate, it is clear that the remainder of the land required will have to be acquired by some form of compulsion.10. Method of payment.^The first method which suggests itself is purchase outright by the State, but in the present financial position it is clear that State pur--:hase on a large scale could not be contemplated. As an alternative, the Committee propose that the land required for the purposes of this scheme should be acquired by the county authorities in consideration of a perpetual annuity charged on the county rates and redeemable at the option of the authorities, or (with the consent of the owner) on long leases.In some cases it may be necessary to acquire the interest of a tenant, and for this purpose cash payments would probably be required.The same system of payment would apply whether land is acquired by agree-ment or under compulsion. The compulsory acquisition of land for public purposes in consideration of a perpetual yearly payment is, of course, a novel proposal, and the Committee are sensible that it could not be applied generally; but they are of opinion that its adoption for the purpose of settling on the land men who have served in the war would be generally approved.11. Administration. The Committee have considered whether the work of ad-ministration in connection with land settlement should be central or local, and have come to the conclusion that the County Councils are the best agencies for the pur-pose. The County Councils already have experience of the provision of small holdings under the Small Holdings and Allotment Act, 1908. So far as they have failed to meet the demands for small holdings in their counties, the failure has been mainly owing to financial difficulties, and especially to the inability of the Treasury to raise money for further local loans during the war. The new scheme is, of course, on a scale of great magnitude compared with the comparatively small operations contemplated by the Small Holdings Act; but it seems wise to use existing machinery when it appears capable of being adapted to the wider use. The County Councils will be in a position to know the possibilities of development in their own counties, the land which is most suitable both in its character and its situation as regards market towns and other centres, and the best methods of distributing the holdings in relation to large estates.While the duty of administering the scheme will rest with the County Councils, it will be necessary to have effective supervision and control by a central depart-ment, which in this case would be the Board of Agriculture. The duty of the Board would be not only to satisfy itself that the County Councils are doing all in their power to ascertain the demands for small holdings by ex-service men and to provide for them to the full extent, but also to give expert advice on all the questions that will be raised. In the event of default on the part of any County Council, the Board of Agriculture would have full power of preparing a scheme and carrying it into effect. The Board would have power under the Act of 1908 to contribute one-half of any losses incurred by the County Council.The Small Holdings Act, 1908, will need amendment to give effect to these pro-posals, including a new power for the purposes of this scheme to acquire land com-pulsonly m consideration of an annuity, and a Bill for this purpose should be passed forthwith.The Board of Agriculture should continue to administer directly the powers already given to them during the war by the Sailors&apos; and Soldiers&apos; (Gifts for Land Settlement) Act, 1916, and the Small Holding Colonies Acts, 1916 and 1918 [932] B 2
12. Equipment.-AX is obvious that the actual provision of small holdings will not be enough, and that some equipment must be provided. Until reliable figures are obtained, an accurate estimate of the cost cannot be given; but the Committee think it desirable that a sum of  2,500,000 should be voted to the Small Holdings Account to enable the County Councils to equip the land which is provided for the settlement of ex-service men under this scheme. In view of the probability that the cost of equipment will be exceptionally high during and immediately after the war, it will probably be necessary that for a time a percentage of this money should be provided as a free grant.13. Facilities to settlers. Apart from equipment it will be necessary for the State to give some assistance to the settlers towards stocking their farms, especially in the first years of occupation. For this purpose the Committee recommend that, pending the organisation of Credit Banks or other approved machinery, settlers who require assistance towards the provision of implements, live stock, seeds, fertilisers, and other requisites of the agricultural industry should be enabled, under proper safeguards, to obtain credit for these purposes.14. Dwelling houses. One of the essential features in a satisfactory scheme of land settlement will pe the provision of suitable dwelling-houses. In some cases there will be suitable houses already existing on the land acquired, but in most cases building will be necessary. Where the building is in connection with a small holding this should be undertaken by the County Councils under the Small Holdings Act, 1908, but where the building is a dwelling-house in connection with a cottage garden, the Local Authority under the Housing Acts should usually be the body to provide the dwelling-house and the cottage garden. This will prevent overlapping and duplication of work, and will bring the undertaking as regards cottage gardens with dwellings thereon within the scope of the Government financial assistance promised in respect of houses provided under Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, under the control of the President of the Local Govern-ment Board.In order, however, that the Local Authority under the Housing Acts may have the advantages pf the suggested provision for purchase of land on perpetual annuity in cases where these would be helpful, power should be given to the County Council on tjie application pf the Local Authority to acquire any necessary land under the scheme as sites for dwelling-houses with ^cottage gardens, and to transfer the land to the Local Authority for that purpose in consideration of a perpetual annuity.If the Local Authority fail to make any necessary provision for cottage gardens with dwellings thereon within a reasonable time, it should be the duty of the County Council to make that provision, and the matter will then come under the supervision and control of the Board of Agriculture. That Department wall act in concert with the Lpcal Government Board which Department, in order to preserve uniformity of practice, must finally settle the balance-sheet and estimate the deficiency in respect of which the financial assistance from the Government is to be paid.County Councils in building the houses necessary for the ^occupation of small holdings should receive facilities equivalent to those offered to Local Authorities for the erection of working-class houses under the Housing Bill.15. Purchase-Greater facilities should also be offered to tenants of such holdings and cottage gardens to purchase their holdings. The Committee recom-mend that such a tenant should haye the option at any time during his occupation of the holding to purchase it on payment of one-fifth of the purchase money the remainder being repaid by instalments during fifty years. This provision should apply to cottages with land attached, but not to unattached allotments.16. Scotland. The application to Scotland of the policy recommended by the Comnrttee requires separate consideration.The Committee, as advised by the Secretary for Scotland (who has been in consultation with the Lord Advocate and Sir George Younger) consider that the financial method of acquisition proposed for England and Wales may in its essentials, be also applied to Scotland, i.e., that land should be acquired in considera-tion of a rent charge or feu duty. In accordance, however, with recent Scottish precedent^ the acquiring bpdy for Scotland should be not the County Council but the fecottish Board of Agriculture.As regards the application of compulsion: in Endand it is applied by tne  &quot;7^7 n-onnPn subject to an appeal to the Board of Agriculture. In Scotland the Committee consider that it would probably be sufficient to say that the Board of Agriculture for Scotland may acquire land for the purposes of the scheme com-
5152pulsorily, with the consent of the Secretary for Scotland. The question of ptrioe or annual value for rent charge goes in England to a single arbitrator. In Scotland the Committee are of opinion that it should be decided, in the event of disagree-ment, by the Scottish Land Court, who might receive statutory instructions as to the basis on which the price or annual consideration is to be determined.As regards the tenure under which the soldiers and sailors placed on the land are to hold from the Board of Agriculture, the Secretary of Scotland considers that the tenure established for landholders under the Small Landholders&apos; (Scotland) Act of 1911, and the application of the principle of fair rent contained in that Act, will probably require to be extended to them at least in the North and West of Scotland.17. Reclamation and Afforestation. A considerable acreage of land might also be made available for settlement by ex-service men under national schemes of recla-matioh and afforestation.The Boards of Agriculture should be instructed to prepare detailed schemes with estimates of cost for the reclamation and improvement of selected areas of purely agricultural land now lying derelict or unimproved, which, with State aid and under competent supervision, might be brought into profitable cultivation. Where the selected areas consist of land on the sea coast, or on the banks of navigable rivers, the approval of the Admiralty and the Board of Trade should be obtained.The Boards of Agriculture should also be instructed to complete as speedily as possible their surveys of areas selected for afforestation, and, in the event of any of them being acquired by the State for afforestation, should set aside such portions of the land as are most suitable for cultivation, and adapt them as holdings for the occupation of ex-service men, who might be wholly or seasonally employed in the industry of forestry.Mr. S. W. Harris, C.B., C.V.O., acted as Secretary to the Committee, who are indebted to him for very valuable assistance.&apos;  G. CAVE,Chairman.31st October, 1918.o
