[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet   March 1918.SECRET.6-202. ;   gg50IMPERIAL WAR MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM.Report of Loed Crawfort/s Committee.UNDER authority of War Cabinet Minutes (No. 221, Minute 2, of the 21st August, 1917, and No. 225, Minute 8, of the 28th August, 1917), the Committee have examined the proposals of the War Museum Committee, and, following their Interim Report submitted to the War Cabinet (Appendix I) and approved (War Cabinet 303, Minutes 15 and 16), have to report as follows, viz. : 1. The Committee considered the following salient -features : (a.) The relation between the War Memorial and the War Museum. (6.) The scope and intention of the Museum, (c.) The space required.(d.) The expenditure necessary to erect a suitable building, (e.) The site for the building.2. On the assumption that an Imperial War Memorial upon an imposing scale will be ordered by Parliament, the Committee recommend (a.) That, if possible, it should be erected in juxtaposition to the War Museum building.(6.) That the War Memorial be regarded as an external tribute to the heroism of the Empire.(c.) That in considering the site and structure of the War Museum, account should be taken of its association with the War Memorial.3. The Committee having considered the scope and intention of the War Museum, recommend (a.) That due regard should be had to the Imperial character of the exhibits.(o.) That it is not necessary that the exhibits should include a complete sequence showing the detailed development! of all types and models ; the Museum should be confined rather to a display of exhibits specially selected to indicate succcessive and important stages in the development of naval and military technique.(c.) That as regards the display of actual instruments of war, no useful purpose would be served by exhibiting failures or abortive designs, or indeed any examples which are not in themselves complete, instructive, or influential in subsequent developments.(The Committee communicated these recommendations to the War Museum Committee.) 4. Space.The Committee have carefully considered the space required by the War Museum, as set out in the memorandum of the 26th June, G.T.-1650 (Appendix IIj, by the Director-General, Sir Martin Conway, and recommend that a reduction of 28 per cent, on original estimated requirement be effected.   The space recommended is as follows: [333] B

Estimated Expenditure on Building.A revised estimate of the cost of the building has been obtained, namely, 665,0001., which includes all the architectural and engineering services required, but is exclusive of all internal Museum fittings and furniture. The Committee recommend this estimate as reasonable.6. Site.The Committee have carefully examined the proposal of the War Museum Committee to utilise a site in Hyde Park, but in view of the likelihood of this site being unpopular owing to its encroachment on the amenities of the park, they considered alternative sites.* It was decided by a majority to recommend that a site be obtained suitable for the War Memorial and for the War Museum on the south side of the river, adjacent to the New County Hall, with a river frontage. An estimate for acquiring this site, consisting of approximately 412,000 square feet, is given as 4 86,0001. This site is central and accessible and possesses a good frontage, which will enable the War Memorial to appear prominently to the public view.7. The Committee have carefully considered the relation of Public Records relating to the war, and the Museum Library. They submit the following recommen-dations for approval :-(a) That the War Museum should contain a well-developed reference library, withtypical documents, including a complete collection of foreign books andnewspapers relating to the war. (6.) That instructions be given to Government Departments urging the importanceof proper care and custody of official minutes relating to war matters, (c.) It has betn suggested that the management of the library of the War Museumshould be in the hands of the British Museum ; but this question must bereserved for further consideration. (d.) It is hoped that it may be possible to house the United Service Institutionwithin the walls of the War Museum, and enable this Institution to becomeassociated with the War Museum, both as regards its personnel, its collec-tions, and its work.8. The Committee have considered the need of providing opportunities for employ-ment during the period immediately succeeding the war, and recommend that, if the War Cabinet decide that the outlay for acquiring and clearing the site referred tc above, .and for the building, can be contemplated, this preliminary work shall proceed ;as early as possible.* Dr. Addison desires it to be known that he strongly dissents from the proposal to acquire the river site at accost of 486,000/.
9. The Committee have further borne in mind the necessity for legislation to acquire the site ; if this course be found necessary, they recommend that the First Commissioner of Works shall prepare a draft Bill for the approval of the.Cabinet.Should the Cabinet consider the moment inopportune to submit the measure to Parliament, it is suggested that Sir Alfred Mond should in the meantime be authorised to continue the collection of material for the Museum.10. The Committee desire to record its warm appreciation of the diligence and skill of Mr. Dan Thomas, who has acted as Secretary to the Committee since its inception.(Signed)        CRAWFORD and BALCARRES. ALFRED MOND. H. A. L. FISHER. C. ADDISON. ROBERT MUNRO. H. E. DUKE. W. A. S. HEWINS.DAN THOMAS, Secretary.March 14, 1918.APPENDIX I.(G.T.-3016.) -Lord Crawford&apos;s Committee on the War Museum.Interim Report.THE Committee appointed by the War Cabinet to examine the proposals of the War Museums Committee (War Cabinets 221, Minute 2, and 225, Minute 8) wish to submit the following interim report and recommendations : \. Scottish National War Museum.Mr. Munro reported that informal communications had reached him from representative Scotsmen civil, military, and naval showing that strong and even enthusiastic support would be forthcoming to the proposal to use Edinburgh Castle as the Central Museum for Scottish Military History. The desire for some such museum and memorial is widespread throughout Scotland, all&apos;parts of which would readily combine if the Castle were made available for the purpose.The Committee expressed general approval of the scheme, on being assured that, as the new Bedford Barracks are now completed, the War Office will not require the building after the war, except to a very limited extent. The Committee therefore invites the assent of the Cabinet to the proposal, subject to the following conditions : (a.) That the establishment of a Scottish National Historical War Museum and Memorial is in no sense intended to be antagonistic to the general interests or catholicity of the Imperial War Museum, in which Scottish aspects of the war should be fully represented.(b.) That the existing authority of the First Commissioner of Works in regard to the Castle as an historical and architectural monument of paramount importance should continue unimpaired throughout the period of its . adaptation for museum purposes.(c.) That, in the event of any request being made for a grant of public money, account should be taken of the fact that the site and buildings of the Castle represent a large money contribution towards the necessary outlay. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works might reasonably be called upon to meet part of the expense involved in adapting the buildings to their new purposes.Should the Cabinet concur in the foregoing proposals, it is suggested that the Secretary for Scotland be authorised to take such steps as he considers desirable for announcing the decision of the Cabinet; for discussing the best methods of enlisting Scottish interest and support; for collecting exhibits and relics ; and for formulating a general policy to deal with the Castle buildings, in conjunction with the First Commis-aumer.of Works.
2. The Name of the War MuseumThe Committee, having received from the India and Dominions Committee of the War Museum a resolution in favour of the word &quot; Imperial,&quot; as opposed to the word &quot; National.&quot; and, having considered the scope and character of the Museum, it was decided to recommend to the War Cabinet that the title of the central War Museum in London should be the &quot; Imperial War Museum.&quot;(Signed)        CRAWFORD and BALCARRES.December 14, 1917.APPENDIX II.(G.T.-1650.) -National War Memorial and Museum.1. Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works. II. Memorandum by the Director-General of the National War Museum.I.I HAVE the honour to submit herewith a Memorandum by the Director-General of the National War Museum, Sir Martin Conway, which has been approved by the Committee.Since the approval by the Cabinet of my Memorandum of the 27th February last the Committee then established has met weekly and several special Sub-Committees have been formed. A stage has now been reached which calls for some further action on the part of the War Cabinet. The necessaiy preliminary investigation into the scope of the National War Museum shows that some decision must be come to as to whether the Committee is to proceed on the lines of the accompanying Memorandum, and whether the War Cabinet is prepared to sanction in principle the creation of a War Museum of the size and importance which the Committee consider necessary and the provision of the funds that are required. Until this decision is given, it is impossible for the Committee to proceed with the work of organising the collection of material, &amp;c, on which it is at present engaged.In support of the accompanying Memorandum. I wish to point out the following considerations : 1. Building.- -A very carefullv carried out investigation by the Sub-Committee as to the space required hy, the different sections of the exhibits discloses the fact that to adequately represent the efforts made during the war by our British imperial Forces and our Allies a floor space of about 278,000 sq. ft. is needed. This figure has been arrived at after considerable reduction of the estimated space asked for by the different Sub-Committees, and is a minimum if the Museum is to be at once fully representative and popularly attractive.2. National War Memorial. The Committee are unanimously of opinion that a building will have to be created for the housing of the Museum, which must be worthy of the contents. This has led the Committee to the conclusion that the subject should be regarded in a wider aspect than the proposal first outlined in my memorandum of the 27th February last. The Wrar Museum, by the nature and character of its exhibits forms a Memorial of the War, and it is submitted that it should be adopted as such by the Cabinet and designated the National War Memorial Museum. A large sum will necessarily be required for this purpose. Details of this proposal are fully stated in the Director-GeneraFs Memorandum.3. Estimated Expenditure. Preliminary estimates of a suitable building, made bv Mr. F. Baines, M.V.O., one of the principal architects of my Department, tend to show that the sum of 750,000/, will be required to cover the expenditure on the scheme. Although this sum may be considered large, I would like to point out that if the
proposal to combine the Museum and the War Memorial is adopted, T do not believe it would be considered as unreasonable, either by the House of CoinmoDS or by the country. Yotes have been granted for museums and exhibitions in peace time of very considerable magnitude. Over 2,000,000Z. has been spent on the British Museum, 602,000?. has been spent on the Natural History Museum, and over 1,300,000L has been spent on the Science and Art Buildings.Site. The Committee has also been occupied with the question of a suitable site, and have generally come to the conclusion that the site for the National War Memorial Museum should be in London, should be worthy of the building to be erected, and should be central. Of the numerous sites examined by the Committee, and its architectural advisers, there is one which they have unanimously approved of as being of outstanding merit for the purpose in view. This is a small section of Hyde Park between the top of the Serpentine and Bayswater Road. While I am aware of the strong feeling that has always been aroused against any buildings being placed in the Royal Parks, 1 would point out that this question of a National Memorial stands on a different footing from that of any other building, especially if it is to be a great National War Memorial. The amount of space to be taken from the park would, approximately, be only 5 acres, and would not affect the amenities of the park. In fact, with its fine architectural front at the head of the Serpentine, it would be seen from the bridge and the road as a very great improvement compared with the relatively mean and unimportant houses which now form the vista. The front on the Bayswater Road will, of course, be a great improvement. The situation is a very good one from the point of view of com-munication, being accessible to two tubes routes, and numerous bus routes, and is as central as could be wished. The advantage of this site is that it will be free of cost, and it is obvious that the saving so effected will be very considerable. Another consideration is that the building operations on this site can be commenced practically immediately, whilst on all other sites that have been examined, and which are at all centrally situated, various buildings and land will have to be acquired, and the site cleared, and this will necessarily cause considerable delay. It would appear important that the Museum should be commenced as soon as possible after the war and proceeded with with the greatest expedition, so that it can be completed while the memory of the war is still fresh in the minds of the people. If the Cabinet approve of this suggestion for the site, it will be, of course, my duty to submit it to the favour and approval of His Majesty the King.It is only right to point out that this scheme will record not only the British, but the entire efforts of the Empire, and a Sub-Committee is in formation, on which will be represented the Governments of the oversea diminions, and the India Office will specially deal with this important phase of the work.Finally, I respectfully submit that approval be given to the scheme as outlined, more especially the following features : -1. The adoption of the National War Museum as the National War Memorial. 2. The sanction of the estimated expenditure. 3. The approval of the proposed site.I wish to explain that the accompanying plan* and elevation^ are not to be considered as in any way finally decided, but are submitted to show the general scope of the scheme and the proposed site.(Signed) ALFRED MOND.H.M. Office of Works, August 8, 1917.II.Memorandum on the Scope of the National War Museum.The First Cc iinmissioner. H.M. Office of Works.The Committee charged with the duty of organising the National War Museum, understands that the end to be achieved is the provision of a record and memorial of the war by sea and land in all parts of the. world, of the raising, equipment, and* Not reproduced.[333] C
transportation of armies, of munition manufacture at home and elsewhere, of tin-medical and other subsidiary services, of the work of women both directly for war purposes and indirectly by substitution, and generally of all the activities called forth by the war at home, in the dominions, and in India, at all the fronts, and on the sea.Such a Museum, if wisely collected and ai-ranged, will be unique in this respect that, alone among Museums, it will make a direct appeal to the millions of individuals who have taken part in the, war or in war-work of any kind. Thus the sailor and soldier should be able to see models of ships, batteries, trenches, and the like in which they fought, the uniforms they wore, and the weapons they used. Airmen should find actual examples and more numerous models of the aircraft employed, wherebj^ to follow and explain the development of flying and the machinery of flight during the years of active warfare. Craftsmen should be able to examine models of some of the great munition works in which they were employed, and photographs of machinery they used as well as actual examples of munitions they helped to produce. Women should behold commemorated their occupations as nurses, munition workers, hospital supplv workers, and generally as substitutes for men on the land, on railways, and elsewhere. Young people, boys and girls, should not be forgotten. The boy scouts, the girl guides, the country post girls, and all the uniformed workers, when they visit the Museum in years to come, should be able by its aid to revive the memory of their work for the war, and, pointing to some exhibit, to say &quot; This thing I did.&quot;A War Museum that did not record and honour the brave ivho sacrificed their lives for their country would be constructed on a fundamentally wrong principle. It is therefore suggested that the very heart and focus of the building should be of a memorial character. This might take the form of a Hall of Honour as rich and beautiful in character as artists can devise, and adjacent to it a Gallery devoted to the separate memorials of the Navy and the Army by ships, regiments, and contingents. The Hall of Honour could be designed to bear on its walls painted portraits and on its floor pedestals carrying busts or sculptured figures of such eminent individuals as the people as a whole may delight to single out for special honour. In the Memorial Gallery the name of every individual who fell in battle or died of wounds should be legibly inscribed on bronze plates, suitably framed, with the arms, badges, and honours of each regiment; here also the special mementoes of particular units would find place in the neighbourhood of the regimental or other collective memorial.It is evident that if the core of the Museum is thus designed and equipped, it will by the very nature of the case become the National War Memorial, for no pile of sculpture wherever set up could possibly vie in public interest or truly memorial character with this Hall and Gallery of Honour in the heart of a great War Museum. It is therefore suggested that the proposed Museum be adopted as the War Memorial. If that step is taken, all difficulties connected with finance will fall away ; neither will there be any impediment to selecting as central and costly a site as may seem desirable. The public might resent what could be represented as extravagance in connection with a Museum : but the same public would insist that the memorial to the countless dead who gave their lives for its salvation should be costly in sacrifice, splendid in character, and central in position.In no case can a War Museum be anything but very large and correspondingly costly if it is to be honourably representative of the gigantic national effort. When guns were made of bronze they could be exposed for an unlimited time in the open air. Few, if airy, modern implements of warfare can stand such exposure. The guns, tank?. &amp;c, to be exhibited are many and large, and will cover a considerable area.To display existing models of all the different types of ship employed by the Navy in the war would require almost an acre, and when every economy in selection and arrangement has been made, the minimum space needed cannot be reduced below 30,000 square feet. Aircraft, again must be represented by some actual examples as well as by many models. Space must also be allotted to the dominions and Tndia. Offices, corridors, workshops, store-rooms, &amp;c, will have to be supplied, and a submarine tank room (estimated at 17,400 square feet) if an actual submarine is to be included.Every effort has been made to reduce demands of space to the lowest point consistent with lucidity and efficiency of representation, and the Museum Committee has taken the advice of the following expert Committees, who have closely examined the requirements and have estimated them as here stated and in the schedule set forth in more detail: 
Admiralty Committee (127,000 square feet) Commander Walcott (Chairman). Anti-Submarine Department. Director of Naval Construction. Director of Naval Ordnance. Director of Torpedoes and Mines. Royal Naval Air Service. Enmneer-in-Chief. Director of Stores.War Office Committee (82,000 square feet) Ian Macpherson, Esq., M.P. (Chairman).B. B. Cubitt, Esq., O.B. Sir Arthur Leetham.Representative of the Master-General of the Ordnance. Representative of the Quartermaster-General. H. C. Perrott, Esq.Ministry of Munitions Committee (36,000 square feet) Colonel Stansfeld, R.A. (Chairman).Major Paulett.Major Boyd.Captain Cooper.R. V. Yernon, Esq.Colonel Bicknell.Women&apos;s Work Committee (5,000 square feet) Hon. Lady Norman (Chairman).Lady Askwith.Hon. Lady Haig.Lady Moiid.Mrs. Carey Evans.Miss Conway.Library and Records Committee (28,000 square feet) Professor C. W. Oman, LL.D. (Chairman). George Prothero, Esq., Litt.D.C. T. Atkinson, Esq., W.O. Records. Sir Julian Corbett.The question of records is a difficult one. It is absolutely essential that the Museum should become a fully-equipped centre for all future historical research in connection with the war. and that it should ultimately contain (as from time to time necessary restrictions of secrecy are removed) all the official documents relating to naval, military, and economical matters. This can only be accomplished if a portion of the Museum is designed and set aside as a branch of the Record Office, and remains under the control of the Master of the Rolls. It is understood to be the desire of the Record Office authorities to remove from Chancery Lane all the War Office and naval records. Congestion at the Record Office will involve the erection of further accommodation unless such relief is supplied, and it is suggested that it would be cheaper to afford the needed extra accommodation in connection with the War Museum than by building in the costly neighbourhood of Chancery Lane. The Army and Navy Records now occupy 10 miles of shelves. If 16 miles of shelves were provided in the War Museum the area covered would be some 18,000 square feet, to which the necessary rooms for the accommodation of the Record Office officials in charge must be added.The Library should contain the 30,000 books, pamphlets, &amp;c, already published in connection with the war, and a large number of files of newspapers, not neglecting the provincial press, which contains a multitude of facts, elsewhere unrecorded, about the doings of individuals and particular regiments. Neutral and enemy newspapers must -also be acquired.   The German collection of files of newspapers of all countries already
numbers upward of 1,700. Provision must be made for future growth, as the issue of war literature will not end with the war. It is estimated that an area of 6,400 square feet will be wanted for library purposes. In addition it will be necessary to provide room for an enormous number of photographs.It is far too early to offer anything like a definitive plan of the proposed Museum, but certain broad lines of arrangement suggest themselves as likely to be determined by the nature and purpose of the institution to be housed. Thus two or more large glass-covered courts will almost certainly form part of any acceptable plan, and these must be on the ground level, as they will have to hold the heavy exhibits: the great guns, tanks, &amp;c. Other essential elements will be the Memorial Hall above described and the Hall of Sculpture. About these elemental parts the exhibition galleries will have to be arranged in two or three storeys. Rough outline plans indicating possible arrangements are appended. In both, the exhibition galleries on two or three floors surround and divide the great courts.(Signed)       MARTIN CON WAY,Director-General.June 26, 1917.Ground floor  OrdnanceMarine engineering Submarine room Aeroplanes Naval construction First floor  RelicsSchedule.Admiralty.Sq. ft. 12,000 35,000 5,000 5,000 30,000 30.00010,000War Office.Ground floor General        .. .. ..Relief maps   ..
