AN AGREEMENTBETWEENTHE BRITISH AND GERMANGOVERNMENTSCONCERNINGCOMBATANT PRISONERS OF WAR AND CIVILIANS
fAn Agreement between the British and German Governments concerning Combatant Prisoners of War and Civilians.No. 1. Final Protocol.THE undersigned British and German delegates who met at The Hague during the period 8th June 14th July, 1918, to deliberate on the subject of prisoners of war and civilians, arrived to-day at the annexed agreement.During the negotiations wishes have been expressed and complaints brought forward by the delegates on both sides. These wishes and complaints are contained in memoranda which have passed between them. The agreements and engagements contained in annex (A) have reference to a portion of these wishes and complaints. In so far as the remainder of these wishes and complaints have not already been dealt with, they shall be laid before the two Governments for examination and consideration.The undersigned Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Royal Netherland Govern-ment, who has presided, with the assistance of the undersigned Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, Jonkheer Dr. van Vredenburch, over the deliberations aforesaid, has, with reference thereto, made the annexed declaration in the name of the Royal Netherland Government.An authenticated copy of this protocol, and of the documents annexed, shall be communicated by the Royal Netherland Government to the two other Governments concerned.Done at The Hague, in duplicate, on the 14th day of July, 1918.J. LOUDON.NEWTON.H. E. BELFIELD, Lieutenant-General.FRIEDRICH.Fiirst HATZFELDT WILDENBURG.ECKARDT.KRAUSS.DRAUDT.VAN VREDENBURCH.Annex (A) to the Final Protocol of the 14th day of July, 1918.Agreements and engagements made by the British and German delegates during their deliberations concerning combatant prisoners of war and civilians between 8th June and l^th July, 1918.I.The German Government will remove the British officers from the camps at Holzminden and Clausthal to other officers&apos; camps outside the Tenth Army Corps District and in future will intern no more British officers in those camps, provided that the British Government removes the causes for the complaints brought forward by the German Government regarding the conditions in the camps at Dyffryn Aled and Kegworth, and meets the wishes of the German officers as to their removal from Dyffryn Aled to other officers&apos; camps. The senior officers in all the camps referred to above shall report in writing to their Governments throught the protecting Power that these arrangements have been carried out.
Holzminden and Clausthal are to be evacuated and the improvements at Dyffryn Aled and Kegworth carried out within one month, if possible, of the date 6m which the agreement of the 14th July, 1918, comes into force.Independently of the execution of these measures the two Governments shall immediately cancel the orders which have been given for increased severity at certain camps.II.The delegates on both sides will arrange for officers to be sent, from the War Offices of the two countries, as soon as possible after the conclusion of the negotia-tions, to the respective areas of operations on the Western front. These officers shall examine the conditions in the prisoners of war companies and interview the local commandants concerned with a view to the rectification of all abuses and the improvement of the lot of prisoners on both sides.Detailed and conscientious reports of the conditions discovered at these inspec-tions shall be mutually exchanged by the two parties through the medium of the protecting Power.III.In view of the detention of a number of children born in the British Empire of German parents, the German delegates thought it necessary that the agreement should contain a provision to the effect that children under age of persons who are eligible for repatriation shall be repatriated, provided that they have on the coming into force of the agreement of the 14th July, 1918, no^mjlitary obligations in the State where they at present reside, if one of their parents oFtheir guardian wishes it and if no objection is raised by the other parent, provided that the child, if over the age of 15 years, desires to leave. The British delegates objected to the insertion of such a provision in the agreement, since the children described above are British subjects. At, the same time, the British delegates undertook that the wishes of the German delegates that the departure of these children should be permitted should be carefully examined and considered before the agreement comes into effect.The German delegates Took cognizance of the above, with the observation that they anticipate a prompt and satisfactory settlement of the question.IV.The German delegates expressed the opinion that among the twenty German civilians not of military age, whom it is permissible for the British to retain under a former agreement, there are certain persons whose retention does not appear justifiable under that agreement, since they were over 55 years of age at the time of the conclusion of the agreement in question. The persons concerned are those whose names are denoted by the numbers 3, 4, 5, 15 and 17 in the British list of the twenty Germans retained, namely: Herr Wirtz, Dr. Mensching, Dr. Duenschmann, Herr Smidt, Herr Goldhagen.The German delegates proposed that these persons should be repatriated or interned in a neutral country, or that, if they are to be retained, they should at least be set at liberty and only subjected to police supervision. The same proposal applies to Herr Koettgen and Herr von Luettwitz, noted in the British list under numbers 10 and 19, who are recommended for consideration on account of their physical ill-health. The same number of British civilians, who are being detained in Germany under the above-mentioned agreement, would be treated in the same manner by the German Government.The British delegates, while maintaining that the persons mentioned above were being justly retained, undertook on their return to England to submit the German proposals to the competent authorities for examination and to recommend them for consideration.
No. 2.Declaration by the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs.Le Gouvernement des Pays-Bas se declare en principe tout dispose a col-laborer avec les Gouvernements allemand et britannique a la mise en oeuvre de 1&apos; arrangement intervenu entre les dele-gues des deux pays en tant que les dis-positions de cet acte le prevoient, Des considerations d&apos;ordre constitutionnel pourraient demander que les points qui reclament specialement la collaboration des Pays-Bas soient consignes dans des arrangements a conclure avec chacun des Gouvernements precites.En vue des difficultes croissantes relatives a la situation economique des Pays-Bas, le Gouvernement de la Reine, heureux de pouvoir offrir l&apos;hospitalite a des prisonniers de guerre, mais tenant compte en meme temps des preoccupa-tions du public neerlandais, doit se reserver de faire dependre sa collabora-tion definitive du reglement de certaines questions d&apos;ordre  conomique et financier, en particulier, sur le point de 1&apos;utilisa-tion eventuelle des navires mentionnes dans FAnnexe 1 sous le No. 3, pour le transport aux Pays-Bas des marchan-dises necessaires a 1&apos;approvisionnement du pays.Le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres, J. LOUDON. La Haye, le 14 juillet, 1918.(Translation.)The Netherland Government declare themselves quite ready in principle to collaborate with the German and British Governments in carrying out the arrange-ment come to between the delegates of the two countries, in so far as provided for by the stipulations of the agreement. Considerations of a constitutional nature may require that the points which speci-allv call for the collaboration of the Netherlands be recorded in arrangements to be concluded with each of the above-mentioned Governments.In view of the increasing difficulties relative to the economic situation of the Netherlands, the Queen&apos;s Government, happy to be able to offer hospitality to prisoners of war, but bearing in mind at the same time the preoccupations of the Dutch public, must reserve to themselves the right of making their definitive col-laboration depend on the settlement of certain questions of an economic and financial nature, particularly with regard to the possible utilisation of the vessels mentioned in Annexe 1, Section 3, for the transport to the Netherlands of the goods necessary for the provisioning of the country.J. LOUDON,Minister for Foreign Affairs.As it was not possible at this Conference to arrive at an agreement with regard to the recognition of the persons coming under the designation of medical personnel both delegations will recommend to their respective Governments that this question should be settled by a special agreement.NEWTON. FRIEDRICH.

In tropical places barracks of corru-gated iron may only be used if they are sufficiently protected against sun and rain by wood or other suitable material.These minimum conditions shall be fulfilled not more than three months from the date on which this agreement comes into force, save in so far as new construc-tion or structural alterations may be required, for which an additional six weeks shall be allowed.
The same conditions shall apply to working parties as far as the local circum-stances permit.Nothing in the above shall preclude the accommodation of ranks other than officers under canvas at suitable times of the year and under conditions which are in medical opinion not injurious to health.6.

Article 48.Paragraph 16 of The Hague Agreement of the 2nd July, 1917, is hereby can-celled, and the following is substituted therefor: The duration of the punishment for a simple attempt to escape on the part of a prisoner of war, even if repeated, shall not exceed military confinement for a period of fourteen days, and, if made in concert with other prisoners, a period of twenty-eight days.The duration of the punishment for such an attempt to escape combined with other punishable actions consequent upon or incidental to such attempt in respect of property, whether in relation to the appropriation or possession thereof, or injury thereto, shall not exceed military confinement for a period of two months.The foregoing provisions shall apply to attempts to escape from arrest of any kind, or from prison, in the same manner as they apply to attempts to escape from ordinary camps.Prisoners of war recaptured after an attempt to escape shall not be subjected to any unnecessary harshness. Any insult or injury to such prisoners shall be severely punished. They shall be protected from violence of every kind. In par-ticular, officers recaptured after an attempt to escape shall be treated in a manner suitable to their rank.Article 49.Collective punishments or deprivations of privilege on account of the misconduct of individuals are forbidden.
