o the Eight Hon. Sir AUCKLAND GEDDES, M.P.,Minister of Reconstruction.REPORTOF THEW0MEN&apos;S EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.IE,I. APPOINTMENT AND TEEMS OE REFERENCE.1. The Women&apos;s Employment Committee was appointed on 9th ,ugust, 1916. Originally a Sub-Committee of the Eeconstruction Com-ittee of that date, it was continued as a Committee by Dr. Addison, .P., when he became Minister of Eeconstruction in 1917. The Chair-an. Sir John Simon, E.C., M.P., resigned in 1917, whereupon Major ills, M.P., was appointed in his place. 2. The terms of reference are as follows :  To consider and advise, in the light of the experience gained during the war, upon the opportunities for the employment of women, and the conditions of such employment, in clerical, com-mercial, agricultural and industrial occupations after the war.Limited Character of Beference.3. It will be seen that the terms of reference call for a report under vo heads, first the opportunities, and secondly the conditions of omen&apos;s work in the four branches of ernpkrynient specified. But they in be read as having either a wider or a narrower scope. Demobilisa-on itself, the transfer of women from war to peace work, is outside the )mmittee&apos;s ambit, but the precise meaning of the word &quot; dernobilisa-on&quot; is not clear. For instance, was the Committee concerned to certain what number of women would be displaced at the end of the ar, what work they were suitable for or desired to pursue, what their e-war occupations were, and in what order and over what time they lght to be demobilised? Or, on the other hand, were they to assume at the above enquiries appertained to demobilisation and that their oper function was to deal with post-war opportunities and conditions :ter demobilisation in its wider sense was complete? During the first ar of its existence, the absence of any body with a more specific -ference suggested that the Committee should take into early con-leration the position of women liable to displacement at the end of the ir. One of the groups or Sub-Committees, into which the Committee d for convenience resolved itself, accordingly prepared and transmitted memorandum on the subject, which is reproduced in this eport as Appendix II. On the appointment at the end of 17 of the Civil War Workers Committee, under the Chairman-ip of Mr. Gerald Bellhouse, C.B.E., the matter was adjusted th the concurrence of Dr. Addison and it was settled that this Com-:ttee&apos;s work was confined to the narrower sphere. This means that the ichinery of demobilisation, the provision of work or of pay or allow-ce during the transition period, the prevention of unemployment and e relief against unemployment during that period ore outside their ference. Nor are they required to report upon the number, qualifica-ms, desires or previous occupations of women displaced.22391a 3
4. However, even after that point was settled, there still remain certain factors of uncertainty. For example, the general questions of the state of trade after the war, the trade policy which this country niav pursue and the trade agreements it may make, and, above all, the supply of raw material would vitally affect all employment after the war, and therefore that of women. But there are, in addition, two matters which affect women to a degree out of all proportion to that in which they affect men. Those are the future of the National Factories, and the Government pledges for the restoration of workshop conditions.Recommendations as to National Factories. 5. Since large numbers of women have been working in National Factories it was obvious that their industrial future would be greatlv affected by the fate of these factories. The Committee&apos;s views on this point are set out in a letter addressed to the Minister of Reconstruction dated 23rd January, 1919, and printed as Appendix I.Restoration of Trade Union Conditions.6. At the outset of our enquiry we are met with the question of Government pledges for the restoration of Trade Union conditions.   It is one of immense importance.     A large proportion of women who entered industry since the war have done so as substitutes or dilutees, and are therefore covered by the pledges.   Though we have no doubt that the Government will keep its promise in the fullest manner, we feel great difficulty in reporting before we know what the Government meaj to do.   We are asked to report on the opportunities for employment oi women.   We cannot separate, the question of opportunity from that oi the pledges, since the method of fulfilling the pledge will determine ill. opportunity; and jet we have/to furnish a report on opportunity befor we know how the bargain will in fact be carried out.    Under the? circumstances we wish to state clearly that anything we say as to sm\ ability must be read as absolutely governed and conditioned by tli pledges.   In other words, when we report that a certain industry i suitable to women we are not to be taken to mean that openings in sue&apos; an industry are in fact, or ought in our judgment to be, available io women.   Whether such openings will exist or not largely depends o the manner in which the pledges are carried out, which must be settle by the Government in agreement with the other parties to the bargaiiII. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON EMPLOYMENT OFWOMEN.Opportunity and Suitability.T. The subject matter of this Beport is therefore the work of wome in its widest sense, after peace. Assume that pence is signed, thi transition has taken place and that the world is running on normal lines what work will there be for women to do? And what work is it desiral that they should do? It is obvious that the answer to these two questie. will not be the same in all cases. There may be work which won. could do, with immediate economic advantage to themselves and ti nation; and yet it may be work which enlightened statesmanship won consider unsuitable. Professions or trades may present opportunii&apos; for women, and yet the conditions involved may be harmful to them a consequently to the State. Many examples may be cited. Hot a heavy trades, such as foundry work, which involve labour in a heat atmosphere or the lifting of great weights, are unsuitable to worn however valuable the work and high the wages.   Thus, at the outset
is possible to define a class of employment which, should be prohibited, it the other end of the scale there are many employments which are obviously suitable, and these are not only such as were considered so before the war, but ma.ny in which women were not previously engaged. The Committee have been furnished with valuable evidence on this object. The Home Office have published an important^&apos; Memorandum 0Il Substitution of Women in Non-Munition Factories which classifies trades according to their suitability for women, and also according as they did or did not employ women before the war. A Memorandum uid Tabular Report has also been prepared for a Ministry of Munitions Committee by Mr. Benjamin H. Morgan, a member of this Committee, fhich shows in tabular form the processes on which women have been engaged on munitions in the engineering, wood-working and allied trades, distinguishing those which in the opinion of the Departments are or are not suitable. Reference to these Memoranda will show that ;n the Departments&apos; opinion many trades previously carried on by men jjTord opportunities for women.But midway between occupations which are clearly suitable and those xkich are equally clearly unsuitable, lies a wide field of employments iliich modern science and proper supervision could render suitable, for example, Mr. Morgan, in the Memorandum and Tabular Report juoted above, gives 60 lbs.t as the limit of weight which women can iafely handle. Now, when you come to a weight of 80 lbs. and over, a nan would require lifting tackle to do the work properly, and lifting ackle can he operated as easily by a woman as a man, since no strength s required. Therefore, there is a comparatively narrow range of Teights which can be managed unaided by a man and not by a woman, [he foregoing example is quoted not for the purpose of defining how ieavy is the work which women can safely do, as to which there will ;e difference of opinion, but to show how nearly women may equal men&apos;s ndustrial efficiency if furnished with appliances which are every day jecoming more common. And what is true of the engineering is true if many other.trades. The march of science, proper workshop organisa-ion, and efficient Government supervision will open the door to women&apos;s abour even wider than it stands now.It will thus he seen that there is a close connection between the two tranches of our enquiry, opportunities for employment of women, and mditions of such employment. The one cannot be considered without he other. A trade may afford openings for women, and yet the work ie unsuitable. Or, again, the work may be entirely suitable, and yet romen may be kept out of it. The driving of taxi-cabs on our London ireets is just as suitable for women as the driving of official cars, of rliieh. they have almost a monopoly; and yet the opposition to women ,xi-drivers has hitherto defeated the efforts of a powerful Government lepartment. Or again, a trade in its present state may he unsuitable, at may be rendered suitable by adequate machinery. All these samples are pretty clear; hut it is necessary to call attention to another ranch of employment in which some more radical reconstruction is &quot;cessary than that indicated above.* Published by H.M. Stationery Office, Kingsway, W.C., price 9rf. f This figure is too high ; probably 50 lbs. is nearer the limit, and then only for certain jvements0 Women have been lifting, without tackle, Government 4&quot;5 shells weighing libs. Health of Munition Workers Committee Report (Cd. 6095), Appendix B. II, 145. The whole question of weights for women is carefully examined in that Report, paras. 418 to 424.22391
Agriculture. An Instance.8. Agriculture may be selected as an instance of this class. It is perhaps, generally believed, judging from newspaper articles and other current comment, that the number of women permanently engaged in agriculture has immensely increased since the war. This is far from being the case. Between July, 1914 and July, 1918 (to compare like with like), the number increased from 80,000 to 113,000, or an increase of 33,000.* No doubt the smallness of the number is partly explained by the reluctance of farmers to employ women. Still, if compara-tively so few women have been drawn permanently into agriculture during tbe war, in spite of the urgent national demand which women are always ready to answer and the extended appeals and recruiting efforts set on foot to enlist their services, it is permissible to conclude that a much smaller number would have engaged had the attractions of the pursuit been the only inducement. It might be supposed that the increased wages brought about by the Corn Production Act are likely to attract women in greater numbers,; but the agricultural representa-tives on the Committee are unanimous in thinking that this is not the case.tt In their view agriculture is not an industry in which certain changes in wages, hours of work and conditions generally will convert it into one affording openings for women. The wages and conditions might be all that could be desired and yet the industry would not be one which presented a wide field of suitable employment. On the oilier hand, they were equally unanimous in thinking that a reconstituted agriculture would give an immense and valuable opening. But in order to create this opening it is not enough merely to raise a wnjre here or improve a condition there. The whole industry must be recon-stituted. We have dealt with this branch of employment more fully elsewhere, and only mention it now in order to show that the field of women&apos;s work is indeed a wide one.Women and the Race.9. In considering women&apos;s labour, the relation of their work to tli duties, which fall to them as mothers and homemakers has necessarily ti be borne in mind. While opinions may differ as to the exact measure to be taken for insuring the race against injury to health and happines arising from the overwork of women, or their employment in trade unfit for them, or in unsuitable circumstances, there will be genera agreement that&apos;Some restriction (as to, e.g., the employment of mother after childbirth and in trades involving the use of racial poisons) i necessary. The Health of Munition Workers Committee and the Horn Office, taking a wide view of their functions and considering health in it relation to social well-being as well as to industrial efficiency, collecte and published the results of several valuable experiments in the stud, of industrial fatigue and effect of hours upon output, which will serv as starting points for wider exploration in the general field of industry* Report on the State of Employment in all occupations in United Kingdom in Ju! 1918, prepared by the Board of Trade.f Note : This increase is a net increase. The gross figure would be higher, for ma; women have been drawn away from agriculture in the North of England and Scotland 1 the better wages offered by Munition Works. Further, the effect of the wage increas under the Corn Production Act, 1917, remains to be seen.ff The two following sentences do not apply to Scotland.
-   414Women and Men as Workers: How they Differ.10. The two sexes have hitherto entered the world of work under such lely differing conditions that any comparison between their capabili-s, as well as their achievements, must inevitably be unsatisfactory, e data for accurate comparison do not yet exist, and the exceptional eunistances of war employment cannot he said to have supplied them, or the present we are left to reckon on the physical side with difference physiological constitution and lesser degree (in the average woman aipared with the average man) of muscular power; on the moral and :ial side with the fact of marriage as interrupting and, in the majority cases, ending the woman&apos;s career in industry. Owing to the shortness this career, the young woman has not the same encouragement as the rang man to cultivate industrial ambition, to work for improvements in i status and prospects, or to devote herself to the development of trade ion organisation. Tet efficient organisation is one of the most urgent lustrial needs of women. Coupled with State action, as it has worked rough the series of Orders issued by the Ministry of Munitions during e war and with the legalised minimum rate set up under the Trade lards, it has achieved a stabilisation of, as well as an increase in. men&apos;s wages which has gone far to change profoundly their position industry. This change has been assisted, in the women engaged in ir work, by the common dominating motive of service in a great cause, id a consciousness of capacity, hitherto undeveloped and by themselves ien unsuspected. The maintenance of their new and improved position ill depend largely on what the Beport of the Beconstruction Committee i Adult Education calls &quot; a new industrial outlook &quot; on the part of iinen themselves. Largely, but not entirely. In the matter of con-tions, and especially in the maintenance of the standard of wages for omen, the State, Whitley Councils and Trade Boards have still their at to play. Even education, as the same Beport points out, can do itle without a harmonious environment. If, however, there is better iucation, and at the same time a freer and finer industrial life, the two adencies are correlative and develop each other. It is perhaps not o much to say that there are signs of the approach of this broader and leper industrial vision.III. THE NUMBERS INVOLVED.11. Having briefly set out the factors, social, political and individual, iich have to be borne in mind, it is necessary to give certain figures, neral in character, showing the size of the problem. The following-He gives a summary of the position of the employment of women ine Jo not propose to prejudge the results of such enquiries. But, as a aeral principle, we would suggest that the only differentiation between ea and women which can be justified is such as has its basis in the ed of preserving women&apos;s powers unimpaired for those primary ivities which are connected with the family and the home. The fact it a large proportion of adult women now possess full rights of citizen-p will enable them to express themselves directly on the subject of eli differentiation and to help in embodying in reformed factory legis-ion the results of their personal experience.

For instaiw doubtless many women classed as Commercial are in reality Clerical, and the Clerica women employed in Industrial Factories, as in the Pay Office, are classed as Industrial Therefore, the Clerical figures are bigger than shown, though it is impossible to say bi how much.f Including Finance and Banking ; Hotels, Theatres, etc.: Civil Service (Post Office) Other Civil Service ; Services under Local Authorities (excluding Gas, Water, Blectricit and Tramways).J Including Industries : Government Establishments : Gas, Water, Electrical Service (under Local Authorities); Transport (excluding Tramways under Local Authorities) Tramways under Local Authorities.The table may be summarised as follows: Before the war, nearl; 3,250,000 women were employed in clerical, commercial, agricultura and industrial occupations. This number has been increased by ove 1,500,000. But this is a gross increase in the specified occupations, an it must not be assumed that the number of employed women has bee increased by that figure; for on the one side must be added the 43,00 full-time workers in the various war hospitals and the women enlists in the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps, Women&apos;s Royal Naval Servia Women&apos;s Air Force, Women Police and Timber Cutters, and on the otlu side must be deducted women who have left domestic service and ii smaller workshops and workrooms in the dressmaking trade, which a not included in the table given above, and are estimated to amoii: together to 400,000. Assuming that the 400,000 new entrants fro small workshops and domestic service will return to their origin vocations, there remain to be dealt with 1,200,000 new entrants since I war. Add to this the pre-war figure of 3,250,000, and the result is tl the outside figure to be absorbed in clerical, commercial, agricultui and industrial occupations is over 4i millions.IV. OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT AFTER THE WA112. In considering opportunities after the war it is desirable to sfi once more that &quot; after the war &quot; means after both demobilisation ; the transition period have passed. It is not possible to state at wl date after the conclusion of peace normal conditions may be expec to resume their sway; but this present Report deals only with empl ment when that date has been reached, the problems and difficulties the earlier period having been remitted to the Civil War Wori Committee.   It now becomes necessary to consider the factors affecj
jpportunity of employment of women in greater detail than in the preceding sections of this Report.The factors are divisible into three main heads:   (1) The volume of trade and general state of enipk^onent after the war.(2) The attitude of men and their organisations in regard to whatare known as &quot; War Pledges.&quot; (3) The capacity of women for new work of various grades anddescriptions.There is also the large factor of the extent to.which conditions of employment are regulated which will have a great influence on oppor-tunity.   This is discussed under conditions (see para. 37 et seq.).(1) The Volume of Trade and General State of Employmentafter the War.13. It is impossible to arrive at conclusions even of the most general character upon this. Nor have the Committee any information on diich to rely, and they can only proceed on what seems the most pro-jable assumption. Therefore, as a working hypothesis for the purpose if this Report, a favourable state of trade is assumed.*(2) The Attitude of Men and their Organisations in regard to what is known as war pledges.14. The Committee can only repeat what Xh.ey said in para. 6 hereof.(3) The Capacity of- Women for New Work of Various Gradesand Descriptions.General Observations.15. The great test of war, which tried the whole fibre of our national ife, fell with not least severity on women&apos;s capacity for work. From 1914 onwards the demand for certain articles became enormous; at the arne time male workers were enlisting in hundreds of thousands, and rere allowed to do so without regard to the dislocation of industry. Consequently when about the beginning of 1915 it became possible :oughly to gauge our national requirements and the labour power avail-ible to meet them, it was at once plain that unless new sources of iupplies were tapped we could not continue to take so large a part in he war as the military situation demanded. The only unused supply if labour was women. The need was extensive, immediate and long :ontinued: the response of women was wide, enthusiastic and sustained. No better test than the fiery trial of war could be devised for ascertain-:ng woman&apos;s possibilities.16. Over 1,500,000 women have entered industry and commerce since he war, of whom 1,200,000 are new entrants who before August, 1914, lid not work outside their homes. The occupations are multifarious, anging from the carrying on of a solicitors business to the work of a ricklayer&apos;s labourer. Industry proper, distinguished from clerical, ommercial or agricultural employment has been heavily invaded, and, :or other reasons, comes first in importance.In considering what new work women have shown that they can do, :t is necessary at the outset to exclude certain employments which for nirious reasons are unsuitable.   What these are will be found set forth
in that part of this Report which deals with Suitability (see paras 129-142).   Upon them and upon others valuable information is con-tained in the Home Office Memorandum above referred to; and on this together with Mr. B. Morgan&apos;s Memorandum, the Committee have largely relied for this part of their Report.Capacity of Women for Industrial Employment.17. Women have been introduced into industry on two main lines. In trades in which they worked before the war, they have been intro-duced to semi-skilled and skilled work, previously reserved for men, as well as into labouring work. Secondly, they have been introduced into trades from which they were previously excluded. The future employ-ment of women in these two branches of industry falls again under two heads : first the nature of the work they can do; secondly the industries in which they can be employed. The first head is treated in the Home Office Memorandum under:  (1) Management; (2) Supervision; (3) Scientific Work; (4) Process Work, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled; and (5) Labouring,This is a convenient sub-division which we propose to follow. Tlx; second head, an account of the industries in which women are or can be employed, is dealt with in that Section of this Report which discusser Suitability (see para. 129).Management.18. Munition work shows instances of women acting as full managers.* They have been doing so in Shell, Cartridge, and Filling Factories. The future will almost certainly show a wide extension of the employment, of women as managers. As may be supposed, there are more women managers in munition than in non-munition work; for in non-munition work women have been gradually introduced among men, and it is therefore hot a likely field in which to find women employed as managers. But there is a tendency even here, small hut increasing, to employ women as managers or works managers, and this over a wide range of industries, running from general engineering to jewellery and tobacco. We feel confident that the future will show a large increase. It would be a great mistake to measure tlie opportunities for employment by the numbers employed. The true measure is the demand, which, owing to the infinitesimal supply ol trained women, can at present only be met to a fraction of its extent. The existence of large staffs of women workers will compel employe)&apos; to create posts for women managers: those posts must be well paid for the requirements will be high : and the combination of good pen and interesting work will make women train themselves to fill the post provided that adequate facilities for such training are furnished. Ii addition, the declaration of peace will release many highly trainei women managers from Shell, Cartridge and Filling Shops, many o: whom will want to continue in industry.The possibilities of the future are, indeed, great; and the succes of women in managing munition works shows that proper selection aw careful training can make these possibilities become certainties.Supervision.19. &quot; Where women are employed in large numbers and organise apart from the men, there is a growing tendency to place a woman ii charge of them.&quot;t   And the tendency would have grown still faster hai* H.O. Memorandum, Cd. 9065, 1918, para. 111.      f H.O. Memorandum, p. G.
[here been a supply of women technically trained.   Employers, indeed, jave been faced with a difficulty; they had either to employ a man upervisor, with all the drawbacks, or an untrained woman, who could 5ot give the assistance and close oversight required, and whose want 0f technical skill was objected to by the operatives to the same extent as the presence of the unskilled male foreman is resented by men.   The Ministry of Munitions were faced with this difficulty from the start, and have trained women in their Training Schools to become shop super-visors and forewomen, and the enterprise has been most successful, jhe Health of Munition Workers Committee recommend that in all La;es where women are employed a forewomen should be appointed. In engineering, women tool-setters and setters-up should be employed, and women charge hands and sectional forewomen as well as women upervisors and shop managers.   The need will increase after the war. &apos; With the entry of women into the more skilled branches of trade there has arisen a demand for the technically trained forewoman, which will certainly persist, and may even increase after the war, when the staffing if the upper ranks of women&apos;s trades by men will frequently present difficulties.&apos;&apos;*   It may, therefore, be taken as proved that there will be a demand, and a demand which will originate in the desires of the irorkpeople equally with the requirements of the employers.   The Train-ing Schools of the Ministry of Munitions have shown that women can be irained to meet that demand.   Opportunities, of wide extent and infinite value, lie here before women, but they can only be made available by adequate provision of training.Scientific Work.20. The entry of women into this branch has gone much further tkan is generally imagined, as will he seen on reference to the Home Office Memorandum on Substitution of Women in Non-munition Fac-tories during the War, pp. 7-8. It should be remembered that, marked as is this progress, it has nevertheless been confined to the relatively short period of the duration of the war.Process Work.21. But it is in Process Work that women have chiefly progressed. Their success in it during the war is well known. If the work be considered as divided into very light, light, heavy and very heavy, it will be found that they can, as might be expected, manage with ease all the very light and light operations. Light engineering and wood-dorking in munitions, boots and shoes, clothing and light leather tanning in the non-munitions trades are examples. The women&apos;s success here is so complete and so notorious that little need be said of these two classes. When we come to the moderately heavy and lieavy operations different considerations arise. Most processes can be opened to women if proper care be taken to reduce fatigue, if appliances lie fitted to supplement muscular effort, and if the work be sub-divided so as to give to men such parts as can by no mechanical means be made light. In Mr. Morgan&apos;s opinion, it is only a question of introducing proper lifting tackle to enable women to perform every single process on shells of all sizes, except forging in fact, the only limiting factors are found in such operations as some processes in the rubber trade, where a combination is required of skill and ability to deal at the same time with heavy weights, or in small works where articles over 50 or 60 lbs. have to be handled and lifting tackle is an economic difficulty.* H.O. Memorandum, p. 7.
As might he expected, devices to reduce fatigue and lifting machinery, have been carried much further in munition factories than m those engaged on peace products.* Still, the latter can show many examples. In rubber tyre-making the introduction of machines and lifting tackle has enabled women to replace men; and the use of lifting tackles and hoists has played a similar part in the bleaching and dyeino of velvets and cords, and also in flour mills.Sub-division of work, too, either alone, or, what is far more useful, combined with mechanical appliances, has had a most marked effect! It has enabled women to do part of such heavy work as the making of large crucibles, and the moulding processes in oil and seed mills* io quote only two examples. Many more instances could be given, &apos;bnt probably enough has been said to show the possibilities of the future.Process Work. Skilled and Semi-skilled.22. To what extent has woman acquired skill? How far can she corn-pare with the &quot;skilled man,&quot; the craftsman, the tradesman? There has been a good deal of loose talk about this, and as the matter is vita! for woman&apos;s future, certain misconceptions must be removed. If &quot; skilled man &quot; be taken in the strict sense, as it is used in the enpi-neering trades, for instance, to mean a man who can &quot; put in hand and carry out any given complete job on a particular class of work * when furnished only with the requisite drawings,&quot; it is doubtful if such a person as a skilled woman exists. But if, on the other hand, &quot; skilled &quot; be used, as it generally is, not of the man but of the job. to mean &quot; operations which in normal times are only undertaken at the close of a definite period of apprenticeship,&quot; there are thousands of women who can do &quot; skilled man&apos;s work,&quot; even work of the highest accuracy, provided they are specially trained and that very few opera-tions are involved. These are the women who are skilled in one particular operation, who by careful selection, intensive training and systematic practice have been given aptitude which enables them to carry out numberless jobs classed as skilled man&apos;s jobs. But they are skilled iii one or two of these jobs only: though they do skilled man&apos;s work and are paid skilled man&apos;s rate, they are not in the same industrial category as. the man who has served his apprenticeship, worked on the vice and the lathe, in the drawing office and in all the. innumerable operation.&apos; which every branch of engineering comprises. He acquires a practice, a proficiency, a manual and mental dexterity and resourcefulness to which no woman under present conditions attains. Not only can hi perform all operations in any given job, where a woman can only per form one or two, but he can meet the difficulties and deal with tin emergencies which must arise even in the most fool-proof machinery difficulties which often find the woman helpless. His superiority is din io his training, and to the special cast thereby given to hand and brain Now, women can acquire this superiority; there is no sex hindrance tha stands in their way; their brains are quick, their hands dexterous, thei power of application great. But up to the present they have no acquired it. They have not, for reasons which are historical and social These have disappeared or are disappearing; education and training wil then do the rest.But, to complete the picture, while admitting that few women possesH such general skill, the remarkable success of women in operations fi* H.O. Memorandum, pp. 9, 10. I
-he highest skill, especially precision work, where only a few operations 3re required, should be recorded.* &quot;In a tool factory women are ;iuplQyed as turners on milling cutters, working to limits of &apos;01 nims.: ,jje of them setting up her own work on a B. &amp; S. Universal Miller jnevenly spacing reaumurs; another on a thread-milling machine with 30 limits, the work required being dead accurate; and in electrical j-orks women are chasing external and internal threads on electrical jttings, machining end-plates of magnetos to a limit of 0&quot;002 and -rinding tapers on pole pieces to a limit of 0&quot;001.&quot;t There are also -iunierous women making engineers gauges of all kinds, work of the jiighest precision, whilst they are also engaged on sub-divisions of most jrher accurate tool room work.In this Report skilled and semi-skilled are used not of the worker but of the work: skilled work being that which in ordinary times is not done -ill a man is out of his apprenticeship; and semi-skilled that for which a Jiort training is required in order to give proficiency. These words are -ised because they are in common use, but as a fact they are misleading. The division between skilled and semi-skilled work is uncertain, arbitrary, ;md varying from place to place. Moreover, the war has shown that in numberless instances the degree of skill connoted in the expression &quot;skilled man&apos;s work &quot; is not high, but is one which can be reached by ;otally untrained women and boys after a short period of teaching. These reservations must always be borne in mind.Women have acquired skill most readily in non-munitions trades where previously they have been employed in the semi-skilled and unskilled section. &quot; Familiarity with the atmosphere, surroundings, customs and even the special nomenclature of an industry is of immense assistance to a woman set to learn a new process. This is particularly true of the textile industries. . . , . Textile skill, or at least a textile mind, is necessary to make a person of any use, and the length of training necessary will vary as the previous knowledge or textile experience.&quot;^: The Committee, however, do not consider that this imposes any limita-tions on the possibilities of the future.   It is a transitory state of affairs.The pressure of war, which expanded munition factories so enormously, often contracted non-munition work; and, as in munition work, the tendency has been to sub-divide and to train women on one or two opera-tions only in repetition, so that her services may the sooner become pro-ductive.   This fact, combined with the large field of semi-skilled work, has resulted in the creation of a great number of women classed as semi-skilled that is, thoroughly proficient at one or two jobs, usually of a repetition character.   These are the women who will compose the rank and file of the women&apos;s industrial army of the future.   It is certain tliat repetition work will increase in extent; and as it increases there will lie found a body of capable, quick-witted, deft-handed, self-reliant women ready to run intricate machines and to produce what the modern world requires.   Below them will be the unskilled and the labourers, above them the craftswoman, the woman completely skilled at her trade; and above her again, the forewoman and the supervisor, until finally we reach the woman works manager, managing director or partner.   From the top of industry to the bottom there will be work for woman suited to her capacity.* H.O. Memorandum, p. 11. f Mr. Morgan&apos;6 Memorandum. X H.O. Memorandum, p. 12.
Process Work. Unskilled.23. &quot; Unskilled work includes both labourers&apos; work and also those pro-cesses where a habit of attention and some familiarity with the machine *&apos; form the only needful equipment of the worker.&quot; Numberless women are now working on these so-called unskilled operations. Women arc now on all the operations repetition work be it understood of the heaviest bootmaking, including Army boots. And the same applies to leather tanning.   The only limitation is that of physical strength.Labouring Work.24., The Home Office Memorandum shows that women have been very largely employed in labouring work, pure and simple. They have replaced men in iron and steel works, in chemical works, in brickyards and in gasworks, to name instances of work of the heavier kind. In some instances, only women selected for their physical strength have heen engaged; but in the great majority the story has been the same as in process work: sub-division, sectionalisation, and above all, the intro-duction of mechanical assistance has enabled their employment on work previously regarded as beyond their strength. They make efficient brick-yard labourers if given lighter barrows, reduced loads, and special steps when stacking: lifting tackle, trolleys and runways for bogies enable them to handle the heaviest packing-case; lighter tools and appliances have made them useful in railway yards, gas works and breweries. In fact, where the hours are not too long, where protective clothing and footwear are provided, where meal and rest rooms with hot food and drink are at hand, and where otherwise the conditions of work are good, &quot; women appear to find labouring work healthy and not too fatiguing.&quot;* But where heavy work is combined with long hours at the factory and onerous duties at home, fatigue and sickness become prevalent, so much so, that the heaviest work should only be performed by the young, physically fit,t and capable, who either have no arduous home duties, or possess adequate means for providing for their discharge by others.25. It will, therefore, be seen that from the top to the bottom of industry, from the Managing Director or maker of scientific instruments to the bricklayer or goods porter, the only limitation imposed on women is their muscular strength and the suitability of the work, judged by social, economic and physiological standards. The progress of scientific equipment is fast replacing strength by dexterity. Women&apos;s future industrial kingdom, therefore, is hardly limited by her weaker muscles, for this is a boundary which is disappearing. But it is limited by a complex of conditions, summed up under the word &quot; suitability.&quot; These limitations, that is, which occupations are wholly unsuitable, which are wholly suitable, and which are suitable under conditions, are discussed in para. 129, and it must again be pointed out that the Government pledges problem governs the question of opportunity.Capacity of Women for Clerical and Commercial Employment.26. In commerce and clerical work there are no materials available similar to the Home Office Memorandum and Mr. B. H. Morgan&apos;s Memorandum. A group of the Committee, over which Sir Bichard Vassar Smith usually presided, therefore took evidence of those engaged in business, hanks and other employment, heads of educational establishments, and trade union officials. There was very general agree-ment among all the witnesses.   A glance at the table in para. 11 will* H.O. Memorandum, p. 13.     f Cd- 9065, 1918, para. 90.
show how immense has been the increase in numbers employed since the war. To give further details, in the Civil Sendee (excluding the Post Office) there are nearly twenty women employed for one before the war; whilst in industry proper there are only a little over four as against three. And apart from proportionate figures, which do not tell the whole story, the actual increase is greater, for more women have entered clerical and commercial work combined than have entered industry. The problem is therefore a big one, both present and future.Of the numbers who will be displaced and yet wish to continue, no reliable estimate can be formed. But it is possible to gauge women&apos;s capacity for the new work which they are doing, and from this to make a rough forecast of the possibilities of the future.27. Women have, as in industry, invaded all grades of employment. They are acting as Managers and Heads of Departments, in a wide range of occupations. Their business capacity is well spoken of, though there is some doubt as to their ability to meet emergencies or to accept respon-sibilities. No doubt the want of facilities for training partly explains this. On the other hand, strong complaint is made by them that the work on which they are set is often monotonous,, discouraging initiative and enterprise. These two tendencies are, of course, correlated, for a woman whose resourcefulness is dulled by excessive routine is not in the most favourable situation to respond to an emergency; and indeed, no employer can expect to have it both ways. Much commercial work must always be monotonous, for men as well as for women. The remedy lies, not in changing the character of the work, which is often impossible, but in giving the worker hope of advancement, when he will cheerfully endure early years of drudgery. It is the absence of this hope which takes the heart out of a worker, from which women are suffering. The new entrants since the war, when they invaded institutions like Banks in which no woman previously had set her foot, naturally were confined to the lower grades of work, for the higher posts were all in the hands of men. But if, as is probable, the war has brought a change, the future may see women acting as Branch Managers or Chief Cashiers, and then the evil will right itself. There is one pre-requisite, however, it is that women&apos;s education should fit them for the higher posts.Education required for Clerical and Commercial Work.28. What should this education be? Should it be general or voca-tional? And should the vocational side be acquired in school or in the work itself? The evidence was nearly unanimous. A sound general education is preferred to early specialized training. Women entrants may be grouped in three classes: Those who enter over 18, usually from a High School or University; those who enter from 16 to 18, usually from the Secondary Schools; and those who enter from 14 to 15- from the Elementary Schools. The advantage of High School and Secondary School Education in fitting girls to take up clerical work with much hope of real success is clearly established, and, what is much more remarkable, the High School is also considered superior to special com-niercial classes for this purpose. All witnesses agree about this. The Committee did not go far into the question of the superiority of the University-trained woman, a question which the comparatively small number of such women as yet engaged in clerical and commercial work rendered difficult of investigation.29. Speaking generally, therefore, women showed capacity for all sorts of clerical work. Employers will gladly continue to employ them after the war, subject, of course, to the right to reinstatement granted
to men who have joined the Forces. Clerical work, widely varied though it is, has no characteristic which unfits it for women.The higher branches of Commerce, too, present numerous openings. The barriers which excluded women in the past, traditional or social as they were, have largely vanished. Evidence was given that fathers are bringing their daughters into their businesses where a few years ago such a course would bave seemed either fantastic or improper, and this tendency is one which will increase.Local Government Service.30. Special attention was given by the Committee to the Local Government Service with its immense opportunity for women. All clerical posts open to men should be open to women. It was ascertained that the standards imposed by Local Authorities differed greatly, ranging from that of the London County Council, which is as exacting as that for Government Civil Service, to tbat of some Local Authorities, who require no qualifications at all. Now, it would be a great public advantage if the qualifications of all were levelled up to the best: ancl it would incidentally be an advantage to employees to have a much wider field in which to move: and it would simplify the educational task if all schools and colleges knew for what they bad to prepare their pupils.Summary of Recommendations as to Local Government Service.31. The Committee, therefore, recommend that free entrance to the clerical posts in Local Government Service should be accorded to women; that all clerical posts open to men should be open to women; and that with a view to securing a proper standard of education it should be re-quired that no woman could be appointed who had not passed such school or special examination as might be prescribed.This would be a big step in advance. It would be a boon to the public, to the Local Authorities, to the women and to heads of schools. But the reform need not stop there. There are quasi-public bodies, eni-ploying hundreds of thousands of clerks, who might be asked to follow suit. Railway, tramway and omnibus companies, gas, electric light, and water companies, banks and insurance offices would gain, and not lose, if&apos;they drew their women clerks frlom a common pool, their acquirements certified.by a common test. For them it would be an enabling, not a restrictive measure: it would open a wider field of choice, without preventing them from engaging the daughter of a former officer, or anyone else with a traditional claim to employment, or indeed anyone they wished to employ; but it would secure that the person so engaged was duly qualified. And to the women themselves, it would mean wider employment, more certain conditions, and that dignity which comes of corporate unity.32. It goes without, saying that women&apos;s clerical future is bound up with the question of remuneration and conditions of work as closely as is her industrial future. The value of clerical work is assessed by infinitely varying standards: and the conditions under which it is carried on show the same attribute. They are dealt with in another section (see paras. 48, 69 and 142). They are mentioned here in order to reinforce the urgency of an enquiry into the conditions in offices.
17419Further Opportunities in Health Services and other CognateServices.33. At the request of the Committee an investigation was conducted 0v Miss A. M. Anderson, C.B.E., into the opportunities for the employ-ment of women in Health and Sanitary Services, maternity work, and other work of a character especially suitable to women. Her conclusions ffhich are of the greatest interest, have been published by the Ministry of Reconstruction, and should be studied by readers of this Report. * ft will probably surprise many readers to see how large and varied is the work which women can do with benefit to themselves and to the community. Moreover, not only is the sphere a large one at the moment : it is one which will ever increase with the increasing regard paid to iromen&apos;s health and happiness and to the care of infant lives.Capacity for Work in Shops.34. Women have extended their range in shops as they have in other branches of commerce. They have shown themselves capable of acting as managers, travellers, and buyers, their success as buyers in the drapery trade being specially marked. There are good reasons for thinking that they will retain after the war the status they have Avon and will do work formerly done by men. The need of better educa-tion, general and vocational, and of increased wages to provide better food and housing, is as urgent here as elsewhere, and is specially asked for by the organised shop assistants.Opportunities in Agriculture.35. There remains to consider the opportunity which argiculture offers. The views ofj the Committee, already indicated generally in Para-graph 8, must now be stated in greater detail. The Committee were fortunate in comprising members well versed in agriculture, who formed ,i special group at whose sittings Mr. Floud usually presided, and the opportunities which the industry offers were carefully canvassed, forms of enquiry having been sent to a large number of farmers and other persons with a special knowledge of the subject. At an early stage of the discussion the agricultural members put forward the contention that agriculture, as at present constituted, would not offer many new opportunities for women in addition to the work they did before the war. The ranks of agricultural labour, whether skilled or unskilled, were not a promising field for women&apos;s work. It was thought that after the war women ploughmen or women horsemen would not find employment; and, although it was possible that a limited number of cow-women might be required, that a good deal of the emer-gency work undertaken during the war from patriotic motives would cease at its termination. But this does not mean that there is no place for women in agriculture. Par from it. A reconstituted agriculture would present an immense and valuable field, but that such a field should be open depended on a new organisation of agriculture and a new vision of village life. In this connection, the importance of widely distributed cheap electric power and improved transport facilities in their bearing on rural development cannot be overestimated. If the industry could be reconstructed, if our villages could be re-created, if industries not only the bigger ones such as sugar beet, and flax, but the smaller ones, such as bacon curing, fruit canning andi jam-* Memorandum on Subsidiary Health and Kindred Services for Women. By Miss A.M. inderson, O.B.B. To be obtained of H. M. Stationery Office, Kingsway, W.C. \. Price 3d.
ismaking, for which the unit is the village-could be established, there-was a new and great opportunity for women. Women to supply the need would be drawn, not so much from the general pool of women&apos;s labour, on the lines that women are and will be drawn into industry, but would be furnished for the most part by the wives, the sisters and the daughters of farmers, small holders, labourers and village artisans resident in the locality.recommendations as to opportunities in agriculture. 36. On examining the question, two conclusions were reached by the Committee. The first was that the ground which they desired should be covered had not been covered entirely by any previous enquiry, either in England or, still less, in Scotland, and yet an enquiry was a national necessity. The second was that the present Committee, by its constitution, was not the most suitable body to conduct the enquiry. Accordingly, it was settled that the Chairman, in conjunction with other members of the Committee, should approach the Ministry of Re-construction. This was done, and as a result, a special Sub-Committee of enquiry was set up by Section IY. of the Advisory Council of thai Ministry under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Roland Wilkins, a member of this Committee, with the following terms of reference:  &quot; To consider what economic part women can take in the develop-ment of agriculture,  having particular regard; to the Report presented by the Agricultural Policy Committee, and to recommend what steps should be taken to give practical effect to such con-clusions as may be drawn.&quot; The investigations of this Sub-Committee are confined to England. Subsequently, a similar Sub-Committee was set up for Scotland, under the Chairmanship of Mra. Charles Douglas of Auchlochan.    Three members of the Women1 s Employment Committee Miss Paterson, Miss Crabbie and Miss Mitchell serve on this Sub-Committee. &apos; The results of these enquiries will be awaited with great interest.V. CONDITIONS of EMPLOYMENT.37. So much for Opportunities: the closely related subject of coii-ditions must noAv be examined.The word &quot; Conditions &quot; has no very precise meaning. It is used here in its widest bearing, so as to cover all topics which, though they may not be conditions in the strict sense, yet have to be considered if women&apos;s employment is to be surveyed as a whole. These topics can be grouped under the following heads:  A. Remuneration.B. Hours.C. Welfare.D. Trade Unionism.E. Training.f. Employment of Married Women.G. Suitability of Employment.H. Home Work.A. remuneration.38. No comprehensive survey of the rates of wages paid to women workers exists apart from the volumes published in connection with the Earnings and Hours Enquiry conducted by the Board of Trade in 1906. The figures there shown will have been considerably affected by the general movement of wages which has since taken place; but after
making allowance for any probable change, the fact remains that in many trades the average earnings of women for full-time employment are insufficient to support a decent life, even when planned on the mostrugal lines. In the group of textile trades the average weekly earnings of women, 18 years of age and over, for full time were in 1906 15s. 5d., the lowest of the group being linen, with an average of 10-s. 9d. In the clothing trades group the average was 135. Gd., the lowest being manu-acture of corsets, where the average was 12s. 2d. Among other trades important from the point of view of the employment of women, may be mentioned paper stationery manufacture with an average of Us. 11^.,ad the aerated water and general bottling trade with an average of 9s. 7d. All these figures, it must be remembered, are of a period prior to the Trade Boards Act, 1909 and they were higher at the beginningf the war.Wages in Munition Trades.39. The war has caused a great increase, but mainly in Controlled Establishments, and those trades to which Orders of the Minister of jfunitions under the Munitions of War Act, 1916, apply or have been ^tended. Under that Act a body called the Special Arbitration tribunal was constituted. It was composed of an independent Chair-aian, members of Government departments, and persons of experience, either as employers or in connection with labour. Its functions were  to advise the Minister of Munitions as to the directions to be given with regard to the employment and remuneration of women and girls on munitions work, and to arbitrate on differences affecting women and lirls on munitions work. The Minister of Munitions, advised by the Tribunal, was the supreme authority over women&apos;s wages on munitions nork to the same extent as the Committee on Production was over those if men.The Orders made by the Minister, advised by the Tribunal, cover most of the principal industries in which the Ministry of Munitions 5 concerned. These include engineering and all its allied industries, hipbuilding, chemicals, explosives, aircraft, woodwork, rubber, wire rope, hemp rope, brass working, bolts and nuts, and others. Their effect has been to establish a series of minimum rates for munitions rork, and to provide for the payment of rates above the minimum appropriate to the nature of the work.As a result of the Orders the minimum remuneration of women was raised to 32s. for a week of 48 hours, while the average earnings were onsiderably higher. Detailed improvements of a permanent nature liave been introduced into the wage systems under which women work, and the status of women in industry has been immeasurably improved. In this important work the Tribunal cannot be dissociated from the Ministry of Munitions; neither body could have achieved these results without the assistance and co-operation of the other.Wages in Non-Munition Trades.40. But these results, remarkable as they are, do not obtain in other than controlled establishments, to which alone the Orders apply.The degree in which wages have been increased in other trades since 1906, especially on account of the war, is a matter on which conclusive statistical information is not available. From certain figures submitted to the Committee it would appear, however, that the general increase in the trades in which women mainly found employment up to August, 1918, was only a little over 90 per cent., which is less than the increased
cost of living, measured by changes in retail prices. But assuming it to be of that amount, and allowing for some fall in wages that will probablv occur on a return to normal conditions after the war, it is clear that-^by whatever standard of human necessity the rates of wages are judged___there is an obvious and urgent need for improvement.   Such statistical information as is available is given in Appendix IV.41. Two other disturbing factors need to be noted. The first is the well-known one of the seasonal character of many women&apos;s trades causing acute unemployment and consequent fall in wages during the slack season. The second is the large number of women who before the war were not in employment, hut who have entered employment during the war, and from various motives will desire to remain in it.How can Wages be raised and stabilised?42. The practical question to which the Committee have addressed themselves is by what means wages which have reached a proper level can be established, and improvement can be effected in those that are too low. Such means are : the enlargement of the field of employment for women; the provision of appropriate and adequate training; the development of trade union organisation: and the regulation of wages directly or indirectly by the State. These methods can be considered individually, but they become most effective in combination; indeed, the extent to which they interact makes the effectiveness of any one dependent in many cases upon the simultaneous employment of the others.Influence of Opportunity on Wages.43. The wages paid to women, as to any class of labour, -must ulti-mately be determined by.economic conditions. It is impossible to maintain, except temporarily in exceptional circumstances, a rate in excess of the value of the work performed. The remuneration of women in industrial occupations must, therefore, depend upon the demand for women&apos;s labour, and this demand will be the greater as the field in . which they may find employment is enlarged. The experience gained during the Avar has thus a special significance as regards the outlook of the woman worker. The opening to her of new occupations is of importance, not merely because many such occupations are relatively well paid; but also because, in so far as women find employment in them, the rates of wages tend to be raised in the other occupations which they have left, or which they otherwise would have entered. Without prejudging, therefore, the recommendations in that part of the Com-mittee&apos;s report which deals with the suitability of the new occupations for women, it is desired here to emphasise the importance, from the point of view of the remuneration of women in industry generally, ofgiving women as wide an opportunity of employment after the war asother considerations may permit.Influence of Training on Wages.44. In the past the employment of women has in mnny directions been restricted on account of the two connected facts that no provision existed for training them to be of value in highly skilled and remunera-tive occupations, and that, if provision had been available, it would not have been profitable to utilise it. The question of training is bound up with other and larger questions of social policy. The working .and industrial life of the average woman is short owing to the fact of/
marriage. For certain reasons the employment of married women may be more common after the War than before, but such a change does not need encouragement; and, in any case, it is not likely to be so considerable as to affect the general conclusion that after the War, as before, working women will regard marriage as their proper vocation, and that in most cases, upon marriage, they will leave industry never to return. In so far as the feeling against the employment of married women is based on the view that home and children should be the noman&apos;s first concern, it is in line with the interests of the community, but if she is compelled to continue it should be under good conditions. The objection which prevails among so many working women against continuing in paid employment after marriage is sometimes due, no doubt, to the fact that their employment is often unattractive to a degree which is not inevitable. That the conditions of employment should be so improved that a woman can if necessary pursue an industrial calling throughout, her life with some maintenance of interest and keenness is obviously desirable. The consideration of these facts is necessary in order to estimate the possibilities of training as regards women. A separate section of the Report will be devoted to training, but it is necessary, in connection with remuneration, to recognise, in the first place, the limitation placed upon training by the shortness of the period hitherto spent in industry by the ordinary woman as compared with the ordinary man; and, in the second, the importance, from the point of view of women&apos;s employ-ment, of the specialisation of industry into processes that can be learnt quickly.Influence of Organisation on Wages. 45. The organisation of women workers into Trade Unions has many advantages. In this section of the report we are concerned only with its effect on wages. The War has resulted in a great accession of members to those Trade Unions that admit women and it is to be hoped&apos; that the present position will be maintained or improved. At the same time, however, it is necessary to recognise that it is impossible to rely exclusively upon organisation and collective bargaining as a means of raising wages. The time spent by women in industry is generally short and the development of a sense of industrial comradeship thus becomes difficult. That every effort should be made to combat existing difficul-ties, and to promote Trade Unionism among women, is not incompatible with a recognition that such difficulties exist.Regulation of Wages by Late. .46. But after allowing their full weight to opportunity, training and organisation, it is in the regulation of wages by law that the most immediately helpful means of bettering women&apos;s position can be found. The Committee in 1917 submitted to the Ministry of Reconstruction a Memorandum on this subject (printed in Appendix V) in which they recommended a wide extension of the Trade Boards Act. The Trade Hoards Act, 1918, has adopted some, though not all, of those recom-mendations.   Its working will be watched with expectation and hope.We have, meanwhile, to record our regret that as yet not a single new trade board has been set up, nor, save in the case of the tobacco and aerated water trades, have any Orders been issued by the Ministry of Labour. In view of the danger of the reduction of women&apos;s wages in* many occupations at the end of the war from a rate permitting a reason-able level of comfort to one insufficient for decent living, it was of the ut-most importance that the new Boards to be set up should have been ready to issue in March of this year proposals to take the place in May of the machinery of the then expiring Wages (Temporary Regulation) Act.
This Act, by permitting the Minister of Labour to alter unduly low standards of wages confers upon him temporarily the wage-fixing power of a Trade Board. Failing the establishment, before May 21st, of a sufficient number of new Boards to deal with the rate of wages in trades normally poorly paid, we are of opinion that some continuance of the present emergency arrangement will be necessary, and we recommend that the Minister of Beconstruction should at once approach the Minister of Labour on this question.Wages in Clerical and Commercial Work.47. The above observations relate alone to women in industry. Different considerations arise as regards women in clerical and coru-mercial occupations.Evidence was taken from a number of witnesses who had had considerable experience of the employment of women in clerical work,, and were strongly impressed by the abundant opportunities afforded by such work. But the Committee are equally impressed hy the great need of an improved general education, which is often sadly lacking. Technical accomplishments, such as typewriting and commercial foreign languages, can come later; the training of mind, judgment and character by education is the foundation. It is all the more importanl because combination is far more difficult and much less effective among clerical workers, working often in several establishments and under varying conditions, than it is among industrial workers aggregated in large units and doing much the same work. A glance at the success of men&apos;s trade unions of industrial compared with clerical workers will bear this out. Adequate salaries cannot be expected without education and cannot be obtained without organisation.Equal Pay for Equal Work.48. This question has lately come into increased prominence and since the Government have set up a Committee to deal with it we need no) discuss in detail the relation of women&apos;s wages to men&apos;s. At the same time there are certain general principles which ought to be stated, and. without attempting to prejudge the Beport of the Committee of the War Cabinet on Women in Industry, it is desirable to enunciate some broad considerations, both for and against, without attempting to strike a balance between them.In industry generally, where payment is by result, it might be thought that the question does not arise. It is obvious that where the worker is paid for producing any article, be it cotton goods or shells, it makes no difference whether the producer is a man or a woman and the same price should be paid for the same article. But this is not the whole story. Piece work is not entirely payment by result. Besides his piece price, the piece worker often has a guaranteed minimum which he earns indepen--dently of his production, provided he works the full week. In munitions work women have won a pieceworkers guaranteed minimum rate, and this is a material gain. It will not, we think, be disputed that this gain ought to stand, for if a worker is sufficiently skilled to be put on piece, he or she ought to receive the guaranteed time rate.The case in time work pure and simple is different. The phrase &quot; equal pay for equal work&quot; is one that avoids too many difficulties to * be of much practical value. The question what is equal work is not one which can be answered by a mere examination of the tasks which the man or the woman is called upon to perform. Speaking generally, wages will be determined by the value of the man or woman to the employer, coupled with his or her power to enforce payment. It is necessary, however, to recognise that in clerical work the forces of competition often operate sluggishly, and that there are many positions filled by both
23422men and women to which the salaries attached are not determined by the work performed. The pay is more or less conventional. The value to the employer can only be ascertained by calculating the comparative value of a male and female staff taken over a substantial period of time. The war affords a unique opportunity for such an assessment. For example, the London Omnibus Companies could give valuable evidence of the replacement value of women to men and the effect which the employment of women has had on the efficiency and productivity of the service. Upon a matter such as this it is possible to assess the wage values of the employees, but in many other employments the decision is more intricate and requires a longer period and the consideration of more remote factors. The capacity of one sex or the other to meet emergencies or unexpected pressure of work, their greater or lesser tendency to illness, and the value attached on the one hand to the greater stability of a male staff or to the peculiar attributes of a female staff on the other, are all considerations which must be taken into account in determining their relative value. The subject is one upon which no off-hand opinion can be given, beyond the obvious one that there should be no discrimination against women as women.Conclusions as to Equal Pay for Equal Work.49. But there are other considerations besides those of value to the employer which may be held to determine wage value. Genera] prin-ciples of human equity may be considered to operate. Upon this it is apposite to point out that if fairness to the employed is taken as the criterion it may well be the case that equal pay discriminates unequally between men and women. A fair wage for a man is reckoned with reference to one who has a famiry of normal size. For the time being the man with no family is placed at an advantage and the man with an exceptionally large one at a disadvantage. The wage should be settled \vith regard to the needs of the normal case. Now as regards women, the normal case is not that of the woman with several dependants, and it is not with reference to her that the notion of fairness must be examined. The normal case is the single woman, and by giving her equal pay with the man you might effect the appearance of equality without the fact. From this, certain important consequences, by no means to the advantage of women, might ensue. In competition with men, women might be ousted, or, where they were employed, a higher social grade than that of the men might be brought in. Or, lastly, if the strict letter of equality ivere insisted on and work were found for the women, it might result in the real wages of the women largely exceeding those of the men.On the other hand, it is arguable that even were women knocked out by equality, this might in the long run be in the interests of women themselves as well as that of the State. If the inferiority of women were one that could be remedied by training, as in many instances is the case, girls might be encouraged to fit themselves better for a career and the Government might be forced into providing the necessary facilities. Thus the raising of the standard against women would not in the long run operate to their disadvantage.Also the granting of equal pay for apparently equal work is not only a standard simple to enforce, but corresponds as well to an instinctive sense of equity and justice; and this principle alone gives hope of the final settlement of that old feud between men and women workers which is inspired by the fear of under-cutting. It may not meet every individual case. But we confess that we can find no other working principle. Further, it appears to us that anything less than equal occupational rates (known colloquially as &quot; the
same rate for the job &quot;) for men and women on time work would tend to undermine the whole basis of collective bargaining and re-act injuriously on the standard of life built up by organised effort.Equal Pay in Clerical and, Commercial Occupations.50. On the whole it is suggested, without, as has been said, attempting to prejudge the decision of the Committee on Women in Industry, that where the work is ostensibly the same the starting wage should be the same for men and women: and that when wages increase automatically according to age or service the increases should be the same for both. Then differentiation by merit and not by sex would come in at a later stage when capacity to rise to special responsibility and to perform work of specialised character had declared itself. There are fewer incon-veniences in the long run in basing a payment on the worker&apos;s value to the employer than on any other standard. When their abilities and capacities are untried let them start on equal terms. After that let there be a fair field and no favour. That is not only logical and fair, but, in the long run, in women&apos;s interests also. He must take a gloomy view of woman&apos;s industrial future who does not believe that, though there are many occupations in which men excel women, there are also many, and these not the least dignified or well paid, in which women excel men.Wages in Home Work and Agriculture.51. Home Work, with its specialised and difficult wage problems, is dealt with in paras. 136-144 and Agriculture is treated in paras. 35-3G.Summary *of Recommendations as to Remuneration.52. Organisation is of chief importance in securing ade-quate wages; more general and better organisation is therefore recommended. In addition, sufficient training for industry and, in the case of unorganised workers, a large extension of Trade Boards are thought to be necessary. The Committee^ suggestions on the regulation of wages by law have already been presented (see. Appendix V).Recommendations as to Truck.53. In dealing with the conditions of employment for women, the Committee feel that they cannot disregard the important question of the Truck Acts.The amendment of these Acts, by which fines and deductions are regulated, was considered by a Departmental Committee which reported in 1908 and took a large amount of evidence showing the serious effect of the fining system and of many customary deductions on the earnings of women and the drawbacks of the &quot; living-in &quot; system for shop-assistants. There was both a Majority and Minority Report, the latter recommending complete abolition of all fines and deductions, while the former would have had them strictly limited by law. Since the Committee reported, the customs of fining and &quot;living-in,&quot; which were already being abandoned by a certain number of firms, have fallen further into&apos; disuse, and we suggest that the time is now ripe for consideration of a Bill dealing with fines, deductions and the &quot; living-in &quot; system for shop-assistants, drafted on the lines of the Minority Report.
423B. Hours.54. In the re-settlement of industry, the question of working hours is scarcely, if at all, of less importance than that of remuneration. It is possible to conceive a system of industrial organisation in which high wages should be paid and yet, under protracted and excessive hours of employment, the workers would reap little benefit from their improved pecuniary position. Unless increased purchasing power in ;uch material things as food and clothing is correlated with an amount of leisure giving opportunity for improved education, wholesome recreation, family life, and time for study and exercise of the duties of citizenship, the reconsideration of women&apos;s industrial position will not have advanced far.Present Legal Restrictions on Women&apos;$ Labour.55. At present the only restrictions imposed by law on women&apos;s labour are:  I. In all factories, except textile factories, 12 hours a day for five days a week, with 1  hours for meals, and eight hours on Saturdays, with half an hour off for meals. Therefore, the normal weekly hours worked cannot exceed 60, excluding meal times.II. In textile factories the hours are half an hour a day shorter, making a net weekly total of 55 A. For both textile and non-textile factories the daily periods must be between fixed limits, for example, 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., or 7 a.m. and 7 p.ni,, and be specified in a notice affixed in the works.III. Sunday labour is forbidden.IV. XSTo spell must exceed five hours, or, in textile factories, 4  hours.V. In certain industries two hours&apos; overtime on three days in the week is allowed on not more than 30 days in the year. VI. Night employment is forbidden, except within the limits of permitted overtime. VII. Laundries. One hour&apos;s overtime may be worked on any three days a week, provided a corresponding reduction is made on the other days; or, alternatively, overtime may be worked on not more than four days weekly or 60 days in any year.VIII. Shops. Before the Act of 1912, the only restriction was that young persons under 18 could not be employed for more than 74 hours a week, including meal times. That Act adds further restrictions. A weekly half holiday and specified intervals for meals are now compulsory; nor can an assistant be employed for more than six hours without at least 20 minutes&apos; rest.All these restrictions can be relaxed or removed in factories and work-shops by the Home Secretary &quot;in case of any public emergency.&quot; They have been relaxed during the war, but under stringent conditions.Movement before the War for Shorter Hours. 56. Already before the war there was a considerable movement of opinion and practice in favour of shortening hours in many of those trades in which women were chiefly employed. In textile industries, indeed, with the exception of a few localities such as Dunfermline, where a shorter day had been introduced, custom still went hand in hand with regulation in maintaining the maximum limits permitted by
the Factory Act; but in some of tbe most important non-textile trades employing women a mucb shorter day and week than the law allows was frequently worked. For instance, the 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday to Friday, with 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, was common in the clothing trade. Even in the laundry industry, to which the Act of 1907 per-mitted more overtime and greater elasticity in arrangements of its day and week than was considered necessary for other trades, the federated employers were for several years before 1914 pressing in the direction of stricter regulations and shorter hours, and were only deterred from taking definite action in this direction by fear of undercutting on the part of the smaller occupiers, especially those controlling workshop laundries who remained outside their Association.Other modifications of the existing system of regulation were freely canvassed and recommended alike by enlightened employers, by the representatives of organised labour, and by the workers themselves. These included the assimilation of the textile and non-textile day and week, the abolition of pre-breakfast work, and the shortening of the five hours spell, which had long been felt and found in practice to be too long, both for health and efficiency of output.A Note on Hours actually worked before the war so far as information is available is contained in Appendix VI.57. The period of the war, with its introduction of over a million new women into industries and the transference of many hundreds of thousands more from women&apos;s trades to those of men, with the conse-quent engagement of women in numerous occupations which before August, 1914, would have been considered too heavy and too arduous for them, has offered unique opportunity for observation of the effects of hours of employment. While dilution, especially in munition works, and direct substitution in many non-munition industries alike necessi-tated cautious procedure in the introduction of women into unfamiliar processes frequently involving severe physical strain, urgent national needs formed a frequent argument for long hours and overtime and speedily led to relaxation of such prohibitions as the employment of women and young persons on Sunday and at night. The Emergency Orders granted in the earlier period of the war were necessarily expeii-mental, and were based, not only on the pressing demand of the great war departments, but also on the situation of employers suddenly called upon to be war contractors on a great scale before they had had a chance of organising themselves &quot;efficiently on a war basis. Some of these relaxations were granted with reluctance and as an emergency measure only. This is specially true of Sunday labour. The system of shifts was introduced, and, as industrial organisation improved and experience grew, it was seen that different shift systems were appropriate to different trades and to different factories in the same trade. The General Munition Order took full advantage of this experience, and with the series of General Orders for non-textile trades as a whole and for certain non-munition industries in particular, has enabled very valuable data to be gathered in respect of these differing systems of employment.Results of War Experience. 58. Before proceeding to consider the principles which should govern the regulation of hours after the war, it may be useful to enumerate certain general questions on which war experience appears to have given a clear answer.(a) The evidence against the seven-day week was overwhelming, and it speedily became a matter of public policy to restrain such employ-ment within the narrowest limits, possible.
(b) Sunday work, compensated by a day off during the week, was found necessary during tbe war to meet urgent needs. But there is bo reason to suppose that similar needs will exist after the period of reconstruction, and at its close Sunday employment should be forbidden. Apart from all questions of religious observance, Sunday employment with, a compensating day off is highly undesirable, owing to its inevit-able effect on family life. For the working community, and especially for manual labourers, Sunday is the only day in the week in which a full reunion of the family is possible.(c) While there is not sufficient evidence to establish where conditions ire good, and night employment is not continuous, any marked dele-;erious effect upon the health or output of women workers due to employ-aent on night shifts, we desire to point out that the comparatively short time during which night work for women has been permitted uakes it impossible to draw final conclusions on this point. As regards continuous night employment there is such evidence. The general arguments against night employment of women remain unimpaired, and are:  (1) The industries in which night work is customary in normal times involve for the most part either hot, heavy or laborious work generally unsuitable to women, or solitary operations sometimes carried on in isolated shops.(2) The fact that, with the exception of munition workers, the majority of the women engaged on night shift were employed as. unskilled labourers only.(3) The moral risk, especially where there is co-employment of the sexes in large, scattered works, where parts of the processes are carried on out of doors, or under special circumstances of heat and stress, rendering such co-employment unsuitable, or the works themselves are situated at a distance from the workers&apos; homes.(4) Physical strain imposed by lack of opportunity, in many working-class homes, for proper rest and sleep during the day-time, increased in the case of practically all married women and of many who are unmarried, by the necessity of depriving themselves deliberately of such rest in order to perform their domestic duties.(d) War experience has confirmed the well-established view that the we hours unbroken spell is too long for women, and war experiment aay be said to have established the value as regards health, content and efficiency alike, of short breaks for rest and refreshment during spells )f five hours and even shorter duration.(e) The movement against pre-breakfast work has gained in strength, king reinforced by the fact that vast numbers of workers during war-:ime production travelled to their factory from long distances, leaving wme an hour or more and often rising two hours before the nominal forking day begins; and, if pre-breakfast work is abolished, for the same reason, the commencing hour should not be too early. Professor Love-iay, in his Memorandum on the Causes and Conditions of Lost Time, published by the Health of Munition Workers Committee and quoted in their Final Report,* gives strong arguments against pre-breakfast* Cd. 9065, 1918, paras. 153-154.
work. His conclusions, summarised in the Final Report of the Health of Munition Workers Committee, are as follows:  That when the total hours of the day shift week are -the same, there are likely to be more hours actually worked without than with work before breakfast, other conditions being similar.That a reduction of hours may be compensated for or even out weighed by the abolition of early hours, partly owing to reduced absences, partly owing to reduced waste of time, and partly to the greater vigour of work after taking food. (/) Continuous overtime is undesirable in the interests of health and of production itself.   While it is true that the better wages earned by industrial women during the war, with their consequence in better food, clothing and general comfort, have apparently proved a set-off against the very long hours which many such women have worked over a considerable period, it must not be forgotten that the number of hours of overtime worked in the factory does not by any means represent those put in by the individual worker.   The expert enquiries of the Health of Munition Workers Committee show  that,  where the hours are abnormally long, the workers have effectually protected themselves up to a certain point by bad time-keeping, and more or less regular taking of days off apart from absence caused by sickness, and they have done this, not from laziness, but from what the Final Report of the Health of Munition Workers Committee calls &quot; physiological self-protection.&quot;* It is as yet too soon to judge of the effects, either temporary or per-ruanent, of the strain of prolonged hours upon health.(g) War experience has emphasized the value of a weekly- halt-holiday, which should always be on Saturday, save in exceptional circumstances. We are further of opinion that an annual fortnights holiday with pay, as customary in the case of salaried employees, should form part of the conditions of employment in the case of all women wage earners.(h) The closer enquiry into the circumstances of women workers in such matters as housing and transit, which war-time conditions necessitated, made plain to the nation at large the undue and perilous strain to which such women are subjected when to long hours of work is added the fatigue of a considerable journey night and morn-ing, and, in the case of many-, heavy and responsible domestic duties and bad housing conditions. Transit also became increasingly both slow and bad. Further, the public interest in safeguarding the health and&apos; strength of employed women, who constitute or will con-stitute so large a part of the mothers of the race has been quickened and informed by war losses and the serious considerations of the national future.(;&apos;) The excessively long hours worked during the earlier part of the war not only did not increase but in rnany cases diminished output. The investigations of Dr. Vernon made for the Health of Munition Workers Committee show that in certain processes shorter hours mean larger output. His reports are summarized in the Final Report! of the Health of Munition Workers Committee as follows:  &quot; Speaking generally-, the above dafaj show that a reduction in the weekly hours of actual work varying from 7 to 20 hours per week, in no case resulted in more than an insignificant reduction of total output, while on the average it produced a substantial increase.   .   .   .   The exact measure of such alterations (in hours* Cd. 9065,1918, para. 68.        f Co. 8344 and Cd. 8628. % 2d. 9065, 1918, para. 151.
worked) cannot be predicted; it can only be ascertained by observa-tion and experiment. It appears evident, however, that for processes similar to those examined by Dr. Vernon the weekly hours can advantageously be reduced to a total of from 50 to 55 hours, and he suggests that even lower limits might give an equally good output.&quot;Suggested Reduction of Legal Maximum Hours.59. The present legal maximum under the Factory Acts is therefore entirely out of date. It is not regarded in practice; for actual hours worked are considerably lower, war experience favours a further reduc-3on, and some employers are reducing hours even further still. The government accordingly should at once institute enquiries to ascer-;ain whether a substantial lowering of legal hours is not possible. It appears to the Committee that a reasonable working week for women rill be found to consist in about 44 hours&apos; actual work, excluding meal lines. These hours could be spread over the week, as agreed between employer and employed, either as an eight hour day on the first five jays and four hours on Saturday; or over a week of five days, leavingjSaturday free, eight hours being worked on Monday and nine each on(die four following days; or in some other manner. It is stated that die five day week is actually now being worked in a few instances and is extremely popular. Be that as it may, the 44 hour limit, or what-ever the figure may be, should be regarded as one ultimately represent-iug total hours worked, and overtime should be reduced to a minimum. It is recognised that this cannot be done at once, and for the present the overtime allowed by the Factory Acts should continue. But it is little use relaxing hours without at the same time strictly regulating overtime; for otherwise the attraction of the higher rate paid for over-dine might result in actual hours worked not being reduced.   TheIgoal to be aimed at, therefore, is to fix a working week which eventuallyjwill not be exceeded unless for exceptional trades.It should be remembered, in this connection, that the movement in favour of shorter hours is not confined to this country. At the Inter-Allied Labour Conference held in February, 1918, the demand for a maximum week of 48 hours was urged both by the French and the American delegates, and unanimously adopted as one of the objects to be secured at the Peace Conference.-   I Question of continued Shift System.e     60. With the cessation of the war and the gradual restoration of Hpeace conditions, the present Emergency Orders of the Secretary of ^BState authorising the employment of women on the shift system will lin the ordinary course come to an end.   The question of continuing the HBpower of allowing employment on this system, so far as day work is IjHeoncerned, is one that will require consideration not only in respect Hoi&apos; the transition period, but afterwards.   It is a matter of common Knowledge that many emplov-ers in different districts and trades (of ill whom Lord Leverhulme is probably the best known) are anxious to Ijlobtain sanction for a continuance of this system.   The argument for [Jits continuance where required during the transition period of de-JBmobilization and re-settlement, and so long as essential industries are 111 hampered in production by a shortage of male labour, is strong.   The further question is, however, raised whether it would not be in the t I National interests, as well as in that of many women workers, if a
system of two short shifts (to be worked between certain fixed hours&apos; could be sanctioned, in suitable cases, for normal times. We are of opinion that this proposal should be carefully considered for the foliow-ing reasons:  (1) A system of two short day shifts would help to absorb con-siderable quantities of surplus trained women labour, and so ease the pressure on the labour market and diminish the danger of widespread unemployment. This argument opplies with special force to areas where, although con-siderable numbers of women have been engaged in munitions or other war manufacture during the past three or four years, there is normally very little, industrial employment for women.(2) It would sensibly increase production, with a reduction of overhead charges a matter of special importance in the case of essential products and the export trades.(3) It would afford a passage to the shortening of hours.Choice of Localities for Aew Industries.61. While the absorption of the great army of women war worker-into peace trades will everywhere present certain difficulties, these difficulties must necessarily be most acute in those industrial centres which have no women&apos;s trades, and offer little or no opportunity of regular industrial employment to women. There are a number of districts, especially in the north of England, where at present an outlet for the energies of women and girls trained io industry during the war is almost wholly lacking. We suggest that the present serious position of demobilised women living in such districts would be greatly helped if, where it is possible, their towns or areas were selected as the hone of &quot;key&quot; or other new industries definitely requiring a substantial amount of women&apos;s labour in some departments, and we would ask that, in choosing sites, this argument in favour of certain places should be given careful consideration.The Improvement of the Woman Worker&apos;s Position.62. How can women&apos;s position be bettered, while preserving to them opportunities of extended, fresh and more intelligent employment which the war has &apos;given them and opening out to them new fields of usefulness along lines in which, in their work of helping to save the nation in its extremity, they have proved themselves fitted to labour? Two alternative lines of action suggest themselves, since it is clear that in the altered industrial world of &quot; after the war,&quot; there can be no return with any hope of success, industrial or social, to the old system which prevailed before it and was the outgrowth of a state of things which has largely passed away. With women employed, as they will still continue to he employed, in industries which involve a great variety of processes and conditions, working side by side with men, it is obvious, to quote the words of the Health of Munition Workers Committee in their Memorandum No. 20, that &quot; the best scheme can only be determined after a careful consideration of a number of different factors.&quot; The-c are well summed up by the Committee :(a) The strain involved in the work, its character (heavy or light.continuous or intermittent) and the mental demand whichit makes upon the worker;
(6) The extent to which the pace of the work is governed by the machine;(c) The factory environment, temperature, ventilation and such-like ;(d) The individual physical capacity of the workers, and their age, sex and experience;(e) The organisation of the factory (including welfare supervision); (/) The sufficiency and suitability of the workers&apos; food, canteen andrest accommodation; (3O The arrangement of the hours of work (spells, breaks and pauses);(h) Conditions outside the factory, such as housing and transit.Regulation by Law or Selj^Determination?63. Hours can be regulated in two ways. Either the Department concerned must lay down minute regulations for each trade and often for various processes within the trade which may and generally does provide occupation, skilled and unskilled, heavy and light, arduous arid pleasant for different sets and classes of workers; or we must frankly admit the principle of self-determination. This last is the line on which movement is actually taking place. In face of the whole trend of industrial feeling and action there is no doubt that it is in giving as large play as possible to the latter principle that the hope of real reconstruction lies. If no complete machinery exists at present, still a large part of the ground&apos; can be covered. Where a substantial majority of an industry or section of an industry, both employers and workers, are agreed on a modification either of hours of employment or 01 conditions, they should have power within statutory limits, subject to the Government&apos;s assent, to make them binding on the whole trade. It should not any longer be possible for a minority in an industry to hold up a general movement towards the improvement of the condi-tions of that industry. That principle has olready been recognised in the closing provision of the Shops Act. What machinery should be established for this purpose requires very careful consideration, and will vary according to the degree of organisation reached by the industry. It is not within our province to make any specific proposals on the point, but the Whitley Councils where they exist, and Trade Boards where they do not, offer an obvious machinery.The procedure for giving effect to the agreed proposals would naturally follow the same lines as the procedure in the existing Factory, Shops and other Acts by which regulations are made for industries or occupations. The proposals should be submitted to the Department concerned for confirmation. Notice of them could be published and an opportunity given for the submission of objections. The objections, if any, would be considered by the Department, and if necessary an enquiry held with regard to them. Finally, the proposals, if approved, should he embodied in a Statutory Order, which would be laid before Parliament and would have the force of law. It is necessary that the machinery should be simple, so that when it is decided that a change in the terms of the Order is desirable it may be canned through expeditiously.It might be desirable that the Departmental Authority should itself take power to initiate enquiries with a view to the formulation of pro-P;)sals, something on the lines of the provision contained in Section 7 of the Shops Act, 1912. Such a power would be useful, particularly in the tess highly organised trades.
Advantages of Self-Determination.64. Tlie plan proposed, of allowing all trades a large measure of self-determination as regards hours, would have many advantages. It would meet the desire of the workpeople, including the women, to have a deciding voice in their conditions of employment, of which hours and the leisure dependent on them are among the most important; it would prevent a minority holding back a trade from carrying out improvements desired by the majority; it would facilitate the adjustment of men&apos;s and women&apos;s work in industries where both sexes are in common employment; it would enable a nicer relation of hours, breaks and spells to different types of work to be established and maintained than could be effected by the unassisted action of a Government Department; it would retain both the limiting power of the Department and its administrative authority, and lastly it would encourage experiment in the economic value idf still shorter hours and make progress more rapid.Need for Scientific Investigation.65. The war has shown that the laws which govern industrial fatigue have been and still are very imperfectly understood. The investigations which were in progress before and have been carried on during the war have considerably advanced our knowledge, but many of the conclusions reached are necessarily provisional and many important questions are still undetermined. Whatever method of regulating the hours and other conditions of employment in industry is adopted, regulation, if it is to be scientific and give the best results, must be based on knowledge of the laws which govern fatigue. We are glad to know that at the instance of the Home Office an Industrial Fatigue Research Board has been appointed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research jointly with the Medical Research Committee to consider and investigate the relations of the hours of labour and of other conditions of eniploy-ment, including methods of work, to the production of fatigue, having regard both to industrial efficiency and to the preservation of health among the workers; and we recommend that some public body of this kind should be established on a permanent basis. We are strongly of opinion that the membership of any such body should include women, properly qualified by knowledge and experience to take part in its labours.Hours in Commerce and Clerical Work.66. So far we have dealt only with the hours of employment of women in industry. The question of regulation of hours in commercial and clerical employment remains for consideration.Shops.67. The Government included proposals for the limitation of hours of employment and regulation of other conditions of employment in shops in the Shops Bill of 1911. Owing to the difficult questions to which they gave rise and the pressure on Parliamentary time, these provisions, with the exception of the half holiday and meal times provision, had to be dropped. The war has greatly strengthened the case for regulation, and has also seen a substantial reduction in hours worked. Large numbers of women have been introduced to do the work previously done by men, both inside and outside the shop, including work which before the war would have been thought too heavy for women, but which, with careful selection, and under proper conditions, they have shown themselves quite capable of undertaking, and it is certain that much of this work will continue to be done by women after the war.
Recommendations as to Shops.68. Except for the limitation of the hours of trading under the Shops ict, there is no legal limitation on the hours which may be worked by remen in shops. If a spell of more than six hours is worked, there must se an interval of at least 20 minutes. For workers living in, the time riven for meals need not exceed f hour.We consider that there is no reason why less protection should be ifforded to workers in shops than to those in factories, and we recom-nend that the provisions of the Factory Acts with regard to hours, with the amendments we have suggested above, should be applied to shops.A further point arises with regard to fines and to sanitary conditions. it present no Government authority has power to improve the conditions rith regard to fines. Further the law with regard to the enforcement jf the provisions of Section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amendment ict, 1890, is far from clear.We think that the Factory Department should, while the system of fines continues, have the same power to deal with offences against the Truck Act in shops as they have at present in factories and workshops, and re recommend that provisions to this effect should be inserted in the Truck Act.With regard to the administration of the law with regard to hours of work, and sanitary conditions, we think that closer co-ordination diould be ensured between the local authorities and the Factory Depart-aient. Without proposing to take from the local authorities powers which have already been confided to them by Parliament, we think that these powers should be carried on under the supervision and with the advice of the Department concerned. We suggest that this object could he satisfactorily attained with the minimum of friction if a grant-in-aid were paid to the local authorities, dependent upon any conditions which the Government mig-ht see fit to attach to the grant.Clerical Work.69. Women&apos;s employment in clerical work has been revolutionized by the war. To a far greater extent even than in the distributive trades, women have been introduced to do the work of men in almost every branch of clerical work. It seems probable that much of the work will be retained by them after the war.We have had little information laid before us as to the conditions of employment in clerical occupations; and owing to the great variety of clerical work, and the numerous grades existing in the calling, any enquiry into the subject would be a complex and difficult matter.The great increase in the employment of women makes it desirable that the conditions under which the work is done should be suitable for them, and there is not any doubt that in many instances these are entirely unsuitable.Eegulation of hours- obviously presents difficulties. Especially in the higher branches of clerical work, if women are to be able to compete pa equal terms with men, statutory restriction may not be possible, but it is desirable that the above question, which has never yet been fully investigated, should be explored and further enquiry is needed.Conclusions as to Hours.&apos;0. In conclusion, we wish to point out that, while our recommenda-tions based on war experience take specific account of arguments pro-ceeding from considerations of physical health and economic efficiency, we by no means confine them, in so far as they support a reduction of22391 c
hours, to these material considerations. Physical well-being is not the whole of life, and mere productivity is not even the major part of it. A system of long hour employment, carried on under good hygienic condi-tions and by means of labour-saving appliances, might fail to undermine the health of the workers and leave them economically efficient, while it deprived them of the leisure necessary for their development as human beings or usefulness as members of a family and as citizens. It is the task of those who have to reconstruct our industrial system to see to it that the human rights and needs of the workers receive at least equal consideration with the conditions that fit them to maintain their place in the industrial machine. And, if this be important in the case of all workers, it is especially so in the case of women workers, on whom is laid the double task of supplying the economic needs of the nation and caring for the future of the race in the persons of the nation&apos;? children; nor must it be forgotten that long hours worked by women will have an evil reaction on those worked by men.71. Finally, it should not be forgotten that legal regulation can never do alb that is required unless supported by enlightened public opinion; for advance is made through experiment, by employers or by workmen. Already there are signs of the possibility of a working day far shorter than the legal maximum and shorter even than the eight hour day. So experienced an employer as Lord Leverhulme has already advocated a six hour day, and has defended it on economic grounds. The Ministry of Munitions, too, made an experiment of a 50 hour week, to include all overtime in selected Government factories.* Experiments such as these are to be welcomed. They may lead to a greater reduction in hours than at present appears possible.Summary of Recommendations as to Hours. 72. The relaxation of the Factory Acts allowed during war should cease at its termination and excessive over-time, long spells, night work and Sunday work should he forbidden. There is a prima facie case for a reduction in legal maximum hours, in overtime, and in the length of the spell, and for the abolition of work before breakfast, and the Government should immediately institute en quiries with a view to amending the Factory Acts. W: recommend the possibility of a 44-hours working week and an annual fortnighfs holiday on full pay for the con-sideration of the Government. Trades should be allowed within statutory limits, to settle their own hours, subject to Government sanction^ a substantial majority having power to bind the minority. Further information u urgently needed as to hours worked in offices, and this should be enquired into. A new Shops Act is required to limit the existing excessively long hours and excessively long spells. Government Factories should make experr ments to see whether a working day much shorter than a! present is not economically possible, and private enr ployers should be urged to follow suit.C. Welfare.73. War experience has hastened that demand for a higher standard within the workplace which was making itself strongly felt before the war began.   For years past the trend of factory legislation and the* See Final Report of Health of Munition Workers Committee, Cd. 9065 of 1918, para. 160.
practice of the best employers alike had been gradually growing more constructive. The law, no longer confined to prohibition and penalty, was an instrument of positive betterment, and its prescriptions were taken as models and frequently outrun by factory owners. At the same time, care for the worker&apos;s health and wellbeing became more personal : whereas the older law had been mainly directed to the protection of the workers as a mass, the newer took increasing account of individual risk and danger. These tendencies appeared mainly in the Statutory Orders issued by the Secretary of State under the Factory Acts for the regula-tion of dangerous and unhealthy trades. The making of regulations provided from time to time valuable opportunities for experiment in constructive industrial legislation; similar and often much larger experi-ments in what came to be known as Welfare work were made by enlightened employers engaged in the more normal industries; and thus there had been created, before 1914, a considerable public opinion in favour of a fresh legislative advance which should cover the whole field of industry by amendment of the Factory Acts.74. The time for such an advance was already ripe when the war broke upon us and indefinitely enlarged the field of experiment. The orgari-isation of vast war industries, the substitution of women for men in a great number of trades and operations, the co-employment of men and women under abnormal conditions of place and time and in circum-stances of special risk and urgency, served to make the lesson that was being slowly learned in peace an accepted doctrine with the nation at large after two years of war. Provision for munition workers of all those things which are commonly summed up under the comprehensive term &quot;Welfare&quot; is now generally approved. It is held right that such workers should have dining rooms and canteens, washing accommo-dation and cloakrooms, that protective clothing should&apos; be provided for such of them as work among machinery or in dirty, dusty, or wet processes, that there should be ambulance rooms where their hurts may he dressed in case of accident and rest rooms where they can find quiet and appropriate treatment if they are taken ill. War work, on the greatest scale, is, however, but a passing episode in the history of industry. Should what are known a.s Welfare conditions not only sur-vive, but become general in time of peace ?The answer is clear. The provisions for cleanliness, health and comfort, which obtained in many controlled factories during the war, should be the ordinary accompaniments of factory life. This principle underlies that section of the Police, Factories, &amp;c. (Miscellaneous 1&apos;rovisions) Act, 1916, which gives power to the Home Secretary, by Statutory Order, to make such provision obligatory on any trade, or factory, or classes of factories. The Act is a A&apos;aluable one, and the Government should use it to raise the standard of factory conditions in general, and more especially in those places where, as in the cotton industry, it is. notoriously low. While it is true that, in the earlier stages of Welfare work, factory inspectors can often do more by per-snasion than compulsion, there is no doubt that their counsels gain force and weight by association with their legal compulsory powers. In the case of employers whose standard is low, all attempt at improved conditions must begin with enforcement of the Factory Acts, which can only be secured by its steady administration, involving careful use by the factory inspectors of their powers to compel, if necessary, by prosecution.It should be noted that, since the object of Welfare work is to provide healthv and satisfactory conditions, and this provision is as necessary for men as for women (though in some instances the nature of the 22391 0 2
conditions required may be different) there is no ground for the theory that employers are justified in making Welfare conditions a charge upon wages in the case of women, and in paying them, for this reason, less than men similarly employed. The same remark holds good of the labour-saving appliances by which certain work of women has been facilitated during the war period. We are of opinion that in many cases such appliances should have been brought into use long ago for the benefit of men doing like work, and we regard it as important, both from the point of view of the worker&apos;s health and convenience and from that! of increasing output, that labour-sav/ing machinery should be supplied in the case of both sexes, under such safeguards as organized workers may consider necessary.Sphere of, Employer, Employed and State in determining Conditions.75. Compulsion, the ultimate action of the State, should follow when experiment has shown the way.   The main forces making for progress are, and must always be, the investigation of the man of science coupled with enlightened administration, the action of the employer, and the aspirations of the worker.   Factory conditions should remain the object of instructed enquiry in peace, as they have always been by the Home Office, and were during the war by that department and by the Health of Munition Workers Committee.   This being granted:, employer and employed between them, instructed by knowledge and guided by the State, will, both by separate and by common action, work out their own salvation and raise the health and happiness of the workers as well as their efficiency to a height which to-day seems Utopian.   Employers should make it part of their business to study Welfare questions as they study cost of production: workers, both through trade unions and shop committees, should strive for better conditions with the intensity with which they have striven for better Avages.   Both are moving to a goal which is identical.   Their separate action can do much; but perhaps more can be done by joint conferences between the two.   These should be a part of the regular machinery of business.   Occasionally, too, con-ferences should be called and supervised by a factory inspector, who would direct their discussions with a mind at once impartial, experienced and trained.   Then, when the road is planned out, when an enlightened opinion has been formulated, when the industry concerned has shown the way, let the State step in with the compulsory orders so as to stabilise and make universal conditions which have been tried and found success-ful in the best workshops.   Compulsion is the corporate action of the community, making universal that which experiment has proved to be right.   This is the best method.   It grants self-determination to each industry, and allows each to be master of its own fate; it is flexible enough to meet the great differences between trade and trade, and be-tween shop and shop; and when its decrees have to be made universal by compulsion they rest on the largest measure of consent.Women must Serve on Slwp Committees.76. It is essential that Shop Committees regulating conditions should contain full and fair representation of organized women on the lines recommended by the Whitley Committee. Owing to defective organ-ization it is possible that at first special steps must be taken to secure this.
Overlapping of Home Office and Ministry of Munitions.77. During the war administration was complicated by the fact that it was partly in the hands of the Home Office and partly in those of the Ministry of Munitions, whose jurisdiction overlapped at many points. Such dualism must, even where every precaution is taken to avoid friction and to delimit spheres a matter of considerable difficulty with a moving boundary line result in waste of time, effort and money. War conditions and the gigantic activities of the Ministry of Munitions may have made a dual system inevitable while the war lasted, but the argument for a single administrative authority in normal times is irresistible.The Future of the Factory Department.78. In considering the present position and its probable developments, we have constantly kept in mind the relation to both of the Factory Department of the Home Office. For twenty years past the work of the Department has been becoming increasingly scientific, requiring in its inspectors growing expert knowledge of such matters as fencing, by giene, ventilation and prevention of industrial disease. War experience and war necessities have confirmed the conviction already established that progress lies in this direction, and that post-war industry demands considerable re-organization and strengthening of the inspectorate on the technical and research sides. With the growth of the spirit and practice of self-regulation in industry, the establishment of Industrial Councils and Works Committees, and development of action by the workers themselves in determining the conditions of their labour, it may be hoped that the work of the inspectors in detecting irregularities and dealing with infringements of the Acts will be reduced, while their constructive functions as expert advisers become increasingly important. We, therefore, lay stress on re-organization and scientific development within the Factory Department, if possible, even more than on increase of its numbers, which by itself would do little to fit the Department for its responsibilities in relation to the complicated and self-conscious industry of the future. These observa-tions do not prejudice the question raised in the Report of the Machinery of Government Committee as to a possible re-arrangement of functions among Ministries, since the recommendations they imply are and will remain applicable, whatever the Government Department charged to carry them out.Position of Superintendent.79. The position of the Welfare Superintendent is. a vexed and difficult one of great importance both to employers and workers, not to speak of the&apos; superintendent herself, but one which should not be allowed to overshadow the general problem of the improvement of industrial conditions. This position has been largely created by the pressure of the times, the urgency of output, the organization of new works, the experiments of substitution and dilution, the importation of great masses of women labour. It is undefined, depending everywhere on the goodwill of the employer, often largely on the personality of the individual woman who holds it; in one factory the superintendent may he treated as an associate of the management, with full powers of engagement, dismissal and discipline, as well as of initiation in Welfare matters; in another she is a mere overseer of cloakrooms and messrooms;22391 C 3
in a third, a head forewoman, whos.e main business is to see that the level of output is maintained. Her activities may be strictly confined to the factory or extended to a multitude of questions and activities outside it. There is no accepted standard of qualification for a super-intendent; the employer appoints whom he will. In so doing he exercises his undoubted right, and there would have been less cause for complaint than for regret when he made an unsuitable appointment, if a claim had not been generally- set up that the Welfare Superinten-dent was to be regarded as the workers&apos; friend. Much difficulty and friction would have been avoided had her relation to the firm, as it-agent and employee, been frankly recognized from the first. Lack oi such recognition has frequently, it is to be feared, obscured in the mind; of the workers the excellence of the work done by certain Welfare superintendents in making their factory life, under great difficulties, not only tolerable but comfortable, even as it has increased their resent-ment in cases of tactless treatment or what wa,s felt to be unwarrantable interference with individual private affairs.Supervision whether called Welfare supervision or not  is bound to continue after the war. Apart from the fact that, in a large mixec1 factory, a woman superintendent authorized to receive complaints, to enquire into grievances and causes of dismissal, to assist at some point in the engaging, if she does not actually engage, the labour of women and girls, is obviously7 needed, on grounds of health and for the protec tion of the workers, the civilization of industry by the introduction oi a higher standard of conditions involves also the maintenance of these conditions by a proper staff, and this staff must have a trained head It is necessary, therefore, to consider what steps are to be taken h remove causes of friction, and so to modify the existing situation tha a healthy7 relation, free alike from sentimentalism and suspicion, ma\ be created between superintendent and workers.Superintendent should form Part of Management.80. This can only7 be done by7 defining the superintendents positioi more clearly and associating her definitely with the employing- firm It is of importance that she should be associated with both the engage ment and dismissal of women employees. Unless she has these powers her status is likely to be unsatisfactory. She must enjoy manageria status. The alternative proposals that she should be either a Stat official or a nominee of the workers are open to such obvious and over whelming objection that it is unnecessary to discuss them. In Stat and National Factories, however, Government would appoint Superb tendents, but it would do so, not as Government, but as owner o manager.Not only the status, but the duties of the superintendent must he defined. In particular, it should be made plain that her function is circumscribed by the walls of the factory7, and that she is not to follow the workers to their homes, enquire into their circumstances or attempt to interfere with their private lives. Under war conditions, such activities on the part of a capable and sympathetic Welfare supervisor have frequently been inevitable, and have resulted directly from her fitness to deal with an abnormal situation. Safe lodgings had to be found for women brought from homes miles away, very young and friendless country girls protected against the unknown dangers of large towns, cases of sickness that might otherwise have gone untended visited and cared for. But with the return of peace these special conditions are passing away, and justification for the stretching of authority to
430times and places outside the hours and area of employment no longer exists. Possibly when any Order is made under the Police, Factories, etc., Act to include supervision, the time and extent of that supervision might be usefully defined in the Order. Special conditions like those of fruit picking may make call for special extended functions, but such cases are and will remain exceptional.The Name Welfare,81. The name Welfare has hitherto proved somewhat unfortunate, in counting for both less and more than it was intended to convey. Less, because the actual field of operation was rather wider than simply the personal well-being of the worker, more because exceptional circum-stances led to excursions into the field of private or home life normally outside factory administration. Further, the name has through indis-creet, though, we believe, exceptional action, acquired an unpleasant significance in Labour circles. It may be hopefully anticipated that its sound, original meaning relatively to factory conditions indicated in the Act of 1916, S.7, will in due course assert its predominance under expert administration as exceptional war-time conditions pass away.Women on Boards and Committees.82. In order that the real welfare of women in industry, commerce and clerical employment may be promoted, it is of the highest import-ance that all Boards and Committees dealing with the interests and conditions of such women shall include suitable women members.Summary of Recommendations as to Welfare or Conditions.83. Welfare work must continue after the war, when there should be a single Government authority. The In-dustrial Fatigue Research Board will take the place of the Health of Munition Workers Committee for conducting research and investigation. Industries should determine their own conditions under Government Supervision. It should be the employees duty to study conditions as he now studies cost of production; and workers should strive for good conditions as they have striven for good wages. The workers should operate through Whitley Councils and Works Committees, on which organised women must be fully represented. Factory Inspectors should be en-couraged to call conferences of employers and employed. Compulsory action by the State should be used for the pur-pose of making universal that which experiment has proved to be right.It is to be hoped that the work of the Factory Inspector will become more and more merged in that of th$ expert adviser. It requires re-organisation, and should be scientifically developed with special reference to health and safety in the factory, and investigation of questions of industrial hygiene, fatigue, disease and mortality. All factories employing women in substantial numbers should have a Woman Superintendent, with managerial status and clearly denned duties, such duties not extending beyond the walls of the factory, except in abnormal cases. There should be women members on all Boards and Com-mittees dealing with the interests of women, whether in industry, commerce, or clerical work.22391C 4
D. Trade Unionism.84. The great stir of the Women&apos;s Movement of the last few years, which has carried them to heights which a short time ago were matter of aspiration rather than of expectation, which has won them the right to vote and to sit in Parliament, has had a profound influence on organisation. Women&apos;s industrial consciousness has been quickened; they are realising, slowly it is true, but with deep conviction, their potentialities and their power; they are organising to an extent undreamed of before, and they have the opportunity, little used at present but lying to their hands, of using their large numbers and their great powers for extending the outlook and improving the circumstances both of their sex and of the race. Such phrases will not sound exaggerated to one who compares the success of the present with the long and painful struggle of the past.The advantages of organisation can be examined under three heads; the influence on character, the influence on wages, and the influence on conditions of life. It is hard to say which is most important. But one word first about numbers.Numbers.85. Since complete returns for 1918 are not yet available, it is not possible to give accurate figures. Figures up to the end of 1917 have been prepared and are in Appendix VII. They are believed to be generally correct. A number of mixed Unions, however, do not classify their male and female members separately, and in these cases only an estimate (from which it is thought risk of serious error is excluded) is possible.From these actual and estimated figures, for which the Committee is indebted to the Ministry of Labour, it appears that there were 773,003 women Trade Unionists at the end of 1917. The numbers have more than doubled in three years, and have certainly increased further during 1918.Influence of Trade Unionism on Character.86. It must not be supposed that the only value of Trade Unions is to raise wages or improve conditions. They have a power which is greater than these functions, important as they are. Their educational value is real and great. In the past, it has been an instrument for developing intelligence and steadying character; in the future, when the factory girl enters her organisation better educated, she will respond more readily to the influence of corporate action for a common cause. On joining a union she gets her first insight into the currents underlying industry. She learns also the great lesson of common action ; that she who wishes to effect anything must give up much; that she must abandon I objects f(y which she passionately longs and to which she is convinced that she is entitled, in deference to the views of others, equally deserving of respect. Finally, should she rise in the Trade Union Avorld, should she become an official or leader of her union, she is brought into contact with those big movements and problems of industry, which are among the most intricate as they are among the most interesting which the modern world contains.Influence of Trade Unions on Wages.87. Since the war, the number of organised women has approximately doubled: wages in munitions trades have been increased to 3-4 times I the pre-war rate.  What is the relation between these two sets of facts? J
Increased organisation has, of course, contributed to the increase: but it is not easy to disentangle the various forces and to give each its due weight. It would be as unreasonable to attribute the whole of the in-creases in engineering trades to organisation as it would be to deny that the low wages paid in corset-making are in part due to its absence. It would be as misleading to under-estimafe the work done by the Special Arbitration Tribunal of the Ministry of Munitions as it would be to underrate the part played by organised labour in setting it up and in guiding its decisions. Nor can the action of women&apos;s unions be dis-entangled from that of the men&apos;s. At the same time few would dispute that organisation has increased wages; that in well organised trades the wages of women employed on men&apos;s work axe in reasonable relation to the wages of men; that in war industries, where organisation is stronger, women&apos;s wages have risen considerably more than the rise in the cost of living, measured by changes in retail prices, whilst in the non-war industries, where organisation is weaker, they have not risen proportionally to the cost of living.Influence of Trade Unions on Conditions.88. In the past industrial conflicts have chiefly and inevitably centred around wages. Wages have been the object and hours of work have been treated as a means of improving them. The trade unionist&apos;s present demand for shortened hours has largely in view the attainment of increased leisure, opportunities of education, fuller life; along with this goes the claim for improved conditions. It is certain that if trade unions are to play a part in woman&apos;s industrial future they must con-cern themselves with conditions, which to her are of such vital moment. The record of the Lancashire Cotton Trade, with the strongest mixed union in the country, long working hours and bad sanitary conditions, is not an encouraging one. How women can assert themselves; how they can make known and enforce their real needs; how they can exercise that weight to which their numbers entitle them are questions which must be carefully examined.Difficulties of Women&apos;s Organisations.89. It is hardly necessary at this time of day to justify the organi-sation of women. The logical case is won: the same arguments that support the organisation of men prevail in the case of women. But just as in the case of men it was not till long after the victory of opinion was won, that all that is implied in organisation was fully and frankly- recognised, so women now suffer from the same difficulty. Much work has&apos; to be done before employers pay to women&apos;s trade organisa-tions the respect which they pay to men&apos;s, and it must be admitted that this is largely the fault of women themselves. It is useful to examine some of the defects which women have shown in organising themselves, and the difficulties with which they have to contend.The first of these causes is that common to all poorly paid occupations, namely, the inability of the worker to afford weekly contributions sufficient to furnish an attractive system of benefits. The second is the normal shortness of woman&apos;s industrial life, indicated in the figures of the census of occupation, from which it appears that the majority of women leave industry between the ages of 20 and 30. Employed women in the mass, therefore, are young compared with employed men in the mass, and women&apos;s unions, to a corresponding extent, lack the weight and stability which they would gain from the presence in them
of a considerable proportion of older and more experienced members. Further, the shortness of women&apos;s industrial life makes her treat organisation less seriously.Separate Organisations or Mixed Unions?90. &quot;Women joining separate unions can deal with labour questions from their own standpoint; they can direct their own policy; and they gain experience in managing their own affairs. To set against these advantages they suffer the drawbacks mentioned in the preceding para-graph. If they join men&apos;s unions they have the advantage of a common cause, they get more experienced direction and much greater negotiat-ing power. On the whole the advantages of the mixed unions appear greater, though in our varied industrial world there is room for both kinds. But men must reserve for women adequate representation on committees. and executives, which women have not claimed and men have not conceded in the past. A definite proportion of the members of such bodies should be women. Further, the State, when conferring with mixed unions, should insist on the presence of women represen-tatives.How Men&apos;s Unions can Help.91. The action of such powerful bodies as the National Union of Bailwaymen, the Steel Smelters&apos; Union, and various Unions of Trans-port and Vehicle Workers, which now enrol women members, and of other unions, such as the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which, while not admitting women to their organisation, have nevertheless actively assisted to organise them and to improve their rate of wages, has been of the very greatest significance. The fact that in some cases the impulse has been one of self-protection in no sense detracts from its value.How the State can Help.92. Since under the most favourable circumstances women&apos;s organi-sations have an uphill struggle, it is desirable to see how the Stale can help. The following suggestions are made. First, all employees of the Central and Local Government should have the right to organise and to be represented by their organisations. This is a long way from being the case at present, for in many instances though organisation is permitted, the employees are not allowed to be represented by a union official unless he is an employee. This restriction should be removed, and the skill and experience of a. practised secretary should always be at the employee&apos;s disposal.The second point concerns unemployment insurance. It is understood that the whole question of an extension of unemployment insurance is under consideration, but the draft scheme is not before the Committee. It is therefore not possible to enter into details as to methods of strengthening Trade Union Organisations in connection with unemploy-ment insurance, hut we wish to express the opinion that steps should also be taken to prevent unemployment by means of guaranteed security of employment, and by the reduction of casual and seasonal labour to a minimum by better organisation. Trade Unions should obviously play an important part in such undertakings with a consequent increase of their strength and scope.Thirdly, the experience of Trade Boards has been encouraging. They have undoubtedly stimulated organisation. Every effort should be made to hasten the time when the workers&apos; representatives on the Boards are elected and not nominated.
Conclusion as to Importance of Trade Unionism for Women.93. In conclusion we cannot too strongly emphasise our view which kas been reinforced by war-time experience that complete and efficient Trade Unionism is essential, not only for the well-being of the workers engaged in industry, but in the interests of the State. The coherent and intelligent expression of the corporate opinions of those engaged in labour on all questions which affect them and their trade is vital to all healthy industrial development. Since, however, it has been shown that women suffer from certain disabilities from which men are free, it is clear that they have much to gain from outside influences which can be brought to bear on their education in the conduct of industrial affairs. The sympathetic pressure of public opinion may do much, but even more important is the official recognition of women&apos;s organisations and of their encouragement by the State as bodies whose development affects the progress not only of individual trades but of the country at large.Danger of Whitley Councils and Committees.94. The Whitley Report recommends Industrial Councils for organised industries only. It draws attention again and again to the danger of Industrial Councils and Works Committees being used as a substitute for or rival of Trade organisation, and lajrs it down clearly that both assume the existence of organisations both of employers and employed. Where the industry is unorganised, the place of an Industrial Council should be filled by a Trade Board until such time as a satisfactory organisation has been erected. It is necessary, therefore, in administration, to exer-cise care lest the establishment of an Industrial Council, before the state of organisation in the trade warrants it, should prejudice the case for the establishment of a Trade Board. We are aware that the co-existence of the two bodies is possible, hut the prior establishment of a Joint Industrial Council would almost certainly tend to prevent or delay the establishment of a Trade Board. Moreover, the existence of Works Committees in an imperfectly organised trade might enable the employer to deal directly with his employees and deprive them of the advantage of collective bargaining.Summary of Recommendations as to Trade Unionism.95. Organisation should be encouraged in every way. Trade Unions should play an important part in prevent-ing unemployment. Unions comprising both men and women are stronger for bargaining purposes than those consisting of women only, but there is work for both classes of unions to do.E. Training.96. Training of women is a question both difficult and important. Facilities for training of women in pre-war times were limited and inadequate, partly no doubt owing to the extremely limited range of occupations open to them, but also undoubtedly because of the con-flicting ideals prevailing with regard to education of girls and to the somewhat indifferent attitude of public opinion towards education and training of women workers. The war has afforded an opportunity to women workers to prove their usefulness in many hitherto untried directions, and a change of public opinion has set in, giving merited, if tardy, recognition of the value to the State of the woman worker and
home-maker. Probably nothing- short of the abnormality of the times would have brought about such a change in thought and opinion. It remains to be seen whether this change will prove lasting when the nation settles to normal conditions again. The extent to which it will endure will rest, however, largely on the women themselves, and on the strength of their determination to qualify themselves to discharge their greater responsibilities. Por this reason the development and consolidation of the Women&apos;s Trade Union movement is of primary importance. In the formulating of a policy with regard to training, women&apos;s organisations should take a leading part.Education must come before Training.97. At the basis of training stands Education, and any recommendu-tions made for such training pre-suppose an efficient general Education.Vocational Training.98. Assuming efficient education, the extent to which it will ho possible to set up complete systems of vocational training will largely depend on the range of opportunities of employment open to women. Women have entered many of the new trades opened to them during the war as dilutees or as substitutes for men withdrawn for the Forces, and are, therefore, liable to exclusion from many of them when the redemption of pledges and the termination of the substitution agreement take effect. Before, therefore, a comprehensive scheme of training can be made or any steps taken to carry such a scheme into effect, it will be essential that an understanding should be reached as to the range of trades which will afford permanent openings for women.Requisites of Vocational Training.99. In vocational training the shortcomings of the past must be made good, the dislocation of the transition period must be met, and the possibilities of the future must be provided for.It has in the past been too generally assumed that as a woman&apos;s industrial career was short, extending from school-leaving age to marriage, systematic continuation training to prepare her for her after career was unnecessary. The uncertainty of a woman&apos;s career, how-ever, in reality makes the question of training both important and complicated. For the girl needs two-fold equipment. She needs to be prepared for wage-earning as well as for domestic duties. Whatever be required of her in the grade of work, skilled or unskilled, which she enters as a wage earner, in the management of her home and her family, the woman must have in her, to be successful, the spirit of craftsmanship. As things are at present the difficulties of home-life attendant on bad housing, unsatisfactory conditions, and the stress of industrial life, not only rarely permit of the development of such a spirit but are liable to destroy such foundations as early school life may have built.Importance of Training.100. With comparatively few exceptions every girl leaving the public elementary schools in all large industrial centres becomes a wage-earner, in the widest sense of the word. The majority start worka? soon as they leave school, and though nearly all look forward to having homes of their own, yet industrial work takes precedence in point of time, and if the girl is to grow into a capable woman, she must be trained industrially.
45433There should be a large variety in the training offered. It is not possible for any individual girl to foresee whether she will be always dependent on her own labour and resources or not. The uncertainty of the girl&apos;s future makes the choice of a career very difficult. She is tempted to take her industrial life far from seriously, and thus expose herself to exploitation. It is only too tempting for both the girl and her parents to take up some &quot; blind alley &quot; occupation in order to earn good money, on the chance of marriage providing for the future. Even for the blind alley girl, therefore, training is essential. More-over, by judicious variation of employment for those who are engaged iu the more purely mechanical processes, whether of industry or clerical work, some of the most harmful effects of such employment can be obviated.Untrained young workers are, however, likely to remain untrained, slipshod workers, throughout their lives. The fact that a woman is trained to be a skilled craftswoman is not only a gain to herself, but to the community, in that through the fuller development of her powers, she attains a more complete sense of citizenship, and is a more valuable&apos; member of society, while, if she does not marry and has to return to work, she has the means to do so within her power.Vocational Training before tlie War.101. Before the War little provision of vocational training for girls and women was made. A small number of scholarships were awarded by a few of the more progressive educational authorities and by the generosity of private individuals or associations. The Universities provided a few scholarships for women and the Carnegie Trust did useful work in Scotland. The following was the extent of the provision:  (i) Professional Training.Provision was made from National and public funds for training of teachers in elementary schools, and to a lesser degree for teachers of domestic subjects and physical exercises. ,Training for teachers of secondary schools has not, however, until recently been recognized as a national burden.Grants in aid are made both to Universities and recognised colleges of the Universities (including women&apos;s colleges) both from State and local funds, and a certain number of scholarships have been provided to assist women to proceed to the Universities with a view to qualifying them-selves for such various types of professional work as teaching, research work, and medicine. A fairly liberal provision has been made by Local Authorities, aided by State funds, of Arts and Craft Schools, and to a very much lesser degree of Colleges of Music. In recent years county and other scholarships have been available to a limited extent for training of midwives, but not for other important subsidiary health services.Training for the nursing profession has been developed without aid of State and local funds.(ii) Training for commercial anal clerical occupations.Innumerable preparatory clerical colleges and schools of commerce and private shorthand and typewriting offices have grown up since the introduction of women and girls into the lower grades of clerical and commercial work. The quality of the training offered varies. Suffi-cient regard has not been paid to the educational qualifications and requirements of the pupils who have swarmed to obtain sufficient super-ficial knowledge to enable them to get employment.
The existence of these private institutions has retarded development of commercial training by Education Authorities. A few Local Authori-ties have established commercial schools or courses in Technical Institutes. Considerable attention has been given to adjustment of curriculum and of methods of teaching in public secondary schools to fit pupils for clerical occupations. Otherwise the main provision made&apos; has been in Evening Schools and Institutes. Practically nothing has been done to prepare women for higher commercial work.(iii) Industrial Training.The provision of technical vocational training for girls and women was lamentably inadequate.*It may be noted, however, that this country was at least in advance of Germany (where in spite of the system of vocational continuation schools for boys, little attention was paid to girls), though behind France, where the Ecoles professionelles had been established and developed as a part of reconstructive policy after the Franco-German War.The only provision made for girls was the establishment of a small number of day technical schools providing courses in domestic economy, and a still smaller number of day trade schools and of evening trade classes.The day trade schools, excellent though they were in quality, were too restricted in quantity to produce any appreciable industrial result. Before the war London had seven such schools; since 1914 their number has risen to ten, providing about 1,000 places. To these must be added four trade schools outside London Willesden, West Ham, Manchester and Plymouth, with 200 places. There are also (at Clapham and Rams-gate) two Trade Schools for Physically Defective Girls, and a few other localities have girls&apos; technical classes. Since 35,000 girls leave the Metropolitan elementary schools every year, and there are only 1,000 places in trade schools on a two years&apos; course, only 500 each year, or one in 70, can go to trade schools. The part played by the London County Council has, however, proved successful, not merely from the point of view of providing skilled industries with highly-trained and intelligent workers, but also in showing the educational as well as practical value of a combination of trade training with continued general education.It is a condition of admission into these schools that pupils should subsequently enter the trade for which they have been trained. While in the main in pre-war times this condition was observed, experience has shown that the training, in spite of its specialised character, has enabled ex-pupils not only to obtain good positions in their own trade, but readily to adapt themselves to other kinds of work. War conditions have of necessity interfered with the further development of these schools.Useful experiments have also been made on a small scale by the pro-vision of part-time day courses for apprentices. These have, however, been limited to the employees of a small number of enlightened employers.Apart from these there has also been a serious effort to develop evening class trade instruction for adults, to enable them to improve their trade knowledge and skill.Although much useful work has been done in such evening classes, the long hours of employment have inevitably militated against the success of the evening class movement. Moreover, attendance at such classes can, at best, only be within the reach of a comparatively limited number of women, and experience goes to show that for the most part, in spite of the earnest endeavour made by large numbers of girls
-   434and young women to avail themselves of such educational opportunities as have been offered, serious and sustained mental effort can rarely be elicited by tired teachers from tired pupils.To sum up the story of vocational training of girls and women before the war, it is no exaggeration to say that the facilities provided were few in quantity, and often inferior in quality, while such as existed were organised on no general system whatever. Such was the condition of diings when war broke out; it is now necessary to give a short account of the really great effort made during the war.Emergency Training during the War.102. Such training falls into two main categories. The first, com-paratively unimportant, is the training provided for women in order to span the period of unemployment which was expected to ensue, of which an example is the courses, chiefly in domestic subjects, arranged by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Employment at some of their relief workrooms. But the second categoiy, that providing training for women with the definite object of their replacing men, is of far greater moment. Any account of this must centre chiefly round the action of the Ministry of Munitions; but before describing it, certain other activities must be dealt with, which, if of lesser importance, are only so when judged in relation to the great and successful work of that Ministry.Eirst of all, a number of trades provided special courses for training women to take the place of men, among them the grocery, bootmaking, hosiery, saddlery, and optical instrument trades.* The Cordwainers&apos; College started classes for the leather trade, with a specially good scheme for training forewomen. The boot trade in Northampton and Bristol followed suit. Many employers, too, started training for their industries: some tin boxmakers, for example, started a course, and some clothiers, light leather and chemical manufacturers did the same. Next comes the training provided by the various Women&apos;s Corps. The suc-cessful work of Women&apos;s Service in training women acetylene welders is generally known. Many thousands of women have been trained in agriculture, forestry and timber measuring, as well as in motor driving and canteen cooking, as clerks and waitresses. Some Local Authorities, too the London County Council in particular started emergency courses for women. Many more instances could be cited. These efforts, however, valuable and indeed essential as they were, are not in &quot;the same class as the action of the Ministry of Munitions. Beginning from the autumn of 1915, when the need for labour became urgent, that Ministry developed training on systematic lines. A high degree of efficiency in specialised processes was reached, and it is due to the efforts of the Ministry that large numbers of women have entered the skilled branches of munition work.   The scheme is worth explaining in detail.Training by the Ministry of Munitions.103. This falls under three heads. The Training Section of the Ministry encouraged Local Education Authorities to use Technical and Engineering Schools for Training; it started instructional factories, and it established systematic training courses in munition works themselves.Women were trained for munition making at 70 training centres, of which 7 were instructional factories and 63 training schools. The schools were helped by the Training Section of the Ministry of Munitions* Home Office Memorandum, pp. 8 and 9.
with advice, money grants and a varying amount of supervision, hut they were neither owned nor entirely directed by the Ministry. Great local variations existed; for example, the teaching staff was generally that in office before the war, reinforced where necessary; but some insti-tutions used picked foremen as instructors, chosen from actual munition works. In some establishments, again, the existing equipment was used, whilst others have been completely refitted with the most up-to-date appliances. The training given was graded into classes, starting from ordinary factory work and running through special tasks and operations, semi-skilled or process-skilled repetition work, to the tool setter, the setter up, the inspector, and finally the forewoman. The demand for ordinary factory training declined; it was found that the vast amount of repetition work classed as semi-skilled could be better taught in instructional factories; consequently the technical school inclined more and more to deal with two only of the above classes the specialised operative on one hand, and the highly skilled setter-up, supervisor or forewoman on the other. Women constituted three-quarters of the trainees. The period of instruction varied from six weeks for the special operation to six months for the setter-up or forewoman. About 6,000 women were being instructed in the schools at any one time.There were seven instructional factories, with accommodation for about 800 persons. They were owned and operated by the Ministry of Munitions, the course being 6 weeks. The conditions were planned to resemble exactly those of a working factory. The training, so far as concerns women, was largely directed to proelucing those classed as semi-skilled : that is, skilled at one or two processes of a repetition character. In work of this class a high degree of skill is required; but it is specialised skill, can be acquired in a few weeks, and does not fit the operator for more than the particular operation taught. In addition to process work&apos;, however, valuable instruction has been given in tool room work, fitting, viewing and other higher grades of work, including that of forewomen, also in aeroplane work and acetylene welding.Lastly come the training courses in individual factories, whether Government or controlled. These also varied greatly. One well-known arms factory had a special and separate training department approxi-mating in character to a Government Instructional Factory. Other works started smaller courses for a more limited purpose and special object.&apos; One machine tool factory trained women tool setters for the buyers of their tools, the forewomen being the instructors. In another factory especially trained women supervisors taught setting-up and tool setting. In another, the best machinists were picked out, sent to a six weeks&apos; course at a technical school, and then trained as operators of the more difficult tools, setters-up, inspectors and charge hands. More instances could be given of these courses, but enough has been said to show, their general character. They taught for the most part the higher grades of skill.It should be noted that all persons trained received a maintenance allowance until they were earning wages.Close touch was kept between the training given and existing require-ments. Early in the war, when shells and trench materials, requiring little or no skill for the simpler parts of their production, were required, most of the training was directed to this end. As the demand for such articles was met, and skilled operators and process-skilled women were required, a change was made in training methods. The closest touch, too, was kept between the trained pupil and the factory. Altogether this scheme was a great one, and proved highly successful for its purpose.
Sriggestions as to Training Scheme of Ministry of Munitions.104. Successful though the scheme has been, it operates for munition Itrades only. For non-munition trades things are at present little, if at all, better than before the war. But a great deal of the training given for munition making is immediately apt for peace requirements, and most could be so adapted without difficulty. It would, in our opinion, be a disaster if a scheme successful in the past and full of nope for the future, were allowed to lapse at the end of the war; and therefore call the special attention of the *Minister of Reconstruc-rion to the advisability of adapting it to peace requirements. It will iave to be modified substantially. The training given in war time iras inevitably directed to making women into producers at the earliest moment. Therefore it was too specialised to meet the needs of women whose industrial future lies outside the processes taught. And it is felt that training should be controlled not by a Government Depart-ment, but by the industry itself working in harmony with the Local Education Authority. Granted certain modifications, the scheme might be adapted to form the nucleus of a training system.Trade training courses must be planned with a close watch on supply of labour, to prevent over-stocking. The training must be closely associated to trade methods and requirements. Only those individuals able to benefit by such training and afterwards to follow the trade in which they had been trained, must be admitted to the classes. The trainees must be protected against exploitation.System adopted must be Varied and Flexible.105. Methods of training should vary from trade to trade, and the I greatest elasticity consistent with efficiency should be encouraged. Apprenticeship, learnership, technical classes, instructional, national or local factory courses, or combination of these should all be utilised. Xo one method will either suit or be sufficient to meet all the various needs. It is anticipated that the &quot;teacher power&quot; of the country and the school accommodation will be strained to the utmost to compass the carrying into effect of the &quot;Continuation Class&quot; clauses of the new Education Bill. It will, therefore, probably be necessary to tap new sources of supply in order to obtain the suitably qualified personnel to take charge of training courses for women. There should be many trained women to be obtained from munition works.The task to be faced at the period of demobilization will on the whole be less difficult than that at the outbreak of the war, for a fund of experience has been gained both by the workers, who will be thus more adaptable and receptive of further training, and by those responsible lor providing training, which should prove invaluable.Recommendation as to Maintenance during Training.106. The question of maintenance for women during training is one of supreme importance. Unless a fair &quot; learners&apos; wage &quot; is secured to the trainee, it is obvious that training courses would at best be of limited usefulness. In pre-war times the provision of such aid to adults Was seldom if ever forthcoming except on eleemosynary grounds. This was one of the main causes of failure of such few experiments as were* Since this paragraph was drafted the responsibility for dealing with emergency training schemes has, we believe, been transferred to the Ministry of Labour.
made to provide training for adult unemployed women. Whether the learners&apos; wage be paid by tbe State to enable an individual to take up a course of training, or wholly or partly by the employer if the training is carried on as an apprenticeship in his works, it is funda-mental that the payment should be adequate to enable the trainee to take full advantage of the training. Such provision, however, pie-supposes that suitable women only should be trained and payment made conditional on satisfactory progress.The cost both of training and maintenance should be a national charge and one Department only be made responsible for its adminis-tration. This is necessary not only in the interests of economy, and to prevent overlapping, but to ensure that the benefits are not restricted to special sections of the community.Serious   Overlapping   which   now   exists   between   GovernmentDepartments.t107., In this connection we wish to call the serious and immediab attention of the Government to the multiplicity of Departments already authorised to incur expenditure for training schemes and maintenance of trainees. The continuance of such a state of (things can only lead to waste, inefficiency and sectionalism.Thus (a) the Ministry of Pensions is empowered to make provision for training the widows and children of discharged and disabled soldier and sailors. (6) The Ministry of Munitions during the war was respon-sible for training of women for munitions work. Proposals have been put forward in the Report to the Ministry- of Reconstruction of the Local Government Committee for the establishment by (c) County Boroughs of Training- and Unemployment Committees, among whose functions should be that of providing training (institutional or other) for able-bodied persons requiring assistance by reason of unemployment in addition to or substitution for &quot;Home&quot; assistance. Section 100 of the National Insurance Act, Part II, of 1911, empowers (d) the Ministry of Labour, under certain conditions, to pay out of the Fund all or any of the expenses incidental to the provision of technical in-struction for insured persons who, through defective skill or knowledge, are unable to obtain or retain employment.Now it is obvious that four distinct training schemes, carried on under the auspices of four different Government Departments, would cause overlapping and waste. Separate standards would be set up, conflicting and indeed competing schemes started, and the creation o a unified system rendered difficult. The establishment of these separate enterprises is due, not to any proper division of function, but to administrative accident. A soldier&apos;s widow does not require training because she is a soldier&apos;s widow, but because she is deficient in skill in her trade; and the same applies to others. It is essential in the Committee&apos;s judgment, that all training schemes should be put under one Government department, and that this should be done at once. The Report of the Women&apos;s Advisory Committee to the Minister o&quot; Reconstruction dealing with this subject has already been presented. We agree generally with this Committee&apos;s conclusions.Recommendation that a Committee be at once set up to Prepare aScheme for Training.108. It is evident that the provision of training will be one both of difficulty and importance, and that if action on an adequate scab is to be taken with any hope of successful result, careful and extensive
reparation must be made beforehand. It is, therefore, recommended aat at an early date the Minister of Labour should appoint a suitably oinposed Committee to deal with the problem of providing training for omen after as well as during resettlements Such a Committee should )iitain a strong representation of industrial experience, including organ-;ed labour, both men and women, and employers: the Government Jepartments chiefly concerned should also be represented. It should e charged with the work of surveying the field, investigating existing icilities and advising as to the extent and directions in which these hould be amplified to meet the requirements of women workers and of mployers, of formulating schemes, and advising as to the machinery, entral and local, by which the necessary executive action should be iken.Summary of Recommendations as to Training.109. Much of the training given for munition making is immediately pt for peace requirements and could be adapted to these requirements Titkout difficulty. The special attention of the Ministry of Eeconstruc-ion is called to the advisability of so adapting the training scheme of lie Ministry of Munitions. Trade training courses must be planned with . close watch on supply of labour to prevent overstocking. Training aust be closely associated to trade methods and requirements. Only ndividuals able to benefit by training and afterwards to follow the trade n which they have been trained should be admitted to the classes. Slethods of training should vary from trade to trade, and the greatest lasticity consistent with efficiency should be encouraged. Apprentice-liip, learnership, technical classes, instructional, national, or local actory courses, or combinations of these should all be utilised. Main-mance for women during training must be provided, and should extend o the Health Service touched on in paragraph 33, as well as to industrial md other technical training. The cost both of training and mainten-ince should be a national charge, and one department only should he Bade responsible for its administration.   The Ministry of Labour shouldt an early date appoint a suitably composed Committee to deal with lie problem of providing training for women both during resettlement ind afterwards; such a Committee to contain strong representation of ndustrial experience, including organised labour, both men and women iiul employers. The Government Departments chiefly concerned should also be represented. This Committee should be charged with the work r&apos;i surveying the field, investigating existing facilities and advising as to the extent and directions in which these should be amplified, of formulating schemes and advising as to necessary executive machinery, central and local.F. Employment of Married Women.The Present Position should not be encouraged.110. While it is recognised that under existing conditions very many Carried women must leave their homes and go to work, it is hoped that every inducement, direct and indirect, will be given to keep mothers at home. Particularly it is hoped that the excessive employment of Carried women, which obtained during the war, will cease at its termi-nation.111. The systematic employment of married women in remunerated ^&quot;ork, its causes and its effects, economic, social and physical, have never oeeii the subject of any comprehensive enquiry of which the results* A Training Department of the Ministry of Labour has already been set up to deal ^ith training of men, women, and juveniles.
have been made public, although the facts relating to that employment so far as it is industrial, are to some extent known. At present the only bar on their, industrial employment is Section 61 of the Factory ami Workshop Act of 1901, which requires that:  &quot; An occupier of a &quot;factory or workshop shall not knowingly allowa woman or girl to be employed therein within four weeks aftershe has given birth to a child.&quot; This restriction, slight though it is in itself, has had one good result: it has led the women inspectors of the Factory Department to investi-gate many cases of employment of mothers of young infants and [to report on its effects. The summary of references to Section 61 in tin Annual Eeports of II.M. Chief Inspector of Factories, which is printed in Appendix VIII., shows that the importance of this matter wai realised in pre-war days. The references ceased with 1913, not because the subject ceased to be important but, no doubt, because of the great pressure of work in other directions. The evidence given by Mis: Anderson before the Committee on Physical Deterioration also indicate the extent to which the matter has been under the attention of her staff112. From time to time partial enquiries into the subject have beei made by the Local Government Board, and a good deal of evidence in connection with it lies packed away in the Annual Reports of the various Medical Officers of Health. We understand that in 1908 a general investigation through these Officers was instituted by the Home Office, and many reports were sent in, but the evidence so collected was some-what conflicting, and has not been published in collated form.113. Recent reports on Infant Welfare and Mortality do not deal t&apos; any extent with this question. The Registrar-General in his Report ol 1911 included some statistics showing rates of infantile mortality according to the father&apos;s occupation, but ignoring the mother&apos;s. It would be of great assistance if Death Certificates of children, up if five years old, recorded the mother&apos;s occupation as well as the father&apos;-, and the Reports of the Registrar-General gave the corresponding rate-of infant mortality according to the occupations of both parents. Hospital records of in-patients, too, might very well give the occupation-of their married women patients, which now is either not done or done too loosely to be any use. Very little is said on the influence of the mother&apos;s employment in the Report of the Medical Research Com mittee on the Mortalities of Birth, Infancy, and Childhood. The Report on the Physical Welfare of Mothers and Children in England and Wales, presented to the Carnegie United Eingdom Trust, shows for each county and each town, with a population of 50,000 or over, the approximate-proportion of married women and widows employed, but does not deal further with the subject and gives no expert opinion on it. It was probably outside the reference, but it is clear that the mother, absent at a factory all day, must be deprived of the educative advantages of the Child Welfare Schemes, advocated in the Report, from which so much is hoped.114 The Health of Munition Workers Committee* elicited valuable facts and made excellent suggestions; but we believe we shall carry that body with us in saying that more sustained and more systematic enquiries are necessary if the best results are to be obtained.115. Voluntary organisations and individuals have undertaken in* quiries from time to time into aspects of the Infant Welfare question, and have not ignored the employed mother. While the results of these have been of interest, it is probably not unfair to say that the conclu-* Cd. 9065, 1918.  See paras. 91 to 99.
H ons have been based for the most part on inadequate data, and have Ibflected largely the pre-enquiry views of the investigators. And Mere is the additional difficulty that the conditions of many of He homes are so unsatisfactory as to be capable by themselves of caus-ij ig many of the evils proved to exist, and it is impossible to disentangle ae different factors.I It is obvious that the difficulties of such enquiry are great, and theII act that the total number of married women who are regularly II naployed form a comparatively small proportion of the total number I f married women, except in a few centres, has obscured the importance 1 if their employment as a factor in health problems.s More Information Required.I 116. On looking into the question of employed  married  women I lenerally, what becomes evident is the paucity of information as to 1 heir numbers, and their distribution.   The Census figures cannot be ijhccepted as quite conclusive.   The woman intermittently employed is I nclined to enter herself as not employed if she is interrogated during I an interval of unemployment.   In many districts to state that you go 1 )ut to work after marriage is to a certain extent to confess your marriage I a failure, which a woman does not readily do, even on an official return. I It is probable, therefore, that the Census figures understate the actual I number of occupied married women.   No statistics on the subject are I available from the Census of Production; and the return made by em-ploy ers at the request of the Home Office in 1907 did not produce anything like a complete record, even of those employed under the I Factory Acts, in the textile trades.   Large numbers of married women I are known to work in seasonal trades, such as jam-making and fish-curing, as charwomen, as school and office cleaners, and many of these would, in giving information, treat their employment as subsidiary to liome duties.   In many districts married women are largely employed for part of the year in agricultural work, and they are to be found engaged in practically all forms of unskilled and casual work open to women, while they form a considerable proportion of the homeworkers.*Restrictions in this and other Countries.117. The existing restriction under the Factory and Workshop Act is mainly in the interests of the health of the mother; is confined to women employed in factories and workshops; and does not extend to the outworker. Restrictions of a similar kind have been adopted in almost all European countries, many of them requiring a longer absence from work, and some including a period before confinement as welLf It is generally accepted that the restriction is a necessary one, but that the absence is too short.Maternity Benefit.118. Under the National Insurance Act an inducement to refrain from wage-yielding work is offered to married insured women in the payment of a second maternity benefit of the value of 30s., subject to the condition that no work is undertaken during the four weeks follow-ing confinement. This applies not only to the woman affected by the restriction of the Factory Act, but to employed women^ generally-the clerk, the farm servant, the charwoman. The supervision exercised, however, by Approved Societies through whom the benefit- is payable is not sufficiently close to afford any guarantee that this condition is always observed.* See Appendix IX., statistics relating to Employed Married Women, f See Appendix X.
The fact that under the National Health Insurance Act, 1918, special fund called the Women&apos;s Equalisation Fund has been provide-,: to assist Societies in paying sickness benefit to women during pregnancy makes it clear that their title to benefit cannot be questioned and that they are, therefore, entitled to financial help while taking the rest anc precautions that may be required at such a time, if they are not in i sufficiently fit physical condition to continue at work.It is believed that out of the total number of women in England aw Wales who were confined in the year 1914 (including unmarried mother-only one-ninth were themselves insured persons and consequently entitlei to sickness benefit and to medical benefit. (It must be remembered too, that medical benefit does not include medical attendance in respet of confinement.) About six-ninths were the wives of insured men an drew maternity benefit by virtue of their husbands&apos; insurance, hi consequently were entitled to no other benefits. The remaining twi ninths were not eligible-for any benefits under National Health Insm ance, because neither the woman nor the husband was an insured person,The above estimates were based wholly on figures before the wai It is probable that considerable changes in each of the three grou] referred to in the paragraph must have taken place during the late years of the war.119. To attribute the high infant mortality rate in certain industrii centres only to the extensive employment of married women is clear! to ignore other factors of importance, but it is permissible to look wit! confidence for reduction of the rate if mothers are put into the positioi of being able to refrain from industrial work for a period before an after confinement, without thereby depriving themselves of necessai nourishment and comfort.The Questions to be Solved.120. This short summary includes all the information at the Cow mittee&apos;s disposal.   The questions which have to be decided are, it wi be seen, not simple, but are both involved in some obscurity, not fn from controversy and contain diverse facts.   They may be summarise thus:  (1) Should restriction be extended to all employed women? (2) Should it include periods both before and after confinement; an of what length?(3) Should this be a minimum with a possible extension up to maximum ?(4) How should this extension be carried out (a) by different regulations for different trades;(b) by medical reports on individual women;(c) at the option of the women themselves?(5) What financial compensation should the women receive and b) and to whom should it be paid?These questions are partly medical and there is no unanimity o medical opinion.   The time is ripe, however, for an enquiry with view to modification of the law.It appears to us that the most urgent need for the health of boil mother and child is a free and efficient midwifery and medical service for ante-natal treatment and attendance at and after confinement.   It would be out of place here to discuss the effects of the present mb wifery service, and it must be noted that the National Health Insuranc Act does not provide medical treatment as such in respect of confin* It should be understood that this estimate includes women of all ranks and not womt of the working classes only.
eat. The expense of suck treatment is supposed to be defrayed out the maternity benefit, and the effect of a gratuitous midwifery service mid be to set that benefit entirely free for other purposes. We think that it would be desirable also that a cash allowance should made, either universally or to specified classes of married women liether themselves insured persons or not), for a period before and er confinement, either in addition to or in lieu of the present sick-is benefit to which insured women are entitled when incapable of rk during pregnancy or after a month from the date of confinement, t we make no definite recommendations on this point, which requires tailed consideration by experts.Mothers&apos; Pensions.121. There remain, after disposing of the foregoing questions, two rrther problems. The stability of the position of women in industry fter the war, and the new opportunities of employment presented to. aem will be largely conditioned by the state of the labour market, his has in the past been seriously affected by the industrial competition f widows and deserted wives compelled to return to wage-earning inIrder to keep a home together and maintain a family of young children. !y the circumstances of their condition, such women are often not,, men necessity causes them to seek employment, members of any orga-isation, and the need of their dependants may make them ready to. ccept wages below the Trade Union rate. They supply the cheap abour which lowers the standard or customary wage of unorganised vomen, and increases the difficulties of the organised in maintaining he standard they have reached. This dangerous competition will ertainly recur and in more serious form and over wider industrial areas kan before, at the close of a war which must leave many women with roung children widowed, and many others with husbands either incap-ible or only partially capable of supporting their families.The Case for Mothers&apos; Pensions.122. These cases might be met incidentally to the great advantage of the children concerned by some system of Mothers&apos; Pensions which would enable widows and deserted wives (including wives of men serving long terms of imprisonment) to remain at home and care for their child-ren without impossible economic sacrifice. It is not intended to endow motherhood, but simply to compensate the woman who, in order to fulfil er family duties, retires from industrial competition. That such a system is capable of successful practical working has been proved by the experience of the United States, set forth at length in the pamphlet on Mothers&apos; Pensions lately published by the Local Government Board. Much interest in the system has been aroused in this country and approval of its principle is becoming widespread. Besolutions in favour of the adoption of a scheme of Mothers&apos; Pensions on the American model and urging its immediate promotion on the Prime Minister and the Minister of Beconstruction have been passed by 120 Metropolitan, Town, and Urban Dictrict Councils, including those of Bethnal Green, Finsbury, Poplar, Holborn, Islington, St. Pancras and Shoreditch, Sheffield, Portsmouth, West Ham, Cardiff, Oldham, Stoke-on-Trent,. Huddersfield, Gateshead and Willesden. Infant Welfare Centres all over the country, among them Nottingham, Croydon, Sunderland, Man-ckester, Salford, Leicester, Leeds, Liverpool and Perth, have taken similar action and so has the Trade Union Congress in two successive-years.  The working of such a scheme should form a valuable experiment
123. This system might with benefit be extended to the wives of me who, by reason of disability, would otherwise be obliged to transfer i the mothers of their children the task of earning the family incoin The position of such women differs little from that of the widow c deserted wife.Compensation for loss of Earnings.124. A larger question, and one on which we do not propose to offe any final opinion or recommendation, is whether it might not be for tL benefit of the nation, as well as the relief of the labour market, if ther were offered to the woman who is a mother of children under or o school age, and would otherwise seek employment which takes her on of the home, the alternative of compensation equivalent to her in earnings in such employment. We are, however, of opinion thai being a question of great importance, it is deserving of the most seriou and scientific study.Married Women in Commercial and Clerical Occupation^.125. Although modern organisation of retail trade, whether untie limited companies or by co-operative societies, tends to eliminate tin wife from partnership with her husband in business, she still plays ai important part in retail shop-keeping and other branches of commercial enterprise. In 1911 the Census showed one-tenth of the occupied wive; in England and Wales engaged as dealers in food, apart from thosf engaged in inns and hotels or as lodging or boarding-house keepers win collectively formed nearly another tenth of the wives returned as occu pied. If to these large groups be added the number of married womei occupied in drapery and other classes of retail shops, more than one - fourth of the occupied wives are accounted for.Of these wives very few were employees, the great majority assisting husbands or relatives, or running the business on their own account with or without assistance. During the war&apos;the number of wives thus engaged must have increased largely, many travelling from suburban homes to take charge of their husbands&apos; shops or warehouses in their absence. Many will probably continue in business, although those who have always lived on or near the shop premises will be glad to relax their efforts and return to their pre-war position of occasional helper and superintendent.In no other social stratum is the comradeship of husband and wife so close as in what is generally described as the &quot; small &quot; retail trades. Undoubtedly the wife here can take a place which no other can fill so effectively. With the development of intensive agriculture and rural industries the townswoman may be expected to find a place in the marketing branch of her husband&apos;s country business which may be remunerative to both and at the same time secure her from the monotony which the town-bred wife is said to find so oppressive in the rural districts.Clerical training and experience, which at first sight seems to offer a blind alley occupation to women from the point of view of marriage, is in fact perhaps the best preliminary and the most useful aid to wives able to assist their husbands in their business. In 1911 nearly 90 per cent, of adult women commercial clerks (i.e., of 20 years and upwards) were between the ages of 20 and 35. Only a very small percentage of the small proportion of commercial clerks over 35 years of age were married. In the grocery retail trade 68 per cent, of the adult women were over 35 years of age, and of these considerably more than half were wives.

Such opportunities kder it worth while to give daughters, in addition to a good general plication, the special training in book-keeping and accountancy and in be technical subjects of their trade which we have already advocated.Marriage and Retirement in the Civil Service.126. It is obvious from the Table given in the preceding paragraph bt women clerks rarely remain in their employment after marriage.lie same fact holds true of the Civil Service, where women, holding fernianent appointments are required to resign on marriage, and married Fomen are therefore employed only in a non-established or temporary opacity. In the case of permanent women Civil Servants a gratuity -s given on marriage. This gratuity appears to be in the nature of partial compensation for loss of pension rights, but it is not admittedly such. We are of opinion that in the matter of superannuation there should be no discrimination between men and women, and also that when a Civil Servant resigns, whether on marriage or for some other reason, in good health as well as in bad health, he or she should be awarded such pension, or its surrender value, as may be due to his or her length of service.The Committee have had the advantage of considering certain figures relating to the women clerks in the General Post Office, on the basis of ^hich a scheme suggesting new regulations respecting retirement has been submitted to the Committee. In view of its statistical basis the scheme necessarily relates only to women, though, as above stated, the Committee do not feel in a position to support any discrimination in the retiring conditions as between women and men. With regard to the other features of the scheme the Committee are not able to pronounce upon its merits, but is of the view that a case has been made out for enquiry and recommends that a Committee should be appointed for that purpose.
Need for a Committee of Experts.127. An enquiry should be undertaken by a Committee of experts, o which medical science and the experience of trained persons we] acquainted with the conditions of factory life, such as women factor inspectors, should be strongly represented. The Committee should inchni representatives of the National Health Insurance Commission. Thi Committee&apos;s reference should empower them not only to deal with tl physiological aspect, both as regards mother and child, but also to cot sider the economic situation created by any restriction of the labour o working women in connection with motherhood, married and unmarried and to make proposals for the provision necessary to meet the needs o such women. Since administrative difficulties will arise in conneclio with this restriction and provision, we hold that these also should 1j carefully considered by the Departments concerned, with a view t establishing the best possible system of co-operative administration.Smnmary of Recommendations as to Employment of Married Women,128. The employment of married women outside theiJ homes is not to be encouraged.   A free and efficient medical and midwifery service, both before and after con[ nnement, is urgently needed.  More information is re quired as to the numbers and distribution of employe married women. An expert Committee of Inquiry shoul be set up.  The Registrar-G-eneraFs Report should giv statistics of infant mortality  of children up to fivf years old classified according to the occupations of both parents, instead of only according to the father&apos;s, as at present; and death certificates of such children shoul contain this information. Hospital records should give the occupation of their married women in-patients.  Factory creches in normal times are not approved of.We recommend that some system of Mothers-&quot; Pensions, on the lines of that now successfully in operation in the United States, which would enable widows and deserted wives, including the wives of men serving long terms of imprisonment, to remain at home and care for their children, should be established. Such a system might with benefit be extended to the wives of men who by reason of disability would otherwise be obliged to transfer the support of their families to their wives (122, 123).G. Suitability of Employment.Reasons why a Trade is Suitable or Unsuitable.129. Suitability is a complex of various factors. Before 1914 cus-tomary and conventional standards played a great, if unacknowledged, part in assigning to women their share in their country&apos;? service and their means of earning a livelihood. The war has largely dissolved these standards. Vital issues have, in the main, driven out all tests except those which bear the stamp of reality. Before the war it might have been thought unsuitable that women should act as window cleaners or as farm labourers, just because so doing involved wearing men&apos;s clothes; but nowadays any such test would appear ludicrous, and women have won the right to serve their country in any costume they please. Before the war, too, women were practically excluded from many trades for which the war has shown their complete suitability. On the other hand, however, though the war has destroyed some standards which are merely
jnventional,, it has reinforced the importance of those which are essen-al. What these are it is our business to discover, but before doing1 so iiere are one or two preliminary observations to be made. 130. Much of war-time employment in manufacture is expressly of a emporary or substitute character, and is governed by the scope of the ade agreements which made it possible. In dealing with Suitability ?e are once more brought face to face with the question of the fulfilment i the Government pledges. It governs the situation with regard to Mutability, for it is a condition precedent to the admission of women to ertain employments however suitable. What we have to say in this Jeport about Suitability in so far as it relates to trades to which the jovernment pledges apply, must be read on the understanding that hose pledges are carried out.131. In judging whether an industry or process is suitable or unsuit-ble for women it is necessary to consider carefully the real meaning of he word suitability, and to state with clearness, in the case of any ndustry or process from which it is proposed to exclude women&apos;s labour, ie principles governing this exclusion.    There must be a test by hick prohibition can be justified, not only to the world at large but to die women themselves.   They, if they are not to be allowed in all cases ;o sell their labour as they will, must be convinced, as citizens, of the lesirability of restriction.   We have attempted in the following para-jraph to establish such a test and definition.   In so doing, we have had n mind certain &quot; unsuitable &quot; work done by women, often without question, in the pre-war period, as well as that which they have under-taken  during the war while replacing men  in a great national emergency.   For the hard, heavy or excessiveh- hot work performed by women substitutes as boiler-sealers and flue-cleaners, in lime and tan-pit processes in leather tanneries, or at the centrifugals in sugar factories, corresponding examples might have been found, long before 1914, in the labours of women tinplate workers and picklers women flax-spinners, women firebrick makers and chain-makers.   No dirty or dusty trades entered by women workers employed under dilution schemes or in substi-tution for men probably presented conditions worse than those to which women fur-pullers, rag-pickers and gut-scrapers were habitually exposed in normal times.   To recognise this is not to deny that certain classes of work undertaken during the war by women were not suitable for them in the present prevailing industrial conditions,* but to accept the fact that both in war and in pre-war industry women have been engaged in labour which, tried by the standard of suitability, is undesirable.Definition, of Suitability.132. The factors of Suitability can be grouped under two heads: Physiological and Social. The first is concerned with actual bodily lnjury, either to the woman or her offspring, the second with the more difficult problem of mental, spiritual, or moral hurt, and comprises con-ditions which prevent the woman or her offspring attaining the full standard of free citizenship in a civilised community.Bodily injury can happen in several ways. There is, first of all, strain, as in lifting heavy weights, or other excessive muscular exertion. Secondly accident, as from dangerous machinery, which remains dan-gerous, however skilfully guarded, or from fire, as from the ignition of napktka fumes, or from explosion, as in an explosive factory. Thirdly, poison, as in certain paints, in pottery, and trinitrotoluol. Under tke Social kead come suck questions as dirty, wet, and kot work, or excessive* This is especially true of heavy labouring tasks.
exposure to weather, which causes no actual physical harm; work it lonely situations, with its well-known evils; night work, which destroy home life; and work which, while not heavy enough to injure the body yet produces what is defined as &quot; well marked fatigue &quot; in the Report o! the Health of Munition Workers Committee,* a condition not too wel understood now, but which in the future will play a large part in deter mining exclusion; it is a state of fatigue where the recovery of tin individual falls short of the diurnal rhythm of rest and work, whicl reduces the vital capital of the worker and if it does not render her t victim to disease at least prevents her from taking her full share in life.In applying these standards again the primary function of woman n the State must be regarded: it is not enough not to interfere with her service in bearing children, and the care of infant life and health, W she must be safeguarded as the home-maker for the nation.Standard to be Enforced.133. There will be little difference of opinion on the above definitions: the differences will arise in their application. What standard should he enforced ? What degree of danger should cause a process to be for-bidden? What constitutes heavy work? At what point does fatigue exceed the normal? These are some of the questions which have to be answered. The line to be drawn is indeed not a fixed and static one, but will move this way or that according to the ideals of the community and its essential needs. Before 1914 for many years regulation grev more stringent, during the war it has been relaxed; and it is wort! while following the history of regulation before the war, and judging the result of war relaxation to enable us to arrive; at a working applies-tion of our standard.Historical Account of Exclusion of Women from Unsuitable Trades.134. It is necessary to understand at starting the essential change; which the factory system brought to women&apos;s industrial outlook and environment. During the last 125 years important consequences for women have followed on the irresistible change from the domestic to the factory system. There followed a gradual loss of traditional skill in many industries, important exceptions being textiles and some branches of the clothing trade. It was a loss which affected women of the middle and other classes remaining in their homes, as well as those who passed into factories. There also followed a loss of most of the supervision of women&apos;s industrial work by women, and thus of their direct continual personal influence on the conditions of labour, training, apprenticeship and general industrial environment. These two losses acted in conjunc-tion with ever increasing force to degrade women\s labour. Loss of skill meant lower-grade work and diminished industrial self-respect; ignorance c f the primary and essential needs of women workers, due to the absence of female organisation and supervision, meant that the old factory system, unsuited as we now know it to have been to men, was far more unsuited to women. It was only when the evil reached a head, when the injuries, physical and moral, social and economic, were too vital to be disregarded, that the law stepped in. Women&apos;s labour in textiles was first regulated in 1844, the year which saw the first report on the prohibition of the employment of women underground in mines, enacted two years earlier; and in 1844 also factory inspectors were first systematically appointed on something approaching the modern basis. From 1860 onwards one industry after another was brought within the scope of regulation, and  iew ideas arose as to the application of science to health and safety,* Cd. 6095, paras. 85, 86 ; ibid., para. 51.
w,of ell ex-fce:ough the labours of Sanitary Commissions and the medical investiga-:,iis of the Privy Council, until the great consolidating and amending ictory Act of 1878 prohibited employment of girls in certain unsuitable &apos; dangerous processes, and laid the foundation of a centralised in-ectorate under the Home Office. The Acts of 1891 and 1895 gave the jine Secretary power to make special rules, now transformed into liulations, for specially dangerous or injurious work, and to prohibit restrict the emploj-ment of all or any class of person. Finally, in 56, a Medical Officer of Health was for the first time appointed Chief speetor of Factories. Administrative and medical control of injurious ncesses was developed during the next 20 years, and finally the araend-y and consolidating Act of 1901 gave improved methods of regulation ich have largely transformed the ranks of modern factory industry, was not till 1893 that a tardy beginning was made to replace the lost pervision of women by women, and women Factory Inspectors were st appointed. Their numbers grew slowly until there are now 30. iieir annually published reports threw fresh light on woman&apos;s industrial -ition and .needs, and their work has been one of the greatest ministrative successes of modern times.The Position at the Outbreak of War.135. Thus the Factory Acts slowly transformed some of the worst evils. nmen&apos;s hours were regulated; safety was enforced, some dangerous and jurious work was forbidden; their needs were guarded by women spectors.   But nothing was done to restore their lost industrial skill to enlarge the possibilities of employment.   The feeble and sporadic iiort at training women before the war has already been recounted; the limber of substitution agreements which were necessary before they could &quot;employed speak of the wide area from which they were excluded.   The iar, and the war alone, brought adequate training and enlarged oppor-uuity.   But the war also saw removal of restrictions.   What has been lie result?   The result is two-fold.   First, war experience has completely ustified the industrial code contained in the Factory Acts.   Secondly, lie evils of relaxation are not as great as might be feared.   The Health i Munition Workers Committee* report that as a whole the women and iris examined were bearing their work remarkably well.   But it must e remembered that increased care and attention were given to their health; that Munitions took the cream of the workers; that high wages an more and better food; and that it is too soon to be certain that all effects have shown themselves.The Standard of the Future.136. What then is to be the standard after the war? There will be little dispute about machinery. The scheme of the Factory Acts, enabling the Home Secretary to apply to any industry or worker principles which have been laid down by statute is both convenient and safe. It v-&apos;as reinforced in 1916 by the passing of those provisions of the Police, Factories, &amp;c, Act, which, by giving power to the Secretary of State to issue Orders imposing what are known as Welfare conditions, laid additional stress upon the positive and constructive side of industrial legislation. This emphasis is welcome. Nor will anyone deny that Ionian should be guarded from strain, from accident and from racial poison to a greater degree than man is guarded. But there is room for ttiuch difference of opinion as to the administrative standard.* Cd. 6095, para. 90.
Classification of Trades according to Suitability.137. But though it is not feasible or desirable to define the standai too closely, it is possible to carry our investigations beyond the poin reached in the last paragraph. We can do this by taking certain cm crete tests. The Home Office Memorandum contains a classification o non-munition trades in terms of suitability. They are grouped in thre classes. First, there are trades which are absolutely or in the main in suitable; secondly, trades where women were employed before 1914 whicj show enlarged opportunities; and, thirdly, there are the trades in wliic) women were not previously employed, in which they could be suitably em ployed. An examination of these three classes will afford an example o. how the proposed standard would work. Little need be said of the TJji suitable Trades. They are set out on pp. 16-2G of the Home Offic Memorandum on Substitution of Women in non-munition Factorie during the War, and show examples of exclusion on both physiologica -and social grounds. Nor need much be said of Suitable Trades, for tin Home Office Memorandum contains a full account of these also.In trades which before the war were women&apos;s trades, there arc increased opportunities of suitable employment and the same is tin case in many trades not previously women&apos;s trades. The exception are chiefly trades, such as the furniture trade, in which long previous training is required; sections of industry, like the scissors section oi the cutlery trade, involving hot and laborious handwork or con tact with dangerous machinery which has not, so far, been madi safe: and those in which a combination of skill and strength are required; such as rubber-spreading or solid rubber tyre building.The success of women on munitions is shown by Mr. Morgan&apos;s Memo-randum, and many of the peace trades which will take the place oi munitions will be equally suited to them.Sttitability of Clerical and Commercial Work.138. Nearly all such work would be suitable were it not for the indifferent conditions under which much of it is carried on. Office5 are not under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and though they are technically subject to inspection by the Local Authority little Iras been done to better their conditions in fact, in many of our towns, and these not the least wealthy or progressive in business, these con-ditions are bad. At the request of the Committee, Miss Constance Smith, one of our secretaries, prepared a Memorandum printed in Appendix XI. The case for some regulation of offices is a strong one We recommend that, as a first step, offices in factories should be brought under the inspection of the Factory Department. As regards other offices, we urge that immediate enquiries be instituted, either by a Committee or by a Government Department, to discover what form regulation should take.Self-Determination and Adequate Inspection.139. It will greatly facilitate the extensive work of readjustment and guiding of women&apos;s activities into the channels that are safest and healthiest for themselves and the nation, if effective national, din-trict and shop organisation of all the industries, with due representation of women, can be ready in time to co-operate with, and act on, the expert advice of the Factory&quot; Inspectors. For this purpose, also, conservation and building up of the! Inspectorate in sufficient numbers, and with sufficient technical assistance, is an all-important point.The need of a strong medical supervision by both men and&apos;women can hardly be over-stated.   The admirable subsidiary health work done in
of ree m-:chch in of &quot;n-ce ies al he&apos;e le is is )f i-!enumber of large factories by well-qualified women superintendents oiuts to the importance of wise and sound development of this aid to J^ritability of employments for women.Suggestions as to Increased Powers Required for the Regulationof Factories.140. It is very probable that some strengthening of Section 79 of the actory Act, 1901, which provides for regulation of dangerous trades, ill, in the new expansion of openings for women, be found necessary, ! well as some simplification of procedure for establishing regulations. It would be well to include within the scope of the section processes and ccujrations which, without being easily proved to be dangerous to life, :ealth or limb, are rmavoidably so excessively hot that they are not uitable for co-employment of the sexes.   Further, there would be gain o having power to regulate trades which on moral grounds need special are and control as to age of workers or co-employment of the sexes.   A :fw section, simply for keeping under observation by means of periodical uedical examination any industry in which the need for such records is iiown by report of the Medical Inspectors, would be a valuable aid to r-tablishing the case for applying the powers of regulating dangerous excessively heavy or hot occupations, given by Section 79 of 1901 amended as suggested).   At present this means of acquiring exact nformation can only be applied&apos; either with the voluntary consent of the ccupier of a factory or workshop, or as a part of a code of regulations, he necessity for which has to be proved by the Department before they an be established.Suggestion as to Ovcrlairping of Duties of Certifying Surgeon and SchoolMedical Officer.141. Under the new Edircation Act there will be overlapping between the duties of the Certifying Surgeon and the School Medical Officer, -ince the last-named will eventually exercise health functions over young liersons up to the age of 18. We suggest that the matter should1 be at mice considered by the Government Departments concerned with a view to coming to a satisfactory working arrangement.Summary of Recommendations as to Suitability.142. The restrictions on dangerous and unsuitable trades imposed by the Factory Acts and relaxed during war should bo re-imposed immediately on the conclusion of peace. The determination whether trades are suitable or unsuitable must be left to the Government Department concerned, whose powers should be enlarged as mentioned in paragraph 140. Joint Industrial Councils and Trade Union Committees should greatly help in this. An im-inediate enquiry should be held into conditions in offices.H. Homework.143. A review of women&apos;s industrial position would not be complete without some account of homework and some consideration of the unique problems that arise in connection with that section of industry.No Numbers Available.144. The numbers of homeworkers in the various trades are not shown by any of the Census Reports prior to that of 1911, so that no figures can be furnished to support the general view that Homework is declining.   There can be but little doubt, however, that
a decline has taken place. The system by which work is given out to be done off the employees premises and beyond his direct supervision is opposed to the centralising and standardising tendencies of modern industry, and employers protest in increasing numbers that they &quot; cannot be bothered with it.&quot;Objections to Homework.145. Though homework is sometimes accompanied by many evils, such as the employment of very young children or of women up to the moment pf their confinement, public attention has been directed to homework mainly on two grounds one economic and the other hygienic or sanitary. In other words, the aim of regulation, actual or proposed, has been to secure proper rates of payment for the homeworkers and some assurance to the public that the work is done under conditions that are not inimical to public health.Pay of Homeworkers.146. The remuneration of homeworkers is a subject giving rise to many complex considerations. At first sight it would seem that where an employer had to provide neither premises, heat nor light he would be in a position to share part of his saving under these heads with his workers, and that the wages of the homeworkers would accordingly be higher than those of workers employed indoors. Experience show-, however, that this anticipation is seldom realised. In the first place, the cost of distributing work among homeworkers is often very considerable. Though probably the majority of homeworkers are employed in crowded industrial centres, a gTeat deal of homework is done in country districts, and the work is distributed and collected by agents at outlying stations, by carrier or by special delivery carts. In the seexmd place, as has already been indicated, the distribution of work in small lots, the absence of control over its execution and uncertainty as regards its punctual return are disadvantages of Avhich many employers are gravely conscious, and to which a monetary equivalent is attached which may more than counterbalance the &quot;overhead charges&quot; incidental to work done in the factory.While on the one hand employers may thus be unwilling to pay the same price for work done out-of-doors as for work done on their premises the homeworkers themselves are often willing to accept less. In a small number of cases workers employed at home could, without undue incon-venience, go to work in factories; but the position as regards most home-workers is that work in a factory would be either impossible or highly inconvenient. Broadly, therefore, homeworkers and factory workers may offer the same services at different prices, that of the homeworkers being the less.Importance and Difficulties of Organisation.147. This unsatisfactory state of affairs in which two classes of workers are virtually in competition might be improved by Trade Union organisa-tion. The difficulties of organising homeworkers are, however, well-known, and in the past Trade Union propaganda among homeworkers has met with small success. The case of the chainmakers at Gradley Heath indicates, however, that the difficulties are not in all cases in-superable; and any other localised industries carried on mainly or to a large extent by homework might present a similar opportunity.
443Competition of Homeworker with Factory.148. So far it lias been supposed tbat honieworkers and factory workers offer services of tbe same kind. In some cases where the work is done entirely by hand that supposition is true. In other cases, how-ever, which tend to become more numerous with the progress of inven-tion, it happens that while the results of the work are similar the methods are different. The homeworker, working in isolation, is practically cut oft from all the economic advantages of division of labour, while if she uses machinery at all it is usually of a kind much inferior to that with which the factory worker is provided. In the sewing trades, which still afford a large field for the employment of homeworkers, the introduction and development of high-speed power machines has placed the home-worker at the most serious disadvantage. A more popular and cheaper distribution of electrical power and the installation of motors might, it-is sometimes thought, help to remove this handicap, but the heavy initial cost of up-to-date machinery would probably be prohibitive in all but exceptional cases.Low Wages of Homeworkers.149. For the above reasons the remuneration of homeworkers has sometimes reached a level which has shocked public opinion, though it must be observed that lack of training and irregular methods of work have in many instances been the cause of low-earning power on the part of the worker equally with inadequate piece-rates. The often unhappy plight of the homeworkers themselves and fear of the effect of their competition on the wages of the factory workers have thus sometimes led to the suggestion that homework should be prohibited altogether. Such a suggestion, however, could be entertained only if the State were at the same time ready with some provision for the support of those who would thus be deprived of their means of livelihood.Recommendations as to Wages of Homeworkers.150. It does not appear, therefore, that measures can safely be taken beyond the careful regulation of wages with a view to ensuring that, so far as possible, the piece-rates paid to homeworkers shall be sufficient to yield to a worker of ordinary efficiency a reasonable living wage. This suggestion was made by the Select Committee on Homework which reported in 1908,* and the experience of the Trade Boards, which have given effect to the Committee&apos;s suggestion in certain trades, has shown that it is practicable. The Boards, consisting of representatives of the trades concerned, are acquainted with the facts, and by the exercise of due caution have been able to effect improvements in. rates of wages without any violent displacement of labour that would have meant to individual workers hardship and possible destitution.Though effort must, therefore, in the interests of the workers them-selves, be directed to a mitigation rather than a removal of the evils attaching to homework, the fundamental dilemma indicated above needs to be recognised. A detailed survey of the industrial field may disclose some employments, for example, those of an artistic character, in which the homeworker is at no disadvantage as compared with the factory worker. Assuming that adequate facilities can be provided for training, such employment may afford a suitable opening for those women whose circumstances are such that while it is necessary or desirable that they should he employed for gain, their employment elsewhere than in their own homes is impossible.   As regards the great majority of trades in22391* H. of C. Paper 246 (1908).D
which, homework is prevalent, however, the fact that the liomeworker by the evolution of industry and the stress which war experience has laid on increased productiveness, is placed at an increasing disadvantage should be borne in mind; and schemes, sometimes of a semi-philanthropic nature, for the encouragement of homework should be regarded with great caution and even suspicion.Conditions of Homework.151. As regards the measures necessary to ensure that work when done at home is done under conditions of reasonable cleanliness, the existing law requires that persons giving out work shall keep a list of the outworkers employed open to inspection by the Factory Inspector at -any time, and shall forward the list twice a year to the local Public Health Authority. The Public Health Authority has power in certain trades to prohibit any7 person from giving out work to be done in premises which are injurious or dangerous to the persons employed therein. There is some reason to believe that in many cases, probably because of inadequate staff, the local authorities do little or no inspec-tion on the basis of the lists and in some cases take no steps if the lists are not in fact furnished.The work of inspection in the case of homeworkers is necessarily difficult. The prerequisite of satisfactory inspection is, however, know-ledge of where the work is carried on. If the requirements of the existing law with respect to the furnishing of lists of outworkers by those who employ7 them are properly7 enforced the necessary knowledge Avould be available. The Committee understand that the lists are at present accessible as a matter of right only to the local authorities who obtain them and to the factory inspectors. Though the lists are usually-made available as a matter of courtesy to the Trade Board Officers, the Committee feel that some opportunity should be taken of giving such officers access to the lists as a matter of legal right.The more thorough exercise of the powers of the local authorities with respect to obtaining lists of outworkers and of inspecting premises on the basis of such lists is a matter which the Committee feel requires some investigation. The precise measures by7 which any laxity on the part of a local authority in these matters can be remedied, whether by a grant-in-aid or otherwise, fall within the sphere of practical administration, and the Committee do not consider it necessary that they should consider the subject in detail.The present method by7 which the Public Health Authority can be placed in possession of the facts as to the distribution of the wort appears to be simple and sufficient, but it is possible that the law needs strengthening with a. view to the authority having more power to prohibit the carrying on of homework under conditions dangerous to the consumer of the article made as well as to the worker. Should the law be amended as may be necessary in this respect no need would arise to consider the alternative suggestion of confining homework to premises that art licensed, a method that is invidious and open to objections on several grounds and one that -was reported against by the Select Committee referred to.Summary of Recommendations as to Homework.152. Homeworkers and Factory workers are often in com petition and modern industrial developments tend to depress the level of remuneration of the former. The regulation of wages by law must proceed with care lest the homeworker should be deprived of work altogether.
For this reason the regulation should be effected by means of Trade Boards that can take all the facts bearing upon the relative position of homeworkers and factory workers into consideration. Homework should not be encouraged in any trade unless it is clear that the circumstances are such that the maintenance of adequate wages is possible.The general scheme of supervision by the Local Health Authority should be retained; but their powers require strengthening in the direction of prohibiting home-forK under conditions harmful to the consumer as well as to the worker. It is desirable that Trade Board Officers should have legal right of access to the lists of outworkers kept by Local Authorities. Licensing is not recommended.153. The Committee are deeply indebted to their Secretaries, Miss Constance Smith and Mr. G. T. Reid. Miss Constance Smith&apos;s great knowledge of industrial questions, and in particular her intimate acquain-tance with all branches of women&apos;s labour, has rendered her assistance of peculiar value; whilst Mr. Reid&apos;s experience of the working of Trade Boards fitted him in a special degree to help the Committee&apos;s investiga-tions. Miss Whitworth, who was originally appointed as joint secretary nith Mr. Reid, and resigned in 1917, also rendered able assistance. During the latter part of our enquiry Mr. Reid, owing to the pressure of his other work, has not been able to take so large a part as he did in the earlier stages; and the burden has fallen on Miss Constance Smith. She has had to prepare the Report, a laborious task, both from its length and from the detail involved. We cannot speak sufficiently highly of the ability and enthusiasm with which she has thrown herself info the work.154. The following is a Summary of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations: As to Local Government Service.Free entrance to the clerical posts in Local Government Service should be accorded to women. All clerical posts open to men should be open to women. With a view to securing a proper standard of education it should be required that no woman be appointed who had not passed such school or special examination as might be prescribed (31).As to Remuneration.Organisation is of chief importance in securing adequate wages: more general and better organisation is therefore recommended. In addition, sufficient training for indus-try and, in the case of organised workers, a large exten-sion of Trade Boards are thought to be necessary. The Committee&apos;s suggestions on the regulation of wages by law have already been presented see Appendix V. (52).As to Hours.The relaxation of the Factory Acts allowed during war should cease at its termination and excessive overtime, long spells, night work and Sunday work should be for-bidden. There is a prima facie case for a reduction in legal maximum hours, in overtime, and in the length of the22891
shift, and for the abolition of work before breakfast, and the Government should immediately institute enquiries with a view to amending the Factory Acts. We recom-mend the possibility of a 44-hours working week and an annual fortnightfs holiday on full pay for the considera-tion of the Government. Trades should be allowed, within statutory limits, to settle their own hours, subject to Government sanction, a substantial majority having power to bind the minority. Further information is urgently needed as to hours worked in offices, and this should be enquired into. A new Shops Act is required to limit the existing excessively long hours and excessively long spells. Government factories should make experiments to see whether a working day much shorter than at present is not economically possible, and private employers should be urged to follow suit (72).As to Welfare or Conditions.Welfare work must continue after the war, when there should be a single Government authority. The industrial Fatigue Research Board will take the place of the Health of Munition Workers Committee for conducting research and investigation.   It should be the employees duty to I study conditions as he now studies cost of production; and I workers should strive for good conditions as they have 1 striven for good wages.   The workers should operate through Witley Councils and Works Committees, on which organised women must be fully represented. Factory in-spectors should be encouraged to call conferences of em-ployers and employed.  Compulsory action by the State should be used for the purpose of making universal that which experiment has proved to be right.It is hoped that the work of the factory inspector will become more and more merged in that of the expert ad-viser. It requires re-organisation and should be scientifi-cally developed with special reference to health and safety in the factory, and investigation of questions of industrial hygiene, fatigue, disease and mortality. All factories employing women in substantial numbers should have a woman superintendent, who should have managerial status with strictly defined duties, such duties not extend-ing beyond the walls of the factory except in abnormal cases. There should be women members on all Boards and Committees dealing with the interests of women, whether in industry, commerce or clerical work (83).As to Trade Unionism.Organisation should be encouraged in every way. Trade Unions should play an important part in preventing un-employment. Unions comprising both men and women are stronger for bargaining purposes than those consist-ing of women only, but there is work for both classes of unions to do (95).As to Training.Much of the training given for munition making is im-mediately apt for peace requirements and could be adapted
to these requirements without difficulty. The special attention of the Ministry of Reconstruction is called to the advisability of so adapting the training scheme of the Ministry of Munitions. Trade training courses must be planned with a close watch on supply of labour to prevent overstocking. Training must be closely associated to trade methods and requirements. Only individuals able to benefit by training and afterwards to follow the trade in which they have been trained should be admitted to the classes. Methods of training should vary from trade to trade, and the greatest elasticity consistent with efficiency should be encouraged. Apprenticeship, learnership, technical classes, instructional, national, or local factory courses, or combinations of these should all be utilised. Maintenance for women during training must be provided, and should extend to the Health Service touched on in paragraph 33, as well as to industrial and other technical training. The cost both of training and maintenance should be a national charge, and one department only be made responsible for its administration. The Ministry of Labour should at an early date appoint a suitably com-posed Committee to deal with the problem of providing training for women both during resettlement and after-wards ; such a Committee to contain strong representation of industrial experience, including organised labour, both men and women and employers. The Government De-partments chiefly concerned should also be represented. This Committee should be charged with the work of sur-veying the field, investigating existing facilities and ad-vising as to the extent and directions in which these should be amplified, of formulating schemes and advising as to necessary executive machinery, central and local (104,105, 106, 107, 109).As to Employment of Married Women. *The employment of married women outside their homes is not to be encouraged. A free and efficient medical and midwifery service, both before and after confinement, is urgently needed. More information is required as to the numbers and distribution of employed married women. An expert Committee of Enquiry should be set up. The Registrar-GeneraFs Report should give statistics of infant mortality of children up to five years old, classified according to the mother&apos;s occupation, instead of only according to the father&apos;s, as at present, and death certin-cates of such children should contain this information. Hospital records should give the occupation of their married women in-patients. Factory creches in normal times are not approved of (128).As to Mothers&apos; Pensions.We recommend that some system of Mothers&apos; Pensions, on the lines of that now successfully in operation in the United. States, which would enable widows and deserted wives, including the wives of men serving long terms of imprisonment, to remain at home and care for their children, should be established.  Such a system might with22391 D 3
benefit be extended to the wives of men who by reason of disability would otherwise be obliged to transfer the support of their families to their wives (122,123).As to Suitability.The restrictions on dangerous and unsuitable trades irn-posed by the Factory Acts and relaxed during the war should be re-imposed immediately on peace. The deter-mination whether trades are suitable or unsuitable must be left to the Government Department concerned, whose powers should be enlarged as mentioned in paragraph 140. Joint Industrial Councils and Trades Union Committees should greatly help in this. An immediate enquiry should be held into conditions in offices (142).As to Homework.Homeworkers and Factory workers are often in corn-petition and modern industrial developments tend to depress the level of remuneration of the former. The regulation of wages by law must proceed with care lest the homeworker should be deprived of work altogether. For this reason the regulation should be effected by means of Trade Boards that can take all the facts bearing upon the relative position of homeworkers and factory workers into consideration. Homework should not be encouraged in any trade unless it is clear that the circumstances are such that the maintenance of adequate wages is possible.The general scheme of supervision by Local Health Authorities should be retained, but their powers require strengthening in the direction of prohibiting Homework under conditions harmful to the consumer as well as to the worker. It is desirable that Trade Board Officers should have legal right of access to the lists of outworkers kept by Local Authorities. Licensing is not recommended (152).As to Shops.We consider that there is no reason why less protection should be afforded to workers in shops than to those in factories, and we recommend that the provisions of the Factory Acts with regard to hours, with the amendments we have suggested, should be applied to shops.A further point arises with regard to fines and to sanitary conditions. At present no Government authority has power to improve the conditions with regard to fines. Further, the law with regard to the enforcement of the provisions of Section 22 of the Public Health Acts Amend-ment Act, 1890, is far from clear.We think that the Factory Department should have the same power to deal with offences against the Truck Act in shops as they have at present in the factories and work-shops so long as the system of fines continues, and we recommend that provisions to this effect should be inserted in the Truck Act.With regard to the administration of the law with regard to hours of work and sanitary conditions we think that closer co-ordination should be ensured between the local
446uthorities and the Factory Department. Without pro-Bposing to take from the local authorities powers which tiave already been confided to them by Parliament, we think that these powers should be carried on under the supervision and with the advice of the Department con-cerned. We suggest that this object could be satisfactorily attained with the minimum of friction if a grant-in-aid fere paid to the local authorities dependent upon any con-ditions which the Government might see fit to attach to the grant (68).We are,Sir,Your obedient Servants,JOHN  W.

NOTE RELATING TO SCOTLAND BY MISS MITCHELL AND MISSPATERSON.1. The Report deals chiefly with questions of general principle and we are in full agreement with the conclusions reached. It is, howevei necessarily based mainly on experience in England and on the condition] prevailing there.We recognise that the width of the field of reference rendered am other course difficult; and in the discussions of the Committee we have more than once refrained from criticism of proposals and recommendations (desirable in themselves or aiming at desirable objects) although we Inn. seen that differences in local government and in industrial condition, would make it difficult to carry them out in Scotland without modification,This note has reference solely to Scotland, and is not one of dissent but is intended to indicate one or two of the principal modification; which would in our opinion tend to make the recommendations more acceptable to the people in Scotland most concerned.Regulation of AVages by means of Trade Boaiids.   Pah. 52, Api\ V,2. The Committee put forward a memorandum as a matter oi urgency in 1917 with certain suggestions for amendment oi the Trade Boards Act. It was not advisable in the circumstances oi the time to emphasise any difference of view, but now that the Memo randum is issued as an Appendix to this Report, we desire to urge thai, except where the number of workers employed falls below a specified limit, the Minister of Labour shall set up in any trade to which tlit Act is applied a separate Board for Scotland. We believe this pro-cedure would meet the wishes of Scottish Trade Unionists, won!&apos;: stimulate the interest of the workers concerned, and would lead then: to associate themselves more actively with the work of the Boards.Supervision of Shops and Offices.   Para. 68.3. We agree with the recommendations as to shops and offices, but w think it right to point out that we do not believe that the extension ii Scotland of Home Office administration would be acceptable there.The powers and duties of the Home Secretary have been, with certaii specified exceptions, transferred long ago to the Secretary for Scotland and strong objection would be raised to the proposals if they involved tin introduction of the Home Office into any department of industry or social life in which it is not now the controlling authority.Self-determination.   Paragraphs 63, 64, 72.4. We agree with the conclusions reached by the Committee on tin point, but we cannot agree that the right of a majority of a trade to bind i minority should extend to include the right of those engaged in : trade in one country to bind those engaged in it in another. Within tli limits laid down by the Legislature there may be such variation as h tween England and Scotland in the customs of a trade and the habits n the people that the same modifications would not be suitable for both,   i
a example, one of these countries might choose for the distribution of a 4-hour week an eight-hour normal day, and a four-hour Saturday, while jj the other the preference might be for a free Saturday and something jore than eight hours on the remaining days.We do not believe that such freedom would result in the Scottish jction of a trade prejudicing the English rather do we believe the fleet might be in the opposite direction. In certain industries textile, nd dressmaking and also in shops Scotland has led the way in jperimental reduction of working hours.We recommend, therefore, that any machinery set up to enable trades j settle by self-determination their maximum hours, overtime, length ; shift, &amp;c, should be on a national basis or should at least enable ational differences of conditions, practice or progress to be provided for. We are convinced that in this recommendation we are expressing the :ew of large numbers of Scottish workers.Employment of Married Women.   (Par. Ill et seq.)5. We agree that the time is ripe for enquiry into the employment of omen before and after childbirth, and1 that an enquiry should be under-aken without delay by a Committee of Experts.We are convinced, however, that, apart from the purely medical -pect of the question, to secure satisfactory results in Scotland it is of rst importance that the Committee enquiring in Scotland should assess intimate knowledge of social and industrial conditions there, as ell as of Scottish Local Government.We desire to point out that already a considerable volume of infor-ation is available in the Report on the Physical Welfare of Mothers id Children in Scotland, prepared by Sir W. Leslie Mackenzie for ie Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. The National Health Insurance ommission (Scotland) has carried out a wide survey (the results of Inch will, it is understood, shortly be available) of the conditions afler which Maternity Benefit has1 been used and of Maternity and nild Welfare schemes. These investigations can best be continued ad expanded by a Scottish body, and we recommend, therefore, the apointment of a separate Committee to deal with the problem in jotland.It may be noted that the proportion of occupied married women to 1 occupied women and to all married women is much smaller in Seot-:iid than in England. Over 50 of the total number and a much larger ercentage of those industrially employed are found in the four largest irghs (Census of 1911).ISSENTING NOTE by Sir Malcolm Delevingne, Sir Arthur Whitelegge, and Miss Anderson.While we agree in the main with the conclusions of the Committee, :d have therefore felt justified in signing the Report, we are unable endorse all the proposals contained in it, some of which in our dgment require further investigation and consideration. For instance, i doubt the wisdom in present circumstances, having regard&apos; to the Kcult questions arising in connection with women&apos;s employment after :e war, of suggesting any general limit of hours of work a week without ference to the hours of men (par. 59). The proposals also for dealing ith the long-standing question of &quot;Truck&quot; (par. 53) have been made ithout any special investigation of the subject by the Committee. We ink the whole question requires to be carefully considered in connection
with the new movement in industry for the control of workshop con-ditions, and it seems to us possible that a better solution of the questions relating to the maintenance of discipline, standard of work, &amp;c, than a bard and fast rule such as is suggested, may be found on the lines of workshop committees. There is no doubt that in the improvement of workshop conditions generally a great part can be played by the industrial councils and works committees under the Whitley Scheme, and we [ire convinced of the desirability of the State doing everything possible l0 foster their establishment.In some respects also, e.g., the application to shops of the Factory Act provisions as to hours (par. 68), the recommendations would require modification and qualification should they come to be translated into legislation. The proposal mentioned would probably be found inapplio able, for instance, to the small country shops where trade is intermittent,Some of the proposals under the heading &quot; Employment of Married Women &quot; appear to us to require further examination, and we think that the whole subject, should be referred to the proposed Committee ol Inquiry.On the qrrestions of (a) Equal Pay for Equal Work (paras. 48 to 50) which was being separately investigated by a Committee special!; appointed by the Government; (b) Trade Union Organisation ahione State Employees (para. 92) which raises difficult questions of publii policy and was not in our view within the competence of the Committee: and (c) Superannuation in the Civil Service (para. 126) which also seemed to us to be outside the competence of the Committee, we refrain from expressing any opinion.* We also desire to dissociate ourselves froii the remarks in para. 46 as to the administration of the Trade Board-Act by the Ministry of Labour.DISSENTING NOTE by Miss Collet.   (Para. 48. Sub-Para. 2.)Women should be paid the same piece rates as men. Such rates should be fixed high enough to guarantee to ordinary men workers a weekly minimum time wage sufficient for the support of a family. But womei. piece workers should not be compelled to produce the same minimum out-put as men; nor should they be paid the same guaranteed mininniii as men for an habitually smaller output.DISSENTING NOTE by Me. B. H. Glanfield and Mr. Ben. H.Morgan.We dissent from the views expressed in Paras. 48, 49 and 50, to tin effect that women should always receive the same guaranteed minimum rate on piece-work and the same time-rate as men. There are rmmerou; occupations suitable in every respect for women from which they wouli be excluded if this view were applied in practice.Such a view is also in opposition to the principle of &quot; equal pay for equal work &quot; since, in many cases, women would be receiving equal pay for less work.Women must not be placed at an economic disadvantage with men in occupations which are suited to them, but in which at the outset, or after full experience, they are unable to give an equal output.* Miss Anderson has expressed her views on point (a) before Mr. Justice Atkin&apos; Committee.
-   448DISSENTING NOTE by Miss Durham, Miss Paterson, and MissWilson.We dissent from the recommendations of the first sub-paragraph of 126, being of opinion that the Committee had not sufficient facts before them to justify the conclusion therein arrived at.&quot; Equal pay for equal output or equal service &quot; more nearly expresses the view that we take of what is admittedly a very complicated and. difficult question.We do not agree with the statement in Para. 59 that a reasonable working week for women will be found to consist of 44 hours&apos; actual work excluding meal times.While we are in favour of reducing the hours of workers to the full economic limit, we think it is impracticable to make a definite declaration in favour of a 44-hour week, as referred to in Para. 72, as such a week would not apply to very many industries.We are not in favour of a six-hour shift, except possibly in such industries as Soap Manufacturing, where more or less a monopoly exists both in regard to the supply of raw material and markets.We also dissent from the opinion expressed in Para. 90, that mixed Trade Unions appear to offer greater advantages to women than separate Women&apos;s Unions.Until the prejudices that exist in the ranks of male workers against women workers in many trades have diminished the interests of women cannot, in our opinion, be so well served through the medium of a mixed Union where women are in a minority.Separate Unions do not prevent co-operation on questions of common interest.We further wish to make it quite clear that we are opposed to the Government embarking in commercial manufacturing operations in National factories, except as a purely temporary expedient to find employment for workers during the period of reconstruction.
23rd January, 1919Dear Sib AUCKLAND GEDDES,NATIONAL FACTORIES.We desire to draw your attention to a matter of urgent importance, the position and the immediate destiny of the National Factories.We have learnt with considerable surprise, that some of the -National Factories haVe already been disposed of, and that the immediate sale of others is contemplated!It appears ta us that in the present state of industry, the retention of at anv rate some of such factories is of extreme importance.In the first place, there is at present a condition of wide-spread unemployment due to the uncertainty of future markets and the dislocation of industry. At the same time, it is clear that in a very short period a demand will exist for many articles of national importance. Secondly, the continued existence of such establishments as the national factories under government control would enable many useful experiments to he tried both in the manufacture of articles not hitherto produced in the country, and in industrial experiments with regard to the relation of hours and output and other matters. Thirdly, it would be of much value to women if some oojuld be turned into Instructional a&apos;nd Demonstra-tion Factories. Fourthly, we understand, that some Local Authorities would be glad to take over the factories in their areas as Local Technical Schools.We suggest, therefore, that certain of these factories should be retained for the purposes above indicated, and in especial for dealing with unemployment on a satisfactory basis.It has often been pointed out that the rational motliod of dealing with unemployment is to employ unoccupied la&apos;bour by producing articles for which a demand can be foreseen in the near future. The difficulties experienced by those who had tried extempore schemes for the employment of the unemployed are well known. The Central Committee for the Employment of Women, for instance, adopted in the earlier days of the War the principle that work and not doles should be given. They had, however, neither the buildings nor the appliances necessary as they commanded no large or certain markets for the goods produced, and were dealing with a multitude of inexperienced workers who had to be provided from the very beginning with such employment as could be provided.The present situation is altogether different, owing to the existence of the National Factories. Buildings and equipment are available and workers engaged there are bodies of skilled persons accustomed to work together.Further, it is evident at the present time that a large demand will shortly exist for many Articles of national importance. For example, to carry out the housing scheme foreshadowed by the Government many millions of doors, window frames, and other woodwork fittings will be necessary, -besides numerous metal articles, stoves, fenders, locks, etc., needed in house construction. Doors are already being manufactured in the Government factory at Woolwich.We venture, therefore, to ask your serious consideration of these facts in connection with the disposal of the National Factories, and wo earnestly hop.^ that you will see your way to consult with the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Munitions on the issues involved.Yours faithfully, (Signed) JOHN W. HILLS.APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM BY THE INDUSTRIAL GROUP ON ASSISTANCE IN FINDING EMPLOYMENT, TRANSFERENCE TO OTHER DISTRICTS AND PROTECTION AGAINST AND DURING UNEMPLOYMENT  &apos;We are stating our proposals in as concise a form as possible, leaving details to be considered later if the general suggestions are approved. Our aim has been not to produce a finished and final report, on every phase and detail of which
agreement is sought, but a statement which would indicate generally the mind c  the Committee and serve as a provisional and interim report should such be desired by the Reconstruction Committee.In making the following suggestions, we have borne in mind that with the cessation of war, a man&apos;s problem will arise as well as the women;s problem, and we therefore recognise that the measures proposed may possibly require some modification when the question of employment after the War is considered as a whole.1. It is an essential requirement, and one which we have assumed throughout, that the machinery of the Employment Exchanges, which must obviously deal with most of the points raised in this memorandum, shall be adequate to cope with the increased demands which may be made upon it at the end of the War.2. In order to establish a connecting link between the administration of the Employment Exchange and local Trade Unions a&apos;nd working class opinion, we propose that local advisory committees which there is statutory power to set up in connection with Employment Exchanges should be increased in number, and should consist as at present of representatives of employers and employed, with officers of the Employment Exchanges as secretaries (of. report of Sub-Committee on the Demobilisation of the Army). We suggest that the woman officer should act as joint secretary and as secretary of the Sub-Committee described later. We think that a Central Committee similarly constituted, save for the presence of representatives of the Government Departments concerned, is also required as a means of linking together these local Committees, and that it would be desiraible to appoint such a committee in the first place in order to consider what questions should he referred to the local Committees. We do not feel able, at this stage, to define the duties which should be assigned to these Committees, but we think there are various question of policy which will arise both on questions treated in this memorandum, and likely to be treated by this Sub-Committee under other heads, and by the Sub-Committee on relations between employers and employed, for which such machinery is essential if the Employment Exchanges arc to command the confidence of the working classes.We do not propose that they should have executive functions or that they should in any sense control individual exchanges or give instructions to officers. Their powers should be concerned with deciding questions definitely referred to them by the Central Committee which should be advisory to the Ministry of Labour, and with considering complaints connected with the working of the Employment Exchanges and reporting their findings to the head office, and with making repre-sentations as to matters of policy on which the Ministry of Labour would consult the Central Committee. They might also usefully direct the attention of other departments such as the Home Office or the Medical Research Committee, to grievances which may be brought before them incidentally, or to the need for further scientific knowledge on industrial questions.We are regarding these Committees as a permanent part of Employment Exchange machinery, but also as the most suitable bodies to deal with questions arising on demobilisation of women.We consider it essential that the chief trades in the district should bo repre-sented on the. Local Committees, and that a certain number of places on these Committees should be reserved for representatives of women&apos;s trades, and that some proportion of these should be women. We have considered the question of separate Committees, to deal with wome^fs questions, but have no doubt that the same Committee should be responsible for dealing with the problems as they affect both men and women. Since, however, these Committees will necessarily be bodies consisting of many members, we think it desirable that there should be special sub-committees (both central and local) which would make recommendations to the main Committee with regard to all questions affecting women. It is possible that in some districts it may be desirable that the. .cnb-Committee should co-opt further representatives of women&apos;s trades, if it has not been practicable tc secure that all the important women&apos;s trades in the district were represented on the main Com-mittee. There are obvious disadvantages in this procedure, and it should not be necessary in all areas.We have already suggested that the Committees should consist only of represen-tatives of employers and workers and in this connection we desire to refer to the Resolution to this effect passed by the Trades Union Congress held at Birmingham in September last and to the similar view stated strongly in the recent pamphlet issued by the Labour Party on the subject of Demobilisation.In view of the fact that one of the chief aims of the Committee is to brin^ the Unions into more cordial relation with the Employment Exchanges, the importance of deferring to the feeling thus expressed can hardly be over emphasised.
At the same time, it is recognised that there are numbers of women not definitely connected with the Trade Union Organisations whose qualifications for member-ship of the proposed Committees would readily be admitted by the Trade Unions themselves, and it is thought that there would be every desire to utilise the services of these women if their admission to the committees did not entail the risk of the admission of other women whom Trade Union opinion might regard as antipathetic.It is thought that the solution of the dimcutly of satisfying Trade Union opinion and of ensuring the presence on the Committee of various women whose services in that capacity would be of great value, might lie in the creation of a Nominations Committee composed in a manner agreeable to Labour opinion and preferably by the choice of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress. To this Committee would be entrusted the task of selecting the representatives of workers, both on the Central and Local Committees, after considering as regards the representatives of women the claims, not merely of members of women&apos;s indus-trial organisations, but of others, including women members of the Advisory Com-mittees on Women&apos;s War Employment, who have knowledge and experience of industrial questions. In selecting women members of the Local Committees the Nominations Committee might be referred to the practice of the Statutory Com-mittee on Pensions which, where effective Trade Unions exist, have invited these to nominate representatives, and in the absence of effective Trade Unionism, have invited nominations from the Joint Committee of Women&apos;s Industrial Organisa-tions to which are affiliated Trade Unions admitting women to membership and other associations of working women, such as the Women&apos;s Co-operative Guild and the Women&apos;s Labour League. This Joint Committee is understood to have avail-able for submission a comprehensive list of women who are known in connection with various phases of social and industrial work.Further, we are of opinion that in dealing with certain of the questions such as board and lodging accommodation, considerable use might be made of the experience of various types of social workers who might be called upon by the Women&apos;s Sub-Committee to assist in such matters.3. We propose that in the case of women engaged on work which will be diminished or terminate with the War, and possibly in certain other cases whero they have undertaken the work of men, the Employment Exchanges, when there appears to be a definite prospect of the approach of peace, should send forms to managers of national factories and to employers for distribution to their women workers asking them for such information as will facilitate their transference to other work if desired, e.(j., whether they were employed before the War if so, in what branch of what trade; whether they wish to return to their former employ-ment: whether, if not employed before the War, they will now require employment, and, if so, what trade they desire to follow. Those who wish to go on working should be asked to name the locality in which they were employed, and should bo offered facilities for returning to their own trade in the same district. The object of this proposal is that means should be ready to deal with individual cases. We suggest that forms should be prepared arid printed at once, in order that they should be sent to Employment Exchanges and distributed by them when the moment arrives. It is desirable that the filling in of the forms should be carefully supervised and that assistance should be given by the Employment Exchange officials where possible. - The returns which are now being prepared for the Sub-Committee by the Board of Trade will serve to define the magnitude of the problem before the information suggested by us, which is necessary for dealing with it in detail, is collected.We wish in this connection to direct the attention of the Sub-Committee to the figures on pages 15 to 21 of Document 25, showing that so much as 29 per cen,t. of the women are employed on Government work.We understand that it is proposed under the Army Demobilisation Scheme that when peace is in sight forms should be sent to employers asking whether they arc prepared to take back a soldier previously employed by them and whether this will mean displacement of a substitute. It must be remembered that the person displaced will not necessarily be the substitute, indirect cr direct, of the soldier, but may be some other worker. We suggest that the employer, when filling in these demobilisation forms, should be required to enter the name of the worker whom he proposes to dismiss, in a register. The forms referred to above could then be supplied at &quot;once to these workers by Employment Exchange officials.4. We suggest that for a period of a year after the War, free railway passes should be furnished by the Employment Exchanges to women who are going to definite work which has been procured for them through the agency of the Exchanges, or of the genuineness of which the Exchanges are otherwise satisfied.
We do not propose to limit a worker to one free pass but contemplate cases where the first job will prove unsatisfactory within the year, and where another pass should be given.We considered the question of repatriation passes (i.e., passes to finable workers who had moved to work away from their homes, to return to them), but find it difficult to recommend that these should be distributed freely. In most cases, if workers wish to return home for a holiday, they will have money to do so when, they are discharged, and if they are returning home to work they will be able to obtain a work pass. It is not desirable to encourage a universal holiday at the end of the War, as such trades as are able to resume work on ordinary conditions should, for obvious reasons, do so at the earliest possible date. But at the same&apos; time there will bo instances in which it may be important that a town should be relieved at once of surplus labour which it cannot absorb, and that workers should, oe sent to their homes though they may eventually have to be transported elsewhere when work can be found for them. In order to meet this difficulty, we suggest iat Employment Exchanges should be given discretionary powers to offer in such, cases repatriation passes to which special conditions might be attached.5. We suggest that an Inter-Departmental Committee should be set up in order to secure co-operation between the main contracting Departments (Admiralty, War Office, and Ministry of Munitions). This Committee should consider the possibility of easing the dislocation of the labour market which must be caused&apos; by the sudden termination of War contracts by endeavouring to secure that the main trades in. a particular town should not be hit at the same time, or should receive special consideration as regards the distribution of new contracts or of supplies of raw material, required for ordinary industries but now commandeered for war purposes,, which will be set free.This Committee should also be entrusted with the duty of issuing to controlled establishments general instructions as to the order in which they should dismiss labour, e.g., whether they should dismiss first those who came from a distance or had recently joined.It is important that any Committee or Committees dealing with the adaptation of war factories to other purposes, should, if possible, time their new developments, so far as those add to the sum of employment, to coincide with the contraction of the demand for women&apos;s labour.6. While we desire to avoid anything in the nature of the fallacy that the amount of work to be done is a fixed1 qi Aiitity we are nevertheless bound to recog-nise that during the period of adjustment following the War there may be more persons seeking employment than there are vacancies which they can fill. The question arises therefore whether there is any broad method by which those whose need for employment is more urgent can be differentiated from those whoso need is less, and if so whether it is possible so to profit by this division that such unemployment as may occur is attended by the least hardship. Following this line of enquiry, we think that juvenile workers, and especially tho.se under 16, should be distinguished from adiilts. It is true that the juvenile and the older workers often have different spheres of usefulness, and that in some cases the employment of a boy or girl does not necessarily mean the exclusion of an adult. Broadly, however, there can be no doubt that the opportunities of employment of adults would be substantially affected if the flow of new, that is juvenile, labour into a trade were restricted.At a time of expanding trade such a restriction might, from the purely indus-trial point of view, properly be the subject of criticism; but on the assumption which underlies the whole of this memorandum, namely, that the volume of cmploy-ment will be temporarily contracted, such a criticism fails. It also must be borne in mind that war conditions have swollen the supply of juvenile labour, and that there is consequently lost ground to recover.Moreover, apart from the foregoing considerations it would be unwise, even if it were possible, to restrict the outlook to the mere quantity of labour, and to have no regard for its quality. It is indisputable that many of the young persons who year by year enter industry are so inadequately educated that their purely indus-trial efficiency remains permanently of a low order. War experience lias shown the superiority both as regards adaptability and enthusiasm of the educated over the tmeducated woman, and we suggest that there would be an ultimate social gain, as well as an immediate alleviation of labour conditions after the war, by some restriction of the employment of juveniles in the interests of education.Measures of educational reform are, we understand, under consideration by a separate committee, and we have no desire to trespass on that ground, by making specific proposals.    We suggest, however, that in considering the opportunities of
employment of women after the War, the incidental but important industrial consequences of such measures as the raising of the school age and the diminution of the hours of work of juvenile workers for the purpose of continuation classes should not be lost sight of.7. We are aware that it may also be desirable to make special proposals as to the employment of married women, but we defer this question until it has been considered by the Sub-Committee.8. It is to be hoped that exceptional unemployment after the War will not occur;, and it is possible that such measures as have been or may be suggested will avert any severe dislocation of industry. The industrial consequences of the War may be properly regarded, however, as of national concern, and, should the preventive measures taken be ineffective, responsibility for the necessary remedial steps should rest with the Government.It does not appear to us that on the assumption of exceptional unemployment the present provision of Unemployment Insurance is sufficient to meet the case, inasmuch as it takes no account of:(a) the unemployment which must be indirectly caused by the cessation ofthe War among trades which will be affected by the reduced spending power of munition workers or others now earning good wages (this applies to necessities as well as to luxuries 6uch as cheap jewellery), or to the decrease in comforts sent to soldiers.(b) the unemployment in partially, insured trades,  such as hosiery, as aresult of the contraction caused by the cessation of Government orders, which will not necessarily fall on the insured, as the employer will discharge his least valuable hands, who may be in many cases the uninsured.We suggest, therefore, that powers should be taken immediately to extend the scope of Unemplo3mient Insurance universally. By means of a subsidy it should be arranged tihat a&apos;ll persons not already insured should be deemed to have been insured since such a date as is necessary to bring them effectively into insurance when the need arises. In order that those who were previously insured should have the benefit of their additional contributions, some adjustment in their favour would be necessary. Adjustment would also be necessary in the case of those who entered employment later than the date specified.Trades with strong Trade Union organisations, eg., the cotton trade, which do not desire to be included, should be required to show that they have enrolled the bulk of the workers concerned and are prepared to make satisfactory provision for their members. Machinery should bo available for the retrospective extension of Unemployment Insurance in such cases if it were shown to bp necessary at a later date, and an increase in the contributions must, of course, form part of such machinery.We suggest that the scale of contributions should bo graduated in such a way that in the case of workers receiving below a certain wage, the whole of the contributions would be paid by the employer.Im the absence of actuarial guidance we axe, of course, unahle to form rnoro than a vague estimate of the cost of the above proposals, and we realise that the financial ^aspect will need careful consideration. It does not seem probable, however, that, regarded as an expense directly attributable to the War, the cost would be prohibitive. It needs, moreover, to be borne in mind that against the direct outlay should be offset the amount which in any ease would need to be expended in cruder forms of relief, to say nothing of the special gain in the maintenance of the health and self-respect of the workers during the period of their unemployment. It should also be remembered that it will be desirable to close down at short notice the manufacture of certain classes of munitions e.g., shells, and adjust the works to peace conditions,, thereby temporarily causing great dislocation. In such cases it would not only be wasteful to accumulate large stocks in order to avoid dismissing workers at short notice, but the raw materials will be urgently needed for the re-establishment of other trades.9. It is, of course, hardly to be hoped that ial flat payment of 7s. or 3s. 6d., as the case mav be, will obviate serious hardship in all individual cases. In order to deal with those it may be necessary to have recourse to definite relief schemes, and ehould the Sub-Committee wish to pursue their enquiries in this direction, the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Employment &apos;should perhaps be invited to present some memorandum with reference to its aims and achievements which would furnish a&apos; basis for consideration.
WOMEN&apos;6 EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE CLERICAL AND COMMERCIAL GROUP ON THE MEMORANDUM ON &quot; ASSISTANCE IN FINDING EMPLOYMENT, TRANSFERENCE TO OTHER DISTRICTS, AND PROTECTION AGAINST OR DURING UNEMPLOYMENT.&quot;The Clerical and Commercial Group having considered the above Memorandum, decided to report as follows with fespect to the various suggestions contained jn the Memorandum, hearing in mind the appropriateness of such suggestions to Clerical and Commercial employment: (a) That the task of re-settling women in normal or civil occupations is properly one for the Employment Exchanges, which should be made adequate for the task.(b) That existing Advisory Committees of Employment Exchanges sho*uld be increased in number, and strengthened, in order to establish a connecting link between the administration of the Employment Exchange and local Trade Union and working-class opinion, and that a Central Advisory Committee should be created for purposes of co-ordination: Provided that in setting up the Committees,, both Local and Central, special care should be taken to give representation to clerical and commercial workers. It was agreed, also, to note that in approving the recommendation in the Memorandum it was surmised that the clerical and commercial representatives on the Committees would form separate Sub-Committees.(Miss Collet dissented from the foregoing recommendations, her view being that clerical and commercial workers should be represented by separate Committees.)ic) That workers&apos; representatives should be selected by a Nominations Com-mittee composed in a manner agreeable to labour opinion.id) That when peace is in sight forms should be sent to Government Depart-ments and to large employers of clerical labour for distribution to their women workers, asking them for such information as will facilitate their transference to other work if desired.(c) That employers should be requested, when filling in forms required under the Army Demobilisation Scheme, to enter in the register the name of * any workers whom it is proposed to dismiss to make room for a dis-charged soldier, and that a copy of the register should be sent to the Employment Exchange.if) That within twelve months after the end of the war not more than two free railway passes should be furnished by the Employment Exchanges to women who are going to definite work, and that in certain cases the Exchanges should have discretion to give passes enabling women brought from a distance to return home, whether they have definite work or not.((/) That an Inter-Departmental Committee of the chief Government Depart-ments employing clerical labour should be set up to decide the order in which the women workers employed by them should be discharged.-(h) That where practicable the selection of women for retention after the War should be by means of examination, and that for this purpose there should be a relaxation of the usual age limit to enable all women to compete.(?) That attention should be drawn to the fact that unemployment in general is a matter of greater hardship to an adult than to a juvenile; that educational reforms may furnish incidentally a means by which the competition of immature to older workers can be reduced; and that the salaries of clerks have in the past been lowered by the competition of incompetent young people.ij) That unemployment insurance should be extended on the lines suggested in Section 8 of the Memorandum, to all women clerical and commercial workers in receipt of salaries of less than  160 a year, and that registration during the period of unemployment should be effected at the Employment Exchanges.

I. The Need for Wage Regulation.The Industrial Group of the Sub-Committee on Women&apos;s Employment after the War have considered the need for the State regulation of wages in womonV occupations, and the means by which such regulation, if deemed desirable, can be effected.So far the regulation of women&apos;s wages has taken place under the Trade Boards Act and under the Munitions of War Act. Experience under the latter measure is of less value than that under the former, inasmuch as the special condition^ prevailing in establishments wholly or mainly engaged on Government work render a generalisation to commercial employment of doubtful validity. The Trade Boards Act has, however, been in force since 1910, and action taken under it, though admittedly tentative, justifies the conclusion that a bolder application can be made of the principle which it embodies.Such an extension of the principle of the minimum wage would be desirable apart from the special requirements and opportunities to which the war hoc given rise. The conditions which will supervene on the cessation of the present war serve, however, to make specially urgent such a measure of social reform, and we recommend that steps be taken at the earliest possible moment to set up the necessary machinery.A considerable dislocation of industry at or soon after the close of the war appears to be inevitable, and the conditions which may be expected to prevail are exactly these which are favourable to a sudden and considerable fall in tin-level of remuneration in semi-skilled and unskilled occupations. In a number of industries in which women are largely employed a reasonable level of remuneration has been obtained for the first time. This improvement, which it is desirable so far as possible to maintain, is due partly to general economic conditions and partly to the action taken under the Munitions of War Act. The Statutory Orders, under which such minimum rates as 4%d. or 5d. an hour have been fixed, apply to workers employed on Government work in &quot; controlled &quot; establishments, so that with a diminution in Government orders the number of workers affecteti would shrink. And in any case, the continuance of the Munitions Acts on which the Statutory Orders are based would be a course to which trade unions are strongly opposed and one which we do not recommend.Apart from those workers who, by State action or otherwise, have been raised to a wage-earning level which it is desirable to maintain, there are still large numbers who have shared but to a small extent in the upward movement of wages due to the war, and whose lot has become one of great hardship owing to the increase in food prices. The unfortunate position of these workers calls for immediate attention.The protection of a minimum wage for as many women workers as possible in recommended, therefore, for a two-fold purpose. One purpose is to safeguard the position of women in trades where a reasonable level of remuneration has already been reached in order that they shall not sink back to a condition which is socially undesirable; the other is to raise by such mea.ns as are possible those women workers employed in trades in which, notwithstanding war conditions, the rates of wages are unduly low.II. The Machinery for Wage Regulation.The question now needs to bo considered as to what method should- bo adopted to secure the above-mentioned ends. In our view the most satisfactory means of prescribing minimum rates are to be found in the establishment of Trade Boards We have no hesitation in supporting the principle that wherever possible the wage-fixing power in any trade should reside in carefully selected representative; of that trade, and although we suggest below certain amendments of the Trade-Boards Act to which we attach importance, we are of opinion that the Act ie in principle an excellent one and that the powers vested in the Boards set up under it are well devised.RECONSTRUCTION   COMMITTEE.MEMORANDUM  BY   THE   INDUSTRIAL  GROUP   OF   THE   SUB-COMMITTEE   ON  WOMEN&apos;S   EMPLOYMENT,orREGULATION   OF  WOMEN&apos;S  WAGES  AFTER   THE WAR.
Id may be observed here that since Trade Boards cannot be established for the ffhole of industry, at any rate in the time available, there will be a residuum of irorkers who will be without such protection. The position of this class is con-sidered below Section V. of this Memorandum.III. Trades for which Tbade Boabds should be Established.It is felt to be desirable therefore that Trade Boards should be set up as soon as possible in those trades in which women and girls are largely employed. The trades specially suitable for regulation by Trade Boards appear to be women&apos;s clothing trades, certain -textile trades (e.g., jute, linen and hemp), certain branches of the food trade in which women were employed prior to the war, the tobacco trade, aeroplane manufacture and various branches of the woodworking trades, ertain sections of the engineering and metal trades, the paper, stationery, printing and bookbinding trades, and various miscellaneous trades among which soap and chemicals, leather and rubber and brushes and brooms may be specially mentioned. In this connection reference may be made to a. Table which -was furnished to the ?roup showing a list of trades, with relevant statistical information, for which trade Boards might suitably be established. This list is not formally submitted js a recommendation, but it indicates in general the field which might be covered by an extension of Trade Boards. It should be observed, however, that the list n-a.3 compiled mainly with those trades in mind in which the establishment of a Trade Board would have a remedial rather than a preventive purpose, and hence Joes not include such trades as aeroplane manufacture, in which the aim of a Trade Board would be to prevent the wages at present paid falling below a reasonable standard.No precise calculation of the numbers of workers affected by the suggested extension of Trade Boards is possible. It appears, however, that the number of women and girls who, after the war, will be retained in industrial occupations irith which alone this group is concerned) may be estimated at about 2i millions. Of this number it is estimated that about one million, in addition to 320,000 under existing Trade Boards, could be covered by such an extension as has been outlined.IV. Suggested Amendments of the Trade Boakds Act.As indicated above, we consider that certain amendments of or improvements in the Trade Board system are desirable. Some amendments of the Act, though loubtless important, would relate to matters of detail. In regard to these we refrain from making suggestions, assuming that the Department concerned will obtain advice direct from those who, as officials or as representative members of existing Trade Boards, have been concerned with the administration of the Act.Certain other amendments are of a more general character, and in regard to :hese we offer some observations.(a) Method of Applying the Act to New Trades and Class of Workers.Extension of the Trade Boards Act is at present effected by Provisional Order. This procedure is unnecessarily slow now that the application of the Act may be fairly regarded as having passed beyond its experimental stage. Some other aiothod is therefore to be preferred which, while giving opportunity for the roicing of the interests affected, is more flexible and expeditious.With this object we recommend that either of the two following courses, or some modification of them, should be adopted:  1. That a comprehensive list of trades should be incorporated in a schedule to an Amending Act, and that power should he given to the Ministry of Labour to add further trades by a procedure similar to that by which the Secretary of State makes regulations under Section 80 of the Factory and Workshop Acts. 2. That the Minstry be given power to set up Trade Boards for any class of workers by a Statutory Order, which would lie on the table of both Houses of Parliament for 40 days. The second course is the simpler, while the first (under which public enquiry would be necessary if objection were raised to the proposals to establish a Board) would provide a firmer check on the exercise of Departmental discretion.(b) Classes of Workers Affected.Under the Trade Boards Act at present it appears to be doubtful whether minimum rates can be fixed by Trade Boards for many workers in their respective
trades who are not directly or closely concerned with the manipulative or manu-facturing processes. This has resulted in the exclusion from the advantages of the Act of such workers as warehouse hands, errand girls, lift attendants and others, which cannot be justified on equitable or practical grounds, and carries with it a certain inconvenience both to employers and to those responsible for the enforcement of the minimum rates.   This should be remedied.(c) Procedure in bringing minimum rates into effect.It is recommended that Section 7 of the Act should be substantially altered in tho sense that when a minimum rate has been fixed by a Trade Board, after three month&apos;s notice of proposal has been given as at present, the rate should, after a further month&apos;s notice has been given, become fully obligatory on the trade unless the Minister of Labour make an Order to the contrary.The present provisions of Section 7 are unnecessarily complicated and elaborate. Employers often make no use of the six months&apos; limited operation of a minimum rate; and the postponement of its full operation, during which time it is obligatory on some employers and not on others, tends to cause uncertainty and inequality iii the trade.(d) Provision for learners.Under the Act as it is at present framed, a Trade Board has power to fix special minimum rates of wages for &quot; special classes &quot; of workers. Most Trade Boards have exercised this power to fix minimum rates for learners. The conditions which must be satisfied in order that a worker may bo deemed to be a learner are by this means introduced as part of the definition of the &quot; special class.&quot; We suggest that instead of this indirect or inferential power there should be substituted a char and direct provision by which Trade Boards can prescribe reasonable conditions of learnership in their respective trades, which must be satisfied if the worker concerned is to come under the minimum rate for learners in lieu of that for workers other than learners.(e) Method of fixing wages for piece-workers.An amendment of the present provisions of the Act with regard to piece-workers is, in our opinion, desira&apos;ble. At present in cases where a time-rate but no general minimum piece-rates arc fixed by a Trade Board, each employer can arrange his own piece-rates, provided that each rate is sufficient to yield, in the circumstances of the case, not less than the minimum time-rate to an &quot; ordinary &quot; worker. On piece-rates so arranged the worker who is better than ordinary can earn more than the equivalent of the&apos;minimum time-rate, and the worker who is slow, or sub-ordinary, would earn less.This provision has its advantages and disadvantages, the chief advantages being:  (a) That it secures to the efficient and industrious worker the benefit of horsuperior output;(b) That ft tempers the rigour of a minimum rate to the case of a worker whois delicate or slow either temporarily or permanently, and who might otherwise lose her employment through not being worth the minimum;(c) That it allows for differences in factory organisation, and results in theemployer whose establishment is inefficiently organised being obliged to pay higher piece-rates than would otherwise be necessary. Against these advantages a number of considerations may bo urged. The pro-vision is found not to be easily understood by either employers or workers. The question who, in any given group of workers, is the ordinary worker by reference to whose capacity a piece-rate should be judged, is to a great extent one of opinion or point of view; and in the actual conditions of industrial life it is difficult to ensure that, without careful coaching by one of the Trade Board officers, an employer will attach to the expression &quot; ordinary,&quot; just that shade of meaning which the Trade Board and those responsible for administration require. There is a tendency therefore for employers either to do too much or too little; either to interpret the Act as requiring that every piece-worker shall earn the minimum, or else to think that so long as some peace-workers can earn the minimum the obliga-tions are fulfilled.The employees difficulty is enhanced by the fact that the Act requires that each piece-rate shall satisfy the conditions mentioned, and where the workers are, employed on a variety of jobs consisting of short runs of work paid at different rates, he is obliged either to trust to instinct, which is not always unerring, or to
attempt an analysis of his rates on lines which are unfamiliar and often extremely troublesome.On the side of the workers the position thus created is also one of uncertainty, ilie individual worker usually has no opportunity of judging the general yield of d, piece-rate, and if she herself fails to earn the equivalent of the minimum time-rate, may be genuinely in doubt even if she has a clear understanding of the pro-visions of the Act whether the fault is with the piece-rate or herself.It appears, therefore, that the present provisions of the Act with regard to piece-tvorkers, though well designed where there is a clear understanding of the obliga-tions imposed, give rise to considerable misunderstanding and uncertainty. This defect we consider is incompatible with an extension of the Act on a considerable scale. If large numbers of persons are to be affected, it is important that the main obligations imposed should be clear cut and easily understood, and we suggest that this end should be secured, even, if need be, at the expense of some of the elasticity of the present provisions.In our view every worker in the trade for which a minimum rate is fixed should be entitled to not less than that rate for the number of hours during which she is employed, unless she holds a Permit of Exemption issued by or on behalf of the Trade Board In other words, we suggest for peice-workers a guaranteed minimum time-rate, subject to the extension to them of the present provisions of the Act with respect to time-workers who suffer from some infirmity or physical injury ivhich renders them incapable of earning wages at the minimum rate.The task of issuing individual Permits of Exemption to piece-workers may appear considerable, and it would no doubt be too heavy for Trade Boards themselves. The needs of the case might, however, be met by entrusting the Investigating Officers or other officials of the Boards with power to grant the Permits with a right of review reserved to the Boards themselves. *The minimum time-rate thus secured to piece-workers might or might tiot be the same as that for time-workers. On the precedent of the Ministry of Munitions Orders 9 and 10/11917, it would be less and we see no objection to this principle.Side by side with the greater definiteness and certainty which the arrangement suggested would secure, we think that the principal advantages of the present provisions could be substantially maintained by the requirement that while a piece-worker must be paid not less than a certain time-rate, the piece-rates on which she is employed should be such as to yield not loss than some specified percentage in addition to that time-rate to an ordinary worker.We should, in short, superimpose the present provisions of the Act &apos; on a guaranteed minimum time payment. This again follows the precedent of the Munitions Orders. It is true that certain difficulties to which we have directed criticism would be thus perpetuated, but -jhose difficulties would be much less serious when apart from the adequacy of the piece-rates each employer knows that he must pay, and each worker knows she is entitled to receive, not less than a certain sum for every hour workedV. Provision for Workers Xot Covered by Trade Boards.In the discussions which have taken place prior to the former drafting of this Memorandum, the attention of the Group has been directed to the fact that though Trade Boards be established on the scale proposed above (Section III) there would still be large numbers of women to whom the protection of the Trade Boards Act would not apply. These may be estimated at about 200,000* in factories and workshops. Until some action is taken in regard to these women they will naturally remain exposed to the risk of a lowering of wages through the enhanced competition for employment at the end of the war.There was agreement among members of the group that as a general method of fixing wages it would be most undesirable that the rate or rates should be specified in an Act of Parliament or left to be fixed directly by a Government Department subject to Parliamentary pressure.Opinion was not unanimous, however, in regard to a proposal that as a supplement to the setting up of Boards, as suggested above, there should be pre-scribed by some means a general minimum wage which would be payable to women workers unless and until their position was safeguarded at a later date by the establishment of a Board for their particular trade.The proposal is of importance and interest, and, in the absence of unanimity, it is desired to report it in a reasoned form as placed before the Committee,* This number is exclusive of women employed in the cotton industry, in regard to whom, it is asumed, no question of regulation need be raised.
together with a statement of various considerations which were urged against it Between the two sides of the case the Group, as such, does not express an opinion. The case in favour of the proposal is as follows:  It is proposed that the lowest rate at any time fixed by a Trade Boa&apos;rd for a trade not purely local in character (or, alternately, the commonest Trade Board rate) should be a&apos; basis minimum rate below which no women employed by way of gain shall be paid except under a Trade Board determination. Power would, of course, have to be given to the Minister of Labour (by some special authority) to declare from time to time &quot;what was the basis minimum rate. It would no doubt have to be provided further that this rate should not be altered more often than once, say, in six or IS months, and that throe or six months&apos; notice of any alteration should be given.This plan differs from a proposal to fixing a general minimum rate for women, in that:  (a) It assumed that a large part of the field will be covered by actual Trade Board determination, and not by the basis rate, and that the formation of Trade Boards will be pushed forward as ratpidly as possible.(6) It avoids the fixing of a rate by Act of Parliament or directly by a Government Department.The advantages that may be claimed for the plan are as follows:  (a) It provides some immediate protection to all women pending the settingup of Trade Boards foT them.(b) It provides protection for women of types for whom it might ultimately beimpossible ever to set up an actual Trade Board. There are, for instance, numbers of isolated groups of women employed in industries which are otherwise well-paid, whom it would be very difficult to bring within any Trade Board as ordinarily understood.(c) It might materially stimulate the formation of Trade Boards.   In thisconnection it might ba a matter of some importance which of the alternatives indicated above for fixing the basis rate were adopted. The proposal, as stated, is that not less than the basis rate must bo paid execept under a Trade Board determination. If in any trade the employers urged that they could not afford to pay the basis rate, they would, prsumably, press for the formation of a Trade Board. If the lowest rate in a trade which is not purely local be taken as the basis, only in those which are purely local (analogous to chain making aiid lace-finishing) would a lower rate be possible, so that only in these cases would employers have a motive for the establishment of Trade Boards If the other plan of fixing the rate at the commonest Trade Board rate be adopted there might be a good many trades in which the employers desired to have a board. Indeed, it is likely enough that if the principle of a basis rate for all women, failing a Trade Board, wore adopted, both employers and workpeople in many trades would be stimulated to ask for more flexible machinery of Trade Board determination.If, before the anticpiated dislocation of employment at the end of the War occurs, a large number of Trade Boards have been established!, and have reached their determinations, the basis rate can then he declared in the light of a con-siderable volume of authority and without prejudicing the decisions of particular Trade Boards. If, however, this cannot be done, the choice will then lie between:  (a) declaring a basis rate, though relatively few Trade Boards have reachedtheir determinations; and(6) Leaving those women who cannot be brought under Trade Boards outside minimum wage legislation altogether for the moment.Against the above proposals, the following considerations have been urged:-1. The proposal to regulate women&apos;s wages ofter the war by means of Trade Boards is made on the assumption that the extension advocated) will have been substantially completed by the time the need for it arises, that is to say, by the time when a downward movement in wages is threatened. If this is not possible the recommendations of the Committee might need to be reconsidered and alternatives put forward, even though these should take the less satisfactory form of a rate or rates prescribed for female workers generally.
2. If Trade Boards are established at an early date for the trades as pro-posed, the number of employed women (estimated above at 200,000) that would remain outside their jurisdiction would include many who are well paid, and who would not be benefitted by any legal prescription of wages which is at all likely to take pace.3. The fact that after the establishment of Trade Boards there is left a residuum which cannot be analysed and divided without difficulty into those homogeneous groups which are the basis of a Trade Board system, is an argument against the laying down of any flat rate of wages. Such a residuum would include, as has been observed, many who are well paid and who could only be prejudiced by even the nominal application to them of a rate of wages out of relationship to the facts of their case; while, at the other end, there would be those who are employed in obscure and economically weak industries whom the general rate would tend to deprive of any employment at all. In certain trades the alterna-tives lie between fixing a rate which is so low that it fails to satisfy any reasonable standard based on cost of living, or fixing a rate than m more than the industry will immediately bear. In such cases Trade Boards do the best they can; they shrink from forcing workers impoverished by low wages into the greater impoverishment of unemploy-ment. On the other hand, they apply a rate which will compel the industry to exert itself, and do all that is possible to meet the new con-ditions. Such treatment is possible only under Trade Boards, and is inconsistent with the fixing of ,a minimum rate, as is proposed above, without regard to the facts of the particular trade to which it is&apos; to apply.4. Many trades, and frequently those whose existence is most precarious, have no corporate consciousness. In the trades at present under the Trade Boards Act, organisation both of employers and workers has tended to follow and not precede the setting up of a Trade Board. The definition of a trade for the purposes of bringing it under a Board has proved itself to be the basis on which various interests, hitherto regarding themselves as detached and remote, have coalesced and found expression. It is. not to be expected, therefore, that the bad effects of an unsuitable rate on some section of industry will be averted by the joint action of those likely to be affected, since, in many cases, the conditions are necessarily such as make joint action improbable.5. Assuming that a trade or section of industry is able to find a collective voice, the harm against which it desires to protest may be done before suitable provision can be made. Enquiry would be necessary, and this, together with the setting up of a Board and the fixing of rates to take the place of the general residual rate, might occupy a considerable time, long enough indeed for the infliction of irreparable injury.V. Administration .The carrying into effect of the recommendations made in this memorandum will necessitate substantial administrative changes with a view to the machinery being strengthened to carry its new and larger burden. On these no recommendation is felt to be necessary, as it is presumed that the matter is one falling properly within the province of the Department affected, and as such will be taken into careful and detailed consideration.Reconstruction Committee,Sub-Committee on Women&apos;s Employment. 5, Chancery Lane, W.C.2.

fJOSUGGESTED ENLARGEMENT OF POWER OF TRADE BOARDS TO REPORT ON MATTERS AFFECTING THEIR TRADES.In the discussion on the foregoing Memorandum, suggestions were made that irade Boa-rds should be given enlarged powers to consider or deal with questions (other than those relating to wages) affecting their trades.   Unanimity of view n, these suggestions  was not secured   and the  following statement is therefor,, appended without any recommendation being made:-In Section 3 of the Trade Boards Act it is provided that &quot; a Trade Board for any trade shall consider as occasion requires any matter referred to them by a Secretary of State, the Board of Trade, or any other Government Department with reference to the industrial conditions of the trade, and shall make a report upon the matter to the Department by whom the question has been referred.&quot;Very little, if any, use has been made of this provision, a fact which may be due to the novelty of Trade Boards. It is suggested that the power of Trade Boards to consider matters not directly connected with wages should lie enlarged, anil that the initiative should rest equally with the Trade Boards and the Government Departments, and not solely with the latter as at present. In other words, a Trade Board should have power to make a report and recommendations on matters affecting the trade without waiting to be asked, and the appropriate Government Department to which the report is forwarded should be under a duty to consider it, though not necessarily to take action on it.A body charged with the highly responsible duty of fixing minimum rates of wag(s for a trade should consist of the best representatives the trade can oiler, and such a body being in existence might well be deemed capable of expressing the opinion of the trade on.any matter affecting its welfare.Tiie exercise of these larger functions would not only be of social value, but would re-act on the Trade Boards themselves. The subject of wages is one on which the cleavage between employers and employed is relatively sharp. In many other matters the two sides of a Trade Board would have a more obvious, if not actually a greater, community of interest and the drawing together of employers and workers in a joint consideration of such matters might do much to soften industrial relationships.As an instance of a matter which might be referred to a Trade Board, the subject of hours of work may be mentioned.There is an increasing body of evidence to show, except where entirely automatic machines are concerned, that a considerable reduction of hours on those permitted by the Factory and Workshop Act is not only beneficial to the health of the workers, but actually tends to increase output. It may be found possible to recommend a general reduction of the maximum hours allowed by the Factory Act; but even if this be effected a further reduction v ill still be possible for certain trades. Although the legal regulations in force in textile trades are much more stringent than those in non-textile trades, the hours actually worked in an ordinary full-time week in the non-textile trades are generally less than those worked in the textile trades.This remarkable fact is made evident by the returns made to the Board of Trade in the Earnings and Hours Enquiry of 1906. The Reports of this Enquiry  how that the average hours of all workpeople in a full week were 55-3 in the textile trades; 52-7 in the clothing trades; 52-5 in the paper, printing, &amp;c., trades; 53-7 in the pottery, brick, glass and chemical trades; 54-1 in the food, drink and tobacco trades; 53-2 in the metal, engineering and shipbuilding trades; 53-4 in the building and wookworking trades; and 53-7 in the group of miscellaneous small trades.It is suggested that where it is found to be the practice of a substantial number of firms to work habitually fewer hours than those permitted by the Factory Act, a Trade Board should be enabled to recommend to the Home Oflice that shorter hours, suggested in accordance with their evidence, should become the legal hours for the trade, and that the Home Office should take powers to enforce such hours.
NOTE  ON THE  HOURS ACTUALLY WORKED  IN AN ORDINARY FULL-TIME WEEK BY MEN AND WOMEN BEFORE THE WAR.The official source of information with regard to the recognised hours of labour 0f men in a full-time week (exclusive of overtime) are the numerous Reports published by the Board of Trade since the establishment of the Labour Department in 1893.   These include amongst others The Twenty-first Annual Report on Changes in Rates and Wages and Hours of Labour, dealing with changes in 1913, with comparative statistics for the previous 20 years.   Cd. 7635 of 1914.Report on Standard Time-Rates of Wages in the United Kingdom in 1900. Cd. 317 of 1900.The Seventeenth Abstract of Labour Statistics, Cd. 7733 of 1915, which brings information as to existing standard time-rates of wages up to the date of 1st October, 1914.Report on Collective Agreements between Employers and Workpeople in the United Kingdom.   Cd. 5366 of 1910.In addition, the Inquiry into Earnings and Hours of Labour in 1906 gives the statements of employers as to the hours constituting an ordinary full-time week tor all workers, collectively, employed on employers&apos; premises.A brief Table is attached which shows the shortest week and the longest week reported amongst the returns of recognised hours of labour at 1st March, 1915. These returns of hours of labour have, with few exceptions, either been quoted liv both the Employers&apos; Associations and the Trade Unions concerned, or arc embodied in Working Agreements or have been quoted by employers as the hours must usually in operation. In the building trades nearly a thousand local agreements between the employers&apos; and the workpeople&apos;s associations regulating wages and hours and other conditions of employment are known to be in operation.It will be noted that in very few cases are the recognised hours for men in Jiese trades as long as those permitted by the Factory and Workshop Act to be worked by girls of 14 in non-textile trades (i.e., 60 hours). In the great majority iif districts they are shorter than those permitted for girls in the textile trades fi.c, 55^). Of course, the limitation of hours for men does not involve any prohibition of extra time being worked, but confers on the men a lever for obtaining extra pay for such extra time.A second Table is attached giving a brief summary of the results of the employers&apos; returns as to the hours constituting an ordinary full-time week for all workers employed on the employers&apos; premises for whom returns as to earnings wore made for 1906.Overtime.Id men&apos;s trades the formal recognition by agreement between employers and workpeople of a certain number of hours as constituting the normal day and the normal week usually coincides with a provision for a minimum standard wage or definite piece-rates of wages or an agreement as to payment for overtime.In women&apos;s trades there are few instances of a recognised normal week other than that permitted by the Factory Act. Employers &quot;generally fill in the obligatory Factory or Workshop Abstract with the full hours allowed to them by the Factory and Workshop Act, and this tends to create an impression that the shorter normal hours are due to an act of grace on the part of the employe? s. There is no informa-tion available on which to form a judgment as to whether women time-workers are always paid for overtime within the ordinary legal factory and workshop hours, or are often paid at higher rates for overtime within those limits.Overtime payment for piece-workers in addition to their piece-rates is arranged for in several of the men&apos;s collective agreements with employers (notably in the printing trades), but although occasionally instances have been mentioned of an extra sum being given to women by the employer for such work, it has always been regarded as a gratuity and not as a payment to which the woman has a legal claim.The Trade Boards have introduced a new feature in women&apos;s trades by mentioning 5 weekly rate of pay for a week of a stated number of hours, considerably below those permitted by the Factory and Workshop Act in those trades. Like the agreements as to hours in nk-n&apos;s trades, it does not restrict the hours to be worked, Init confers a legal claim for an extra payment for extra hours worked.

(Employment of Women after Child-birth.) Summary made by Miss H. F. Cohen.Introductory.The subject of the early . employment of women after child-birth has always ccupied a great deal of the attention of tho women Inspectors, and has been epeatedly. and strongly insisted on in their annuaL reports. It was further nphasised by the Memorandum on the Employment of Mothers in Factories and orkshops, which was presented by Miss Anderson in J&amp;U4 to the Inter-Departs lental Committee on Physical Degeneration, and was extensively quoted in the ody of the Report and printed in extenso as an appendix. the main points rough t out by tho Inspectors can be very brioily summarised:  (1) That the comparatively small number of contraventions of the. law is no indication of the number of cases of premature employment; for the proviso that an occupier of a factory or workshop shall not knowingly allow a woman or girl to be employed therein within the specified time renders evasion of the law very easy. (2) That even where there is no reasonable doubt that there has been a breach of the law, it is frequently impossible to take action   owing   to   the impossibility of proof. (3) That the great majority  of   cases   of  premature employment, whether technically illegal or not,  are due   to   the   pressure of want, either because the mother is the only breadwinner or because her husband is incapacitated by illness or wholly or partially unemployed.   Often it has been found that employers have taken a woman back before the legal date with full knowledge of the circumstances, but only out of pity and in response to her earnest entreaty. But such a summary gives only a faint idea of the existing state of things it is only the cumulative&apos; effect of instance after instance of premature employment srhich. enables one to realise the imjiotence of the law on tho one band and on the xher the pitiful dilemma of the mothers, leading to incalculable waste of life and health.Principal References.In liSOo Miss Anderson made, at the request of the House of Commons, a sum-niary of the factory regulations in Germalny and Austria. In those countries a iroman may not bo employed within four weeks of the birth oi&apos; a child without a aiedieal certificate of her fitness for such employment; failing this a period of six weeks must elapse.In 1JS97 tho difficulty of obtaining evidence of knowledge on the part of the employer was emphasised; also the defect of the law as it then existed, by which the word &quot; woman &quot; was used, and young mothers of 10 and 17 were consequently &quot;xcluded. In 189S a glaring instance of evasion was giv :i where the occupier of &apos;he laundry, instead of taking tho woman back in his latindry, had given her the ivork to do at home where the conditions made it infinitely more arduous and exhausting, although there was no breach of the Act. In 1902 reference was made the practice of workhouse infirmaries to discharge confinement caws after tivoeoks. It was pointed out how in the case of unmarried mothers they were practically compelled to return to the factory, &quot; leaving the infant in the care of ^hoover would charge the least for - minding &apos; it,&quot; and it was suggested that in &quot;idustrial centres the attention of hospitals and infirmaries should be directed te S. 61.In 1904 special inquiries were undertaken by the Principal Lady Inspector and her staff in view of the memorandum referred to above, and much fresh information was collected.   This memorandum summarises:  (1) the scope of the law and means of administration;(2) the nature and extent of the evils it is intended  to  check  in   certainspecially selected districts; (3) certain social, economic and moral forces to be considered in view of anyamendments;(4) existing or possible aids to the objects in view in addition to amendments to S. 61.EFERENCES    IN   ANNUAL   REPORTS   OF   CHIEF   INSPECTOR   OFFACTORIES TO S. 61.
KliSAs regards the existing law a fresh point was raised since the issue of die Memorandum showing that tlie ditlieulties oi enforcing the section were oven greater than had been anticipated or thought namely, whether &quot; knowledge &quot; could, under this section, be charged against a Limited Liability Company. As regards the other main points Miss Anderson referred to the necessity of further invosti-gation, notably in the great laundry industry, in the lace industry of Nottingham, in tho woollen and clothing districts oi Yorkshire and in others, and considered that these investigations would be greatly strengthened if the Recommendations in tJio Report of the Committee were carried out as regards:  1. Registration of occupation of mothers in connection with infant mortality. 2. Registration of still-births3. Either making the employer responsible for obtaining proof or requiring a medical certificate from the mother.4. Organisation of maternity insurance. Much administrative work was done under section (jj after the close of the special injury From Scotland it was reported : &quot;The number of cases investigated is, 1 fear, only a very small proportion of the number that could be found.&quot; Another inspector, after giving details of pa-rticular cases of poverty and illness, resulting in the death of the infant, comments on the general callousness and lack of responsibility. &apos;; It was quite obvious that until the woman Inspector put tin1 matter before them in what was evidently a new light, it had not occurred t/j anyone that it was worth consideration, or that even a legal let alone a moral responsibility rested on anyone.&quot; The loophole provided by the word &quot; knowingly is again pointed cut; and a case is cited which was dismissed because the managei had not inquired as to the age of the child: although the magistrate said that hi ought to have inquired. The dangers of prohibition or of any extension of tin legal period are strongly emphasised by another Inspector, owing to the risk of an increase in home work, which is unregulated as regards date and often inve.lv-greater strain.The attention aroused by the publication of Miss Anderson&apos;s Memorandum a in evidence was not allowed to slacken; every year fresh instances were given of tin well-known facts. In 1905 it was pointed out how mothers, in order to avoid actual breach of the law, returned to work in a different mill from that in vvhicl they were employed before the birth of the child. In one case of premature employ-ment the woman thought, as she said, that it was better to work than U starve. In another, that of a rag-sorter, the baby died at 5 months old from neglect. The woman had worked at the trade for many years: she had had 11 children, 9 of whom died in infancy. In another ease the joint earning- ol husband and wife amounted to 21s. 9d.. of which tho husband earned 11s. An inquiry into the observance of S. (il in the laundry industry in Konnington run Acton revealed the same melancholy conditions leading to the same melanchol; consequences, the out-of-work husband and the overworked wife with poor health and a semi-starved family. It was found, however, that the regulations won sufficiently well known to the occupiers and tho workers to make the latter fee it safer to ;&apos; fill in the month &quot; at some other than their regular laundry.Instances are reported in 1906 of the impossibility of taking action in main of the worst cases.*   It is pointed out that the practice of creches in Lohdoi and elsewhere admitting babies under a month is more or less an inducement U the evasion of S. 61.   Several reports are quoted from Medical Officers of Health drawing attention to the extensive employment of married women and the high rate of infant mortality.   Instances are given to show the deplorable effect on married women of excessive specialisation solely in non-domestic work.     From Belfast it is reported that il though in many cases women are obliged&apos; to worl owing to their husbands being out of employment, in other cases they do se owing to the fact that, having been employed in mills and factories from an earn age, this is the work to which ihey arc accustomed, while cooking, housework am the rearing of children is employment with which they are entirely unfamiliar. Several examples are quoted.      Much valuable information  was obtained  from matrons of hospitals and officials in public and private institutions with regard to the ill-health resulting from illegal and premature employment.In 1907 pathetic instances are quoted of known contravention of the section where no conviction could be obtained, either because &quot; knowledge &quot; could not lie proved, or because the woman returned to a different factory, or, finally, because the circumstances were so sad that prosecution seemed cruel; and1 the saddest feature of all is that just as want drives the mother back to work too soon, so weakness often causes her to break down after two or three days of employment.* Miss Anderson writes that while the years pass on. and the law remains unchanged, from district after district reports reach her that employment of married women is increasing, and he evils resulting therefrom are continuous in effect.
iii inspector writes: &quot; 1 know of no more pathetic or tragic iigure than that of 10 toil worn woman striving, however ineffectually, to do the work of two arsons with, as her background, the unemployed or insufficiently employed man.. . . In such cases you can see the influences that make for both physical add loral deterioration at work.&quot;In 1908 it is reported from Scotland: &quot; It appears that with the increased cowledge of the requirements of absence after the birth of a child has come also he knowledge that work may be continued legally up till the time of the birth, nil many of the cases show a very short total absence, even where there is no &apos;jutravention. It is poverty that drives the unfit mother back to work. In only ne case did I find any other reason, and that was one in which the workshop resented unusual attractions in the way of comfort and liberty, and the child ad died a few hours after its birth. ... In the majority of cases the child ad been illegitimate, so that the mother was the provider. In the case of married ronien they have been either deserted or their husbands have been earning wages hat must be supplemented somehow.&quot; Again, from Glasgow: &quot;Out of 1,281 orking mothers, 601 were at work regulated by the Factory Act, while GSO were itherwise employed (charwomen, hawkers, shopkeepers, domestic servants, etc) lliere is no information as to the earnings or contributions of the husband, but iuo may take it lor granted that in many cases the wife is the sole contributor, Hid there is a high rate of illegitimacy, almost 30 per cent, among the mothers laploycd tinder the Act. There can be no doubt, therefore, that to the worker here seems frequently no choice, and one is not surprised that she seeks to evade In Act.&quot; Another inspector: &quot; 1 have during the year visited a large number &apos;! women in their own houses shortly after their confinements, and I found even &quot;ho poorest and most ignorant mother is fully aware of this provision of the Factory Act, and the privations they suffer, and the struggle they make to stay it home for the four weeks is in many cases truly pathetic. I have never found, ind never expect to find, a woman who has a husband in steady work or even in cork at all, attempting to return too soon, but it is the poor unfortunate creatures -ho have got into trouble, or married women whose husbands have deserted them w who are out of work, who stay in the factories until the hist possible moment, and return as soon as they can manage to do so rather than starve at home.&quot;&apos;tn Scotland, and especially in Dundee, where these cases are most frequent, :i great deal of good work has been done by voluntary effort under the Medical Officers of Health by visiting, by feeding nursing mothers at restaurants in various jiarts of the town, and generally caring lor them. In Glasgow and Edinburgh similar developments are taking place. &quot; The very high proportion of illegitimate cases present a special difficulty. Voluntary assistance is not so readily forth-soming; and charity, it is found, will only increase the evil and si ill further ^crease the very slight responsibility now thrown on the lather, who toe often escapes all liability.&quot;l&apos;&quot;rom Belfast it is reported that the emigration of the men often throws the burden of bread-winning on the women.In 1909 fresh instances are given to illustrate the well-known facts and it is stated that Section 61 takes effect chiefly by bringing to light facts which might otherwise have been overlooked. A case of premature employment is quoted where die husband had been out of work for 7 weeks before the confinement, and the Guardians gave relief in money and kind for II days. The third week, they r&quot;l used an application for continuance of relief, and the woman returned to her ^i-ployment, the husband being still workless. It is reported from Lancashire that a large employer supports the mother by paying her 12s. a week during 20 w&apos;oeks absence from the mill.The excellent work of the Dundee nursing mothers&apos; restaurants is brought to notice. They were first started by the Social Union on the lines of Mine. Coullefs work in Paris. Free dinners are granted to the mothers during the first three Months of the baby&apos;s life. One object of the restaurants being to discourage married wonieirs work, at three of them if is the rule tliat no free dinners should &quot;&quot; granted to mothers who have returned to their work in the mill.An amendment in the German Industrial Code is noted by which the employer &apos;s compelled to grant a- complete rest of eight weeks, of which six must be subse-fiuent to the date of birth. In France, likewise, a law of November, 1909. provides for a total period of eight weeks&apos; abstention from work preceding and following child-birth.In 1910 it is reported that, as in former years the majority of cases proved to be untouched by the present law, inspectors follow up these cases with great care, and the resultant information will lie available when the community decides individually or collectively to give more care to working mothers and their infant
children.   These inquiries reveal the all too familiar conditions of destitution, illness and wife desertion.One inspector writes: &quot; Possibly the number of deserted wives and illegitimat. births in Dundee, and the return of married women to tho factories within month of confinement, is connected with the fact that a married woman living with her husband is disqualified for the receipt of Poor Law relief, whereas th* unmarried or deserted mother may, if destitute, be granted adequate mediai: attendance and maintenance, whatever her conduct or character, and can actual]; claim it as a legal right.&quot;Tho legal and medical members of the Local Government &quot;Board have expressed the opinion that the present law actually puts a premium on wife desertion.In 1911 several cases are quoted of premature employment resulting in break down of the mothers and death of the infant. &quot; Such illustrations point, as in past years, to the conclusion that prosecution under the Factory Act, even il practicable, would be useless, and that what is wanted to limit the employment ol expectant mothers and mothers of infants is some stronger, wider measure.&quot; Ii is hoped that the National Insurance Act may somewhat improve the situation though some most necessitous eases may lie outside its scope.In 1912 it is recorded that the chief remedy for the excessive employment oi married women in Dundee is to be found in the employment of men as weaver-If there were work for the men, the women could stay at home and care for their children. As a citizen of Dundee, well qualified to judge, remarked: &quot;If only men could be persuaded to become weavers, there would be a revolution in the social conditions of Dundee.&quot;In 1913 it is reported that the maternity benefit under the Insurance Act hv materially lightened the burden of compliance with Section 61, and that even in Dundee, where this evil of heavy employment for child-bearing women has beer probably the worst in the Kingdom, an improvement is to be seen.Complaints.Before 1904 the number of complaints of alleged breaches of Section 61 was onh one or two in each year.   From 1904 onwards the numbers are as follows:  1901.    1905.    1906.    1907.    1908.    1909.    1910.    1911.    1912.    1913. 24       12 6        18 26       15        21 16        12 8Since 1913 the annual reports have been very much curtailed, and they contain no further references to Section 01, although the enormous increase in the employ-ment of women which has residtcd from the war has rendered the question ol safeguarding maternal and infant health more than over important.APPENDIX   IX.STATISTICS RELATING  TO  EMPLOYED MARRIED  WOMEN.

Glasgow having 24 per cent., Dundee 20 per cent., Edinburgh per cent., and Aberdeen 3 per cent.Blackburn shows a striking figure, having 44 per cent, of all its married women turned as occupied, followed by Leicester with 26 per cent., and Dundee with i per cent.The corresponding figure for Lancashire as a whole is 17-5 per cent., the highest r any industrial county.APPENDIX X.RESTRICTIONS ON EMPLOYMENT OF MARRIED WOMEN IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (p. 53).These notes indicate what has been done in some European countries. It is ossible that there has been in some cases more recent legislation than that eferred to here.France. The Act of 1913 provides: (1) that pregnant women may leave work without notice without being liablefor breach of contract; (2) that women shall not be employed in industrial or commercial undertakingsfor four weeks after confinement; (3) that any Frenchwoman without means, employed for wages either as a worker, employee, or domestic servants, shall be entitled to a daily allow-ance for a period of 8 weeks before and after confinement on production of a medical certificate stating that she cannot continue to wTork without injury to herself or the child. The exact determination of these grants is given to the Municipal Council of each commune, but the grant must not be less than 50 c. a day nor more than 1-50 fr. unless the commune wishes to increase the amount out of its own funds.Germany. The Industrial Code prohibits the employment of women for eight weeks before and after confinement. No woman is permitted to return to work for six weeks after her confinement.The Insurance Act provides that women who have been insured against sicknass for at least six months shall he entitled to sickness benefit for a period of eight r&quot;eeks altogether before and after confinement, six weeks of which must fall after confinement. Tho amount of the sickness benefit varies in the different local insurance funds and also according to the wages.The Act further provides that maternity benefits for the wives of insured persons may be granted from the sick funds.Austria. The Austrian Industrial Code prohibits the employment of women in mduBtrial occupations for four weeks after confinement.In the Act of 1911 the prohibition is extended to six weeks for women employed above ground in the mining industry.By the Sickness Insurance Act of 1888 sickness benefit is given to women for at least four weeks after confinement. The rate of sickness benefit is 60 per cent, of the customary daily wages in the district.Italy. The Act of 1910 established a system of maternity insurance for women workers.   This insurance provides a maternity benefit of 40 lire, of which 10 are
contributed by the State. The contributions for women between Jo and 20 years of ago are 1 lire a year, and for women between 20 and j0 years of age 2 lire a year, the employer paying half and deducting the remaining half from the womaira wages. The fund is increased by having any fines made for infractions of tho Act added to it.Switzerland. The Sickness Insurance Act of 1911 docs not make sickness insurance compulsory unless the cantons so decree. Where insurance is ooinpul-sory, the sick funds are required by the Act to regard child-birth as a sickness, and to give sickness benefit for at least six weeks. It also provides that a furthei benefit shall be given if a mother is still nursing her child after four weeks.By the Factory Act of 1914 it is provided that women shall not be employed for six weeks after their confinement. They may not be dismissed during i In-period. If they so desire, their term of leave for this purpose must be extended to eight weeks.Russia. The Sickness Insurance Act of 1912 prohibits the employment of women who are members of sick funds for four weeks after confinement. The same Acl provides that sickness benefit shall be payable for a period of two weeks before and four weeks after confinement. The rate of lienefit is half the wages of the woman concerned.Greece. The Act of 1912 prohibits the employment of women in industrial and commercial occupations for a period of eight weeks altogether before and after confinement, lour of which must be after confinement. In such cases the woinairs place must be kept open for her.ben-mark. The Factory Act of 1913 prohibits employment for four weeks after confinement, unless the woman can procure a medical certificate to the effect that she may return to work without injury to her own health t,v that of the child. Assistance granted from public funds while a woman is prevented from working under this section is expressly declared not to have the effect of poor relief.Holland. The Labour Act of 1911 prohibits the employment of women in factories and work places within four weeks of their confinement.Tho Sickness Insurance. Act of 1913 provides that in the case of women expecting confinement sick money shall be paid from the first day of incapacity at the rate of 70 per cent, of tho mean rate of wage in the class in which she is registered as being insured.Belgium.- The Act of 1889 prohibits the employment of women in industrial work for four weeks after confinement.Norway. The Factory Act of 1909 prohibits employment for six weeks after confinement, and provides that relief granted in necessitous cases shall not be regarded as poor relief.An Act passed on 18th September, 1915, provides that women are to lye released from work in a factory four weeks before the time of their confinement on produe-tion of a certificate from n. doctor or midwife.The Sickness Insurance Act of 1909, as amended in 1911, provides that sickness benefit shall be paid to insured women for six weeks after confinement, and also the necessary medical attendance. The sickness benefit amounts to 00 per cent, of the average daily wage in the wages class to which the person concerned is assigned. They are also to be afforded opportunities of nursing their children during working hours.Sweden: The Factory Act of 1912 provides that a woman shall not be employed for six weeks after confinement unless she has a medical certificate showing that she can begin work without harmful effects either to herself or to her child.The Swedish system of sickness insurance makes it permissible for sick funds to give maternity benofits to their women ^members. A Government grant has been given to encourage funds to adopt this type of benefit.appendix  xi.MEMORANDUM ON CONDITIONS IN OFFICES.The enormous increase since August, 1914, in the number of women and girls employed in office work under the control of Government Departments, local authorities, and railway and insurance companies, in banks and mercantile estab-lishments, and in connection with factories, workshops, and shops, together with the strong probability that when full allowance for reduction in this number at
the conclusion of peace has been made, opportunities of clerical work for women rill be found to have become permanently enlarged by war employment, seemed to the Clerical and Commercial Sub-Committee to make the position of office conditions for women clerks a matter for the consideration of the Committee as airhole.This memorandum, prepared by the Sub-Committee&apos;s request, is a summary of statements put forward for the consideration of the Committee by tho following societies:  (1) The National Union of Clerks. (2) The Railway Clerks&apos; Association. (3) The Women&apos;s Industrial Council.The Secretary of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries (who gave Btvidence before the Sub-Committee) stated that her Executive had been unable I to make any inquiries into the question of office conditions.1 The opinions of certain expert witnesses on conditions in underground offices ffhich will be found in the Memorandum, are taken verbatim from the official record of the proceedings of a Deputation to the Home Office and Local Govern-ment Board in March, 1911, organised by the Women&apos;s Industrial Council in support of their Underground Workrooms Bill. This record was put in by the Council as part of their case against underground offices.(a) Pee-Wak Position.For a considerable period before the outbreak of war the organised reprcsenta-tives of the clerical workers of the country had been expressing increasing dissatisfaction with the conditions under which many of them had to work, and their views were, at different times, brought to the notice of the Home Office and the Local Government Board. It was pointed out by them that the absence in the case of the clerk, of the protection afforded to industrial workers by the Factory and Workshop Acts had resulted in ill-constructed, unhealthy and insani-tary office accommodation, and in long hours of work and excessive overtime. On these grounds it was recommended that offices should be brought under the I Acts, and should be open to inspection by the officials of the Factory Department.The complainants stated that in respect of structural regulations, and provisions for ventilation, lighting and sanitation, the occupants of offices were in a position much inferior to the inhabitants of dwelling houses. Thus, requirements insisted on by the London Building Act of 1894 in the case of domestic buildings (Seel ion 45) and sleeping rooms (Section 70), such as the ventilation of courts into which domestic buildings open, the provision of an open space in the rear of buildings, and minimum conditions of ventilation, do not, by definitions (37 and 38), apply in the case of offices and counting-houses. The conditions of many underground hakehouses at the end of the last century proved the urgent need for special regulation of conditions in places where work is carried on below ground level, and f-uch regulation was embodied in the amended Factory Act of 1901. No similar regulations applicable to offices exist.It was urged by the National Union of Clerks and other representative associu-tions that insanitary offices arc not only productive of great discomfort and impaired health, but that they become, in many cases, actual centres of disease. They asserted that conditions in many offices were particularly injurious to women and young people, who, even before the war, formed a considerable proportion &quot;f the existing body of clerical workers.(o) Increase of Women Clerical Workers.The latest Eeport on the State of Employment in all Occupations in the United Kingdom (July, 1917), prepared by the Industrial (War Inquiries) Branch of the board of Trade, shows an increase in banking and finance of 570-5 (53,000 women directly replacing males). To take banks alone, it is estimated that before the war they employed not more than 1,500 women; they now employ 35,000. The &quot;omen clerks employed by railway companies have increased, in round numbers, from 2,000 to 20,000. The increase in Government Departments, old and new (excluding the Post Office), shows a total of nearly 68,000, and of the 105,450 women (as against 60,500 before the war) now employed by the Post Office, the majority are clerical workers. .(c) Unsatisfactory Conditions in Offices.Complaint is made that much existing office accommodation is, by reason of (1) inadequacy, (2) unsuitabilUy, and (3) imperfect sanitation and neglect of hygiene, injurious to bodily health and mental energy.(1). Inadequacy. Since no condition as regards the air space required by each worker are prescribed for offices, there is no limit, save that imposed by extent
of desk and sitting-room, to tha number of persons who may be employed in any particular building used as an office. Overcrowding, according to the standard of 250 cubic feet per person prescribed for factories and workshops, is said to be uncommon, even in the ordinary above-ground office or counting-house, and in low-roofed basement offices to be still more frequent, arising out of the structural conditions of such places. The overcrowding of railway offices, especially in the less important centres, is stated to bo largely due to the fact that most of the buildings in use are old, and were designed for a far smaller staff than that which now occupies them.(2) Vnsuitability. The lodging of offices in underground rooms is asserted id bo on the increase. Mr. Isaac Young, Sanitary Inspector for Battersea, speaking for the Incorporated Association of Sanitary Inspectors in 1911, said: &quot; We believe that there is a tendency for underground workrooms to increase, particularly in regard to their use as counting-houses, offices, &amp;c.&quot;* Mr. Young wont on to describe the typo of new underground Avorkrooms lately built in &apos;&apos; a London district &quot; in connection with tho shut-up shops forming the ground floor of large blocks of residential flats; entirely below ground, &quot; extending &quot; in some cases &quot;to a depth of 100 feet with a width of 20 feet,&quot; projecting as to its front part &quot; about 4 feet under the public footpath,&quot; and abutting at the rear upon an area 5 feet wide. Lights fixed in the pavement &quot; on a fine day &quot; reflect light into these basements &quot; for a distance of about 15 feet.&quot; The only opening to the external air is by a fanlight having superficial area of 3 feet over a door leading to the area at tho rear. Dr. Allan, Medical Officer of Health for West-minster, pointed out that many underground rooms &quot; used as work places were never intended or constructed for such a purpose. Sometimes these are cellars or kitchens in old dwelling houses. At other times they are really storage cellars of shops.&quot; Having been designed for storage purposes only, they are without arrangements for occupation by human beings. &quot; No provision is jnade for adequate ventilation, lighting and means of warming. Often gullies and inspection chambers open into them &quot; (Sanitary Inspectors for Kensington).The custom of establishing typewriting offices in basements is referred to as being a matter of common knowledge, and it is pointed out that many retail shops and stores have underground counting-houses, while the possibility in certain neighbourhoods of sub-letting upper floors at a profitable rental is an inducement to keep office staff in the basement.(3) Imperfect Sanitation and Hygiene. &quot; Tho conditions of many offices where both men and women are employed are by no means satisfactory. Often they are underground or in positions where artificial light has constantly to be used. It has always seemed to me a curious anomaly that the Public Health Act, and even the Housing and Town Planning Act, do not seem to mind that an underground place which is unfit to be slept in may be used all day and perhaps the greater part of the evening as a work place or even as an office.&quot; (Dr. Allan, Medical Officer of Health for Westminster). Any living rooms in which two persons pass the day or night must open directly to the external air; 10 or 20 persons may occupy an office which is without such provision.Ventilation. The lack of adequate ventilation is said to bo most conspicuous in basement offices, where pavement gratings or stall board openings are often the only inlet for the doubtfully fresh air which finds its way in, accompanied by much dust, dirt and street refuse, but even in offices above ground a stuffy atmosphere is complained of. Small offices are said to be met with in which none of tho windows are made to open, and special stress is laid on the fact that many large cnes which cannot be kept healthy by &quot; natural &quot; ventilation, are without the mechanical means of changing the air which they need. Recently, it is stated, women employed in banks have broken down in health and been compelled to leave their work solely in consequence of tho airlessness of the office in which they sat.Lighting. Apart from the artificially-lighted basement or the enclosed windowless compartment in which some clerks have to work in continuous dependence on gas and electricity, many offices are unwholesomely and inconveniently dark by position i.e.. because their windows look out upon a brick wallonly a few feet away or into a court with a north aspect. &quot; I think it must be held that ... -the Absence of sunlight, or the fact of never being in the daylight, has a distinctly prejudicial  effect on the health of  the  persons employed.   .   .   .   especially* From the written statement read by him as a member of a Deputation to the Home Office and Local Government Board in support of the Underground Workrooms Bill promoted by the Women&apos;s 1 industrial Council.t Representing the Metropolitan Branch of the Society of Medical Officers of Health.
detrimental it must be to young people and to women . . . pursuing a s-.denta.ry occupation &quot; (Dr. Allan). The strain which work in these conditions imposes upon eyesight is noted.Cleanliness. The accumulation of dust in ill-cared-for offices, and the iuirequency of any thorough periodic cleansing of office rooms and buildings make for ;ll-health and impaired vitality and form the subject of repeated complaint. Clerks are said to suffer in an unusual degree from lung trouble, and the danger of dis-leminating disease is held to be greatly increased by lack of cleanliness. Both the Cierks&apos; Organisations referred to forward cases of offices that have not had a &quot; Spring Cleaning &quot; for 10 to 12 years.Sanitation. Defective sanitation is stated to be common. This is considered specially serious in underground offices where, apart from damp, there is a serious danger to health by &quot; the entrance of impure air from the direct connection of sanitary conveniences or from tho ground which may be contaminated by drains and coal gas. It is not at all an unusual thing.&quot; (Dr. Allan). Further, it is pointed out by him, that in the smaller type of office where neither the radiator nor a central heating system is in use, the air is often vitiated by the use of ilueless gas or-coke stoves. Basements whore chimneys and fireplaces do not exist are the worst examples in this kind.Sanitary Accommodation for Women. Complaint is made that in offices where lioth men and women are employed the provision for women is frequently inadequate and unsuitably placed, and that in some offices there is no accommo-lation for both clerks at all. The great influx of women clerical workers into banks, insurance and merchants&apos; offices, and other places where formerly men only nere employed, during the three years of the war, coupled with increasing difficulty of obtaining building materials and lahour for structural alterations of any kind, has raised the question of fitting provision in many quarters, sometimes in an acute form. The Railway Clerks&apos; Association has been obliged to make -trong representations in a number of cases to the Railway Companies. In general the Companies, on these represntations reaching their higher officials, have taken the necessary action, but in some instances nothing was done till pressure had been brought to bear by the Medical Officer of Health. The Association has reason to believe that owing to the reluctance of women clerks to come forward with com-plaints on this head, many exceedingly bad cases of insufficient, unsuitable, and insanitary accommodation have gone unreported. Meantime, it is endeavouring to meet this difficulty by the institution of women&apos;s conferences for discussion of the needs of women clerks.(d) Absence of Controlling Authority.The Clerks&apos; Societies declare that it is at present practically impossible, in tho absence of good will on the part of the employer, to get grievances removed. They consider that the clerk is here at a serious disadvantage as compared with the manual worker. Her employer is not bound to amend any of the evils which existed in his office when the clerk first took up service there, unless these are such as to constitute a &quot; nuisance,&quot; and evidence establishing this extreme position is liard to come by.(e) Hours of Labour.The hours of women as well as of men clerks, being unregulated by law, vary widely according to the trade or business concerned. In banks and financial establishments, where making-up days are of regular recurrence, considerable over-time is worked at stated periods. In the distributive trades pressure occurs more &apos;regularly; stock-taking and sales may be counted on to bring overtime in their train, but the additional demands of seasonal trade can only be calculated up to certain limits. Probably the longest hours of clerical work put in by women before the war were those of the girl cashiers employed in stores and shops. Many af these were, and aTe, young persons under 18; yet their work was not by any means always done when the shop closed at S p.m. The comparatively small number of women clerks employed in Government Departments other than the Post Office before the war worked a 7 to 8 hours- day; but many present-day Government women clerks are well acquainted with overtime in all its forms, loss of the weekly short day and Sunday labour.In most offices the hour&apos;s break for the midday meal is well established, and is usually fixed at a suitable time in relation to the morning hours of work. There appears to be, however, no general rule as regards the break to be allowed when late overtime is worked, and, in many cases, long unbroken hours of employment are said to occur.
Little check upon the hours of women clerks before the war was exercised by the clerical workers&apos; organisations, the number of women organised in the Nation;;! Union of Clerks being very small and the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries -which had not set up a standard of limitation of hours also possessing only modest numerical strength. Since tho war began, both the women&apos;s member-ship in the Union, and the total membership of the Association, have considerably increased, and the whole number of organised women clerks has been largely added to by tho action of tho Railway Clerks&apos; Association in opening their ranks to women railway clerks. Organisation is, however, a plant of slow growth in tin world of clerical work, and tho great mass of women and girl clerks are still wholly unorganised.(/) Desire for Regulation by the State.The Railway Clerks&apos; Association, which seven or eight years ago had adopted the principle of State regulation for offices, in 1913 drafted a &quot; Bill to regulate Railway Offices and the hours or labour therein, and for other purposes con-nected therewith.&quot; This Bill, which has received tho support of the National Union of Clerks as embodying provisions desirable for all offices, was, in 1915, re-intro duced into Parliament by Mr. G. J. Wardle, M.P. This measure still holds the field, and in February of the present year it was brought to the notice of tho Home Secretary by Mr. Elvin, Secretary of tho National Union of Clerks, in speaking to the resolution of the Trade Union Congress of 1916, urging Govern-ment Regulations and Inspection of Offices, presented to the Minister by the Parliamentary Committee.(g) Specific Proposals by the Organised Workers.These are embodied in the Railways Clerks&apos; Association^ Bill referred to under (/) a copy of which is attached. Its provisions as regards air-space, ventilation, cleanliness and sanitation, etc., are founded&apos; on those of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, though with a higher standard as regards the cubic feet of space to be allowed to each person, both during the ordinary period of employment (800 instead of 250) and during overtime (1,000 instead of 400) and special provisions for offices occupied continuously by day and night (1,600 and 2,000) or basement offices (2,000 and 2,500). The standard of sanitary accommodation is also slightly higher than that of the Sanitary Accommodation Order of the Secretary of State, and provision of washing accommodation is made obligatory in every case. Provisions with regard to employment and hours include total prohibition of employment of young persons tinder 16, prohibition of employment of young persons at night or on Sunday, establishment of the 4^ hours&apos; spell (with meal interval of at least one hour) for young persons and of an 8-hours&apos; day and -12-hours&apos; week. Overtime is limited on the pattern of the Factory Act permission to seasonal trades, but with the further proviso that no person may work more than 12 hours in any one day. Provisions for &quot; a free and uninterrupted rest day of 24 hours in each week,&quot; and for the restriction of Sunday labour and of night work (in the case of adults), for special rates of overtime, night and Sunday work, and for the alloAv-ance of 14 continuous whole holidays in tho year without loss of pay, are also included in the Bill. It is provided that the Act shall be enforced by the Factory Inspectors.It is to be noted that this Bill contains no clauses specially referring to women. The legislation proposed is distinct for all railway clerks without distinction of sex. In the same sprit the National Union of Clerks endorses and supports the proposals of the Bill.(ft.) Attitude op Women Clerical Workers in general to State Regulation ofOffices.In view of tho vast number of unorganised women clerical workers, it is difficult to say positively whether or no opposition to regulation exists in their ranks. The Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries stated before the war that a small group of women clerks, belonging to the upper ranks of the calling, were opposed to any proposition which, in their view, tended to place the clerk on the same footing as the manual worker. The Railway Clerks&apos; Association stated that their women members were strongly in favour of the Bill promoted by them, and the National Union of Clerks that all their members support it.LONDON:Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By Darling &amp; Son, Ltd., Bacon Street, E.2.
