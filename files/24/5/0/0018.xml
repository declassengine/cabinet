[This Document in the Property ^of Hisjj^tanniciMaJest^s Government.)120Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1918.SECRET.G.-218.SOME FURTHER REMARKS ON THE GERMAN COLONIES.(Previous Paper, G.-182.)(Note by Lord Curzon.)IN December last I submitted a paper to the War Cabinet on the subject of the German and Turkish territories conquered, almost entirely by our own forces, during the war, and more than likely to be still in our possession at its end. I argued against the rendition of any of these possessions to Germany or Turkey, and I stated the reasons which rendered it desirable, provided we were successful in the war, that they should remain either in our occupation, or 0under our general control in the future. Those arguments have been powerfully reinforced by the subsequent pro-nouncements of the Dominion Ministers; and it is now generally recognised that to such of these territories at any rate as are adjacent to or fall within the sphere of the British Overseas Dominions, the enemy cannot be readmitted, except as the sequel to a complete enemy victory.More recently, Mr. Balfour has suggested, with regard to the remainder of the German Colonies (which are exclusively African) that, in order to.satisfy the scruples of some, or to placate the jealousies of others, among our allies, we should abandon all idea of retaining them within the British Empire, and should adopt in preference one of two alternatives, viz., either make a present of them to certain of our allies, or submit them to a condominium of European Powers. Mr. Long has, on general grounds, sharply criticised these suggestions.General Smuts, in a subsequent paper, has put forward another plan, viz., that while declining to hand back any African territories to Germany, and while retain-ing them all under the flags of the nations that hold or have conquered them, we should nevertheless smooth our path at the Peace Conference by agreeing to the institution of an International Control or Development Board (to include German representatives) which would supervise the execution of the provisions of an Inter-national Convention, the principal, of. which would relate to the distribution of African raw materials to the world.As it is a matter of supreme importance that we should be clear in our own minds as to these proposals, and should approach the Peace Conference, assuming the Allies to be sufficiently victorious, with some sort of agreed plan in regard to these terri-tories, I ask leave to submit to a rather closer analysis the proposals of the Foreign Secretary and of General Smuts.Whatever be the fate of the German Colonies, presuming that we are in a position to determine it, I hope that we shall not lightly adopt this alternative.There is, as far as I can see, no valid reason why we should hand over either to France, Italy, Belgium, or Portugal any of the German African possessions of which we may be in possession at the end of the war, unless for reasons of amity on expediency, we persevere in the very considerable, and almost gratuitous, surrender which we have already made to France in the case of Togoland and the Cameroons.If we are unable completely to free the European territories of our Allies from the invader, I am unable to see why it should be incumbent upon us, who have already sacrificed untold British treasure and life in their defence in Europe, to compensate them for a failure which will be as much theirs as ours, nay more, by surrendering what has been won by British blood and treasure alone in other parts.The Plan of Surrender to our Allies.[649]B
fof the world. Why should it be our business to make up to F ranee for her inability to recover, e.g., the whole of Alsace-Lorraine, by making her a gift of East Africa? It is not contended that she would rule the country better, or that her rule would be more acceptable to the natives than ours. She has neither interests, rights, nor concern there. Why should the English settlers in East Africa, who have fought so valiantly for the expulsion of the Germans on their borders, or the Indian soldiers who, for nearly 4 years, have been conducting a campaign, to which India has looked to supply her in future with a possible outlet for her surplus population, or the South Africans and Rhodesians who, coming from a distance, have loyally joined in the struggle see the fruits of their exertions handed over even to a gallant ally simply to console her for a disappointment for which we have no shadow of responsibility in another part of the world? If consolation be needed, are not the Cameroons a sufficient recompense?And, if France be excluded, for these and other reasons, from consideration, it surely cannot be contemplated to increase the African possessions of Belgium, who already has more of Africa than she can conveniently and properly administer, and will have the utmost difficulty in retaining it; or of Portugal, incurably incapable of ruling or keeping anything, except by virtue of her weakness; or of Italy, who has no connection whatever with this part of Africa, and has shown herself in other regions of that continent the most unaccommodating of allies and neighbours. To bring in any European Power to reap the fruits of our own sacrifice would be an act of abnegation which no one would applaud for its disinterestedness now (since it would rightly be regarded as an admission either of our weakness, or of the moral invalidity of our claim/), while in a possibly not distant future, when a different grouping of the Powejs takes place, as it assuredly will, posterity might condemn us for an act of inexcusable folly. If we are strong enough to give German East Africa (which is a pivotal possession) to the Trench, we ought equally to be strong enough to keep it for Great Britain.Plan of a Condominium.In my earlier paper I stated some of the general objections to Mr. Balfour&apos;s second alternative of a Condominium, and I cited more than one comparatively recent case of the failure of such attempts in other parts of Africa. Indeed, I might well ask, is there any recorded case in which the experience of the joint rule or administration of undeveloped territories by a number of Powers, whose interests are necessarily divergent, and may even at times be absolutely conflicting, has been a success? Failure would be even more certain if, as Mr. Balfour seems to con-template, Germany were admitted to the governing body of the territories, of which she had ceased, in circumstances most humiliating to her pride, to be the sole ruler, and of which we may be sure that she would never rest until she had recovered possession. Mr. Balfour, conceding these risks, finds a compensating advantage in two prospects (a) that the African markets would thereby be opened, and the raw materials of Africa secured, to the world; (b) that the territories so administered could not be utilised as a military or naval menace to their neighbours. I think it can easily be shown that these advantages can not only be obtained, but can be much better secured by other methods than a Condominium. Indeed, if as Mr. Balfour proposes, the Condominium would only apply to the territories captured from Germany in the present war, it is obvious that the contemplated advantages would, in both cases, be of very narrow application, since in the remainder of Africa not so disposed of, the provision of raw materials and markets, the raising of armies, and - the construction of naval bases, would be subject to no such restraint, but would, as time goes on, be decided by the old criteria of national interest or international competition. /But there are other objections to an African Condominium of European Powers, whether it does or does not include Germany, to which I must call attention: 1. It is almost the worst form of government from the point of view of the native inhabitants. They understand government by a single and stronger white-man Power; but they do not understand government by a committee. A single Power has force, visible, near, and imposing, behind it force which can be applied without delay or circumlocution. They will recognise and yield to such force, but an international police is a menace which excites little respect, and is not always easily brought into aotion. The natives would at once begin to play off one nation against another, being adepts in such a rudimentary strategy.   Parties would be
formed, both among the rulers and the ruled. From the start there would be a pro-German and an anti-German party; and the fortunes, as well as the sympathies, of the native population would sway hither and thither, according as one or the other interest prevailed.2. International government has never been known to develop an international conscience. The Congo, the Soudan, and other classical illustrations are a testimony to that melancholy truism. In the friction developed by such a form of government at the worst, or in the compromise which it imposes at the best, the interests of the native populations are apt to be forgotten. I believe it would be true to say that African nationality (and such a thing is in process of being born) will thrive better under the rule of any one, even if it be a weak, European State, than it would under the joint rule of a body which comprised all the strongest.3. If the Condominium were extended (and a claim would at once be made that it should be so extended) to the African territories at present owned by the weaker European Pcwers, such as Portugal and Belgium, and if neutral States were admitted (as there would very soon be an effort to admit them) to the Condominium, the grouping of the partners, to which I have already referred, would at once begin. We have already seen enough in the present war of what may be expected from the interests, the cupidity, the intrigues, the fears, of neutral States to quench any desire to reproduce such a condition of affairs in Africa. A Condominium to wdiich Germany w^as admitted would, I apprehend, in less than 20 years be a Condominium in which Germany was predominant, and, just as the abortive experiment of the Congo Condominium ended in the private ownership of King Leopold, and ultimately in annexation by Belgium, so the Germans would make an East African or Central African Condominium the pedestal on which an exclusively German African Empire would before long be reared. The profound and probably invincible reluctance of the world to embark upon another struggle, would greatly facilitate such ambitions.Personally therefore I hope most sincerely that, supposing we are strong enough at the Peace Conference, we shall not, as regards German East Africa, adopt either of the alternatives of surrender to another nation, or Condominium by a group of nations.Plan of an International Board.General Smuts&apos; plan of an International Board avoids the majority of the dangers which I have pointed out, but it does not avoid them all. His idea is that the tropical African Colonies, while remaining under the flag, and also under the administration, of the various European nations (Germany however ex liypothesi being excluded) should be controlled for certain purposes by a Board, on which Great Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, and Germany also, should be represented, under the possible chairmanship of an American. I venture to make a few observations on this proposal.(a.) I am not clear whether it is to include only the colonies that have been conquered from Germany during the present war, or all the colonies, to whatever Power they belong, that fall within this area. But I assume the latter, as the language appears to imply. Nor am I clear whether the phrase &quot;tropical African Colonies &quot; means the whole of the regions that lie between the two tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. If so, they will be found to include the entire British Colonies of Nigeria, Gambia, the Gold Coast, Ashanti, and Sierra Leone on the West; the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Somaliland, British East Africa, Uganda, Zanzibar, and Nyasaland, on the East, as well as the whole of Northern and the greater part of Southern Rhodesia, on the South. They will also include the French possessions of the Congo, Somaliland, West Africa, Senegal, Guinea, the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, and I suppose Madagascar; the Belgian Congo; and the Portuguese possessions of Guinea, Principe, and St. Thomas, Angola, and Mozambique in fact, with the exception of Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli, and Egypt, in the North, and the South African Union, in the South practically the whole of the African Continent.Co.) If these geographical boundaries are accepted Italy must. I think, by accident, have been omitted from General Smuts&apos; calculations, for her Colonies and Protectorates of Eritrea and Somaliland fall entirely within the tropical zone.[649] B 2
f(c.) The next point to notice is, that though Germany is to be admitted to no ownership within this great area (for General Smuts recognises and refers to the Gterwheliiiihg peril of readmitting her to possession anywhere in Africa) she is nevertheless to be conceded a place and voice on the Beard. I understand the Objected hej that/she1 shall secure her fair share of the produce of African markets, ifO; wnSWevfer&apos; ihdf -lifay belong. Nevertheless, i venture to think that a plan under which Germany :was: denied a share in possession, but was admitted to a share in control, would hot&apos;only be vitiated from the start, but must provoke the very evils &apos;qf intrigue, friction, and ultimate rupture, which I have argued to be inseparable from a/Condominium.-; If Germany is to have a seat on the Board of Directors, it would :,aeeni tO:foiloSvthat she should have some share in the property. If she is to beJ refused&apos;the latter, there may still be very good reasons for a Board, but there seems to be no sufficient reason why she should be placed upon it.f(L.) I pass 10 a brief consideration of the idea of a Board.   General Smutshas said no More of if than that it would &quot; supervise the execution of the provisions of the Coiivehtioh/ -would develop the resources of the various colonies with the- participation&apos; of&quot; capit&amp;Ff rom all the countries represented on the Board, and would bfrtitrdl the distribution of raw materials of those countries.&apos;&apos; On the assumption that Great Britain&apos;&apos;&apos; will not be able, or would be ill advised, to assume the exclusive responsibilities of ownership of the captured territories, I think that there is much to be said for such a Board (without at present committing myself to any definition of the African&apos;; areas to which it could properly be applied), and in my former&quot; paper I alluded tb the desirability of international agreement between the. &amp;6l&amp;Teigh:; Eurbpeah&apos;&apos; Powers&apos;&apos;&apos; in Africa, on many points of African policy and administration.The institution of such a body might relieve some susceptibilities, might make things/easier at the Peace Conference, might provide an effective reply to the charges of capitalism, Monopolism;^.and imperialism, which are so freely circulated and so readily believed\ and miight4ead %ot only to greater uniformity, but to higher ideals in the future of !Afiicah: deveto^pmeht! But I think that we should have a clear idea as to what it would mean, and what modification of sovereign rights or preroga-tiyes it would in all probability either sooner or later entail. I expect that it would :dO&apos;;&apos;and indeed Ou^hffo do, a good deal More than appears to be contemplated in deneral&apos;;Smuts? admirable&quot;-sketch. &quot;(i.) I take it that the policy of&quot; concessions, plantations, profiteering, &amp;c, upon which the African colonies of some at least of the European Powers have been founded and are still ihaintained, would be condemned.   But would the consent of those Powers be readily obtained to such  a ;., surrender? .(ii.) A policy of Free Trade or of&quot;a moderate uniform tariff ought in theory to.take its place, for differential duties and preference would hardly be compatible with an international system. But how is this to be reconciled with the policy of Imperial Preference which our Government has recently adopted and proclaimed to the world?(iii.) Mr. Balfour has recommended his Condominium on the ground that it wOuld;&apos; supply markets and raw materials impartially to all the world,&quot; and General Smuts has recommended his International Board on the ground that it would &quot; control the distribution of raw materials to all the countries represented on it&apos;&apos;- (ie., including Germany). Would there not be some difficulty in reconciling these undertakings with the announcement, made only this morning in the Press by the Colonial Secretary, that under the scheme approved by the Government raw materials- in our possession are to be reserved, in the first instance, for the Empire?(iv.) A common policy with regard to the control of alcoholic liquors, the pro-tection of native races, the examination and extirpation of tropical diseases, and the preservation of indigenous flora and fauna, should be an easier consequence.(v.) There should be, by international agreement, a limitation of armies raised from native races, and armaments:(vi.) A unified railway policy for the development of the African continent might gradually come1 into being.(vii.) A question that would have to be decided would be the admission of enemy nationals as settlers and traders in the various territories.   They could
not, I imagine, be permanently excluded. In fact, one of the chief difficulties of the future will be where in the world to find places for the German emigrants, who, whether for purposes of private enterprise or political ambition, will continue to leave their native land.Such are, as I see it, some of the questions that will have to be faced if we proceed with the idea of an International body. It would seem preferable in any case not to call it a Board, which appears1 to connote direct management and the exercise of supreme authority. International Council would, perhaps, be a superior title, and would more correctly describe its advisory functions. Neither would I venture upon any dogmatic pronouncement as to the territories which it should embrace. If it be applied to all the countries included within General Smuts&apos; definition it would amount to a new scheme of government for the greater part of Africa, to which the consent of a great many different parties, with very divergent interests, would have to be obtained. If it were confined to the territories captured from Germany during the present war, it could only have a partial and feeble effect.  Perhaps some mean might be sought between the two.In the creation, however, of such a body in some form may conceivably lie the solution of impending difficulties, as well as a real hope for the future. In discussing it I am conscious of having been, to a large extent, groping my way in the dark, but each contribution, however speculative or lacking in precision, may assist in the formation of an ultimate judgment upon what is by far the most difficult problem that will await our statesmen at the close of the war.Cof K.July 25, 1918.
