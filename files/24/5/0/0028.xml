[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Maj&amp;s^s GoverBS&amp;ent.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1918.SECRET. . -G.-228.WAR CABINET.DEMOBILISATION. Land Drainage Works. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. Land Drainage a national necessity,THE restoration to efficiency of the main drainage channels and protective embankments cannot now he regarded as a work that will merely benefit the owners of the lands immediately affected: it is a work which is urgently required for the sake of the whole country. The estimate of a million acres to be improved or reclaimed by this means is a conservative one. Moreover, the state of congestion into which these channels have lapsed all over England and Wales is the result of a century of neglect, and that neglect is in its turn partly due to the unprofitable conditions of agriculture prevailing for many years past. It would be unfair to burden the present owners and occupiers with the whole of the expenditure necessary to repair this neglect; and if it were sought to do this, their consent, which is necessary by statute, would certainly not be obtained. Further, they might be deterred from immediate action, which is desirable in the public interest, on account of the cost being now greater than under the normal conditions which would prevail later.2. Increasing demand for action.The efforts made in the last two years by the Board and the Agricultural Executive Committees of many of the counties in which the need for land drainage has become apparent have produced in those counties an increasing demand for action. But the Board fear that reliance cannot be placed on the &quot;enlightened self interest&quot; of the land-owners or of the existing drainage authorities (who are composed of the land-owners or their representatives) to act with promptitude sufficient to secure the objects named in paragraph 1 unless substantial financial assistance is afforded. Parliament, in the Land Drainage Act, 1918, has authorised the Board to exercise the powers of an existing drainage authority where this authority wiU not act for itself, and has thus recognised a change of principle.3. The work can mostly be done by manual labour.On the other hand, by far the greater proportion of the works now most urgent can be carried out by manual labour, if that be made available. It is not necessary at the moment to instal pumping plant or to put in sluices. Dredgers, it is true, may be useful in many places, but the vast proportion of what has to be done (the removal of cesses, trees, weeds, and so on) can well be done by manual labour without mechanical appliances, and in many cases it can best be so done.4. Miscellaneous charges to be borne by those immediately interested.If part of the manual labour is supplied free, and the rest supplied on easy terms, the Board believe that in many important cases the owners and occupiers would willingly bear the other charges for supervision, tools, use of dredgers, and so on: and where they are already in striet law liable for the whole cost, there would be no hard-ship in compelling them to bear these charges.5. Typical cases.The arterial channels (both natural rivers and artificial cuts) which require drastic works of cleansing and improvement are very numerous, and are to be found in all parts 11075]
fof the country. The Great Ouse and its tributaries, the Nene, the Witham, the Weiland, and the great system of the Yorkshire Ouse, may be taken as examples in which the need is pressing. At. the mouth of the Weiland, for instance, there is a large area of foreshore which is practically ripe for reclamation as part of a drainage scheme.6. The Powers Required.To carry out these works on a large scale the Government must obtain wider statutory powers than are contained in any of the Land Drainage Acts. All these are based on the principle of levying of the whole expenditure on the owners and occupiers of land, and consequently the enabling provisions are surrounded with restrictions which enable the owners and occupiers either to veto, or to bring forward objections to, the scheme before it is carried out. This description applies &apos;even to the latest enactment Section 16 of the Land Drainage Act, 1918-which for the first time gives the Board of Agriculture * powers itself to carry out drainage ^schemes, though these powers are limited to schemes which will not cost more than 51. per acre or a total of 5,0001. :7. Existing position under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The powers contained in paragraphs (k) and (I) of Regulation 2 M (see Appendix) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations enable the Board to carry out schemes of land drainage which will ,    (a.) directly provide employment for demobilised soldiers ; and(6.) provide a considerable addition to the area of land that can be profitably cultivated as arable or grass land, and consequently to the area which will be available for the settlement of ex-service men.That Regulation, however, does not provide adequate means of recovering the expenditure on these schemes.Paragraph (m) enables the Board to recover the expenses of works done under those paragraphs where the necessity for the work is due to the failure of some person to discharge his legal obligations. But it is only in a minority of cases that there is an obligation on anyone to cleanse channels or to. maintain banks, and even in those cases the obligation, if challenged, may in some cases be difficult to establish in a Court of Law.The Agricultural AVar Executive Committees have carried through certain small schemes by exercising under paragraph (j) of Regulation 2 M the powers of Enclosure Awards, and have recovered the expenses under the provisions of those awards. In other cases they have been able to provide prisoners free of charge, the persons interested in the lands bearing voluntarily the expenses of tools, supervision, &amp;c. In others, again, the Board have entered into agreements to supply the manual labour free of charge, the cost of labour amounting roughly to half the cost of the scheme. These latter cases have occurred chiefly in Carnarvonshire and Merionethshire, where some of these schemes have met with considerable success. There are, however, many cases in which it has not been possible to make, such arrangements.8. Proposals for Legislation.The powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations cease on the termination of the war, and, as already stated, the powers of the Land Drainage Acts are insufficient to deal adequately with the immediate problem. Legislation is desirable to enable the Board to exercise, after the termination of the war, the powers which they can now exercise under the Regulations, supplemented by a power to recover a proportion of the cost of the work from the persons interested in the lands to be benefited. To secure such legislation may take time, and in the meanwhile much could be accom-plished to improve the drainage of land and increase the food supply, if the Board were in a position to offer financial assistance.&apos;9. Proposals for Immediate Action.The making of arrangements for drainage improvements has depended largely upon whether the prisoners could be secured at any given moment free of charge. If the desired objects are to be attained, the time has come when a definite basis should be settled for providing assistance in the form of labour. There are a number of new drainage authorities in process of formation in counties where the interest recently
aroused in this matter is keenest and the need is greatest ; and it is important that this interest should be kept alive, and the need for.drainage in those counties satisfied, by extending the benefits of any arrangements that may be made to these new drainage authorities, although they may not yet be finally established. For this purpose the following suggestions are submitted : (i.) The Board should be authorised to bear a portion, in no ease to exceed one-half, of the cost of an approved scheme in the form of free labour. Thus, if the scheme costs 10,000Z., and the labour 7.500L, the Board may supply free labour to the value of 5,0001. &apos; y(ii.) The Board should be authorised to make an advance byway of loan to provide for the remainder of the cost, with a suspension of interest or repayment for five years, to enable the improvement to show results.(iii.) Advances and grants of free labour of these kinds should be made :-(a.) to existing drainage authorities of whose competence to carry out the workthe Board are satisfied ; (b.) to the statutory County Committee set up under the Land Drainage Act, 1918,sect. 17, in any case where the Committee executes works under thatAct.(iv.) Where a Drainage Board is in process of formation the Board should in the first instance bear the whole of the expense, inserting in the order which establishes the Drainage Board a provision requiring the Drainage Board to repay to the Board a proportion of the expenditure on the above principle. An advance will be made to them for this purpose on their formation in the same way as it will be made to drainage authorities already existing.(v.) In order to encourage the formation of Drainage Boards on these terms, and the commencement of schemes which will ultimately afford employment for demobilised soldiers, the free labour required should for the present continue to be provided by means of prisoners of war,(vi.) The whole arrangement to remain in force for two years after the &quot; termina-tion of the war.&quot; .     ,(vii.) A definite sum of money to be allocated to the Board direct for the purpose of supplying free labour and of making the advances above suggested, distinct from the 1,000,000Z. which has been allocated for land reclamation schemes to be carried out through the Development Commissioners as set out in &amp;T.-6277, and approved by the War Cabinet on the 6th December (W.C. 510, Minute 5).RE. PROTHERO.Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, December 19, 1918.APPENDIX.Defence of the Realm Regulations.&quot; 2 M. (1.) Where the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, after such consultation with the Food Controller as may be arranged, are of opinion that, with a view to maintaining the food supply of the country, it is expedient that they should exercise the powers given to them under this regulation, the Board may &quot; (j.) where, in the opinion of the Board, any land is injured or likely to be injured by flooding or inadequate drainage which might be remedied wholly or partially by the exercise of powers which are conferred by any general or local Act, or by an award made under any Act, or by any Commission of Sewers, and which are not being exercised, or in the opinion of the Board are being insuffi-ciently exercised, exercise any such power and also any power conferred by any such Act or award or commission for defraying the expenses so incurred or for any purpose incidental to the exercise of any such power ; and&quot; (fe.) enter on or take possession of any dam, mill, lock, sluice, weir, or other structure affecting the flow of water in any river or stream, and remove or repair or alter or maintain and use the same where such action ia in the opinion of the Board necessary or desirable for the prevention of floods or for the drainage of agricultural land ; and
&quot; (Z.) for the purpose of removing any obstruction to or otherwise improving the flow of water in any river or stream, or maintaining or improving the banks of any river or stream or any sea defence or drainage outfall, enter on the river or stream or any land adjoining or near the river, stream, defence, or outfall; and&quot; (m.) where any expenses are incurred by the Board in the exercise of any of their powers under paragraphs (k) or (1) of this regulation, recover those expenses, so far as they are directly attributable to the default of any person in carrying out his obligations under statute or otherwise, from that person.&quot;o
