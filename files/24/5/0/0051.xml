COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE SCHEME OF OUT-OF-WORKDONATION.To the Right Hon. Sir Robert Horne, M.P., Minister of Labour.Sir,(1) In the course of the evidence which we have taken with regard to the operation of the Out-of-Work Donation Scheme, certain matters have-come to our notice to which we think immediate attention should be given, and we have decided, therefore, to make this Interim Report in order to bring them before you without delay.(2) We do not propose in this Interim Report to deal with the administration of the Out-of-Work Donation Scheme, except in so far as it is concerned with the particular points on which we recommend alterations. The modifications made in the rules between March and the present date have fundamentally limited the scope of the scheme as originally introduced in November. The more important of these modifications are: (i) In Ireland, the limitation of the scheme, in so far as it applies to civilianworkers, to workpeople insured under the State scheme of Unemployment Insurance, and to those employed in any trade which may be certified by the Lord Lieutenant as one in which there is a substantial amount of unemployment directly caused by the cessation of hostilities ;(ii) The condition that employment in not less than 20 weeks in 1918 must beproved before donation can be drawn; and (iii) The review of all policies held or applied for by civilian workers by the Local Employment Committees, who are empowered to recommend that donation shall not be granted unless they are convinced that the applicant is normally in employment, is genuinely seeking &quot;work, and is unable to obtain it.The scrutiny of the Local Employment Committees is an essential safeguard against abuse of the scheme. The rules laid down for the guidance of the Committees in dealing with applications appear to be generally well-conceived, and the Committees appear to have carried them out in an efficient manner.(3) There are certain points with regard to which we think immediate action should be taken: (i) Inquiries from the last Employer of the Applicant for Donation.   (U.I. 85D.)The circumstances under which the applicant for donation left his last employment may be such as to render him ineligible for the receipt of donation (e.g., if he left his employment voluntarily without just cause or was dismissed for misconduct). Substantially, the only way in which the Employment Exchanges can obtain information on this point is by means of the form of inquiry, U.I. 85D, addressed to the last employer as given by the applicant. We understand that replies on form U.I. 85D are furnished by employers in a comparatively small proportion of cases, and that, if no reply is received by the Exchange, the applicant is granted donation, provided that he is otherwise qualified.This is obviously an unsatisfactory position. It is the duty of employers to co-operate in preventing abuse of the scheme by furnishing replies to inquiries of this nature, but we are reluctant to recommend recourse to compulsion until a further effort has been made to obtain a more satisfactory response by voluntary methods. We recommend that steps should be taken to give increased publicity to the import-ance of furnishing replies promptly and accurately to the inquiries on form U.I. 85D, and that a record should be kept of the proportion of replies received. If, after a fair trial of this procedure, a large proportion of the inquiries remain without reply, there will then be, in our opinion, no alternative to compulsion.We recommend that in the absence of a reply from the last employer the applicant should produce some evidence with regard to the circumstances in which he left his last employment, and that, if necessary, he should be required to furnish a certificate signed either by his last employer, by his trade union secretary, or by a justice of the peace.m   (35)8248   Wt 8569 D 401   3000   G/19   E &amp; S A 2
4 COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE SCHEME OF OUT-OF-WORK DONATION :(ii) Payment of Donation to Workpeople on Short Time.The effect of the rules now in operation is that donation is not ordinarily payable to workpeople on short-time unless they are off work for at least half the number of working days in a given period. For example, donation is payable in respect of each day of unemployment to workpeople who are off work for three days each week or for one week in two, but not if they are off work for two days each week.There is reason to apprehend that these rules may constitute an obstacle, to the gradual recovery of trade; that, for instance, they may prevent a textile mill from increasing the working days in the week from three to four, because the wages&quot;.which the workpeople would receive for the additional day of work would often be less&apos; than the donation for three days which they lose.This danger may be avoided either by abolishing altogether the payment of donation for short-time working or by relaxing the present rules. We are not prepared at this moment to recommend its abolition. We are of opinion, therefore, that the existing rules should be relaxed to the extent of making donation payable also to workpeople who are off two days in the week. In order, however, to provide some safeguard against abuse of the donation scheme in connection with short-time working, we think that before donation is payable in such a connection in any particular case, a tribunal set up in the particular division concerned should be satisfied that it is necessary for industrial reasons (to be defined by the Department) that short-time should be worked. In this connection, we are of opinion that local holidays should not be regarded as stoppages &quot; for industrial reasons.&quot; We suggest that the tribunal should consist partly of persons nominated by the Divisional Council and partly of officials of the Department.(iii) Concurrent Payment of Out-of-Work Donation and Disability Pensions.No deduction from the ordinary rate of donation is made on account of a disability pension drawn by a disabled ex-service man or by the widow of an ex-service man. Notwithstanding the anomalies to which this gives rise in certain cases, we are not prepared, pending further consideration, to recommend any change in this rule except so far as it relates to dependent children. At present a disabled ex-service man, or the widow of an ex-service man, may be in receipt of a pension allowance in respect of children, and may also, if unemployed, draw the donation allowance for children at the iull rate, in our opinion, a deduction from the donation allowance for children ought to be made in such cases. We suggest that the applicant should receive the amount (if any) by which the supplementary donation normally payable exceeds the amount of pension allowance in respect of the children for whom a claim is made. If, however, there are administrative difficulties in the way of adopting this suggestion, some other method of achieving substantially the same result (e.g., by basing the deduction from supplementary donation on the percentage of disablement on which pension is calculated) should of course be-adopted. In any case, we recognise that in practice, owing to the insufficient data available, it may not be possible to apply the procedure to all cases in which pension allowances are being drawn in respect of children.(iv) Part-Time Workers.Considerable numbers of persons now drawing donation are registered under what are normally part-time. occupations; there are, for instance, 40,000 women under the heading of &quot; charwomen and cleaners.&quot; We think that the payment of donation in such cases is not justified, and that donation should not be payable unless it is clear that the applicant is available for whole-time employment.(v) Procedure in Prosecutions for Fraud. Our attention has been called to delays in bringing cases of fraud in Ireland into court, owing in part to the procedure under which all such cases are referred to London in the first instance. We recommend that the Irish Department of the Ministry of Labour should be empowered to deal direct with the appropriate Irish Authorities in such matters in all ordinary cases, and should only be required to refer cases to London if points of special importance arise. The possibility of adopting similar measures with.regard to other parts of the United Kingdom should also be considered, and generally every possible step should be taken with a view to securing that proceedings for prosecution are initiated without any avoidable delay.
INTERIM REPORT.5(vi) Premises and Staff.It is clear from the evidence we have heard that the Exchange premises are in many cases inadequate and unsuitable, ^and that considerable savings, as well as greater efficiency, could be achieved if better premises could be provided. The same conditions appear substantially to have obtained in regard to the temporary staff which had necessarily to be engaged for the work. We recognise that the defects in this respect have been to a great extent unavoidable, owing to the sudden expansion which was necessary after the date of the armistice in order to cope with the difficulties arising in connection with the out-of-work donation scheme and other matters in connection with demobilisation with which the Exchanges had to deal. We recommend that any steps that may be possible should be taken at once, having regard to the temporary nature of the scheme, in order to remedy the defects in this connection. In view of the short notice at which additional staff had to be appointed and the many difficulties with which the staff generally were confronted, we are of opinion that they have performed their duties in a very creditable manner.(vii) Press Advertisements.Several of the witnesses who gave evidence before us laid stress on the good results which folLowed from the insertion of an advertisement in the press, calling attention to the workpeople available on the registers of the Exchanges. This was particularly noticeable in the case of domestic servants. We think that the j udicious expenditure of an adequate sum in advertising the fact that large numbers of workpeople available for various kinds of employment are on the registers of the Exchanges would be more than recouped in the saving of donation pay. We recommend that the sum which we understand is allocated for this purpose should, as an experiment, be considerably increased.(viii) Use of Employment Exchanges by Employers.We are dissatisfied with the extent to which employers resort to the Employment Exchanges for the notification and filling of vacancies. In a con-siderable number of districts the disparity between the number of applicants for certain types of employment&apos; and the number of vacancies notified, taken in con-junction with the number of vacancies which are believed to exist in those districts, induce the reflection that employers do not resort to the Employment Exchanges to anything like the extent that, even in their own interest, is desirable. We recommend that all possible steps be taken by the Ministry to bring the facts before employers generally.(ix) Requirements of 20 Weeks1 Employment in 1918.We have already referred to the rules recently introduced, under which the receipt of out-of-work donation in the case of civilian workers is, with certain exceptions, dependent on proof that the applicant was employed for at least 20 weeks during 1918. We think that this rule is a salutary one, but that it operates too severely in cases where, owing to sickness or accident, a genuine worker has not performed 20 weeks&apos; work during 1918. The proportion of such cases is no doubt small, but something should, in our opinion, be done in order to deal with them. We suggest that the rule should be modified to this extent, that the Local Employment Committee should have discretionary power to issue (or confirm) an out-of-work donation policy if the applicant can show that he or she was employed for at least 10 weeks during 1918, and was, owing to sickness or accident, unavoidably prevented from working during a substantial portion of the remainder of the year.(x) Disqualification for Donation.At present an applicant who loses employment through misconduct, or who voluntarily leaves his employment without just cause, is disqualified for receiving donation for a period of six weeks from the date when he so lost employment. We think that the penalty thus imposed is not sufficiently severe, and we accordingly recommend that it should be within the discretion of the Court of Referees to decide in addition that in the case of an applicant who had lost employment in this manner, the period in respect of which donation may be drawn shall be reduced by a period not exceeding six weeks.m  8248
6 committee of inquiry into the scheme of out-of-work donation *. interim report.(xi) Inspection Staff.The great majority of the convictions for fraud were on the ground that persons were in actual employment when in receipt of donation. The Ministry has already appointed a certain number, of inspectors for the purpose of detecting this form of fraud, but we think that the number is inadequate, and that the inspection stall employed for this purpose should be considerably augmented.(4) Alleged Abuse. In conclusion, we wish to say that the evidence so far heard by us affords no ground for supposing that there has been extensive fraudulent abuse of the donation scheme. The scheme as introduced in November last was so wide in its scope that many persons who were not really &quot; seeking work &quot; could, and did, take advantage of it; and owing to the dislocation of industry it was not usually possible to test their good faith by offering them employment. In our opinion it is the existence of this class of case which has given rise to the impression that the scheme has been widely abused. It is, however, important to recognise that these persons, however indefensible their action in claiming donation might be on moral grounds, were committing no fraud ; they came within the purview of the scheme, and the Employment Exchanges had no option but to pay them the donation. We have mentioned in an earlier paragraph that the scheme has already been modified with a view to excluding such cases, and from the evidence which we have heard we think it may be assumed that this object has now been largely achieved.(5) There are, of course, several other matters requiring further consideration with which we shall deal in our final report.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servants,ABERCON WAY (Chairman).
