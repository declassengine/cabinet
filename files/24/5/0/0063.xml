[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majest/s Governments    560Printed for the War Cabinet.   August 1919.l     (jlWAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAY.Fourth Report.Service Pensions in the Army (Other Ranks).1. IN their three, previous reports the Committee have dealt with the future conditions of service for officers in the Navy, Army, and Air Force, the future pay and. pensions.of men of the Royal Air Force, and the future pay of men in the Army. There remains, therefore, the question of the future pensions of men in the Army, and in this report the Committee submit their recommendations under this head.2, The Committee, in their second report, while unable to submit a scheme for the service pensions of men in the Army, expressed the view that any such scheme should not be less advantageous than the scheme which they then put forward in respect of the Royal Air Force, which scheme was itself based upon that which had been previously approved by the War Cabinet for the Navy.The scheme for the Army now submitted (Appendix) has been based upon the Naval scheme already approved. The same method of assessing the pension has been adopted, that is to say, the pension will be a daily rate dependent upon the number of years of service, with additions, depending npon rank, for each year&apos;s service as a non-commissioned officer. The basic rate of 1-^d. a day adojjted for an A.B. in the Navy and an aircraftsman in the Royal Air Force is recommended also for a private in the Army, and the additions for rank will also be the same in all three Services. . It is not proposed, however, that, as in the Navy, there should be further additions for good-conduct badges, &amp;c.3. Apart from the general scheme, the following point requires particular explanation : Additions for Age. It will be seen from paragraph 7 of the Appendix that the Committee recommend an additional pension of od. a day at the age of 55, and a further addition of A\d. a day at the age of 65. This has hitherto been a feature peculiar to the Naval Pension Scheme, and it arose as follows :, Formerly Greenwich Hospital, like Chelsea Hospital, used to take in old Naval pensioners ; but some forty or fifty years ago this practice ceased, and the money saved thereby went to provide additional pensions bd. at the age of 55 and 9d. at the age of 65 for all old naval pensioners. Subsequently, however, the Greenwich Hospital funds proved insufficient to provide for the additional pensions to all pensioners attaining the qualifying ages ; and the State therefore stepped in, and the additional pensions, as far as the hospital funds were unable to meet the cost, were made a public charge.The Committee view with favour&apos; the principle of increasing a man&apos;s pension as he advances in years, and they therefore strongly recommend that the same principle should be adopted in the case of old Army pensioners. At the same time, it is felt that in order to ease the burden on the already strained resources of the national exchequer, this additional charge should be met as far as possible out of Chelsea Hospital funds; and they therefore suggest that immediate enquiry should be made by the War Office in order to ascertain the extent to which those funds are able to provide for the additional pensions, the State to be responsible for the remainder of the cost.SECRET. G-260.
4. Soldiers, discharged for Disability. The Committee have also considered the following recommendation of the War Office regarding men discharged for disability: &quot; A soldier of 18 years&apos; service and 10 years&apos; qualifying service and upwards, discharged for disability, shall be granted a service pension in addition to disablement grant.&quot;A soldier of 14 years&apos; service and 10 years&apos; qualifying service shall be granted a service pension if he has been granted a permanent disablement pension.&quot;It is, however, felt that this is a question that does not properly belong to a scheme for service pensions, and it is therefore recommended that the matter should be taken up between the War Office and the Ministry of Pensions, and to be considered in relation to the proposals for post-war disability pensions.5. The new rates of pension will apply to all future pensioners, and to men who have served during the present war.
Appendix.PROPOSED SCHEME FOR SERVICE PENSIONS IN THE ARMY(OTHER RANKS).1. IT is proposed that the pension shall be given as a daily rate assessed on the mimber of years qualifying service, the basic daily rate to be \\d. a day for each year&apos;s service, with additions for each year&apos;s service as a non-commissioned or warrant officer.The rank additions to the daily rate to be as follows : For each vear&apos;s service as &quot; .   d.Corporal       ... ... ... ... ...     \Sergeant Class III       ... ... ... ..   1Sergeant Class II        ... ... ... ...   1^Sergeant Class I, or warrant officer Class II ...   2Warrant officer Class I ... ... ....      ...   21-2. Qualifying service for pensions snail be unforfeited colour service only, and shall be counted from the age of 18 years only.3. Service to be taken into account in assessing a man&apos;s pension shall be service on discharge, irrespective of the man&apos;s position on completing 21 years.4. Service in any higher rank than that held on discharge shall not count for pension (i.e., if a sergeant had reverted to corporal and then again became sergeant, his previous service as sergeant might count as such; but if he never became a sergeant again, it would only count as corporal&apos;s time), and in order to count for pension the rank on discharge must have been held throughout the year immediately preceding discharge.5. A total of 21 years shall give a right to pension, but a minimum of 10 years&apos; qualifying service shall be required. A man must be serving with the colours on final discharge (or on ceasing to count service) to be eligible for pension.G. A man re-engagsd to complete 21 years (or re-enlisted to complete a term of service which with former service makes a total of at least 21 years), who is allowed to take his discharge prematurely after 18 years at his own request, may be granted a pension if eligible, assessed as above with a reduction of 10.7.* An additional pension of 5d. at age 55 and a further addition of 4d. at age 65 shall be granted subject to good conduct as a pensioner. -8. Following Naval rules, past service after an interval of more than 5 years should not count.9. These proposals must be taken together, e.g., a man cannot claim to count qualifying service as under the Pay Warrant and pension rates under these rules.* It is strongly recommended that the cost of these additional pensions shall be met as far as possible out of Chelsea Hospital funds.
