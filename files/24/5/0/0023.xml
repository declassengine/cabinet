[This Docinaent Is the Property.of His Britannic Msjesty?s Government;! 1Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.SECEET.G.-223. W.R.G.E. 1/5.WAR   CABINET.INTER-DEPARTMENTAL  COMMITTEE  ON  THE  APPLICATION  OF THE WHITLEY REPORT TO GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.Interim Report No. 1 on the Application to Industrial Persons Directly Employedby the Government.I. War Cabinet&apos;s decision to apply the Whitley Report to Government Establish-ments.1. In paragraph 24 of its Second Report the Whitley Committee says: &quot; In considering the scope of the matters referred to us, we have formed the opinion that the expression &apos; employers and workmen 5 in our reference covers State and municipal authorities and persons employed by them. Accordingly we recommend that such authorities and their workpeople should take into consideration the proposals made in this and in our first report, with a view to determining how far such proposals can suitably be adopted in their case.&quot;2. Consequent upon this opinion, the War Cabinet, having before it the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum of the 21st June, in which thtj principles which would govern the setting up of joint committees were stated, leaving the control of the Minister unimpaired, decided on the 1st July, 1918 : \(a.) To adopt in principle the application of the recommendations of the Whitley Report, with any necessary adaptations, to Government establishments where the conditions are sufficiently analogous to those existing in outside industries.(b.) That an Interdepartmental Committee, composed of representatives of the following Departments, should be set up to consider what modifications were necessary: Mr. Roberts (Minister of Labour) (in the Chair).The Admiiralty.The War Office.The Ministry of Munitions.The Ministry of Air.The Post Office.The Office of Works.The Treasury.(c.) That the Committee should consult Mr. Whitley in the course of their work.3. The Chairman of the Committee has consulted Mr. Whitley, and, acting on his advice, Sir William J. Collins, late chairman of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board of Government Employees, has been invited to assist the Committee in its deliberations.II.-Ideas underlying the Whitley Report and their application to Government Establishments.1. In paragraph 24 of the Interim Report on Joint Standing Industrial Councils, the Whitley Committee made a general statement upon the conditions [849] &apos; B145
necessary to produce a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employed.  This they declared &quot;must be founded upon something other than a cash basis. What is wanted is that the workpeople should have a greater opportunity of par-ticipating in the discussion about and adjustment of those parts of industry by which they are most affected.&quot;2. In paragraph 16 the Committee has given an outline of the kind of question with which they consider Joint Industrial Councils should deal. These functions may be roughly classified under two main heads : A. The consideration of the ordinary  questions of collective bargaining,notably rates of wages, and B. Functions designed to achieve the object stated in paragraph 24 quotedabove.3. Among the questions to which special attention is called in paragraph 16 of the Whitley Report, items (ii) and (x) may be taken as examples of the second class of function.   They are as follows : (ii.) Means for securing to the workpeople a greater share in, and respon-sibility for, the determination and observance of the conditions under which their work is carried on.(x.) Improvements of processes, machinery, and organisation, and appro-priate questions relating to management and the examination of industrial experiments, with special reference to co-operation in earry-ing new ideas into effect, and full consideration of the workpeoples&apos; point of view in relation to them.4. The constitutions of Councils which have already been set up, and of those in process of formation, contain among the functions the questions to which paragraph 16 of the Whitley Report calls attention, and in addition others designed to give expression to the spirit of the report. In considering therefore how the Whitley Report can be applied to its industrial establishments, the Government has to find a method by which the two more or less distinct classes of function can be most suitably carried out to the satisfaction of all concerned.III. Departmental Joint Councils.1. All the questions which fall under class B. should be the work of Depart-mental Joint Councils. A Departmental Joint Council would consist, on the one side of representatives of the Government Department concerned, and on the other of representatives of the trades unions having members employed by that Govern-ment Department. (The possibility of a representative of the Ministry of Labour being present in an advisory capacity at meetings of the Council is referred to later.) At the present each Government Department is solely responsible for the functions falling under B. so far as its own employees are concerned, e.g., the Admiralty in the case of Dockyards.2. The application of the Whitley Report, so far as these functions are con-cerned, would appear to mean that any such Department should co-operate, not with other Government Departments, but with representatives of its own employees. The proper form of a Joint Council for this kind of work therefore appears to be that to which the name Departmental Jpint Council has been given.3. The subjects coming within the scope of such a Departmental Jpint Council would usually be those, involving large classes of the Departments employees such as the consideration of the general principles governing the treatment of disciplinary questions, organisation and management, and also matters relating to welfare, education, and technique, &amp;c.In addition the Council would provide machinery for the ventilation and pre-yention of grievances. All or most of these questions in Government establishments must be considered in their relationship to the Department which controls the establishments; therefore it would appear to be necessary for them to he considered as part of a Departmental policy.
We have intentionally refrained from attempting to formulate a definite list of the classes of question with which these Councils should deal, believing that this will best be settled by experience of working on the general lines recommended above.4. Works Committees will form an integral part of the scheme. In some establishments it may be necessary to have, not only a works committee, but also &quot; departmental&quot; committees (e..g., in an Admiralty Dockyard, a yard committee and also committees for individual shops or for departments in the yards). The arrangement suitable for any establishment will depend upon the size of the particular yard or works, and upon the complexity of organisation. It will be for the Departmental Joint Councils, when established, to arrange for the setting up of these works committees and for their relationship with the Departmental and Trade Joint Councils. These works committees will not have powers to make decisions upon matters of general principle, they will be concerned with the applica-tion to their respective establishments of the general principles agreed upon by the Departmental and Trade Joint Councils; and shall be free to make recommenda-tions of these Councils on questions of principle. It is expected that grievances will usually be settled in these Local Committees and only referred to Departmental or Trade Joint Councils in default of agreement or if they develop into questions of general principle.5. On the side of the workpeople there are not, as there are in regard to the functions coming under A., strong reasons in the facts of trade union organisation and custom against dealing with the various grades and trades as one body. In many cases questions would, in their very nature,, concern the whole of an establish -ment, e.g., the question of how to deal with bad timekeeping. They would often, therefore, be questions which, so far as they were settled locally, would be a matter for the joint committee representing the whole establishment (e.g., in the Admiralty scheme for the yard committee rather than for a &quot;departmental&quot; or a shop com-mittee). Such a joint committee, representing the whole of a certain establishment would be directly under the Departmental Joint Council, and would be constituted on lines similar to the Departmental Joint Council.It appears desirable also that questions relating to the rearrangement of hours of work, for example, should be dealt with by Departmental Joint Councils, but, as it is not always possible to separate questions of the duration of hours of work from questions of wages, reference will frequently have to be made to the Trade Joint Councils concerned.IY-Trade Joint Councils.1. The arrangements proposed in the preceding paragraphs for Departmental Joint Councils seem to be unsuited to the negotiation of wages. On the trade union side the custom is for wages to be settled on a trade rather than on an industrial basis. Certainly it would be altogether unusual for a council formed on the men&apos;s side from the variety of unions employed in dockyards (including the engineering, building, shipbuilding, labourers&apos; and other unions) to arrange the wages of the different sections. Further there is the desirability indeed the necessity of plifferent Government Departments making some common arrangement as regards wages paid for any one kind of work. It would be inadvisable, for instance, for the Admiralty Council (which might be taken as an example of a Departmental Joint Council) to settle all rates in the dockyard without regard to the rates prevailing in other Government establishments or in private industries for the same class of work. Ip order therefore that, not only the trade union custom, but the object desired from the Government point of view may be attained, it is proposed that for wages negotiations Trade Joint Councils should be formed.2. A Trade Joint Council wrould be composed on the Government side of representatives from all the Departments employing the particular classes of labour concerned. On the workmen&apos;s side it would be composed of representatives of trade unions, which have members employed in the particular trades for dealing with the wages of which the Council is formed. Thus the wages of engineers would be arranged by a body representing the dockyard engineers, engineers in Woolwich Arsenal and other Government establishments on the one side; with the represen-tatives of the Admiralty, War Office, &amp;c, on the other.
3. It is practically certain that the engineering trades will not be willing to arrange for the wages on engineering work in any Government Departments to be discussed in a Joint Council in which the building trades are equally represented with themselves. Arrangements would have to be made for the engineering trades to negotiate wages questions by themselves if they wish; the Trade Joint Council is merely a proposal to obviate the unnecessary repetition of this sectional negotiation by all the Government Departments employing engineering labour; for this par-ticular purpose the official side of the Joint Council would be representative of the different Departments concerned.4. The method of remuneration, as well as the actual arrangement of rates would probably be a subject to be dealt with in this way, i.e., by the Trade Joint Councils. Other things which are commonly a matter of trade collective agree-ments such as apprenticeship conditions, demarcation of work, &amp;c, would also appear to be subjects for Trade Joint Councils.5. As already noted also under III 5, the question of the duration of hours often raises questions of wages, and will accordingly be referred to Trade Joint Councils. The same applies to the questions of leave, sick leave, &amp;c, which have a financial aspect.6. The official sides of the Trade Joint Councils would differ from Council to Council in respect only of certain members, e.g., all or most of the officials repre-senting the Admiralty on a Trade Joint Council for the engineering trades would also represent the Admiralty on the Trade Joint Council for the building trades, and the same would be true of the representatives of the War Office or of the Office of Works.V. Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee.Trade Joint Councils of this type would automatically ensure co-ordination between all Government Departments in their relations with each group of trades. An Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee would also be necessary to ensure due consideration of the,.relations between the different groups of trades. This might take the form of a meeting of some or all of the official members of the different Trade Joint Councils. The frequency of such meetings could be left to be determined by experience.YI. The relationship between the Departmental Joint Councils and the Trade Joint Councils.1. The relationship, so far as membership is concerned, between the Depart-mental Joint Councils and the Trade Joint Councils has already been referred to, and the general line of the division of functions has also been indicated. It is important, and at the same time a natural arrangement, that the individuals representing a Government Department or a trade union upon a Departmental Joint Council would also be the representatives to the Trade Joint Council, e.g., the representatives of the engineering unions on the Admiralty Joint Council (Departmental), would also be the representatives of the engineering unions on the Trade Joint Council for the engineering trade, and the official side of the Trade Joint Council for the engineering trade would contain representatives of the Admiralty, who would be chosen from the official side of the Admiralty Joint Council (Departmental). This overlapping in actual membership is an essential feature, and would ensure the observance of the proper divisions of functions.2. On the official side of a Departmental Joint Council, the only Department other than that directly concerned for which representation appears to be desirable is the Ministry of Labour. Though it is implied in the Departmental arrangement that the functions are primarily the concern of the Department, it is clear that the different Departmental Joint Councils should be kept in touch with one another so that a uniform policy should be pursued. In addition to this the. Departmental Councils should be in a position to obtain all the information available about the practice of Industrial Councils in outside industry. It is suggested that the proper way to secure these ends is by an officer of the Ministry of Labour being attached to each of the Councils in an advisory capacity. The same officer should act in this capacity for all Councils which may be formed.
YII. The relation of the Treasury, to the Trade Joint Councils.1. On the official side of a Trade Joint Council all the Departments employ-ing the kind of labour with which the Council is concerned would be represented. As in the case of the Departmental Councils, the Ministry of Labour should be represented. The fact that the Trade Joint Councils will be concerned mainly with wages questions raises the problem of the relationship of the Treasury to these Councils. So far as it applies to wages negotiation, the Whitley Report appears to endorse what has for years been the recognised practice of well regulated trades, viz., the arrangement of terms between bodies representative of, and able to make final settlements for, the employers and the employed respectively.2. There is a strong trade union desire that similar arrangements should be made so far as government work is concerned. The only way in which this can be accomplished is by the Treasury being represented on the Trade Joint Councils. This would remove a cause of strong dissatisfaction on the part of the trade unions who would not then feel that behind the official side of the Council lay an unseen power with which they could not get to grips. Unless the whole outlook of the Whitley Report is wrong, it is to be presumed that the opportunity of discussion with Treasury officials would produce in the trade unions an understanding and an appreciation of the Treasury attitude which otherwise cannot be expected.3. A better understanding would be introduced into wages arrangements, and it is difficult to see how the method could produce any danger which cannot be properly guarded against. The Council would itself make proper arrangements for notice of demands and for adjournment of cases where agreement was not reached; the official side would meet separately in order to settle its policy, and the safeguards referred to could allow of this being done with sufficient opportunity for full review of a situation.4. The trade union desire that the various departments concerned should be met as one body may be illustrated from two schemes forwarded to the Admiralty after consideration of the Admiralty proposals for yard and shop committees:(a) From the resolutions adopted by the Dockyard Trades Councils &quot;National conference shall consist of Government representatives from the Admiralty, Treasury, and Ministry of Labour, with other Government Departments affected.&quot;(b) The A.S.E. Dockyard Advisory Committee proposed that the &quot;National Conference shall consist of Government representatives from the Admiralty, Treasury, and Ministry of Labour, with other Government Departments affected, and executive officials of the unions or persons deputed to act on their behalf.&quot;VIII. The relation of Government Joint (Departmental or Trade) Councils to National (not Government) Industrial Councils.The relationship of the Government Councils (Trade or Departmental) and the Joint Industrial Councils in outside industry will be determined by the follow-ing considerations. The same trade union will be represented on Government Councils and on outside Councils. It is one of the main functions of Joint Industrial Councils to act as the representative bodies which the Government can consult. The Government Councils ought therefore to be able to give information to and also make representations to Joint Industrial Councils, and, in the same way the Government Councils will be able to receive both information and representations from Joint Industrial Councils in outside industry. The proposed representation of the Ministry of Labour is intended to provide for this; the Ministry of Labour being the Department through which other Joint Industrial Councils communicate with the Government. These considerations indicate as close a linking up as seems practicable in present circumstances.IX. Numbers of Members on each side of Council need not be equal.It will not be necessary that the numbers of members of the two sides of Government Joint Councils (Departmental or Trade) should be equal, because voting on these Councils will be undesirable.X. Suggested Procedure for forming Government Councils.In forming Joint Industrial Councils, the Ministry of Labour usually makes very careful investigations as to the employers&apos; associations and trade union [849] C
qualified to be considered as interested in a particular industry. A preliminary conference is called of representatives of those associations, the objects of the Whitley Report are explained, and a Provisional Committee, consisting of an equal number of representatives of employers&apos; associations and trade unions, is appointed to draft a scheme for a Joint Industrial Council. In the same way schemes of functions and procedure for Government Councils might be drafted by Joint Provisional Committees of the Departments and trade unions. The Inter-Departmental Committee might act for the various Government Departments in this connection the representation of any particular Department being increased when proposals for application to it are being considered. This would ensure common action among the Departments, and would facilitate.the procedure. The Minister of Labour might convene the conferences and act as chairman.XI. Position of the Ministry of Munitions.It was recognised that the Ministry of Munitions, having regard to its functions in relation to conditions of employment under the Munitions of War Acts, and its temporary character, and also to the uncertainty of the future of some of its industrial establishments, was in a position whicb would require special con-sideration; but as regards the factories established before the war it was agreed that their position in relation to the Councils should be determined on the same principles as those laid down in this Report for other Departments.October 4, 1918.APPLICATION OF THE WHITLEY REPORT TO GOVERNMENTESTABLISHMENTS.Summary of Interim Report No. 1 of the Inter-Departmental Committee Appointedby the War Cabinet.The functions with which the Whitley Committee proposed that Joint Indus-trial Councils should deal may be roughly classified under the following two heads: (A.) Questions concerned with matters other than those commonly the subject of collective agreements, such as the means for securing to the workers a greater share in the responsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions under which their work is carried on, disciplinary measures, improvements of processes, examination of industrial experi-ments, welfare, education, technique. Many such questions concern the employees of a works as a whole, and not merely the members of particular trades in the works.(B.) Questions of collective bargaining, e.g., rates of wages, questions of hours of work, method of remuneration, apprenticeship conditions, and demarcation of work, where it is the custom for questions to be settled on a trade, rather than an industrial, basis.The Inter-Departmental Committee, in making the following proposals for providing for these two separate classes of function, so far as Government establish-ments are concerned, desire it to be clearly understood that the organisation proposed is not intended in any way to impair the responsibility of Ministers to the Cabinet and Parliament for the administration of their respective Departments: (A.) Departmental Joint Councils would be set up consisting of representa-tives of the one Government Department concerned and representatives of the various trade unions having members employed by that Government Department.Works Committees in each establishment, organised according to their varying requirements, would be an integral part of the scheme. Such Committees would settle all details, referring to the Departmental Joint Council only questions of principle, and would be concerned with the application to their respective works of the general principles arrived at by the Departmental and Trade Joint Councils.
(B.) Trade Joint Councils would be set up, consisting of representatives of the various Government Departments concerned and representatives of the trade unions concerned wjth the trade or trades covered by the Council.In order to facilitate the working of the scheme the following further proposals are made: (i.) An Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee should be formed, con-sisting of some or all of the official members of the Trade Joint Councils, to ensure due consideration of the relations between the different groups of trades.(ii.) The membership of the various Departmental Joint Councils and the Trade Joint Councils should overlap as much as possible, as it will not always be possible to keep entirely separate questions falling within the two clasess of functions, (iii.) A representative of the Ministry of Labour should sit on allDepart-mental and Trade Joint Councils, in an advisory capacity, and as such would provide a means of linking up the Government and the National (not Government) Industrial Councils, (iv.) Representatives of the Treasury should sit on the Trade Joint Councils.(v.) There should be no voting; consequently it is not necessary that the two sets of representatives should be equal in number.The Inter-Departmental Committee have recognised that the Ministry of Munitions, having regard to its functions in relation to conditions of employment under the Munitions of War Acts, and its temporary character, and also to the uncertainty of the future of some of its industrial establishments, was in a position which would require special consideration; but as regards the factories established before the war it was agreed that their position in relation to the Councils should be determined on the same principles as those laid down in the Report for other Departments.October 4, 1918.
