n tto.TEE OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEEAPPLICATION OF THE WHITLEY REPORT TORNMENT  ESTABLISHMENTS.REPORTonThe Application of the Whitley Report to the Administrative- Departments of the Civil Service.We have the honour to submit the following Report on the application of the proposalscontained in the Whitley Report to the Administrative Departments of the Civil Service.   - &apos;2. Terms of Reference.-The. terms of reference to the Sub-Committee were:.  &apos; / . .&quot;To draw up a draft scheme for the application of the Whitley Report to theAdministrative Departments of the Civil Service,&quot;       r      &apos;   &quot;- ;- iand the Sub-Committee were empowered to take evidence  roin the Government Departmentsand from organisations of Civil Servants. -.::&quot;&apos;/--&apos;-&apos;.- ^- &apos;3. Scope of Enquiry. It appeared to us that the best method of procedure was to enquirewhether the recommendations of the Whitley Reports could in practice be applied with orwithout modifications to the Administrative Departments, and, if so, to indicate the outlines ofa scheme, the adoption of which we could recommend, with a view to securing the objectsaimed at by the WMtley Committee. ;:. - ;* . - -    &apos;4. Evidence generally in favour1 of application of Whitley -principles to AdministrativeDepartments.-^ the course of our enquiry, we have held 11 meetings and have taken evidencefrom representatives of typical Government Departments, and also from&apos;representatives ofnumerous Associations of Civil Servants.        &apos; -       ,       -      :&apos;; ;u    vH-Speaking generally, the evidence given both by the Staff Associations and the Departmentalrepresentatives was in . favour of the application of Whitley. principles to the AdministrativeDepartments and, while it was frankly recognised by the witnesses that there are certaindifficulties in the application of those principles to the: Civil Service, it was represented to usthat the difficulties related mainly to matters of detail and machinery rather than of principle.5. Objects in vieio.-We conceive that the main objects of establishing a system of WhitleyCouncils for the Administrative Departments are to secure a greater measure of co-operationbetween the State, in its capacity as employer, and the general body of Civil Servants inmatters affecting the Civil Service, with a view to increased efficiency in the public servicecombined with the well-being of those employed ; to provide machinery for the ventilation ofgrievances;; and generally to bring together, with a view to the free discussion of many diverseand complex problems, the experience and different points of view of representatives of themany grades and classes constituting the administrative, clerical and manipulative CivilService of the country. We assume that the great majority of the Civil Servants who desireto see Whitley principles applied to the Administrative Departments have these objects inview. It is, however, possible that the scheme may have received support under the impressionthat its adoption will give Civil Servants a deciding voice in the settlement of their ownremuneration and conditions of service. Any such proposal would, of course, mean theabandonment by the Government of an essential part of the functions which it exercises ohbehalf of the community as a whole, and its effect could not be confined to the Civil Service. Insubmitting therefore Our recommendations for the formation of Joint Bodies and for a definitionof their functions so far as possible pending further experience, we consider that a clear state-ment of these limitations should be made here, in order to remove any misleading impressionwhich may otherwise be.created in the minds of those interested. &apos; -   -: ,. 6.. General Qonsiderations.-With a view to a clear understanding of the questions beforeus we think it necessary, to draw attention in the following paragraphs to certain general -considerations which have a close bearing on the problem. &quot;.&apos;. : .      ;.     -; &apos; &apos; ,7. Differences between public and private employment.-lt must be frankly recognised atthe outset that there are important and vital differences between public and private employ-u   (38)7524   G 32   10,000   3/19   E&amp;S A
ment Avhich must necessarily modify the application to Government Departments of proposals intended and designed for private industry.   Among the principal differences are : (1) The fact that the State is the ultimate employer of Government servants through tlie Heads of Departments who consequently have not the freedom of decision in regard to wages and conditions enjoyed by the private employer.(2) The absence of the check imposed by considerations of profit and Joss and its replacement by Treasury Control which, so far as questions of remuneration are con-cerned, is now subject to an appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government Employees.(3) The fact that an employee in a Government office is not merely a private individual in public employment but is in a very real sense a servant, of the puhlie and as such has assumed obligations which, to some extent, necessarily limit his ordinary rights as a private citizen. 8. A most important function of a Whitley Council of the ordinary industrial type is to overcome differences which arise between the conflicting interests of employers on the one hand and employees on the other in a particular trade.   In the Civil Service there is in fact no employer apart from the State and no particular trade.   An Industrial Joint Council is composed of representatives of the various associations of employers and work-people in a trade.   Each side of the Council as a whole has a community of interest often different from that of the other side.  In the Public Service there is no definite opposition of interest in this sense.   Heads of Departments, whether Ministerial or Permanent, have no personal incentive to oppose the demands of the employees, while on the other hand the latter are split up into many grades with divergent and often opposing interests, the community between them being mainly the fact of common employment by the State.9. Ministerial Responsibility. Considerations of the kind indicated above point, in our opinion, to the need of a clear recognition of the important principle that, as Public Deparfc-ments should be administered for the benefit of the public, and the Minister in charge of a particular Department is responsible to Parliament for its being so administered, the control of the Minister must remain unimpaired, and that he must continue as in the past to exercise his powers unfettered by any restrictions other than those incidental to ultimate Parliamentary control.Joint Bodies for the Administrative Departments should be consultative and should have no Executive Powers. It follows, in our opinion, that any Joint Bodies set up for the Administrative Departments should be purely consultative, and should not be invested with any executive powers. It is obvious that a Minister would be placed in an impossible position if he were bound in any way by a decision to which his subordinates were parties even though he felt unable to defend it. The maintenance of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament presupposes that a Minister shall be free to accept or reject the conclusions of any Joint Council or Committee, even if they are unanimous.10. Any Scheme should take account of the great number and variety of Departments.  It is clear that any scheme based on Whitley principles must take account not only of the very large number of individual Administrative Departments but of the fact that these Departments differ horn one another in size, in organisation, and in the nature of the public duties they exist to perform.While a number of Departments have a Ministerial Head, there are a substantial number (including some Departments of considerable importance) which have no direct individual Parliamentary representative. While no detailed scheme could be formulated which would satisfy in all respects the varying requirements of all Departments, there seems to be no reason why experimental arrangements of the nature indicated later in the Report should not be introduced, on the understanding that details could be varied from time to time in the light of experience and as circumstances require.11. And must cover all grades and classes of Civil Servants. Another important consideration is that a Whitley Scheme for the Administrative Departments must cover and make provision for the very numerous grades and classes of employees of both sexes. Generally speaking, Civil Servants may for present purposes be divided into established or pensionable and unestablished or unpensionable employees. Both classes comprise grades engaged on (a) administrative, (b) clerical, (c) routine, and (d) manual or manipulative duties. Moreover, certain Departments employ a large and increasing number of specialist, technical, and professional officers. We understand that a fundamental principle laid down by the Whitley Committee is that the industry must be well organised on both sides. This condition can, no doubt, be regarded as satisfied so far as what we shall hereafter call the employers&apos; side of Joint Bodies, of the nature proposed below, is concerned. At present the employees&apos; side may, as regards certain large and important grades and classes, be said to be highly organised. Such organisation does not, however, at the moment extend (except in a some-what limited degree) to many important technical and professional grades, and, while Associations have recently been formed among the First Division and other Civil Servants entrusted with responsible administrative work, a considerable majority of the employees in those grades have joined no Civil Service Association or Society.   Before a Joint Committee
could satisfactorily be established it may in some cases be necessary that enquiries should be made in considtation, in cases of doubt, with the Ministry of Labour with a view to ascertaining whether the staff of the Department as a whole is sufficiently well organised to admit of satisfactory representation by Associations.12. Separate Bodies need not be set up to deal, with Questions of Remuneration.  One of the most important functions of an Industrial Joint Council in outside industry will he the discussion and settlement of questions relating directly or indirectly to the remuneration of the employees. We observe that in dealing with the application of the Whitley Report to the Government Industrial Establishments, the Main Committee recommended that having regard to (1) The Trade Union Custom for wages to be settled on a trade, rather than an industrial basis, and (2) the desirability of securing co-ordination and uniformity of action among the Departments, questions of collective bargaining notably rates of wages should be dealt with by Trade Joint Councils, composed on the Government side of representatives from all the Departments employing the particular classes of labour concerned and on the workmen&apos;s side of representatives of Trade Unions having members employed in the particular trades, while other questions should be considered by Departmental Joint Councils, consisting on the one side of representatives of the Government Department concerned, and on the other of representatives of the Trade Unions having members employed by that Government Department.13. We have carefully considered this aspect of the question and are of opinion that the conditions in the Administrative Departments do not call for the establishment of separate bodies whose special function would be the consideration of wages questions. We think that such questions could, subject to certain conditions, be assigned to the Joint Council and Committees contemplated later in the Report.14. The Relation of the Treasury to the Joint Bodies. The Treasury as the Department entrusted by Parliament not only with the general control over details of finance throughout the Public Service, but also with considerable powers of oversight, co-ordination and direction over all Departments, must clearly occupy an important place in any scheme of the kind now under consideration. The establishment of Joint Bodies for the Administrative Departments is hound to bring the Treasury into much closer touch with the views and opinions of representative employees, while the exclusion of the experience and knowledge of the Treasury on matters affecting the Civil Service from the discussions of the Joint Bodies would seriously lessen the value of any conclusions arrived at. While it is no doubt desirable that facilities should be afforded for the attendance of a Treasury representative at meetings at which important matters are under consideration, it is clearly out of the question for the Treasury to be regularly represented on all the Joint Bodies. (Our suggestions respecting Treasury representation are indicated in paragraphs 20 and 29.)15. For the purposes of this Report it is assumed that the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Government Employees will continue in being and that its functions will remain substantially unchangedi.16. The application of the Whitley Report to the Administrative Departments recom-mended. After careful consideration of the evidence given before us and of the difficult problems involved, we are agreed that, subject to certain modifications rendered necessary by factors such as the essential differences between public and private employment (paragraph 7) and the need for maintaining Ministerial responsibility and Parliamentary control (para-graph 9), the recommendations of the Whitley Report can and should be applied to the Administrative Departments of the Civil Service.We accordingly recommend the establishment of Joint Bodies whose constitutions and functions are outlined in the following paragraphs. So far as possible we have followed and adopted the recommendations of the Whitley Report. In certain respects, however, we have modified those recommendations to meet the peculiar circumstances of the case ; in place of the executive functions exercised by Joint Councils in outside industry, functions of an advisory and consultative nature must necessarily be substituted, and it is essential that certain subjects should be wholly or partially excluded from the purview of Civil Service Joint Bodies (paragraph 44). These modifications will not, in our opinion, in any way impair the usefulness of the scheme or hinder the attainment of the main objects in view as defined in paragraph 5 above. .We proceed to set out our recommendations in detail. Our scheme is based on the ultimate establishment of Joint Bodies falling into the following categories: The Establishment recommended of (L.) A National Joint Couneil. A National Joint Council for the whole of the Administrative Departments.(II.) Departmental Joint Committees. One or more Departmental Joint Committees for each Department (provided its size would justify such a Committee).(III.) District Joint Committees. - District or Local Office Joint Committees in suitable cases.(IV.) Sectional Committees. Sectional Committees of the Departmental Com-mittee.
17. General Observations applicable to all Joint Bodies. Before considering the constitu-tion and functions of these bodies, we think it advisable to make the following observations, which are applicable to them all: (1) Numbers on each side need not be equal. It has been suggested to us that the members on each side of a Council or Committee should be equal in number, on the ground that a body so constituted would inspire greater confidence. We do not agree with this view. As there would be no occasion for voting, equality of numbers is not required on that ground; and any such requirement would in practice result in serious inconvenience and disorganisation of public business, while, in the case of the Departmental and other Committees, it woidd necessitate nominating on the Employers&apos; side representatives from very subordinate ranks, an arrangement which is open to obvious objections.(2) Representation need not be constant. On the whole we think that it should be open to the authorities nominating the respective sides of the Council or Committee, if they consider it necessary, to vary some of their representatives according to the subject matter under discussion. In certain Departments very serious inconvenience would be caused by insisting that the representation on either side should always remain constant.(3) As a rule Associations should be represented by Civil Servants.   While there seem to us to be good reasons why the Associations should as a rule be repre-sented on Joint Bodies by Civil Servants, we see no serious objection to an Association restricted to Civil Servants nominating as its representative a whole-time official of the Association who is not a Civil Servant.(4) Joint Bodies should have vrritten Constitutions. Each Council and Committee should, following the precedents of Joint Industrial Councils, have a written constilu-tion which should make provision for its amendment as required and for the appointment, if necessary, of committees for special purposes on which, if thought desirable, co-opted members with special experience might be invited to serve.(5) Publication of Proceedings of Joint Bodies. The successful working of the arrangements contemplated in the Report will to a considerable extent depend on the nature of the publicity given to the proceedings of the Joint Bodies. It is clear that mention may be made at meetings of matters of a confidential or semi-confidential character the unauthorised publication of which might have serious consequences, or a garbled or distorted version may be published of a discussion on a matter of general Service interest. In any case confidence would inevitably be impaired and future free discussion would be rendered impossible. We recommend that only statements issued under the authority of the Council or Committee, as the case may be, should be published, but such statements should be as full and informative as possible. The minutes of the meetings should contain all particulars which are of value for purposes of record.(6) Finance. Following the precedent of Joint Councils in outside industry, the common expenses of the Joint Bodies should be defrayed in equal proportions by the Government and the respective Staff Associations represented. All expenses for travelling, subsistence and other purposes incurred by representatives of Staff Associa-tions will be borne by the Associations or out of a common fund to be created by them for the purpose.18. We proceed to consider the constitution and functions of the Joint Bodies, the establishment of which we recommend. In the absence of experience of the working of any strictly comparable arrangements, any proposals and suggestions we can make must be tentative and exploratory, and we therefore limit ourselves to an outline sketch of a scheme the details of which must be filled in later in the light of experience.THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.19. The initial Membership should not exceed 50. There are obvious difficulties in prescribing at the outset any definite fixed number of members for this Council. We only think it necessary to point out that the Council should be large enough to allow adequate representation on both sides, and should be capable of expansion if and when necessary. On the whole it will probably be found that an aggregate membership not exceeding 50 in all will provide a satisfactorily representative body, at all events in the initial stages.20. Official Representation. It has been represented to us on behalf of one Association that the Employers&apos; side of this Council should be composed of Ministers, Members of Parliament, and persons of outside experience, and that all Civil Servants of whatever rank should for this purpose be regarded as employees. This view appears to us to disregard the realities of the situation.   The Head Permanent Officials of Government Departments, like
the General Managers of Companies, are no doubt in theory employees, but in practice they exercise the functions and possess the attributes of employers; moreover many of the questions which will be brought before the National Council involve problems of a highly technical nature, the correct solution of which calls for a long and intimate knowledge and experience of Civil Service conditions and practices which few Ministers, Members of Parliament, or persons of outside experience can be expected to possess. We feel that an Employers&apos; side of the National Council constituted on the above basis would be unsatis-factory from every point of view and, while we see very great difficulty in deciding where the line should be drawn between a Civil Servant who for this particular purpose may be regarded as an &quot; employee &quot; and a Civil Servant who cannot be so regarded, we are of opinion that the highest ranks of the service must sit, if at all, on the Employers&apos; side of the National Council. We accordingly recommend that the Employers&apos; side of this Council should consist of members chosen by Government, and that a substantial majority of such members should be Permanent Heads of. Departments or Officials of high rank nominated by them. In large Departments the Head of the Establishment Branch would normally be the person so nominated. As the number of places available will be a small fraction of the number of Departments, it is clear that only a few Departments can have a representative on the Council, and arrangements will have to be made to secure that, so far as possible, the representation is distributed so as to cover the whole field. The Treasury and the Ministry of Labour should certainly have permanent representation on the Council.21. Staff Representation. The problem of securing adequate and satisfactory representa-tion of the greatest possible number of staff interests will require very careful consideration. Speaking generally, the principle of the Whitley Report should be followed, and the repre-sentatives should be nominated by Staff Associations or groups of Associations. This arrange-ment does not, however, provide for the direct representation of the unorganised grades and classes referred to in paragraph 11 above, but clearly, if the National Council is to be of reasonable proportions, this difficulty cannot be avoided, and it must be left to the good sense of those concerned to arrange for the representation of these important elements. We feel sure that it will be generally agreed that in order to be effective the staff side must be broadly representative of the Civil Service as a whole, and that as far as possible the representatives must be drawn from a variety of Departments. In this connection the question of the pro-portion of representation as between the different Associations must arise. By far the largest Associations are those comprising grades peculiar to the Post Office, and these grades in the aggregate account for a majority of the whole body of Civil Servants. Representation on the basis of membership might, therefore, mean that the nominees of the Post Office Associations would dominate the Employees&apos; side of the National Council. Such a situation would certainly not commend itself to the Service as a whole and might defeat the whole purpose of the National Council, which is, we conceive, to bring together the experience and varying points of view of as many different grades and classes as possible. The proportion of representation must be determined by negotiation between the different Associations and, as no doubt similar representation difficulties have already arisen in the case of Industrial Joint Councils, we think that the experience and advice of the Ministry of Labour (which should be closely consulted during the course of the negotiations) should be utilised to the fullest extent.22. Chairman and Vice-Chairman. There should be a Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Council. The Government will no doubt select as Chairman some person possessing intimate acquaintance with the working of the public service. The Vice-Chairman should he a member of the Council.23. Following the practice of Industrial Councils there should be a separate Secretary for each side of the Council.24. Functions. We do not think it advisable to lay down in advance a close definition of subjects with which the National Council should deal. The Whitley Report itself merely indicates the general lines on which development should proceed. It is desirable, however, to point out the general scope of the CounciPs work in certain directions, and it has been found more convenient to do this under the headings of certain subjects later in the Report (paragraphs 26, 27, and 44).2.5. The National Council must necessarily be a consultative and advisoiy body only [see paragraph 9), but, in so far as its recommendations are unanimous, they will naturally carry weight with the Government and Heads of Departments, upon whom, however, must continue to fall the constitutional responsibility to Parliament for their adoption and application. Generally speaking, the National Council should be concerned with broad and important questions affecting the Civil Service as a whole, such as organisation, recruitment, conditions of service, &amp;c. It should not be directly concerned with matters which are at present within the discretion of individual Departments.26. National Council to consider questions of Remuneration of Classes common to the Service. The National Council should in our view be the only Joint Body at which questions of remuneration affecting a particular class common to the Service should be discussed, and after careful consideration we recommend that such questions should be referred by theu  7521 a 3
National Council to Sub-Committees of that Council, consisting of members of the class concerned nominated by the Associations and selected members of the Employers&apos; side of the Council nominated by the Treasury. Such machinery would obviate the difficulty of having (a) separate discussions between the Treasuiy and such classes, going on concurrently with discussions at a Whitley Joint Board, (o) the same question being discussed at a number of Departmental Committees when it should be discussed as a whole by the central authority, and (e) discussions of questions of remuneration of a class by representatives of other classes who have no interest in the matter.27. Suggested basis for Constitution of National Council. The Whitley Report, in paragraph 16, gives an outline of subjects with which Joint Councils in Industry should deal. Witnesses before the Sub-Committee have been asked to give their views as to the suitability of the points indicated for consideration by Joint Bodies for the Civil Service. We agree with the general opinion expressed that, while certain of the subjects proposed are not problems with which the Civil Servant is much concerned, others suggest a valuable basis for the work of the Joint Bodies. We therefore indicate the following as a sketch of the functions of the National Council. Experience will no doubt show the lines on which the activities of the Council can best develop.(i) Provision of the best means for utilising the ideas and experience of the staff. . (ii) Means for securing to the staff a greater share in and responsibility for the determination and observance of the conditions under which their duties are carried out.(hi) Consideration of the general principles governing conditions of service, e.g., recruitment, hours, promotion, salary, and superannuation.(iv) The encouragement of further education of Civil Servants and their training in higher administration and business organisation.(v) Improvement of office machinery - and organisation and the provision of opportunities for the full consideration of suggestions by the staff on this subject.(vi) Proposed legislation so far as it has a bearing upon the position of the Civil Service.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEES.28. Official Representation. The Employers&apos; side will be appointed by the Minister or the Head of the Department, and should consist of higher officials of the Department, -especially those conversant with establishment work.   We think it undesirable to lay down any rule as to the grade of officer .who should serve on the Employers&apos; side of those Committees.29. Treasury Representation on Departmental Committees. The number of Departmental Committees makes the question of Treasury representation one of considerable difficulty. While many of the problems discussed by these Committees will not call for the presence of a Treasury representative, we feel confident that a number of matters will demand the elucidation and assistance that Treasury experience alone can provide. It will probably be found necessary to give the Treasury as long notice as possible of any important question of the latter kind and to leave that Department to decide whether a written communication shall be sent to the Committee or a Treasury representative shall attend the particular meeting. We do not contemplate Treasury representation on Committees other than Committees of the National Council and Departmental Committees.30. Staff Representation. The principle recommended in paragraph 21 of nomination by Staff Associations or groups of such Associations represented in a Department should be followed also in the case of the Departmental Committee. This arrangement does not exclude direct representation of any class peculiar to a particular Department if the class is of a considerable size. It may not be possible to provide for direct representation where such classes are small in number, but experience will probably indicate a means whereby in such cases at any rate indirect representation may be secured.31. The number of staff representatives will vary according to the size of the Department, but should not normally exceed 10. The staff nominees other than officials of Associations should be members of the staff of the Department. The distribution of seats should be settled by negotiation, and need not correspond to the membership strength of the Associations concerned. *32. Officers. On Industrial Councils the usual practice is to appoint the Chairman and Vice Chairman from the Council. If the Chairman is from the Employers&apos; side, the Vice-Chairman is appointed by the Workers&apos; side and vice versa. The special circumstances of the Civil Service preclude the possibility of adopting a similar method. It is, therefore, suggested that the Chairman should be nominated by the Head of the Department, and that in his absence the next senior officer present on the official side should act as Chairman. In all cases a Secretary should be appointed for either side.
33. Functions-Tlie Departmental Committee will be mainly occupied with matters affecting the Department in which it is formed, but from time to time questions of general interest&quot; to the Civil Service will come up for discussion. In any case the Committee&apos;s functions will be limited to submitting any conclusions reached to the Head of the Department concerned for consideration.34. The subjects to which the attention of Departmental Committees might be directed will be those indicated in paragraph 28 so far as they have a special application to the particular Department.35. Relation of National Council to Departmental Committees. The precise line of demarca-tion between the scope of the National Council and Departmental Committees must be left largely to the test of experience. It is important, of course, that no conclusion arrived *at by a Departmental Committee should conflict with a conclusion of the National Council, or indeed, on a question of general interest, with one reached by another Departmental Committee. If, in any particular case, a Departmental Committee are of opinion that a general question is involved, they may, in submitting their recommendations to the Head of the Department, represent to him that the matter is in their opinion one for the consideration of the National Council and may move him to take steps to have the question referred to that Council. The National Council will not act as a Court of Appeal from a Departmental or other Committee. There are some subjects which for all practical purposes are entirely Departmental, and as regards these the National Council -will not be concerned.36. Separate Committees for the Discussion of the Pay and Special Conditions of Service of Supervisory Grades. The position of the higher grades of supervising and controlling officers in a scheme of Joint Bodies gives rise to considerable difficulty. There are for instance obvious objections to the discussion of the pay and special conditions of service of supervising officers by Committees mainly composed of representatives of the rank and file. It may therefore be desirable, particularly in the larger Departments, that separate Committees should be established composed of representatives of the Department on the one side and of the supervisory classes on the other to discuss such matters. Provision might be made for joint meetings of these Committees and those representing the rank and file for the discussion of certain general questions, if both Committees so desired.37. Separate Departmental, District, or Office Committees may be established in certain of the larger Departments.  In certain of the larger Offices there may be Departments which are more analogous to an industry of an ordinary type, and which are separate and distinct from the rest of the Office, both in function, organisation and personnel, while the employees are represented by different Associations. The Engineering Department of the Post Office is a case in point. In such cases we think that it may be convenient to establish a separate Departmental Committee with its separate District or Office Committees.DISTRICT OR LOCAL OFFICE JOINT COMMITTEES.38. District or Local Office Joint Committees. The work of many Departments is distributed throughout the country and is sometimes locally organised as in the case of the Board of Customs and Excise, the Post Office, Ministry of Labour, &amp;c, and in such cases the formation of District or Local Office Committees may be found advisable. .39. Official representatives will naturally be officers of lower rank than those sitting on the Departmental Committees, but the constitution and proceedings of the Committees will be largely on the lines of those of the Departmental Committees. District and Local Office Committees will be comparatively small in size.40. Officers of these Committees should be chosen as in the case of the Departmental Committee, and a constitution adopted.41. The desirability of setting up a District or Local Office Committee in any particular instance and the definition of its functions should be questions for the Department after consultation, if necessary, with the Departmental Committee. This is a matter on which the Ministry of Labour might be asked to advise.SECTIONAL COMMITTEES OF THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE. 42. It has been represented to us in the course of our enquiries that in certain Departments there are particular Branches dealing with distinct sections of the Departments work and staffed by a series of grades of officers recruited for, and peculiar to, those Branches. Cases of this kind are the Outdoor Service of the Board of Customs and Excise, the Tax Branch of the Board of Inland Revenue and the Inspectorate of the Board of Education. Questions peculiar to such Branches may well arise which may he dealt with more conveniently by separate subordinate bodies for those Branches.43. It is necessary for the success of the general scheme that such Branches should enter into the main structure of the scheme and consequently be represented on the Departmental
Committee in the usual way. For the special purposes indicated, however, they might act separately, if this course is considered necessary, and the body appointed to that end should he a Sectional Committee of the Departmental Committee, and should consist of the representatives of the Branch already on the Departmental Committee with such additional co-opted members as the Departmental Committee may approve. The Sectional Committees would consider only such matters as are delegated to them by the Departmental Committee, but their general purpose should be the same.SUBJECTS TO BE EXCLUDED WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY FROM THE PURVIEWOF JOINT BODIES.44-.* Policy. We proceed to- indicate certain subjects which we consider should be excluded wholly or partially from the purview of the National Council and Committees above described. Having regard to what has been said earlier in the Report respecting the maintenance of Ministerial responsibility, we think that there should be no discussion of broad questions of administration and policy even if a Department may be closely interested, e.g., in the case of the Post Oilice, such a subject as the revision of postage rates, or in the case of- the Customs and Excise, the rate of duty on tobacco, a fortiori large political questions, such as Free Trade and Protection, Home Rule, &amp;c, &amp;c.While it is difficult to find a definition free from all objection, we submit that the scope of the Joint Bodies for the Civil Service should- be strictly limited to matters which directly affect the conditions of service of the staff and the working of Departments.Remuneration. Questions of remuneration will naturally come up for discussion at Joint Bodies. These questions often involve considerations of a very technical and complex character, and their satisfactory solution calls for an intimate and general knowledge of terms and con-ditions both within and without the Civil Service. We hope that such discussion will result in a material diminution of the number of cases referred for hearing to the Conciliation and Arbitration Board. Questions affecting the remuneration of grades common to the Service should only be raised at the National Council (paragraph 26), and it may be advisable to set up inside Departments separate Committees to discuss the pay of Controlling and Supervising Officers (paragraph-36). A Departmental, District or Sectional Committee will normally only be concerned with the remuneration of a grade peculiar to the Department or Branch respectively.Promotion. Promotion in the Civil Service raises far more numerous and complex questions than promotion in the industrial world, and it is highly important that nothing should be done to weaken the established principle that merit and the efficiency of the service are the sole considerations which should justify the advancement of a Civil Servant. Discussion of the subject should be rigidly restricted to the general aspects of the matter such as the principles upon which promotions in general should rest, the desirability or otherwise of removing existing restrictions and limitations, and the possibility of securing as between one Department and another a more equitable system of promotion than obtains at present. Under no circumstances should individual cases be taken into consideration. Recommendations of the National Council should be submitted to the Treasury, and any recommendations of a Committee should be made to the Head of the Department concerned.Superannuation. This subject is ultimately one of policy. It would clearly be within the functions of the National Council to consider and advise on certain aspects of it, and their recommendations should be submitted to the Treasury: any discussion or criticism of individual cases should be excluded.Discipline. The State is under a strong obligation to maintain discipline among its employees: cases of misconduct and insubordination are as a rule more leniently and carefully dealt with than in outside employment. As is well known, dismissals are rare and are only carried out after full and impartial investigation.The. position appears to us to be similar to that of Promotion. While the general principles underlying disciplinary action may properly be discussed, the discussion of individual cases should be ruled out.GENERAL.   ..45. Procedure for giving effect to Proposals if the latter are approved by KM. Government.  We have regarded our functions as limited to the formulation of the general principles which should be followed in the application of the Whitley proposals to the Civil Service, and to indicating in outline the main features of the organisation which should be set up.If our proposals are approved by H.M. Government, the first step to be taken to put the scheme into operation should be to call a National Joint Conference of official representatives of the various Departments and representatives of the Staff Associations, to consider the scheme outlined in this Report as a basis for the formation of Joint Bodies for the Civil Service.   This
National Joint Conference would then appoint a Provisional National Joint Committee on which the Treasury and Ministry of Labour would be represented, to draw up the detailed scheme for the National Council and to formulate the main principles on which the Depart-mental and other Committees should be set up.Similarly, Joint Conferences should he called and Provisional Joint Committees appointed in the respective Departments.for the purpose of establishing Departmental and other Committees in accordance with the main principles laid down by the Provisional National Joint Com-mittee modified to suit the varying requirements of different Departments.The Ministry of Labour should be represented at these Departmental Conferences and Provisional Committees, if desired by the Staff.46. Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations. The following is a Summary of our main conclusions and recommendations: (a) The main objects of establishing Joint Bodies for the Administrative Departments are to secure greater co-operation between the State, as employer, and the general body of Civil Servants so as to promote increased efficiency in the public service and the well-being of those employed, to provide machinery for the ventilation of grievances, and to enable all grades and classes to contribute their views and experience on many technical and difficult problems (paragraph 5).(b) In view of the essential differences between public and private employment (paragraph 7) and the need for maintaining ministerial responsibility and Parliamentary Control, the Joint Bodies must be consultative and must not be invested with any executive functions (paragraph 9).(c) The scheme must be sufficiently elastic to embrace the various kinds of Departments and to cover all grades and classes of Civil Servants engaged on administrative, clerical, routine and manipulative duties (paragraphs 10 and 11), but it is not necessary to follow the precedent of Industrial Councils and to set up one set of Bodies, organised on a trade basis, to deal with questions of collective bargaining and another set of Bodies, organised on an industrial basis, to deal with other questions (paragraphs 12 and 13).-(d) As the Treasury will be brought into close touch with the actual views and outlook of representative employees and will be in a position to contribute valuable experience and knowledge of Civil Service conditions and practices, it is desirable that Treasury representation should be secured on the more important Joint Bodies (paragraphs 14, 20 and 29).(e) Subject to certain modifications rendered necessary by the considerations indicated in &quot;(e) above, we recommend the adoption for the Civil Service of the recommendations of the Whitley Report and the establishment of the following kinds of Joint Bodies : (i) A National Council for the whole of the Administrative Departments.(ii) One or more Departmental Joint Committees for each Department.(iii) District or Local Office Joint Committees in suitable cases.(iv) Sectional Committees of the Departmental Committee (paragraph 16)..(/) The membership of each side of a Joint Body need not be equal, and the authorities nominating the respective sides of the Joint Bodies may vary some of their representatives according to the subject matters under discussion. As a rule Associations should be represented by Civil Servants, but there is no objection to an Association restricted&apos; to Civil Servants being represented by an official who is not a Civil Servant. The Joint Bodies should have written constitutions and careful attention should be paid to the nature of the publicity given to their proceedings. Only statements issued under the authority of a Joint Body should be published, but these should be as full and informative as possible. The expenses of Joint Bodies should be defrayed in the manner indicated in the concluding section of paragraph 17.(g) The aggregate membership of the National Council should not exceed 50 (paragraph 19): the official representatives should be chosen by Government, a substantial majority being Permanent Heads of Departments, or officials of high rank nominated by them ; the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour should have permanent representation on this Council (paragraph 20): the staff representatives should be nominated by Staff Associations or groups of Associations, every effort being made to secure that the Staff side is broadly representative of the Civil Service as a whole (paragraph 21).(h) The National Council will he a consultative and advisory body and will be concerned with broad and important questions affecting the Civil Service as a whole, such as organisation, recruitment, conditions of service, &amp;c. (paragraph 25). Questions of remuneration affecting a class common to the Service will only be discussed at this Council, and will be referred to Sub-Committees consisting of members of the class concerned and selected members of the Employers&apos; side of the Council nominated by the Treasury (paragraph 26). In paragraph 27 we suggest a basis fqr the con-stitution of the National Council founded on the recommendations contained in paragraph 16 of the Whitley Report.A 5
(i) The Employers&apos; side of Departmental Committees will he appointed by the Minister or Head of the Department from among the higher Departmental Officials (paragraph 28); the staff representatives should be nominated by Staff Associations, care being taken to cover the whole field, and the distribution of places should be settled by negotiation and should not merely depend on the membership strength of the Associations concerned (paragraph 31).(j) The Departmental Committee will be mainly concerned with matters affecting the Department in which it is formed, and in all cases it will submit, any conclusions-reached to the Head of the Department for consideration (paragraph/33.]. It. may be desirable, particularly in the larger Departments, to set up separate Committees, to discuss the pay and special conditions of service of the higher grades of Supervising and. Controlling Officers (paragraph 36).(k) In the larger Departments there may be branches, separate and distinct from the rest of the Department in function, organisation and personnel and in which the staff is represented by different Associations. In such cases it may be convenient to set up separate Departmental, District and Office Committees (paragraph 37).(I) District or Local Office Joint Committees may have to be formed in the case of Departments whose work is distributed throughout the country (paragraph 38), and distinct sections of Departments staffed by grades recruited for and peculiar to those sections may call for Sectional Committees of the Departmental Committees (paragraph 42).(m) Broad questions of administration and policy should be wholly excluded from the purview of Civil Service Joint Bodies and only the general aspects of questions of promotion, superannuation and discipline should be considered, discussion or criticism of individual cases being excluded.(n) In paragraph 45 we suggest machinery for giving effect to our proposals, if approved by H.M. Government.T. L. HEATH.L. N. GUILLEMARD.W. GRAHAM GREENE.R. H. BRADE.0. A. R. MURRAY.D. J. SHACKLETON. W. A. ROBINSON. G. E. P. MURRAY.E. H. BRIGHT.Bertram Wilson, 1 R. B.
