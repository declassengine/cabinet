FINANCE 			1	Control of capital and rehabilitation of trade	13	That it be an instruction to the Chancellor of the Exchequer:  1. That he should spare neither labour nor expense if, through either, he can establish a control over capital that shall be intelligent, rapid in decision, and accessible. 2. That he should, through reason-able publicity, secure that full infor-mation as to the procedure of the control is readily available to the public. 3. That the policy to be adopted should   be   to   allow the greatest possible amount of   capital   to  be devoted to business development con-sis tently with meeting the essential expenses of the State, which must con-tinue to have first claim  on  the resources of the country.	-2	Inflation	14	That it be an instruction of the War Cabinet to the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer :  1. That he delays action designed to secure deflation. 2. That, if need arise, he even permits a slight further inflation to develop which would have been neces-sary if the war had continued to midsummer 1919, as was at one time deemed to be not unlikely. 3. That the situation with regard to inflation be reviewed in six months&apos; time.	[1748] B72

That it should appoint an iuter-depart-mental committee of the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Foreign Office, and the Ministry of Munitions to examine all such requests, and that, if direct assist-ance from the State is necessary in any case other than those in which orders are placed for goods which Government itself requires, it should take the form of a bounty on export, limited in amount to the cost which might otherwise have fallen on the Exchequer for unemploy-ment benefit to the workers.3.

Special consideration should be given to the question of restoring the re-export trade, which, before the war, was most important and highly valuable, and gave direct and indirect employment to large numbers of people.

Provided that all of the provisions of the existing agreements between the Associated Governments and the War Trade Board, on the one hand, and the Govern-ments of the above-mentioned neutral countries, or Import Associations therein, on the other hand, which provisions are not contravened by the foregoing resolutions, shall be continued in full force and effect, except as the same may be expressly relaxed by the establishment of free lists or other measures adopted by the competent Associated authorities, and administered through the I.A.T.C.&apos;s in the several neutral countries. Further, that all shipments to the above-mentioned neutral countries must be consigned to the respective Import Associations in these countries in the case of shipments for members thereof, provided the said bodies give the usual guarantees to the satisfaction of the I.A.T.C.&apos;s ; in the event that the said Associations shall be unwilling to receive the consignment or shipments intended for importers not members of the said bodies, the Associated Governments will permit shipments to be made for the account of such persons, provided the same are consigned to the I.A.T.C. in the country of destination, release to be made, upon the execution by the actual purchaser of satisfactory guarantees against re-export to unapproved destinations.(2.) Shipments to Germany from the above-mentioned neutral countries, except those authorised by the several rationing agreements, shall be permitted only in the event that the same shall have been approved by the I.A.T.C. in the country from which shipment is proposed to be made.
