-[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Oovernmeirij^Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1918.SECRET.G.-216. 40WAR CABINET.REAFFORESTATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.Tevlous Papers G.-189, G.-215, G.T.-3319, G.T.-3342, G.T.-3433, G.T.-3652, G.T.-3688, G.T.-3989, G.T.-4445, G.T.-5063, War Cabinet 116/2, 360/17, and 411/17.)I HAVE read the Report of Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes on Forestry (G.-215), and desire to offer thereon some observations to the War Cabinet.Our colleagues have evidently found, as I did, that in the matter of forestry &quot; personal and political considerations had engendered a heat which we were not fully competent to understand, and were wholly powerless to allay.&quot;It was with the governing desire that we should embark upon a comprehensive programme of afforestation without delay that I sought to present to the War Cabinet proposals which, whilst securing such a programme, would give rise to the least parliamentary and administrative difficulties :       *   .1. On the programme itself I am strongly of opinion that a block grant covering twenty years should be passed instead of one covering ten years, as proposed in the recommendation 4. The reasons for this were set out at length in my previous memorandum, and substantially amount to this : That of the first ten j^ears not more than five or six would be concerned with extensive planting, and that so short a period would not provide security for the sufficient development of the staff of the organisation necessary for the work.2. I am not greatly concerned as to whether the Central Forestry Authority, as proposed by me, should be attached to the Development Commission or not, but I may say that the main reason why I proposed that it should be attached to the Development Commission was that parliamentary and legal difficulties are thereby materially minimised, as set out in Appendix (B) of my former memorandum G.-189.3. I do not clearly understand the administrative arrangements contemplated by my colleagues in their recommendation No. 2. The local national bodies or executives would either be directly responsible to the Central Forestry Authority or, alternatively, they would be a department of the Board of Agriculture, but it is clear that, in the latter capacity, they could not, as regards administrative and executive work, be &quot; subordinate to the Central Forestry Authority.&quot; Such an arrangement would entail a division of responsibility which could only end in inefficiency and lack of progress. The scheme of operations which I contemplated was that the Central Forestry Authority would allocate the programme and necessary finance to the different local or National Forestry Executives which would be attached to their respective Boards of Agriculture. The National Forestry Executive would be charged to carry out its allotted share of the programme, and the responsible head of the department would be responsible for seeing that they did so. As the programme of work and the money, therefore, would be detailed by the central authority, I do not understand how the National Forestry Executive could thereby find its interests subordinated to those of agriculture, as appears to be contemplated by my colleagues; it would have a specific work to do, and the Minister in charge of the Board of Agriculture would be responsible for the administration and staff necessary for its execution. I think, however, that it would be quite proper that the Central Forestry Authority should have its own inspection officers, so that it might receive its own reports of the progress of all the schemes in the different parts of the United Kingdom.
4. I am convinced that to separate the forestry organisation from agriculture would be a mistake, because the two necessarily overlap in many ways as regards the proper utilisation of land taken in connection with forestrj^ schemes, many areas of which will be unsuitable for planting, but capable of development in other directions.5. I think recommendation 5 ueeds careful examination, not so much from the point of view of forestry only, but in regard to kindred matters. Proposals, for example, are being put forward with regard to fisheries, which may lead to similar recommenda-tions ; and I think we should guard against the creation of a large number of separate and more or less independent authorities, with Ministers responsible to Parliament. Rather I contemplate we should provide adequate machinery for the conduct of the departments concerned, with specific but limited responsibilities grouped under one Minister, so that if there were to be a Parliamentary Secretary responsible for forestry (as is suggested by the Secretary of Scotland with regard to health), these Parlia-mentary Secretaries should be attached to specific Ministers ; otherwise we shall be committed to a needless multiplication of departments.6. With regard to the observations in paragraph 15, I pointed out in my memorandum of the 27th December, 1917, that proposals for subsidising the private owner, in order to secure replanting, were bound to be controversial, and I expressed some doubts as to whether they were compatible with a system of efficient afforestation. I went on to suggest that the position could be reviewed in five years&apos; time, and I still think, though I am open to conviction on the matter, that it will be wiser to leave matters thus. It should be clear by that time whether the programme suggested will be of a kind to meet the need for replanting.7. In conclusion, I should add that I cannot agree that the only authorities who support my proposals are the official representatives of Scotland and Ireland (paragraph 7). My memorandum of December was agreed to by Mr. Prothero and, as I understand the position, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have in no way altered their views.C. ADDISON.July 8, 1918.
