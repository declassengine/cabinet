(COAL INDUSTRY COMMISSION ACT, 1919.REPORTbyThe Honourable Mr. JUSTICE SANKEY, G.B.R(Chairman).TO THE KING&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. May it please Your Majesty.I have the honour to present a further Report in pursuance -of the Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919.1. RECOMMENDATIONS. 1.I recommend that Parliament be invited immediately to pass legislation acquiring: the Coal Royalties for the State and paying- fair and just compensation to the -owners.II.1 recommend on the evidence before me that the principle of &apos; State ownership of the coal mines be accepted.III.I recommend that the scheme for local administration hereinafter set out, or any modification of it adopted by Parliament, be &quot;immediately set up with the aid of the Coal Controllers Department, and that Parliament be invited to pass legislation acquiring&quot; the coal mines for the State, after the scheme has been worked for three years from the date of this Report, paying- fair and just compensation to the owners.,IV.The success of the industry, whether under private or State -ownership, depends upon productivity and upon everyone doing 23797-39 A 3
his best. The alarming fall in output lias convinced me that at present everyone is not doing his best. I am not able to say whether this is the fault of the management or of the workers or of both. Each blames the other. The cause must be investi-gated, but, whatever it may be, it is hopeless to expect an improvement in the present atmosphere of distrust and recrimina-tion. My prescription is the old proverb, &quot; Plenty of work and a heart to do it.&quot;V.I make this Report because I believe that the workers at present employed can and. will maintain an output of 250,000,000 tons a year at least, which was the figure adopted in the Interim Report of March 20th last, pre-sented by me and my three colleagues. I rely upon the honour of the men&apos;s leaders and of the men and of all others concerned to achieve this result. In my opinion it can and ought to be done. If the output per man con-tinues to go down the supremacy of this country is in danger.VI.I recommend the continuance of the Goal Control for three years from the date of this Report.VII.I repeat paragraph XIX of the Interim Report of March 20th above referred to. The question of State ownership is one of policy to be determined by Parliament in which all classes, interests, and industries are represented.
t2. REASONS FOR THE STATE OWNERSHIP OF COALROYALTIES.VIII.Coal is our principal national asset, and as it is a wasting asset it is in the interest of the State that it should be won and used to the best advantage.XIX.The seams of coal are now vested in the hands of nearly 4,000 owners, most of whom are reasonable, but some of whom are a real hindrance to the development of the national asset.X.In certain areas the ownership of the seams of coal is in the hands of many small owners some of whom cannot be found, and this causes great delay and expense in acquiring the right to work the mineral.XLBarriers of coal are left unworked between the properties of various owners to an extent which, in many cases, is not neces-sary for safe and proper working of the individual concern, and millions of tons of the national asset are thereby wasted.XII.Drainage and pumping are carried on in individual pits at heavy unnecessary expense instead of under a centralised plan covering a whole area. Further, lack of co-operation in drainage has in the past been, and is at the present time, conducive to the abandonment oi&quot; coal and collieries.XIII.Boundaries of undertakings are arbitrary and irregular and make coal in certain places difficult to work or not worth working.XIV.Plots of land are let for building and the law allows this to be done without the right of underground support, so that the coal is worked from underneath, houses are damaged, and no compensation is payable; this is not consistent with the public well-being.23797-39 A I
Under State ownership there will be one owner instead qM nearly 4,000 owners of the National asset, and the difficulties caused under the present system in regard to barriers, drainage, pumping, boundaries and support will largely disappear.XVI.The State ownership should be exercised through a Minister of Mines.XVII.The interim report of the Acquisition and Valuation of&quot; Land Committee has pointed out at least 14 defects arising from the present system of ownership of ihe seams of coal and proposes to create a new sanctioning authority vested with power to issue compulsory orders from time to time to remedy these defects as and when they are in different cases found to exist.XVIII.I regard as preferable to this expensive piece-meal machinery that the seams of coal should be acquired by the State once and for all in one final settlement, tog-ether with all usual or necessary easements and rig-hts incidental thereto, tog-ether with power to pro-cure all such easements and rights in the future. If the State only acquires the seams from time to time it means many arbitrations, many intermediate settle-ments, enhanced delay, and increased cost of admin-lstration.
f   3. METHOD OP PURCHASE OF COAL ROYALTIES.XIX.The value of each individual royalty owner&apos;s interest should he assessed by Government valuers with an appeal to a specially constituted tribunal.XX.Such valuers should take into consideration  (a) the properties where coal has been developed; (&amp;) potential properties where coal is known to exist and is . awaiting development;.(c) surface wayleaves and shaft rent in certain cases whichdestroy the amenities of the neighbouring property;(d) the usual royalty charged in the district for the class ofcoal in question;but not (e) properties in which the existence of coal is uncertainbut suspected; and (/) underground wayleaves.\XXI.I also suggest that Parliament in laying down the principles of valuation should consider whether it is not possible to fix a total maximum sum which would form a poo) to be allocated between the various individual royalty owners in accordance with the foregoing or any other principles which Parliament may adopt. The advantage of this plan would be that the State would at once know its total maximum liability.r
4. REASONS FOR STATE OWNERSHIP  OF COAL  4MINES.XXII.Coal mining&apos; is our national key industry upon which nearly all other industries depend. A cheap and ade-quate supply of coal is essential to the comfort of individuals and to the maintenance of the trade of the country. In this respect, and in the peculiar conditions of its working, the coal mining industry occupies a unique and exceptional place in our national life, and there is no other industry with which it can be compared.XXIII.The other industries and consumers, generally are entitled to have a voice in deciding the amount of coal to be produced and the price at which it is to be sold, which they have not had in the past.XXIV.The export trade in coal has greatly increased, and the system of competition between many private colliery owners and exporters to obtain orders frequently prevents the industry getting the full value for the article.XXV.The inland trade in coal has greatly increased, and the system of distribution through the hands of many private individuals prevents the consumer getting the article as cheaply as he should do. It has been estimated that there are 28,000 retail distri-butors of coal in the United Kingdom.XXVI.In other words, there is underselling in the export trade and overlapping in the inland trade.XXVII.Passing to another phase of the difficulty, the lack of capital ul some mines and the lack of proper management in others prevent the development of coalfields and the extraction of coal to the best advantage for the benefit of the Nation.
There are in the United Kingdom about 3,000 pits owned by about 1,500 companies or individuals. Unification under State ownership makes it possible to apply the principles of standardization of materials and appliances and thereby to effect economies to an extent which is impossible under a system where there are so many individual owners.XXIX.It may be argued that the foregoing defects in the present system could be removed by changes in the direction of Unifica-tion falling short of State ownership.XXX.But a great change in outlook has come over the workers in the coalfields, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to carry on the industry on the old accustomed lines. The relationship between the masters and workers in most of the coalfields in the United Kingdom is, unfortunately, of such a character that it seems impossible to better it under the present system of owner-ship. Many of the workers think they are working for the capitalist and a strike becomes a contest between labour and capital. This is much less likely to apply wTith the State as owner, and there is fair reason to expect that the relationship between labour and the community will be an improvement upon the relationship between labour and capital in the coal-fields.XXXI.Half a century of education has produced in the workers in the coalfields far more than a desire for the material advantages of higher wages and shorter hours. They have now, in many cases and to an ever increasing extent, a higher ambition of taking their due share and interest in the direction of the industry to the success of which they, too, are contributing.XXXII.The attitude of the colliery owners is well expressed &quot;by Lord Gainford, who, speaking&quot; on their behalf as a witness before the Commission, stated: &quot; I am author-&quot; ised to say on behalf of the Mining&quot; Association that if *&apos; owners are not to be left complete executive control -&quot;they will decline to accept the responsibility of
&quot;carrying&apos; on the industry, and, though they regard &quot; nationalisation as disastrous to the country, they feel &quot; they would in such event he driven to the only alter-&quot; native nationalisation on fair terms.&quot;XXXIII.It is true that in the minds of many men there is a fear that State ownership may stifle incentive, but to-day we are faced in the coalfields with increasing industrial unrest and a constant strife between modern labour and modern capital.I think that the danger to be apprehended from the certainty of the continuance of this strife iu the coal mining industry outweighs the danger arising from the problematical fear of the risk of the loss of incentive.XXXIV.The object to be aimed at under State ownership is national co-ordination of effort in respect of the production of the national asset and of its export and inland supply.
5. METHOD OF PURCHASE AND CARRYING ON OF THECOAL MINES.XXXV.It is suggested that the State should purchase all the col-lieries, including colliery buildings, plant, machinery, stores and other effects in and about the colliery at a fair value subject to the next paragraph.xxxvi;In addition, expenditure on development of the collieries (in-cluding&quot; the provision of houses) incurred after a date to be fixed and with the consent of the Controller of Coal Mines should be repaid with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum from the date of the expenditure provided that if such expenditure has become remunerative before the date of the purchase, ^he-amount of the sum payable by way of interest should be reduced by the amount of the profits earned thereon.XXXVII.In further addition the State should take power to purchase real and movable property directly associated with the working of the collieiy not comprised in paragraph XXXV., other than the assets at the colliery, at a fair value.XXXVIII.In the case of composite undertakings the owners should have a right to compel the State to purchase, and the State should have the right to compel the owner to sell the whole undertaking if, in the opinion of an arbitrator, the severance of the undertaking cannot be economically or commercially effected. By composite undertaking is meant an undertaking where a company or firm is carrying on a colliery in addition to and in conjunction with another works, e.g., a colliery and a steel works.XXXIX.Without prejudice to the powers recommended by the last paragraph, it is a matter for careful consideration whether the coke and by-product industry, which is at present only in its-infancy, should not be allowed to remain in private ownership.
14 XL.It is suggested that the hulk of the present officials engaged in the coal mining industry, including the managing directors of companies, should be offered an opportunity of remaining on at their present salaries on a 5 years&apos; agreement together with any increases awarded from time to time.XLI.The Civil Servant has not been trained to run an industry, but the war has demonstrated the potentiality of the existence of a new class of men (whether already in the service of the State or not) who are just as keen to serve the State as they are to serve a private employer and who have been shown to possess the qualities of courage in taking initiative necessary for the running of an industry.XLII.Hitherto, State management of industries has on balance failed to prove itself free from serious shortcomings, but these shortcomings are largely due to the neglect of the State to train those who are to be called on for knowledge and ability in management.XLIII.The experience&quot; of the last few years has, however, shown that it is not really difficult for the British nation to provide a class of administrative officers who combine the strongest sense of public duty with the greatest energy and capacity for initiative. Those who have this kind of training appear to be capable in a high degree of assuming responsibility and also of getting on with the men whom they have to direct.XLIV.Finally, under State ownership it is always possible to lease a mine to particular persons on terms agreeable to those who are engaged in the production of coal thereat, and this principle can bp applied not only to a mine or a group of mines contained in a particular district, but to a composite undertaking.N.B. If and when the coal mines are acquired by the State any just claims of pioneer boring companies should be recognised, and the State should take power to carry out exploratory borings.
6. THE SCHEME FOR LOCAL ADMINISTRATION.% N.B. The propositions put forward in this scheme must not be regarded as recommendations, nor does the scheme aim at being comprehensive. The time at my disposal only allows me to make suggestions which it is hoped will be useful to Parlia-ment.Index to Scheme.Paragraphs.(i) Local Mining Council...... xlv-mii.(ii) District Mining Council      ... liv-lxiv.(iii) National Mining Council      ... lxv-lxxii.(iv) Finance and Publicity ...     Lxxiil-Lxxvin.(v) Safety, Health and Research...       lxxix-lxxxv.(vi) Admiralty Coal ...... nxxxvi.(vii) Export Trade   .........   lxxxvii-lxxxix.(i) THE LOCAL MINING COUNCIL.N.B. The object of this part of the scheme is to take advantage of the knowledge of the workers by allowing them to sit on the Councils for the purpose of advising the manager and to give them an effective voice in all que*stions where their own safety and health are con-cerned.XLV.Every mine shall be under one duly certificated manager who shall be responsible for the control, management, direction and safety of the mine and the extent and method of working, provided always that such manager shall not be personally liable for conforming to any lawful order for safety made by the District Mining Council.XLVI.There shall be established at each mine a Local Mining Council who shall meet fortnightly, or oftener if need be, to advise the manager on all questions concerning the direction and safety of the mine.XLVII.The Council shall consist of 10 members of whom the manager, under-manager and the commercial manager shall be ex ofjicio. Four members shall be elected by ballot by the workers in or
about the mine and the remaining 3 members shall he appointed by the District Mining Council.   The members shall hold office,&quot; for 2 years. ^XL VIII.It shall be the duty of the Council to report fortnightly to the Minister of Mines and to the District Mining Council any fall in output and the cause thereof.XLIX.If the manager refuses to take the advice of the Local Mining Council on any question concerning the safety and health of the mine such question shall be referred to the District Mining-Council.L.The contracts of employment of workmen shall embody an undertaking to be framed by the District Mining Council to the effect that no workman will, in consequence of any dispute, join in giving any notice to determine his contract, nor will he combine to cease work, unless and until the question in dispute has been before the Local Mining Council and the District Mining Council and those Councils have failed to settle the dispute.LI.There shall be a commercial manager of the mine or group of mines (which office, if the District Mining Council think fit, shall be vested in the mine manager) whose duty it shall be, subject to the control of the manager, to arrange for the pur-chase and supply of stores in the mines and to take steps subject to the control of the district commercial manager for the disposal of its output.X.B. It is thought that some of the present managing directors of companies might be appointed the commercial managers.LIT.Each mine shall send in a costing account in the approved form to the District Mining Council.LIII.The workers at each mine shall he entitled to an output allow-ance to be ascertained in an approved manner and divided among them half-yearly.
,   -   485(ii.) THE DISTRICT MINING COUNCIL.N.B. The object of this part of the scheme is to pre-ventthe bureaucratic running&quot; of the industry by causing-it to be controlled locally by a Council of fourteen, upon which there is equal representation for the miners, for the consumers, and for the persons acquainted with the commercial and technical side of the industry.LIV.There shall be established in each mining district a District Mining Council upon whom &quot; shall rest the main executive responsibility of taking measures to secure the health and safety of the workmen and the production of coal in the district.N.B. It is suggested that the mining districts be:   1. Scotland, East. 2. Scotland, West. 3. Northumberland. 4. Durham. 5. Cumberland. 6. Yorkshire.7. Lancashire and Cheshire. 8. North Wales.9. Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire. 10. Staffordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. 11. Warwickshire.12. South AVales and Monmouthshire. 13. Gloucestershire, Somersetshire. 14. Kent.LY.The District Mining Council shall conform to any order for safety made by the Chief Inspector of Mines, or by a Divisional Mines Inspector, and shall not make an order in respect of safety which is contrary to any Act of Parliament or regula-tions thereunder.LYI.Subject to the direction of the Minister of Mines the District Mining Council shall manage in its district the entire coal extraction, the regulation of output, the discontinuance of or the opening out of mines, trial sinkings, the control of prices and the basis of wage assessment, and the distribution of coal.
In fixing the pit-head price under State ownership the follovy-ing items shall be provided for:  (a) a fair and just wage for all workers in the industry. (6) the cost of materials, &amp;c.(c) upkeep and management, and development work.(d) interest on. the Bonds to be issued as the purchase priceof the coal royalties and coal mines.(e) the contribution towards a sinking fund to redeem theBonds.(/) a profit for national purposes.LVIII.The District Mining Council shall be entitled to make arrange-ments with local authorities or with private persons (including in such term co-operative societies, companies, firms and individuals) and in country districts, if permissible, with the local railway station-master, for the sale and distribution of inland coal, and with private persons, firms and companies for the sale and distribution of export coal, and shall have power to fix from time to time the price above which coal may not be sold for household and industrial purposes.LIX.The District Mining Council shall consist of a Chairman and Vice-Chairman, appointed by the Minister of Mines, and twelve other members. Four members shall be elected by ballot by the workers, and the remaining eight members shall be appointed by the National Mining Council as follows :  Four to represent consumers (of whom in iron and steel districts two at least shall represent the iron and steel trades, and in shipping- districts two at least shall represent &apos;   recognised coal exporters).Two to represent the technical side of the industry, e.g., mining engineering, andTwo to represent the commercial side of the industry  purchase of material and sale of output.LX.All members shall hold office for three years, and shall be paid a salary.
t^-    48619 LXI.The District Mining Council shall meet at least monthly, and oftener if need be.LXII.The District Mining Council shall appoint all mine managers and all commercial mine managers within its own district.LXIII.The District Mining Council shall appoint a commercial com-niittee, and a commercial manager whose duly shall be, subject to the control of the commercial committee, to arrange for the purchase and supply of stores for any mine and to take steps for the disposal of the output of coal from his district.LXIV.The contracts of employment of workmen shall embody an undertaking to be framed by the District Mining Council to the effect that no workman will, in consequence of any dispute affecting a district, join in giving any notice to determine his contract, nor will be combine to cease work, unless and until the question in dispute has been before the District Mining Council and the National Mining Council and those Councils have failed to settle the dispute.(iii) THE NATIONAL MINING COUNCIL.N.B.-The object of this part of the scheme is to get a body composed of members of the District Mining-Councils who shall meet at stated intervals to discuss and advise the Minister of Mines on all questions con-nected with the Industry. The Minister of Mines will be assisted by a Standing Committee of 18 members elected from and by the National Mining Council, who will meet regularly for the purpose of superintending the operations of District Mining Councils. The Minister of Mines will sit in and be responsible to Parliament.
There shall be established a National Mining Council, which-shall meet from time to time to discuss with and advise the Minister of Mines upon all questions connected with the opera-tion and management of the industry.LXVI.The Minister of Mines shall be appointed by the Government, and shall sit in and be responsible to Parliament. Such Minister shall superintend the operation of the District Mining Councils and shall preside over the National Mining Council.LXYII.The National Mining Council shall be formed as follows:   Eact District Mining Council shall elect one member for every 5,000,000 tons of output, provided that every district shall elect at least one member.LXVIII.The members shall be elected for three years and shall meet once a year in London, once a year in Edinburgh, and once a year in Cardiff and at such other times as summoned by the Minister of Mines. Members shall be entitled to their travelling-expenses.LXIX.There shall be elected from and by the members of the National Mining Council a Standing Committee of 18, six of whom shall retire each year and shall not be eligible for re-election for the next year. Six shall represent the workers, six shall represent consumers, and six the technical and commercial side of the industry.LXX.The Minister of Mines shall be entitled, after consulting the Standing Committee, to veto any resolution come to either by a Local Mining Council or a District Mining Council, and in the event of his so doing he shall state publicly his grounds for so acting.
i No national alteration of wages shall be made without the consent both of the Minister of Mines and the Standing Committee.lxxh.The contracts of employment of workmen shall embody an undertaking to be framed by the District Mining Council to the effect that no , workman will, in consequence of any national dispute, join in giving any notice to determine his contract, nor will he combine to cease work, unless and until the question in dispute has been before the National Mining Council and&quot; that Council has failed to settle the dispute; provided that on the written request of 15 members of the National Mining Council the Minister of Mines shall convene a meeting of the Council within one month.(iv) FINANCE   AND   PUBLICITY. LXXIII.The finances of each district shall be kept entirely separate, and a return in the approved form shall be sent to the Minister of Mines once a quarter.LXXIV.An approved system of auditing shall be established for all accounts.LXXV.The Treasury shall not be entitled to interfere with or to have any control over the appropriation of moneys derived from the industry. The said moneys shall be kept entirely separate and apart from other national moneys, until the profit accruing from the industry is periodically ascertained and paid into the Exchecpier.&apos;LXXVI.It being of vital importance that the Mines Department should be managed with the freedom of a private business, the present Civil Service system of selection and promotion by length i f service, of grades of servants, of minuting opinions and reports from one servant to another, and of salaries and pensions, shall not apply to the servants attached to the Mines Department.
The Minister of Mines shall cause the following statistics to be made public:  (a) the quarterly financial return from each district; (6) the output from each district;(c) the number of persons employed above and below ground;(d) the cost per ton of getting and distributing coal, show-ing proportion due to wages, material, management, interest, and profit;(e) the amount of coal produced per man per shift; (/) the amount of absenteeism.LXXVIII.Pending the acquisition of the coal mines by the State, the colliery owners shall continue to have and be subject to the rights and liabilities conferred and imposed upon them by the Coal Mines Control Agreement (Confirmation) Act, 1918, or any statutory provision that may be substituted therefor as suggested in the Interim Report of the 20tli March presented by me and my three colleagues, or otherwise.(v) SAFETY, HEALTH AND  RESEARCH. LXXIX.For providing for safety, health and research there shall be a corps of officers, as set out in the following paragraphs.LXXX.For safety, the present system of Chief Inspector and Divi-sionol Inspectors shall be continued, and such inspectors shall continue to perform the same duties as their predecessors, but the number of inspectors shall be increased and shall be in pro-portion either (i) to the area, or(ii) to the number of men employed, as for example, one inspector to, say, 5,000 men.LXXXI.The appointment of such safety inspectors shall be made by the Minister of Mines, to whom the inspectors shall report and be responsible.   -
LXXXII.For health, there shall be appointed central and local inspec-tors of health as distinguished from safety, who shall be charged with the superintendence of the health and convalescence of col-liery workers.LXXXIII.The appointment of such health inspectors shall be made by the Minister of Mines, to whom the inspectors shall report and be responsible.LXXXIV.For research, there shall be attached to the Ministry of Mines a Research Section for the purpose of carrying out departmental research work in safety, health and economies in mining.LXXXV.The appointment of such research staff shall be by the Minister of Mines.(vi) ADMIRALTY COAL. LXXXVI.The Admiralty and the War Office shall be entitled to requisition coal at any mine at a pit-head price equal to the lowest price charged to any consumer.(vii) THE EXPORT TRADE. LXXXYII.Any person shall be entitled to purchase coal for export from any mine in the same way as he would have been entitled had such mine remained in private ownership.LXXXYIII.The State shall not make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to, or in favour of, any particular persons desirous of purchasing coal for export, nor shall the State
subject any particular person desirous of purchasing coal for export to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage whatsoever.LXXXIX.Any exporter to whom coal is sold for export shall divide all profits over Is. per ton equally with the District Mining Council.
25489MISCELLANEOUS.The Interim Report of the 20th March last presented by me and my three colleagues (paragraph 15) outlined certain units of economy and of improvement which it was suggested should receive the attention of the Commission in the near future. Having regard to the magnitude and complexity of the question of nationalisation, it has been barely possibly to touch upon these other matters, but I desire very briefly to report upon them as follows:  (1) Housing. This matter is in the hands of the Local Government Board and (for Scotland) the Scottish Office, with whom we have conferred and who are fully alive to the peculiar urgency of the problem in certain miningdistricts. I associate myself with the remarks of my friend Sir Arthur Duckham in paragraphs xi and xii of his Report.(2) Baths and Drying of Clothes. I recommend that the Home Secretary should promote the necessarj^ amend-ment in Section 77 of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, to make these facilities universal at collieries, and I have reason to believe that the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain would exert very strong pressure to make their use almost as universal.(3) Continuity of Transport from the Colliery, and Pooling of Wagons. I recommend that these matters should receive the earliest possible attention from the Minister-Designate of Ways and Communications (Sir Eric Geddes) as soon as his Department is fully constituted.&apos; (4) Clearance.(5) Reduction of Voluntary Absenteeism. (6) Use of Machinery in Mines.Coal-cutting.Coal-conveying.Underground transit.^ (7) Elimination of unnecessary Distribution Costs. I recommend that these matters should receive the early attention of an authority having the necessary
technical and commercial qualifications such as the Advisory Board of the Controller of Coal Mines and; his Department.This Report does not apply to Ireland.The evidence will be published separately.The learned counsel who watched the proceedings on behalf of the Royalty Owners and of the Mining Association of Great Britain on page 6 of his printed speech formulated the question awaiting our decision as follows:  &quot; What changes should in the national interest be made, and when, by legislation or otherwise, in the organisation of the coal-mining industry &quot; ?I agree that the question is a proper one and have endeavoured to answer it.I desire to express my personal thanks, and the obligation I am under, to Sir Richard Redmayne and Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson, two of our Assessors, and to Mr. Arnold McNair, our Secretary, and Mr. Gilbert Stone, our Assistant Secretary, for the great help I have received from them in the preparation of this Report and throughout the enquiry.

-    490TO THE KING&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. May it please Your Majesty,We have the honour to present a further Report in pursu-ance of the Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919.As we are in substantial agreement with the Cbairman&apos;s Report, we think it unnecessary to set forth any separate state-ment of our views. But in assenting to that Report we wish to emphasise the following points, namely:  (1) We suggest that, with a view to securing the cordial co-operation of the workers in the success of the industry, it is. necessary to provide for a fuller representation of the workers on the District and National Councils, on the lines indicated in the scheme submitted by Mr. W. Straker.(2) Whilst fully recognising the necessity of working rules, and the importance of preventing unnecessary stoppages, we feel that the provisions of Paragraphs L., LXIY., and LXXII. may be used to impose upon the workers by law a particular form of contract, with-out their consent an innovation to which we think it will be difficult to gain agreement, and which we believe to be not the best calculated to attain the object.(3) We are of opinion that all coke and by-product plant attached to collieries should be treated as part of the coal mines and should be acquired by the State with the coal mines.REPORTBYMr. FRANK HODGES, Sir LEO CHIOZZA MONEY, Mr. ROBERT SMILLIE, Mr. HERBERT SMITH, Mr. R. H. TAWNEY, and Mr. SIDNEY WEBB.
(4) AVe think it important that whatever payment is made to the owners pending the general acquisition oi^ the mines should not be computed upon the tonnage gotten.(5) Whilst recognising, with regret, that the output from the mines has not yet satisfactorily recovered from the adverse circumstances which have depressed it, during the war, we wish to emphasise the fact that no evidence has been produced to show that the men are refraining from doing their best. AVe believe that this is not the case, and that other causes are at work. The miners demand an immediate inquiry, and we support this demand. During the period that must necessarily elapse before the institution of the machinery for the administration of the mines proposed by the Chairman, we think that it is of the utmost public importance that there should be no deficiency of tubs, no lack of wagons, no shortage of materials and no obstacle to prompt clearance from pithead, all of which are reported now to exist.(6) Three among us (F. Hodges, R. Smillie, and Herbert Smith) do not agree that any compensation whatever should be paid to the present mineral owners for the mineral rights to be acquired by the State. But this must not be taken to imply that there would be objec-tion to the grant of compassionate allowances in cases iu which small royalty owners are expropriated in such a way as to deprive them of their means of livelihood.AVe cordially associate ourselves with the Chairman in his tribute of thanks to the Assessors and Secretaries for the invaluable help they have given the Commission in conducting the enquiry.All of which we humbly report for Your Majesty&apos;s gracious consideration.ROBT.

REPORTBTMesses. ARTHUR BALFOUR, R. W. COOPER, Sir ADAM NIMMO, K.B.E., Sir ALLAN M. SMITH, K.B.E., and Mr. EVAN WILLIAMS.TO THE XI1STG&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. May it please Your Majesty.We have the honour to present our Report in pursuance of the Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919.The second stage of the inquiry which began on the 23rd April last involved the examination of 116 witnesses.2. The main questions with which we have to deal are those set forth in paragraphs (/), (g) and (h) of Section 1 of the Act by which we are required to enquire into :  (1) Any scheme that may be submitted to or formulated by the Commissioners for the future organisation of the coal industry, whether on the present basis, or on the basis of joint control, nationalisation or any other basis;(2) The effect of the present incidence of and practice    i: regard to mining royalties and wayleaves upon the coal industry and the cost of coal and whether any and what changes in these respects are desirable;(3) The effect of proposals under the above heads upon the development of the coal indtistry and the economic life of the country.The Future Organisation of the Coal Industry. 3. The  schemes   which  have  been  submitted   involve   the fundamental  question of  whether the coal  industry is to be organised on the basis of private ownership or on the basis of nationalisation.
Three definite schemes have been submitted in evidence. The first scheme is in substance the same as that contained lm a pamphlet put in evidence before us entitled &quot; The Nationalisa-tion of the Coal Supply,&quot; which originally constituted a chapter of a book called &quot; How to pay for the war,&quot; published in July, 1916. One of the authors of this book is Mr. Sidney Webb, one of the Commissioners, who gave evidence before us, repeating in substance the proposals contained in the pamphlet.4. The second scheme is contained in a draft of a proposed parliamentary Bill prepared on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.5. The third scheme was submitted by. Lord Gainford in his evidence on behalf of the Mining Association of Great Britain.The Scheme of Mr. Sidney Webb.6. By this scheme it is proposed to put an end to the private ownership and working of coal by vesting the coal and the collieries in the State and paying compensation to the owners by means of an issue of Government Stock.7. The scheme proposes that the State should buy out all persons interested, whether as lessees or workers of coal or as lessors or royalty owners, and this was practically repeated in the evidence given by Mr. Sidney Webb, who treats the fair selling value based on pre-war income of the properties as the price to be paid by the State to the expropriated owners.The Bill of the Miners&apos; Federation.8. This Bill, like the scheme of Mr. Sidney Webb, proposes to put an end to the private ownership and working of coal, hut there are essential differences between the two schemes, which may shortly be described as follows:  The Bill proposes :  (a) To expropriate the owner not only of the coal mines but also of other mines.(6) To confiscate without compensation all mining royalties and wayleaves and only to pay to lessees or owners of collieries a limited amount of compensation.(c) Instead of vesting the mines in the State, to vest them in a special body to be created and to be called the Mining Council, consisting of a President appointed by Tour Majesty and 20 members, of whom
one half are to be appointed by Tour Majesty and the other half by the Miners&apos; Federation.(d) To transfer to the Mining Council all powers of theSecretary of State under the Acts for the regulation of Coal Mines.(e) To give the Mining Council at its option power to takeover and carry on iron, steel and other works carried on in connection with coal mining.(/) To postpone indefinitely the exercise of this last men-tioned option, and, meanwhile, either to prevent the carrying on of these works absolutely or to permit them to be carried on upon such terms as may be prescribed by the Council, and ultimately, at the discretion of the Council, to take over the works at their then value.(^r) To authorise the Mining Council to carry on the business of shipowners and to prevent any increase in the rates now charged for the conveyance of coal by railway.The Mining Association Scheme.9. This scheme is based upon the principle that private enter-prise must be maintained and that nationalisation of the coal industry would be prejudicial to the economic welfare of the country.10. The authors contend that want of knowledge with respect to prices, costs and profits, and the absence of machinery con-ferring upon the workers opportunities for obtaining information and influencing the conditions under wbicb they work bave been to a great extent the cause of the existing discontent.11. The authors propose that, in future, fluctuations of the wages of the workers in each mining district, over and above the minimum rates, should, instead of being regulated solely as in the past by selling prices, be regulated by reference also to costs and profits in that district.For this purpose, average prices, costs and profits in each dis-trict are to be jointly ascertained, so that the workers may be able in future to discuss questions of wages with a complete know-ledge of the results of the industry in that district.12. The authors propose that by means of joint committees of employers and workers full opportunity should he given to
the workers in each district and at each colliery to make sugges-tions with respect to the methods and conditions of their work I without impairing the authority of the owner, agent or manager of the mine, upon whom the law imposes responsibility for the control, management and direction of the mine.The Coal Industry.&apos; 13. Neither past experience of State enterprise nor any evi-dence submitted to the Commission gives any reasonable ground for belief that the coal industry could or would be as efficiently conducted by the State in the future as by private enterprise in the past.14. It is of the essence of success in industry that those who conduct it should not hesitate to take responsibility and incur commercial risks. When this is done in the coal industry, what is placed at risk is the capital or profits of capital made avail-able for the very purpose of being used in a risky undertaking. On the other hand, the only justification for a Government official taking risks is grave national emergency.15. It is an inseparable feature of departmental Government that each man instead of taking responsibility for any proposed action should pass it on to his superior; and the final responsibility of the Department.must always be to Parliament. Its actions are thus inevitably governed by political considerations and the interests of political parties. We have the greatest admiration for the work which individual outsiders who joined the Govern-ment Departments during the war have performed for the country, but the system in a Government Department has the effect ol&apos; depressing rather than exciting imagination, initiative and activity. Should the State engage in industry, particularly in the mining industry, which is so vitally connected with the destiny of the nation, the result would be nothing short of disaster.16. No evidence which has been submitted to the Commission would justify us in coming to the conclusion that the benefits claimed by those who advocate nationalisation would result from any form of State ownership of the mines.IT. The danger due to political influence has been frankly admitted, but it is claimed that adequate safeguards can be provided against political interference in industry or commerce. However feasible this may appear in theory the democratic
system of Government makes safeguards impossible when the exigencies of a political situation dominate a question. &quot; We have therefore come to the conclusion that the provision of safeguards against political interference is not within the region of practical politics.18. Tlie evidence submitted to the Commission affords no ground for belief that nationalisation would have the effect of reducing the price of coal.19. With regard to the question of increased output and the question of avoidance of strikes, it appears to us that the attitude freely expressed on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation against co-operation with the other Trade Unions, with the employers and with the State with respect to the proposals made by the recent National Industrial Conference creates a regrettable impression.Without co-operation, nationalisation, even if other-wise advisable, would in no way secure increase of out-put .or continuity of production. The evidence has clearly shown that strikes are not prevented by State ownership and management.20. It is regrettable that during the whole of the proceedings emphasis has been laid on a state of antagonism which is alleged to exist between the employers and the workpeople in the coal industry. To such an extent is this feeling alleged to exist that it is stated that the only means of overcoming it is to nationalise the industry and to substitute the State for private enterprise.From the evidence submitted, which is confirmed by our own knowledge, no foundation exists for such an assertion. In certain cases owing to the action of individuals, few in number but active in agitation, local unrest has been created, but we are convinced that the relations between the employers and the vast majority of the workpeople in the coal mining industry do not call for the drastic proposals that have been advanced.21. The personal and human element which exists under present conditions would be almost entirely eliminated should the State take over the industry.22. From the evidence submitted it is clear that the mine owners are prepared to increase the facilities for enabling the 23797-39 B
workpeople to acquire a greater knowledge of and interest the industry.23. We- think it is only right that the community shoult realise the extent to which success has attended the efforts private enterprise in the coal industry, and we would speciall; refer to the following extract from Lord Gainford&apos;s evident-before the Commission :  &quot; Coal owners have not been slow to risk their capital ii the development of coal, and have taken risks which ill State never could have undertaken, wherever there appears to be any possible expectation of success. The developnicn in output during the past 30 years prior to the war, froi . 128,000,000 tons to 288,000,000, and an increase in the \w employed from 492,422 to 1,118,452, is eloquent testimou to the enterprise, initiative and skill which coal owners an their managers have brought to bear upon the industn So far from necessary development having been retarde in the hands of the present owners, all available evident shows that the full quantity of coal required from time i time bv the nation has always been forthcoming, and a export trade has been steadily built up. (N.B. 16 millioi tons in 18T3 to 82 million tons in 1913.) &quot;24. The advantages and disadvantages of nationalisation hat been discussed at great length in the course of the evidenc Widely different and often wholly unconnected reasons ha* been put forward. Some of the more advanced socialists obje to industry being conducted for private profit and favour tl nationalisation of all industry. Nationalisation of the co mines is openly advocated as a step towards nationalisation &apos; all industry.25. The support given in the evidence to the claim for nationalisation comes mainly from socialists and theorists who seem profoundly convinced that it is their prerogative to lead the nation in the direction of thought considered by them to lie good for the nation.It is noteworthy, however, that not all the theorists are of one mind on this subject.26. The better housing of tbe miners, the increase of provisions for safety, and the lowering of the present high rate of infantile mortality are matters which everyone will agree should receive
immediate attention: but eacb and all of these matters can be dealt with without resort to nationalisation of the mines, and call for careful and organised investigation and scientific&apos; and practical consideration-.27. The continued efforts to obscure the real issues involved in nationalisation by a special reference to these matters, which, while most important in themselves, are not necessarily bound up with nationalisation, coupled with the fact that nationalisa-tion is not so much a request in the interest of the nation, as a demand under threat of a strike, by a relatively small section of the community, give the impression that nationalisation of the mines is more of the nature of a political move and not a policy based on altruistic motives on the part of those who direct the policy of the Miners&apos; Federation.28. Nationalisation in terms of the proposals of the Miners&apos; Federation would amount, on State purchase, to such an amount of control by the Miners&apos; Federation as would remove the in-dustry from the control of the community on whose behalf presumably nationalisation is claimed.29. The credit of the nation from an international point of view has rested to a great extent on the nation&apos;s sound and con-sistent policy in maintaining the stability and security of private rights. If these private rights are assailed and subverted in accordance with certain of the extreme views expressed during the proceedings of the Commission, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the national credit will be seriously affected and that this will be reflected in the industries of the country by very serious consequences.30. We have carefully weighed the whole of the evidence and have come to the conclusion that the nationalisation of the coal industry in any form would be detrimental to the development of the industry and to the economic life of the country.31. It is clear that the present economic position of the coal industry cannot continue.Wages in any industry can only continue to be paid to the extent that the industry can bear.23797-39 B 2
It is economically unsound to pay wages either: (a) By repayment, in the form of a wage subsidy,of taxes previously collected from an industry, or(b) By subsidies from monies collected from the taxpayer.If the coal industry is to be resumed on an economic basis it is inevitable that one of two things must happen:-(a) There must be a large increase in the output otcoal and a decrease in the cost of production, or(b) The price of coal to the consumer must be in-creased and the consequences of this increase upon other industries and on the community generally must be faced.Without expressing any opinion on the subject, we feel very strongly that in view of the statements made before the Commission the causes which have contri-buted to the fall in output should be the subject of immediate and complete investigation.32. We also feel strongly that no action which will vitally affect the Nation as a whole or will result in granting- preferential treatment to any section of the community should be taken without first referring the question to the community.33. Having expressed our judgment upon the issue between nationalisation and private ownership, we now beg to offer the following suggestions with respect to matters affecting the coal industry under private ownership, including the safety and well-being of the miners.Safety.34. There is no justification whatever for any suggestion that the mineowners have been slow to take precautions for the safety of the workers, or that considerations of profit have restricted the adoption of measures to ensure the safety of those working in the mines. Statistics furnished by the Home Office prove that the rate of accident in the coal mines in this country is lower than the rate in the coal mines of any of the other principal coal producing countries.
I 35. The State has prescribed the duties of the owners in these respects, and the owners have conformed to the State&apos;s require-ments.36. The initiative in invention and adoption of safety pre-rautions has come in the past from individual collieries. The State has followed the practice of the most progressive collieries and has adopted their standard of safety and their improvements and prescribed them for the remainder of the collieries.37. We suggest that Mines Inspection should be strengthened by an increase in the number of inspectors and that greater attention than has hitherto been given should be paid by the Government to research, investigation and provision of safety appliances.38. We are strongly of opinion that the existing system of reporting and tabulating information as to injuries in the mines is not sufficient. Complete statistics should be procured by the Government showing the numbers and causes of accidents and the nature and extent of injuries. These statistics should be regularly and frequently published.Housing.39. The general question of the housing of the working classes has been for some years past engaging the serious attention of the community as a whole. This has now materialised on a national basis in the Housing and Town Planning Bill presented by the Government. It is urgently necessary that the housing of the working classes should be brought into accordance with modern ideas. The older classes of houses should be improved; new houses should be built and a greater number of houses should be provided. Particular attention should be paid to sanitary conditions and considerations affecting the amenities of life. This, however, is a national question and includes all working-class houses, w7hether in&apos; colliery villages or nof\ We think it is regrettable that the coal trade should, in a matter of a national character and demanding national attention, have been singled out for particular reproach. We are satisfied that as a special industry the colliery proprietors have done much and would, but for the war and the consequent difficulties, have done more with -regard to the housing of the workpeople employed.23797-39-3 B 3
Baths at Pithead and Accommodation for Clothes Drying,    i\ J40. We are of opinion that baths and accommodation for drying clothes should be provided and maintained at or near the pithead, so far as this may be possible, having regard to the practicability of obtaining a suitable supply of water.41. We recommend the repeal of the proviso to Section 77 (1) of the Coal Mines Act, 1911, which has the effect of relieving the mine owner from the obligation to provide this accommod;i-tion if the estimated total cost of maintenance exceeds od. per week, per person employed.Research and Investigation.42. In view of the setting up by the Government of a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the possibility that the activities of this Council may justify the setting up of a Depart-ment of State to deal with this matter, a branch of such Depari-nient should be set up for the purpose of arranging for am! co-ordinating the research and investigation so far as affecting the working and use of coal.It is essential that there should be the closest co-operation between the mining authority as such and the research authority as such.It should be&apos;borne in mind that there exist at the moment many institutions and organisations set up by private enterprise which have done exceedingly useful work. It is essential that the Mining Department and the Research Department should utilise and co-ordinate the facilities afforded by these institutions and organisations. *Mines Departmenl.43. We recommend that a Mines Department should be set up having at its head a responsible official thoroughly acquainted with the mining- industry.44. This Department should exercise the functions of State so far as regards the ownership of coal, with which subject we deal hereinafter.It should also have administrative functions including the functions which are at present exercised by the Mines Depart-ment at the Home Office, and it should have jurisdiction over all questions relating to the coal mines except the adjustment oi
49611100111&apos; uispuies and wages, which are appropriate subjects for the jurisdiction of the Minister of Labour. For example, ii should deal with questions of safety and technique; should collect and publish statistics relative to accidents, output, export and con-sumptiou; it should be a record office for data relating&apos; to the coal industry and should deal with questions affecting new coal fields and the development of existing ones.45. In the exercise of its duty the Mines Department should be assisted by a National Advisory Council consisting of represenia-tives of (a) the Department, (b) the colliery owners, (c) the mine workers, (d) mining engineers, and (e) other scientific experts.Co-operation in the Coal Industry. 46. While it is essential, even in the interests of the mine workers themselves, that the Executive Authority of the Manage-ment should not be impaired, we recommend that full and regular opportunity should be given to each party to bring forward for discussion any question of mutual interest.47. &quot;We, therefore, recommend that the following-procedure should be established :-(1) Pit Committees.There should be established at each colliery a Pit Com-mittee, consisting of equal numbers of representatives of the management and of the mine workers. The numbers will probably vary in the different mines, but in no case should they exceed seven on each side. Each side should have its own Chairman. The representatives of the mine workers should be appointed, by and from all the workers employed at the colliery.The Committee should meet as occasion demands, but not less frequently than once a month, for the consideration of questions of which previous notice has, if possible, been given.The purpose of the Pit Committee is to afford an oppor-tunity of discussion of any question relating to the working of the mine, or the conditions under which the miners work, and any other questions in the settlement of which both parties are directly concerned.It is hoped that through personal touch at the mine and free and friendly interchange of views, harmonious relations will be promoted and maintained.-23797-30 b i
(2) District Councils.District Councils, consisting of representatives of the coa. ) owners and representatives of the Trade Unions in the dis-trict, should be established for the purpose of dealing with any questions of a district character which, in the opinion of the Council, it is in the mutual interest of the parties to discuss. The District Council should also deal with ques-tions of which a settlement has not been arrived at by the Pit Committee.Where Conciliation Boards exist for the purpose of dealiug with questions on a district basis, the procedure of the Con-ciliation Board and the District Council might with advantage be co-ordinated or the Conciliation Board mighi act as the District Council for the district.(3) National Council.A National Council should be established consisting of tin-representatives of mine owners and mine workers appointed by the districts, for the purpose of dealing with any question of national interest which maj- be referred to it.48. We have confined ourselves to indicating in general terms the lines upon which the Pit Committees, District Councils and National Council should be instituted. We recognise that the varying circumstances of the different districts and different collieries may involve variations in the constitution and pro-cedure, but we recommend that the parties should immediately proceed to discuss a scheme of this description on the basis of the terms of the Interim Report on Joint Standing Industrial Councils by the Reconstruction Sub-Committee on Relations between Employers and Employed to which two members of this Commission are signatories.Distribution.49. The evidence shows that considerable saving is possible in the distribution of household coal.An extension of dealing in household coal by co-operative effort will no doubt take place automatically.50. We recommend, that local authorities should he given statutory powers to deal in household coal, not as a monopoly, hut in competition with private dealers
497or co-operative effort, subject to the provision that any [losses sustained in such dealing- shall not be chargeable to the rates.51. Wherever consolidation of the present distribu-ting agencies is possible it should be effected but not so as to result in combinations or trusts to the detriment of the consumer.52. We recommend that in order that all parties interested should be afforded the opportunity of under-standing- and appreciating- the cost and difficulties of the distribution of coal, a Consultative Committee should be set up by the Mines Department consisting of repre-sentatives of colliery owners, mineworkers, consumers and distributors. This Committee should meet regularly and discuss any points of common interest which may be brought forward by persons concerned. It may also be desirable that similar Committees similarly consti-tuted and with similar functions should be set up in the principal mining districts.Export Trade.53. Many witnesses have referred to the urgent necessity of the maintenance and extension of the coal export trade, as having a most important bearing upon the international money exchange and upon the food supply of the country.54. Even if the State did not itself engage in the export trade, a State monopoly in the production of coal would not permit that freedom of action and flexibility of decision on the part of the private coal exporter wThich is essential to the conduct of the trade.55. We are satisfied that it is impracticable for the State to carry on an export trade in coal.Mining Royalties.The Effect of the Incidence of, and Practice in regard to Mining Royalties upon the Coal Industry and the Cost of Coal.56. There is in our judgment a radical difference between the mere ownership by the State of a national asset like coal and
the conduct by the State of an industry like the coal industry whether with or without its export trade.57. Coal is our principal national asset, and as it is a wasting asset it is in the interests of the State that it should be worked tc the best advantage.58. The ownership of the seams of coal is now in the hands of several thousand persons, most of whom have exercised their rights in a reasonable manner, but some of whom have uot assisted in the development of the national asset.59. The effect of mining royalties (including wayleaves) on the cost of coal has been, in our judgment, slight, in 1913 they amounted to 5 per cent, of the selling value at the pit-head and in 1918,to about 21 per cent, of that value.GO. The third report of the Acquisition and Valuation oi Land Committee appointed by Your Majesty&apos;s Minister of lie-construction has pointed out a number of defects arising from the present system of ownership and proposes to create a new Sanctioning Authority invested with power to issue compulsory orders from time to time to remedy those defects as and when they are found to exist. *01. The defects as set forth by that Committee may be briefly summarised as follows:  (1) Owners unwilling to sell or lease.(2) Owners demanding exorbitant terms.(3) Minerals under cop\-hold or enfranchised land.(4) Minerals in small separate ownerships.(5) Legal disability of owners.(6) Cases of unknown owners.(7) Difficulties in working arising from surface support.(8) Coal unnecessarily left unworked as barriers.(9) Refusal of owners to grant wayleaves on reasonable terms.(10) Difficulty in obtaining surface powers for working or carrying minerals.(11) Restrictive   conditions   impeding   development   of minerals.(12) Onerous conditions of leases.
498(13) Absence of&apos; power to regulate tbe lay-out of a mineral field.(14) Loss of minerals in working.62. In certain cases boundaries are arbitrary and irregular and make some coal difficult to work or not worth working.63. We have carefully considered the evidence sub-mitted to us and have come to the conclusion that the most effective method of dealing1 with the problem in the national interest would be for the State to acquire the ownership of the coal.64. Under State ownership there would be one owner instead of several thousand owners, and the difficulties caused under the present system will be effectively dealt with.65. For this purpose it will be desirable to set up a controlling authority to deal with such of these difficulties as the mere change of ownership will not affect.For example :  (a) coal held by one lessee could not be worked by anadjoining lessee without the consent of the first lessee;(b) if a barrier is comprised in a lease it cannot be worked ;(c) a change of ownership cannot place the State in anybetter position with respect to support for the surface than that of a private owner;(d) some authority must settle the question of any futurepits, railways, or other surface works and surface way-leaves in the fixing of which the owner of the surface ought to have a voice.66. It must be a condition of any vesting- of coal in the State that the existing owners of royalties shall receive fair and just compensation and that the owners and occupiers of the surface shall be protected by suit-able conditions and restrictions imposed upon the State.67. The coal should only vest in the State subject to the existing leases or tenancies and in any case where an existing lease or tenancjr is held for a term of years of which less than sixty are unexpired, the lessees or
tenants must have the option of requiring- the term to he extended upon reasonable conditions as to rent and otherwise up to the full term of sixty years.68. As regards those cases where the coal is being worked by the owner as colliery owner it should only vest in the State subject to the granting to him of a lease for such a number of years not exceeding sixty years, as he may require upon such conditions as to rent or otherwise as may be customary in the district, fair and just compensation being paid to him.69. There must be conferred on the State all usual or necessary mining easements over the surface, together with power to procure all such easements in the; future, subject to proper provision for payment of compensation for land occupied and generally for all damage caused to the owner or occupier of the surface.TO. The powers and provisions herein referred to would require to be carefully defined, and it is only necessary in this Report to indicate generally their character.71. Provision will require to be made for dealing in the absence of agreement with questions arising between the State and the colliery proprietors as to the terms of either existing or future leases and to avoid preferential treatment.Underground Waylea ves.72. We have given some consideration to this subject and have met with much difficulty. The time at our disposal has been too short to enable us to investigate and come to a detailed con-clusion on what we recognise is a complex problem.73. Underground wayleaves may be divided broadly into two categories: (1) wayleaves through an area Avhich is not at the time being worked, and (2) wayleaves through an area which is at the time being worked.74. It has to be kept in view that according to our reebm-mendations the State is to purchase only the seams of coal.
49975. An area which is not at the time being worked may have been exhausted so far as the known searns of coal are concerned. On the other hand, in the area, certain seams only may have been exhausted. In either of these cases the wayleave might be through an exhausted seam. In the case of an area which is being worked, the wayleave may be in respect of conveyance of coal through a seam, a portion of which is at the time being worked, or it may be in respect of conveyance through a seam which has been completely exhausted.76. As already explained, the State will acquire the seams of coal. There is no coal for the State to acquire in an exhausted seam.77. The State as owner of the workable coal must have the right of access to the coal and the right of bringing the coal to the surface through any area.78. On principle we consider that private rights, of whatever description, if acquired by the State, should be the subject of compensation to the owner of these rights, and we recommend that the question of underground wayleaves should be the subject of careful investigation.Other Minerals.79. This Report refers merely to the acquisition of the coal. We are, however, not ignoring the question of other minerals got by underground mining, whether worked in conjunction with coal or not.The extension of the principle of acquisition in such cases may require consideration.Purchase of Coal. 80. The State should pay fair and i&apos;ust compensation.81. In this respect there is, in our judgment, no ground for regarding the owners of mining royalties differently from the owners of any other form of property recognised by the State.82. We are of opinion that the general basis of such com-pensation should be 15 years&apos; purchase of the amount received by the owners for coal rents and royalties on the average of the last five pre-war years, less Mineral Rights Duty; the valuation
being subject to such variation as the Assessing Tribunal may think fit, having regard to the present condition and future prospects of the area which forms the subject of the particular assessment.   Each case must be dealt with on its merits.Where the area was not worked or fully developed prior to the war, the compensation should be ascertained on the present condition and future prospects of the area.Subject to the foregoing provisions, the valuation should be made in accordance with the recognised rules in such cases.83. A Tribunal should be established in each district for the purpose of assessing the amount payable to each royalty owner in that, district. The Tribunal should consist of a mining engineer appointed on behalf of the State, a mining engineer on behalf of the owners, and a legal chairman appointed by the Lord Chancellor in England or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland.84. These Tribunals should have power to obtain any neces-sary information by oral or written evidence and by personal inspection, and the number of expert witnesses who would be employed on behalf of the owner and the State respectively should be limited. Parties should be entitled to appear by counsel or solicitor and a lessee should also be entitled to appear similarly in the event of any question arising affecting his interest. The decision of the Tribunal should be final and should not be subject to appeal except on a question of law.85. The risk of excessive claims or expenses should be guarded against by providing that where the amount awarded by the Tribunal does not exceed the sum, if any,previously &quot;offered in writing on behalf of the State, the costs incurred by the claimant after the date of such offer shall be borne by the claimant. Sub-ject to this proviso the State shall pay the costs and the expenses *of and incidental to the assessment of the compensation and in all cases the costs and expenses in connection with the transfer.Conclusion.86. Having concluded our labours, we desire to express our high * appreciation of the services rendered to us by Mr. Arnold D. McNair, C.B.E., Secretary of the Commission, and Mr. Gilbert

MEMORANDUMSir ADAM NIMMO, K.B.E., and Sir ALLAN M. SMITH, K.B.E.With reference to the foregoing Report:  1. As the first stage of the enquiry was concluded and the three Interim Reports of 20th March, 1919, were issued before we became members of the Commission, we are not responsible for anything that was done up to that date or for anything contained in any of the Interim Reports. It is necessary for us to point this out, because in our opinion it is regrettable that the Chairman&apos;s Report was not confined to the two matters on which an Interim Report was promised by 20th March, 1919, by the Prime Minister, viz., &quot; the two issues of wages and hours.&quot; It was on these two points only that the witnesses were invited to give evidence at that stage of the proceedings. This is clearly indicated in the letter of 27th February, 1919, from the Secretary of the Commission to the Coal Owners&apos; Associations, which stated that the first part of the enquiry would be confined to a pre-liminary investigation into the questions of wages and hours.2. The recommendation in favour of nationalisation or unifica-tion by purchase and/or by joint control in the Chairman&apos;s Report of 20th March, 1919, to which we refer, has made the consideration of these problems in the second stage of the enquiry more difficult for us than would otherwise have been the case.ADAM NIMMO. ALLAN M. SMITH.20th June, 1919.
REPORTBYSir ARTHUR DUCKHAM, K.C.B., M.I.C.E.TO THE KING&apos;S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY.May it please Your Majesty,I have the honour to present my Report in pursuance of the Coal Industry Commission Act, 1919, on the subjects which fell to be considered during the second stage of the enquiry.I find myself unfortunately in disagreement with the rest of my colleagues on points both of principle and detail. It ap-peared to me therefore necessary to submit a separate report.I divide my report into two pai-is :  (i) The opinions upon  which my  recommendations are based.(ii) My recommendations.PART I.Having listened to the whole of the evidence given before the Commission and having assimilated, so far as time has permitted, the many important and interesting documents that have been circulated to the members, I have formed the following-opinions :  I.Ownership of Minerals.The private ownership of minerals has not been and is not in the best interests of the community.II.Proving of Minerals.The proving of the country&apos;s mineral resources should not be left to private enterprise.
III.Disadvantages of Private Ownership. The working of over 3,000 collieries by more than 1,500 sepa-rate interests has resulted in heavy losses of coal and inefficient working, and unnecessary difficulties in the winning of the coal.IV.Distribution.The system of distribution of coal to small users and house-holders has not been and is not satisfactory. The system of distribution of coal to large users and for export in vogue before the war safeguarded the large consumers and encouraged the export trade.During the war the control of coal supplies has undoubtedly : (a) Kept the price of coal within limits.(&amp;) Ensured as far as possible an even distribution of the quantity of coal available. On the other hand control has :(c) Eesulted in grave inefficiencies in the use of coal, owingto the kind of coal delivered to the user being in many cases unsuitable for his purposes.(d) Caused unnatural conditions in the coal trade.(e) Been responsible for many errors which naturally occurwhen an enterprise of such magnitude is ruled by a central and more or less makeshift organisation,V.Decrease in Output. There is at the present time a serious decrease in the output of coal. This is caused partly by the general state of disturbance in industry, owing to the change over from war to peace condi-tions, and partly by a general slackening of effort on the part of all workers. Higher remuneration to labour has not resulted in larger output.VI.State Enterprise. It has not been shown that there is&quot; an increased output per worker or less industrial strife when undertakings are owned and controlled by the State for the benefit of the Community.
1    502VII.Aspirations of Labour.The workers desire and should have full opportunity to improve their status by:(a) Co-operating in the general conduct of the industry.(b) Obtaining a proper and sufficient return for their work.(c) The improvement of their general conditions of living.(d) Having sufficient leisure to devote time to their familycircle and their own betterment.VIII.Cost of Coal.It is essential, in order to safeguard the trade and industry of this country, to increase output and reduce costs by practising every economy and improvement in methods.IX.Need for Cheap Coal.Cheap coal is vital to the industrial prosperity of this country and to the comfort of its citizens.X.Multiple Shifts.The evidence has shown that only in a few areas is a multiple shift system of getting coal in operation. The multiple shift ensures the working of the coal face for the maximum number of hours per day by relays of workers. In the majority of collieries therefore the best results are not obtained. The objec-tions of the workers form the chief difficulty in putting this desirable system into practice in all suitable places.XI. Housing.The general housing conditions of the workers throughout the country leave much to be desired, but it has not been shown that miners are worse housed than other great classes of the industrial population. In many cases miners are badly housed. Some Gwners have consistently and successfully endeavoured to improve conditions. But for the war, many more suitable houses would have been built.
Pithead Baths.Mining is a dirty occupation, and the condition of the miners&apos; houses has been made worse and the lives of the miners&apos; wives and families made harder by the dirt being carried into the houses. Pitbead baths and drying rooms for pit clothes should have been the rule long ago. Both owners and men have been at fault.XIII. Health.It has not been shown that the health of miners or their families is worse than the health of the workers in other industries.XIV. Safety.The standard of safety in British mines compares most favourably with that in mines in other countries. It has not been shown that nationalisation in other countries has improved safety conditions.XV.Plicate Enterprise.The development of the coal industry (the chief source of the wealth and industrial success of this country) has been entirely due to private enterprise. On the other hand grave losses to the community have been caused by lack of co-ordination in the efforts of private enterprise.XVI.Friction between Owners and Workpeople. In some of the districts there has been a failure on the part of the owners and workers to realise that their interests should be made common. The result has been continual and gradually increasing friction and mistrust, which have caused decreased efficiency in the working of the mines. The refusal of the Miners&apos; Federation to co-operate with other unions of workers, with the employers, and with the State to obtain general industrial agreement is much to be regretted.
-    50353 XVII.Poor Collieries and, Areas. The prosperity of collieries and coal  areas  varies  greatly. There is grave danger under present conditions of many collieries and even some areas going out of production.XVIII.N ationalisation.National ownership and control of collieries does not offer a real solution of the problems. Many advantages have been claimed for nationalisation: practically none has been sustained. Many cogent objections have been advanced against nationalisa-tion, the majority of which have not been refuted. The nationalisation of the coal mining industry would be an unpre-cedented and colossal experiment. A mistake would result in a national calamity.XIX.Bureaucratic Control. There is a general agreement that bureaucratic control would be unsuited to the proper conduct of the coal industry.   Incen-tive and freedom of action are necessary;   bureaucracy stifles both.XX.Miners&apos; Federation Bill.The Bill drafted and submitted on behalf of the Miners&apos; Federation does not offer a satisfactory solution.   Among many points which make this scheme unworkable are the following:   1. The Minister is responsible both to Parliament and aMining&apos; Council. 2. The impracticable proposals for the control of the in-dustry.3. The predominance of the Miners&apos; Federation; the dis-regard of the many other interests concerned in the industry.4. The proposed confiscation of property.5. The very wide powers of acquisition to be granted to theMining Council, coupled with a disclaimer clausewhich might paralyse industry.
XXI.Mineo wn ers&apos; Propose Is.The mineowners&apos; proposals show a desire to meet the aspira-tions of the workers, but a profit-sharing scheme, under which bonuses form part of the wages, and the failure to include worlf-men&apos;s representatives on the Board of Directors as a necessary adjunct to the scheme render the main proposals unacceptable. Further, there are no suggestions for the unification of the work-ing of collieries in the same district.XXII.Research.Research and experiment to improve methods and conditions of working and dealing with coal have not, in the majority of collieries, received sufficient attention. Xo evidence is forth-coming, except in a few specific instances, of serious co-operative effort between owners to carry out research and to pool ideas and experience.XXIII.Fuel Conservation.An enormous amount of fuel is being wasted in this country. The collieries are offenders, but every industry is wasting fuel by using it uneconomically. A very substantial saving could rapidly be made if the question of economy were made a national one. The generation of electricity in central stations is only one line of advance. Similar and even greater savings could be made if proper action were taken in other spheres.XXIV.Unsettled Position of Industry.Control and special war conditions have disturbed the whole industry. The appointment of the Coal Commission, the issue of the interim reports, and the publication of evidence in the Press have unsettled the industry still further, and are pro-venting all development. It is essential that the future of the industry be decided at an early date. Conditions in the industry should be changed as little as possible, compatible with the attainment of efficiency, better conditions and satisfactory sup-plies to the consumers.
PART II.Having briefly slated my opinions as to what are the salient facts of the present situation, I make the following recommendations. The time left for the preparation of reports after the completion of evidence has been so short that it is only possible to make recommendations on the broadest lines.XXV.Acquisition of Mineral Rights.The whole of the mineral rights of Great Britain should be acquired by the State, the value of such rights being estimated in each case on the same basis as adopted by the Inland Revenue in assessing ownership of minerals for death duties (the evidence of the witnesses from the Inland Revenue Department clearly show the principles), due regard being given to the change in value of money owing to the war, increased taxation (with the exception of the Excess Mineral Rights Duty), etc. No in-creased, value should be given in cases where it can be shown that mineral owners have used improper pressure to obtain royalties above those commonly obtained or in the case of sliding scale royalties which have become excessive through war conditions. Compensation should preferably be paid in the form of annuities, as suggested in Mr. Walter Leafs evidence.XXVI. Ministry of Mines.A Ministry of Mines should be set up, which should, at a later date, form one of a group of Ministries attached to a Ministry of Industry. The duties of the Ministry of Mines should be (inter alia) (a) To supervise and control all mineral rights throughoutGreat Britain and to ensure the proper working of all minerals.(b) To ensure the making of a complete geological survey(including the systematic proving of all coal areas) of the whole country.(c) To be responsible, through its inspectors, for the properequipment and running of mines to ensure safety.(d) To initiate and, if necessary, carry out research for theimprovement in the conditions of those working in and about mines, better methods of winning coal, etc-
(e) To undertake the study of the special diseases of under-ground workers and to initiate special treatment.(/) To exercise any control of the industry which a national emergency may render necessary.(g) To advise the Minister of Labour as to the special con-ditions present in the coal industry.Qi) To co-operate with any Government Department set up for the conservation of fuel.XXVII.Area Commission.A Commission assisted by experts acquainted with the various districts should at once be set up to decide the areas into which the country should be divided (all mining interests in each of such areas being amalgamated) in order to obtain the best economies and efficiencies in the winning and working of coal. The areas should not be larger than necessary to ensure (a) The most efficient draining and pumping for the whole area.(o) The most rapid transport of the coal to the surface and the miner to his work.(c) The obtaining and distribution of power from one centre.(d) The prevention of waste of coal by artificial barriers, etc.(e) The proper handling of the various classes of coal pro-duced in the area.XXVIII.Unification.It is essential that all the colliery interests in the areas specified should be amalgamated in order to obtain proper working. The amalgamated interests would be granted a lease by the Crown to work coal and other necessary minerals.XXIX.Method of Unification.It is possible to prepare a variety of schemes to attain the primary object of unification in areas, but the following proposals are made to illustrate the intention. The proposals assume the discontinuance of the present system of control.
The whole of the mining and mineral interests in each area should be amalgamated into a Statutory Company (hereinafter called, &quot; a District Coal Board &quot;).(a) The total par value of the shares issued by any Boardshall not be greater than the total value of the various amalgamated interests as going concerns at tbe present time, but valued at 1914 prices, due allowance being made for the capital expenditure since that date at enhanced prices.(b) The shares of the District Coal Board should be of oneclass only and should be entitled to a minimum rate of dividend of 4 per cent, which should be guaranteed by the Government.(c) Profits in excess of those necessary to pay the 4 per cent.dividend and usual depreciations may be utilised (i) to form such reserve funds as may be ap-proved by the Minister of Mines.(ii) To pay a further 2 per cent, dividend.Of the remaining profits one-third may be utilised for paying further dividend on shares, but the other two-thirds must be used to reduce the price of coal.The above proposals for the division of profits do not preclude a bonus on profits being paid to the managerial and clerical staff. This would correspond to the bonus in output proposed below for the manual workers.XXX.Government Right to take over a District Coal Board.The Government shall have the right to take over the shares of any District Board, should the Board have called upon the Government in four years out of a consecutive seven years to make advances to pay the guaranteed dividend and the Board failed to repay within the seven years any advances made. The compensation to be paid by the Government for the shares so acquired should be based upon the profits earned by the under-taking during such seven years.
Board of Directors.The number of-Directors on each Board should be not less than seven. All except three of the Directors should be appointed in the ordinary way by the shareholders. Of such three Directors one should be elected by ballot of: the agents, managers and under-managers, and two by ballot of the workpeople engaged in the area.XXXII.Go vernmen t Representative.The Government, as owner of all minerals in the area, should appoint a competent mining engineer to safeguard the interests of the State. He should have the right to attend directors&apos; meet-ings when he desires to do so, but should have no voting power.XXXIII.Agents, Managers, and Undermanagers&apos; Representatives.The agents, managers and undermanagers have and will con-tiniie to have legal obligation for the proper and safe running of mines. They therefore should be represented on the Board of Directors.   Their expert advice would be invaluable.xxxiv.1 Vo rkmen&apos;s Representat ives.Labour has a special claim for representation in the directorate as wages form the predominant item in the cost of production and the conditions of the industry are necessarily hazardous. The other directors would benefit greatly by having actual workers on the Board with a close knowledge of conditions, and the workmen would have a definite voice in the conduct of the industry.XXXV.Each Director must have full power of taking decisions and voting without reference.XXXVI.Minimum or Standard Wages. The minimum or standard wages for mine workers should lie considered and settled together with the general wages of the
506country. Whatever machinery may be set up by the Minister fif Labour for this purpose should be utilised.XXXYlf.Committee for Settling Rales and Wages.Special rates and wages should be settled for the area of each District Board. The basis should be the agreements at present in force which have been arrived at alter years of experience. Conciliation Boards on similar lines to those now existing shall deal with special wages and disputes.XXXVIII.Payment by Results.The wages of all workpeople and employees should be guaranteed by minimum or standard rates. An equitable system of payment on increased output and efficiency should be arranged and made applicable, as far as possible, to all manual workers in addition to the system of piece-work rates at present in force.XXXIX.AssociaIed Uhdertakings.Where a colliery undertaking is attached to other industrial undertakings, such as iron, steel-works, by-product ovens, &amp;c, the value of the colliery undertaking should be separated and included in the holding of the District Coal Board. The colliery should then be leased back to the original owners, who would have the right to raise and use all coal necessary for their own purposes, but they should have no powers to sell coal as such except through the District Coal Board.XL.Responsibility of Manager.At each colliery, as now, the manager should be responsible for and have complete control of the running of the pit. The District Coal Board will have managing directors, consulting engineers and technical experts, who will naturally discuss matters with the managers and lay down general policy.
Pit Committees.At each colliery a pit committee should be set up with the manager as chairman and representatives of each main class of workmen employed in or about the mine. The pit committees should meet at definite intervals and would be competent to discuss and make proposals on(a) safety of the mine;(b) conditions of working;(c) improvement in methods;(VZ) comfort, and well-being of the workers while in the mine or colliery premises;(e) any disputes that may arise other than wages disputes.Wages would not be discussed at pit committee meetings.XLII.Multiple Shifts.The general extension of multiple shifts, as the most ready means of increasing output, reducing costs, and improving wages to the workpeople as a whole, should he immediately considered by a joint committee of the Government, owners and miners.XLIII.Housing.Housing is a national question. The present great Govern-ment scheme will prevent any other general scheme going for-ward as all available building facilities will be fully utilised.XLIY.Pit Head Baths.The Id. per ton levy proposed in the Interim Report presented by the Chairman, myself and my two colleagues should be immediately used for setting up pit head baths and drying rooms.   This will do much to improve housing conditions.
50*I XLV.Distribution.Municipalities and local authorities should be given powers to undertake the distribution of coal in tbeir areas, either by setting up their own organisations, purchasing existing businesses, or employing existing contractors.XLVI. Coal Traffic.The question of the economy of coal traffic and private owner-ship of wagons should be dealt with by the Minister of Ways and Communications in conjunction with the Minister of Mines. The interests of the consumer must be safeguarded, and the consumer must be given free choice of fuel to ensure proper economy in its utilisation.XLVII.. Accounts and Costing.A standard form of accounts should be adopted for all District Boards.XLYIII.Publicity.It is essential that there should be complete publicity as to the operations and financial results of the coal industry. The Ministry of Mines should be expressly charged with the duty of publishing, not less than once a year, figures showing the cost of getting coal in each of the districts of the country, and the proportion chargeable to materials, wages, general expenses, interest, profits, and other general items.XLIX.Meeting of Chairmen of District Boards.The Minister of Mines should hold a meeting of the Chairmen of all District Boards quarterly (and at such other times as may be required by the Minister).
20th June, 1919.ARTHUR DUCKHAM.Commission for Heat, Li/jlit and Power.Commissioners for Heat, Light and Power should be appointed, who should undertake a full enquiry into the wastage of fuel and the best methods of effecting economies throughout tho country.I desire to associate myself with the Chairman in his expression of thanks and appreciation to the Assessors and Secretaries for the invaluable help they have given to the Commission through-out the enquiry, and for the great assistance I have received from them in the preparation of my Report.All of which 1 humbly report for Your Majesiy&apos;s gracious consideration.

INTRODUCTION.It has been suggested to me that the views of a per-fectly independent observer, who has made some study of the subject, as I have, may help to elucidate the very difficult questions now being investigated by the Coal Commission. I have fallen in with the suggestion because it seems to me that the public, who are deeply interested in the issue and the final judges of its right determination, must be rather bewildered than enlightened by the course of the present inquiry, and would be glad of any help in finding their way through a mass of contradictory assertions, irrelevancies, personalities, and dialectical dis-plays. The new mode of inquiry, in which the same persons play the parts of witnesses, advocates, jury, and judge, has its drawbacks. Valuable evidence has been jiven on technical matters, but it has been overlaid and obscured by the partisan element and by theatrical exhi-bitions which may entertain but do not enlighten. The ding-dong.of ex-parte opinions might go on till the Day of Judgment without advancing knowledge; and, unfortu-nately, the distinguished economists, who gave evidence and are perfectly disinterested, had to admit, for the most part, a lack of acquaintance with the mining industry. They were, in fact, a little too detached.I had no thought of contributing to the discussion, and was looking myself to the inquiry for instruction; but, as it has proceeded, disappointment has grown, for the reasons jnven, and I can well understand that others feel the same and would like to see a more dispassionate treatment of die subject from an outside source. Such help as I can tjive may be of little value, but that is for others to judge. At least it is wholly disinterested and based on personal observation. During the thirty years that I have continu ously devoted to the study of industrial life, public health, housing, the relations, of employers and employed, and other cognate questions I have paid particular attention to miners. I have visited most of the coalfields in Great Britain and some of the principal ones in France, Belgium,
Germany, and Canada, and have observed the operations both above and below ground. At the same time, I have studied the home conditions of life in mining villages and towns, the housing, habits, and characteristics of miners, who form a special and in some respects distinct section of the population. They have attracted me on that account. My interest in them is &quot;human,&quot; to use a current term. I am not an engineer or a geologist, and have no commer-cial interest in coal, direct or indirect, except as a con-sumer. Nor have I any prejudices about social &quot;systems,&quot; whether the existing one or any proposed alternatives. I try to weigh their merits, but I wish neither to preserve the one nor to establish the other, though I should like to see them all tried experimentally. It would be extremely interesting, though perhaps costly. The new system that is actually being tried in Russia is both. Experience is undoubtedly a costly school, but it is the best, and for some the only one in which they will learn. I would keep no one from it who insists on going there. But I think people should be told what to expect, so far as that is possible, in order that they may choose with their eyes open. The Coal Commission is really intended to give that information about the nationalisation of mines. Perhaps it may, before it has done, but rival schedules containing nothing but merits on one side and defects on the other are not informing, but perplexing and deluding.The following chapters, in their present form, will not appear until after the issue of the Sankey Commission&apos;s Report; but they may help readers to form their own opinion upon it.June 19.
COAL MINES AND NATIONALISATIONCHAPTER IThe Miner&apos;s WorkThe first thing to grasp about coalmining as an industry-is that conditions are infinitely varied; so varied that generalisations are a snare and averages a deception. This is a truism to those engaged in the industry, and so familiar that they suppose every one knows it; but the public do not realise it at all. It has been brought out at the inquiry, but not in such a way as to make laymen grasp its significance. The only other industries which vary in a similar manner are those which share the peculiarity of having the basic conditions fixed by Nature. Agriculture is the chief of them, and, though the public know more about it than about mining, they do not understand how varied the conditions are. Discussions during the war have shown that again and again. To people who live in towns a farm is a farm, and what can be done on one can be done on another; if not, it is the fault of the farmer. Well, it may be the fault of the farmer, but generally it is the fault of Nature. And that applies still more to mines, for though agriculture, being a less mechanical and more complicated business than mining, and subject to the incalculable vicissitudes of the weather, is in a sense liable to more varied conditions, yet in a more important sense it is not. For in agriculture the natural conditions are much less stubborn and more amenable to human manipulation. They can be altered and improved in many ways, by draining, fertilising, tree-planting, and other means, so that bad conditions can be brought closer to good ones. But the natural conditions of a mine cannot be altered in that way. Some dis-abilities can be modified; but the depth, thickness, quality, extent, and direction of coal seams and the nature of the ground in which they occur have been fixed once for all by Nature and are immutable.     No two pits are quite
alike, and the range of variation is very great. Nor is that all; the conditions are not constant in the same mine, but always changing. And this process, which tends on the whole to deterioration, must be added to the original variability. It is not so with agriculture, in which static conditions can be maintained indefinitely or improved; there is no inevitable deterioration and exhaustion.Mining, therefore, stands apart from other standard industries. The natural conditions govern it more rigidly both on the economic and on the industrial side, and their extreme variability makes standardisation peculiarly diffi-cult. This explains the large discrepancies between the accounts given by mineowners and mineworkers. When the economic position is in question the former have in mind the worst conditions that is, the poorest and least remunerative pits; when the industrial position is con-sidered, they think of the best. The miners take exactly the opposite line; they measure the owners&apos; position by the best pits, their own by the worst. The same divergence of vision is habitual in all industries. Each side looks through its own glasses and sees what suits it; all men do the same more or less in every conflict of interests. But the exceptional range of variability in mining makes the divergence more striking than in other cases. It accounts for the irreconcilable statements about pay and profits and conditions of work that are flung about, to the bewilder-ment of the public, who do not know what to believe, and conclude that both sides are telling lies. The explanation is that they are speaking of different things; they are not telling lies, but half-truths, which are not the same thing, though Tennyson says that a lie which is half the truth is ever the blackest of lies.The economic difference between particular mines was shown at the first Sankey inquiry by the revelation that the half-crown advance in price, allowed by the Govern-ment in order to enable the poorer mines to pay the in-creased wages, had cost consumers 25 millions, of which five millions, after deducting the war taxes, went into the pockets of the owners of the richer mines, who neither wanted nor asked for it. But a misleading turn was given to the question by. the suggestion that the reason why a price that meant a fortune for some collieries might spell bankruptcy for others was that they were in different ownership, leading to the inference that the real difference was between efficient and inefficient management.    of
ourse, management varies in efficiency, but the relative profitableness of mines depends mainly on natural con- &apos; ilitions, and natural difficulties are rather a spur to efficient management than the contrary. This factor is overlooked jo the proposed remedy of unified ownership, which is one jif the arguments for nationalisation. Of course, if the proceeds, of all the mines were pooled, whether under the State or under a colliery combine, the weak ones would be covered by the strong, and could afford prices and wages ,vhich they cannot when standing alone. But, being secured against loss, they would lack the stimulus of necessity and would lean on the subsidy. A centralised management might combat this tendency by vigilant supervision, but authoritative control is a much less effec-:ive spur to effort than the motive of self-preservation.On the industrial side the natural differences between mines are a very stubborn fact and much less amenable to arrangement than they are on the economic side. You may equalise pay and prices, but you cannot equalise conditions of work. The great dispute in 1912, which led io the general strike and the Minimum Wage Act, arose out of the question of &quot;abnormal places&quot; or conditions ihich prevent a hewer from earning the standard rate of pay for the district. Mr. Stanley Jevons, in his classical took on the coal trade, enumerates eight natural conditions entailing special difficulties in getting coal: (1) Seam too thin; (2) seam too thick; (3) loose joints; (4) soft or broken roof; (5) bands of stone; (6) sporadic concretions of stone in coal; (7) water; (8) gas. These alone afford scope for infinite variety, but they are only some of the natural con-ditions affecting underground workers and varying from mine to mine. Others are the depth, temperature, pre-ralence of dust, distance from shaft and length of workings, inclination of the ground. I dwell on these conditions because thev are inherent in the nature of the industrv; they differentiate it from others, and constitute a primary element in the problem of conducting it. They will remain under any system and will present the same difficulties, which are at the bottom of much of the friction that has brought the industry to its present pass. But their part in the problem has been obscured. Exceptionally bad conditions have been represented as typical, and, since they have occurred under private ownership, the suggestion is that they are caused by it and would disappear with it. The propagation of that notion sets any administration
that may hereafter be set up a very difficult, not to say impossible, task.Underground work has some disadvantages and some advantages over other kinds. It is arduous, dirty, dis-agreeable, and more dangerous than most other occupa-tions; but, to my mind, its greatest drawback is that it is carried on entirely by artificial and, for the most part, a very poor light. That is a thing that can be improved and is constantly being improved. I have before me a letter written by an underground worker whose recollections go back for fifty years. In speaking of the wonderful im-provements that have been made, he says that when he first went down the pit as a lad his duty was to go down before the men, and, when they came, to serve out to them tallow candles and gunpowder! Five shillings was then an exceptionally good day&apos;s pay. Ventilation has been improved even more than lighting, and one of the under-ground conditions that always surprises a visitor is the freshness of the atmosphere in a well-ventilated mine. Perhaps visitors are not allowed in an ill-ventilated one. The temperature, too, is equable and pleasantly warm without being too hot, unless the mine is exceptionally deep. This is an advantage over work exposed to the vicissitudes of weather, such as navvying, which most nearly resembles it. I have some experience of that. In the days of my youth physical labour was my delight, and I sought the heaviest kinds by preference. I never had a chance of working&apos;in a coalpit, or I should have jumped at it; but I did some navvying, and would certainly rather be a navvy than a collier in spite of the exposure. But people who rate warmth and shelter higher than the open air might prefer the mine. There is not a great deal to choose between them; both demand health and strength, but, given those qualities, a man can tackle either without making a song about it.Several kinds of work have greater disadvantages than mining, and there is one great occupation which far sur-passes it in severity, hardship, and danger. The life of a miner&apos;is ease and comfort compared with that of a seaman or fireman on board an ordinary cargo boat. I have been across the Bay of Biscay in a collier tramp, and when I see one of those vessels threshing out to sea in winter 1 think of the men in her and wonder how they can stand it. That is the life to make a song about, and Mr. Kipling has made a very good one.   No men have played
B grander part in the war, though none had less to lose; jnd they never whined about it. Of course, the miners lot is not made any better by the seaman&apos;s worse one; but, quite apart from that, the woeful picture, of Mr. Smillie&apos;s down-trodden clients is grotesquely out of drawing. To do them justice, the miners themselves do not plead for pity or whine about the horrors of their calling; nothing is farther from their thoughts. They take a pride in their occupation, their institutions and their mode of living; [hey hold their heads high, and count themselves quite as ?ood as other folk. What they think of their work is ^hown by the fact that son follows father down the pit from generation to generation, and the boys are as keen to go below as if they were going bird&apos;s-nesting; they im-patiently await the day when it is allowed, not because they know nothing about it, as boys who run away to sea, but because they know all about it. Mr. Smillie has overdone bis brief in this respect; he has struck the pathetic note too loudly and put his clients iin a false and somewhat ridiculous position.CHAPTER IIThe Miner&apos;s Home[n the introduction miners are described as forming a pecial and in some respects distinct section of the popu-lation. The same distinctive characters are found among ihem in different countries as well as in different parts of [he same country and are evidently, therefore, connected with their circumstances. The circumstance distinguish-mg them from other working-class groups is that they live in rural or semi-rural communities, yet are economically at least on a level with highly paid town workers. Indeed, if the average family income be taken, I doubt if any section of wage-earners stands so high as the miners, because large families are common among them and sons continue to live at home, so that several members of the same family are often found bringing in men&apos;s or boys&apos; earnings regularly to the family exchequer. It was this fact that caused so much domestic trouble in Durham and Northumberland in connection with the Eight Hours Act and the practice of multiple shifts that followed it. Where the menfolk in the same house were in different shifts they were going out and coming in at all hours, and the women uere never done preparing meals and cleaning up.   The
question of shifts, by the way, is another illustration of the differences between different mines pointed out in the previous article. The number of shifts worked varies from one to four and it is determined by several circumstances. The girls, too, earn money, being as numerous as the boys and much in demand. Of course the position of having a quiverful of wage-earners implies the antecedent one of a quiverful of wage-eaters, when the children are young; and the one must be set against the other. But that applies generally; the advantage that miners have is that the burden stage of a family leads more regularly to the beneh&quot;! stage and to a fuller one than in other classes.Physical Conditions The combination of semi-rural life with comparatively good economic conditions produces several well-marked effects, of which the most conspicuous and important is vigour both of body and mind. I entirely agree with Dr. Haldane, who told the Commission that miners are a virile class. I have been struck by the fact over and over again in different countries; it is a common characteristic of mining communities. Though many live within the precincts of large towns such as Sheffield, Essen, and St. Etienne, and many more form more or less distinctly mining towns of considerable size such as Merthyr, Konigshutte, and Lens, they are sufficiently apart from city life to retain a certain primitive simplicity and zest in life without falling into the slow-mindedness of a remote peasantry or the mental apathy of a servile class. They are conservative but sturdily independent, attached to their own customs, going their own way and managing their own affairs with shrewdness and energy. Their physical vigour is shared by the women in full measure and shown by the high birth-rate. The last is a mosl important fact closely connected with overcrowding and infant mortality, but hardly mentioned, if at all, at the inquiry. Mining districts everywhere have higher birth-rates than contiguous urban and rural populations. It would be easy to prove this by masses of statistics; but 1 wilKconfine myself to a few illustrative figures. The birth-rate for England and Wales in 1915 was 22 per 1,000; in the county of Durham it was 28.7; in some typical colliery districts it was Hebburn, 35.1; Hetton, 34.9; Easington, 34.3; Seaham, 32.3; Houghton-le-Spring, 31.5; Stanley, 30.9. Similar figures might be given for every mining area.   In the West Riding of Yorkshire, where the tot--)!
birth-rate is only 23.3 and very low figures occur both for towns and rural districts, the mining population yields rates quite as high as those just quoted. In South Wales they run still higher. The same phenomenon occurs in other countries and is even more marked in Germany than in Britain.Miners do not go in for &quot;race suicide&quot; or have not vet done so to any extent, though the birth-rate has per-i-eptibly fallen among them in recent years. A little inci-dent once&apos; revealed to me more eloquently than any statistics the zest in life which they retained after more sophisticated sections of the population had lost it. During the great strike of 1893 in Yorkshire and the Midlands I one day came across a considerable party men and women  who had been at a mass meeting and were on their way home. We met at a roadside inn and got into conver-sation. They were delighted to meet a stranger and put their case to him, which they did without heat and very honestly, as I have always found the real workers do. If you want to know the truth go to them and rely on the statements neither of labour leaders nor of employers, at any rate until you have checked them. On that occasion they clustered round me and told me all about it. Among them was a girl who said something about her children, and I looked at her with some astonishment. She was a bright and comely girl but looked very young. &quot;Then vou&apos;re married?&quot; I said. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, &quot; that&apos;s my husband over there.&quot; &quot; And you have children ? But surely you&apos;re very young,; you look too young to have children.&quot; &quot; Not &quot;at all,&quot;&quot; she said, &quot; I&apos;ve got six &quot; ; and then, noting my astonishment, she flung out her arms with a magnificent gesture and added, &quot;and I hope to have six more.&quot; I have never seen the true joie de vivre so simply and powerfully expressed. And those people were in the middle of one of the severest industrial struggles ever known. They starved; I saw famine on the faces of many before it was over. But they held out, and they won, as they deserved to do, for they were in the right. That was the dispute which Lord Rosebery &quot; settled &quot; at the Foreign Office, gaining thereby prodigious applause. As a matter of fact the colliery owners came up to London prepared to give in. Just a fortnight before, one of the most in-fhiential among them said to me, &quot;This dispute will last about another fortnight.&quot; They were trying to enforce a reduction of wages.
i2 Coal mines and nationalisationMiners do not have large families because they live in a wretched manner and are too apathetic to care what becomes of themselves, but because it is natural to persons of strong vitality and simple habits who can afford it. Except in regard to housing, they live well and possess a high degree of self-respect. The work demands a full diet and they take it; they are hearty eaters and drinkers, and they like to have the best quality of food. Some years ago 1 was inquiring into the tea trade, and the leading wholesale house in London told me that one of their best customers for superior China tea was a little grocer&apos;s shop in the Rhondda, which would take 100 chests at a time. I have heard similar testimony to the taste of miners in other articles. Of course, economic conditions vary in different districts; some are much more prosperous than others. But, except when there is a strike, the mining population is well fed and well clothed. When the outcry about food prices became very loud towards the end of 1916 I made some inquiries, and in one of the principal mining valleys in South Wales I asked the miners&apos; agent if anyone was going short of food on account of the prices. He was an honest man and said that the miners were not, because they earned high wages. The shops in that remote place were full of food of all kinds fruit and vegetables, pastry, confectionery, sweets, cakes, groceries, canned and other provisions in addition to the &quot;Co-op.,&quot; at which they got bread and&apos;otherstaples. A jeweller, who had been there six years, and sold nothing but articles of luxury, told me that he had done far more business that year than ever before. On the Continent miners are not nearly so well paid as in this country, but there, too, they are hearty folk and live better than most wage-earners. The average net wage per shift paid in German mines in 1912 ranged from 3s. 6d. to 5s.; hewers averaged a little more from 3s. 9d. to 6s. This is far below our minimum, but living was then cheaper in Germany, and miners were noted as good customers for meat. Mineowners also do more for them than here.With regard to health, we may distinguish between mining as an occupation and the general health of mininq communities. As an occupation coalmining is healthy, relatively to most others. The death-rate among males aged 15 to 65 is considerably below the average for occn-pied males; the comparative figure in England and Wales is 88 against 100.   If it were not for accidents, they would
be much lower on the list. They are well below the mean line in all groups of disease, except the respiratory; and this does not include phthisis, from which they are remark-ably free, having a death-rate less than half the average. The coal-dust, which irritates the mucous membrane of the respiratory passages and renders miners susceptible to bronchitis and pneumonia, seems to have a protective influence against phthisis. The ironical reference to mines as health resorts made at the Coal Commission has a sub-stratum of truth. The prevalence of respiratory diseases other than phthisis explains the apparent inconsistency between Dr. Haldane&apos;s evidence on the healthiness of miners and Sir A. Newsholme&apos;s observations quoted by Mr. Dugdale-Bradley in The Times. There is no incon-sistency at all. Obviously a section of the population may be liable to particular affections and yet have a generally high standard of health, because the weaknesses are offset by superior advantages; and that is, in fact, the case. Even in regard to respiratory affections miners are not very much above the average in to 100 and far below many other occupations which entail the inhalation of dust or exposure to the weather.Infant Mortality.The case of the mining population in general and infant life in particular is far less favourable. I will again use certain districts in Durham as an illustration. The follow-ing table shows their relation to the whole country in regard to the general and the infant death-rates in 1915. I add the birth-rates, as given above, for the sake of com-pleteness. The birth-rates and the general death-rates are calculated per 1,000 of the population. The infant death-rates represent the number dying under one year of age per 1,000 births. The figures are taken from the Registrar-General&apos;s Report: -	General Death-rate.	Infant Death-rate.	Birth-rate.England and Wales......	15-7	110	22   -Durham County     ......	17-3	133	28-7Hebburn	16-8	110	35-1Hetton............	18-7	145	34-9Easington      .........	17-5	155	34-3Seaham......      ......	18-9	164	32-3Houghton-le-Spring......	17-1	153	31-5Stanley............	17-0	132	30-9
It will be observed that in all the particular areas named, except Hebburn, the death-rates are considerably above the average for England and Wales, as are the birth-rates. This is the general rule. There is a broad, though not an exact, correspondence between birth-rates and infant death-rates; the latter are generally high where the former are high, and that fact must be taken into account in con-sidering the mining population. The combination of a high birth-rate with low infant mortality, as at Hebburn, is unusual, though the opposite combination is only too common in some manufacturing towns. Some of the areas named contain a mixed population; Hebburn is one of them. It lies on the Tyne contiguous to Jarrow, and includes shipbuilding and other industries, besides mining. But on the whole the admixture of other elements affects the returns unfavourably rather than favourably. In Stanley, which has an almost pure mining population, the death-rates are comparatively low, and that is still more the case with the pure mining districts in South Wales. The Rhondda, for instance, has an infant death-rate of only 113, with a birth-rate of 30.7; Gelligaer, with a birth-rate of 34.5, has an infant death-rate of 125.In his Report on Child Mortality (1916) Sir A. News-holme enumerates 21 pure, mining areas in several counties. In these areas the average child mortality (deaths under five years of age per 1,000 births) in 1911-14 was 192, as against 188 for the great towns and 164 for England-and Wales. In the South Wales districts the average was 188, or exactly the same as in the great towns. In view of the high birth-rates this is better than might be expected. The mining districts, with all their draw-backs, are more favourable to child life than the manu-facturing towns.HousingThe broad conclusion is that while the miner&apos;s occu-pation is more healthy than the average his family life is less so. This is due to housing and sanitary conditions, particularly over-crowding. A great deal of attention has been paid to this subject by the Commission, though it has no direct connection with nationalisation, and the evidence seems to have caused some surprise; but it is not new to those who have studied the subject. In the article on Housing in the &quot; Encyclopaedia Britannica &quot; I referred to the bad conditions and over-crowding in mining districts, particularly in the North, where they are worse
Jthan in other parts of England. I was not then acquainted with any pit villages in Scotland, but in 1913 the Secretary of the Lanarkshire Miners&apos; Union took me, at my request, through a number of them and I found conditions still worse than in the North of England. Since thenthe Report of the Royal Commission on Housing in Scotland has been issued. It devotes a whole chapter to miners&apos; houses and gives a full and detailed account of them. I endorse from my own observation what has been said about the worst of these places and believe that it is not exag-gerated. Indeed it would be difficult to exaggerate the state of things; to defend it is impossible. The standard of housing in general is lower in Scotland than in England and less has been done to raise it. Traditional and obsolete conditions have persisted longer there. One can still see remnants of the old style of miners&apos; houses in Durham and Northumberland, that I can remember quite well little cabins of one or two. rooms, built in rows, often back to back, and devoid of all sanitation. But most of it has been swept away and what remains is not inhabited ; there has been a great improvement.The cases brought before the Commission naturally represent the worst; but the conditions throughout the country vary widely, and even in Scotland there is some good housing. In Yorkshire some model villages have been built in connection with new pits. They are not so good, to my mind, as those built by the French companies in the Pas de Calais and the Nord, where the houses are detached and have large gardens; but they are a great advance on the old style. The bulk of the housing lies between the extremes and ranges from poor to fair, with a general tendency to improvement. The greatest and most general evil is overcrowding, which is obviously connected with the high birth-rates and large families. In some districts it is the only serious evil; there are not enough houses and in many of them there is not enough room. It is due to several causes, but cannot be attributed to the private ownership of mines, for public authorities and miners themselves have done still less to remedy it than mineowners. I do not exonerate them in the least, but there is no reason to suppose that any other form of owner-ship would have overcome the general inertia and abolished traditional standards more effectually. A little parallel throws some light on this question. Great prominence has been given to Hamilton as a particularly bad example.   In
Germany, which was held up before the war as a pattern for public enterprise in housing and town-planning, there is a town called Konigshiitte, closely comparable with Hamilton. The industries are coalmines and ironworks. As it happens, the proportion of the population living in tenements of one and two rooms is exactly the same as in Hamilton namely, 70 per cent., or practically the whole working-class population. The bulk of them are miners and the mines are owned by the State. The conditions are vastly different at Dortmund and Bochum, where the mineowners have built a number of colonies, some of a very superior character. They also pay higher wrages than the State.Culture and ReligionI have only space for a few general observations on miners as a class. They are commonly regarded as very rough fellows, much addicted to rather brutal sports. But there is another side. They have in many places provided themselves with clubs or institutes which reach an astonishingly high level. I have been over one in a purely mining village which cost , 15,000 and was entirely paid for by the miners. It contained a large hall for entertain-ments and meetings, library, reading-room, billiard-room, refreshment-room, other small rooms, fives courts, and bowling green. I do not remember if it had a gymnasium, but that is a not uncommon part of the equipment. To sec the&apos; miners in one of these clubs, well-dressed, well-mannered, well-occupied, on good terms with themselves and the world, is to get a glimpse of the other side not vouchsafed to the Coal Commission.Another point of interest about them is that they are, broadly speaking, religious minded. It is notorious in Wales and Scotland, but I came across an instance in Durham. In 1916 in an air-raid on the North-East coast forty bombs were dropped in; a mining village without doing any damage. The miners resolved to hold a Sunday thanksgiving service of their own in the open air, and asked the Dean of Durham to take part in it and address them, which he did; for Dr. Henson has a wonderful in-fluence over working-men, as he proved at Barking.. The secret is that he talks to them like a man, sincerely, straight-forwardly, and fearlessly. The Westphalian miners, who closely resemble our own in character, have the religious trait strongly developed. It was this that led to their break with the Social-Democratic unions which cultivate atheism
and to the development of the Christian unions. The mining population, let me say in conclusion, is a great reservoir of national vitality, character, and capacity. - Its sophistication will sap those qualities, to the great loss of the nation; and I fear it is happening.CHAPTER IIIWhat is Nationalisation?&quot;Nationalisation&quot; has become a Mesopotamia, a &quot;blessed word&quot;; it conveys an ecstatic feeling to enthusiastic minds, which interpret it as they please, just as Irishmen used to translate &quot; Home Rule &quot; into whatever each man happened to want. That is all right so long as it is only in the air; but when you proceed to action and rome down to concrete facts more precision is needed. It becomes necessary to choose between several possible forms which present themselves and to adjust a great many details. Then difficulties are revealed and doubts arise leading to endless disputes. It is an intricate business, and there is very little to guide us through it. A Royal Com-mission has been sitting for several weeks on the nationali-sation of the coal trade; it has to decide, or at least advise authoritatively upon, the future of an immense industry, which provides one of the prime necessities for the preser-vation of life as well as the basis of all manufacturing activity, the means of transport, and the largest asset for the purchase of imports. Obviously this is a matter of the highest importance. But so far as I know no attempt has been made to define nationalisation or to lay down the principles that determine its adoption, the objects sought by it, the fOrm it should take, and the conditions necessary for success. A scheme has been brought forward and a Bill prepared to give effect to it. I shall refer to it later on. But in order to judge any particular project it seems to me that we ought first to have some definite conceptions about nationalisation in general, some principles to go upon, and some criteria to apply. What is nationali-sation ?Public and Private OwnershipThe essence of nationalisation is the substitution of public for private ownership. It is one form of this diange; municipalisation is another, the creation of a special Board or Commission is a third. They differ in form and substance; but the essential principle is the
same, and the word &quot; nationalisation &quot; is often loosely used to cover all three. Ownership implies control or adminis-tration; but the latter is clearly not the essential thing, for on the one hand it may be delegated under nationalisation and on the other it may be exercised by the State without nationalisation. It is, in fact, normally exercised to a greater or less degree over a number of industries or ser-vices, and during the war has been exercised to a much greater extent over many more; but they have noj; been thereby nationalised. If they were there would be no Coal Inquiry. The real question is between public and private ownership; and taking all forms of the former as based on the same principle we get a considerable field for observation.The transference from private to public ownership is a process in constant and progressive operation. Nearly all forms of industrial and commercial activity, including public services such as locomotion, lighting, and water supply, have been originally created and developed by private enterprise. The exceptions are roads and sanita-tion and some factories, chiefly for pottery and glass, established by monarchs either from love of art or for revenue; but the latter are not properly instances of public ownership, and they were based on private enterprise. The fact that roads and sanitary works were publicly owned accounts for their late and slow development, as compared, for instance/ with shipping and water supply; and when they did begin to progress it was chiefly due to private enterprise. Modern road-making dates from the experi-ments of MacAdam, carried out at his own expense, and the works of Telford, commissioned by private employers, as Brindley was commissioned to construct canals. Sani-tation and public health, though essentially public ser-vices, were equally indebted to private enterprise for the initiation and development of the most important advances. The exceptions are, therefore, rather apparent than real. As for railways, manufactures, and extractive industries, &apos; the charge against them is precisely that they are privately owned, which means created by private enterprise.But there appears to be an evolutionary tendency to pass from private to public ownership in one form or another. We have agreed to call it nationalisation. The instances are already numerous and are constantly increasing. In every country I believe the mail is owned and run by the State.    Other means of communication,  having been
developed by private enterprise, are added to it. The leans of locomotion tend to move in the same direction. Jany railways are already in the hands of the State, and ]0re local traffic is publicly than privately owned. This aiter is an instance of municipalisation, which is the most xtensive and generally applied form of public ownership, t least in this country. There is no need to enumerate je services that have fallen under it. But State owner-hip tends to go beyond these fields. In Germany the State owns coalmines, lands, and forests; in France it 3anufactures matches and, I believe, tobacco; in Russia owned the vodka trade, and so on. I do not pretend 3 give a complete list, and doubt if one exists. It is suffi-jent for my purpose to indicate broadly the expanding rocess. The questions I wish to ask are What are the Qnditions that determine the transfer of a given thing a&apos; given time ?   And what are the objects in view ?Socialism ?Many persons label the whole process &quot;Socialism&quot; nd oppose or advocate it according to their prejudices or onvictions about that elusive word of many meanings, hey regard all State action which interferes with or re-laces individual activity as Socialistic; but that is clearly mistake. The right to private property is a State institu-ton which interferes with individual activity; it is social, nit can hardly be called an instalment of Socialism. \gain, war is pre-eminently a State undertaking, but it vould not be accepted as a display of Socialism even by Jiose Socialists who hold that the industrial and commer-ial activities of the State during this war are a step towards socialism and a confirmation of their theories. There is aere a confusion of thought; and since they are protesting against the relinquishment of those activities and urging the extension of national works their views have a direct Dearing on the question of nationalisation and are worth examining. The &quot;capitalist system,&quot; they say, has broken down; but in contemplating this satisfactory enomenon they forget the occasion, which was war. The argument is that Capitalism broke down and Socialism bad to come to its rescue for what? To carry on war. Socialism, then, is a more effective instrument for carrying on war than Capitalism. To persons holding anti-military principles that should rather be a recommendation for Capitalism; its proved impotence would be an assurance
against war, whereas the proved competence of Socialism would afford a better prospect of success and render war less alarming to contemplate. The answer to this dilemma is that State activities in the war had nothing to do with Socialism. War is a purely State business; can be declared and carried on only by States. And since this war, owing to modern developments, demanded for its conduct most of the national energies usually applkx&apos; to other purposes, they necessarily came under the control of the State, which could not otherwise concentrate them on the one business in hand. The &quot; capitalist system &quot; did not break down; it was broken up by war, which is not its affair, and its component parts came to the assistance of the State.There is evidently no necessary connection belweei nationalisation and Socialism.    Indeed, there is an im-portant school of Socialists, holding the strict Marxian doctrine, who are opposed to the absorption of industries and services by the State as it exists.    The German Socialists have, in fact, successfully opposed several pro-jects of nationalisation.    The conversion of private into State monopolies by nationalisation is to this school of thought not Socialism, but its antipodes.   Their position has been explained by M. Vandervelde in a recent book, &quot; Le Socialisme contre 1&apos;Etat.&quot;    It is based on the dis-tinction, originally drawn by Saint-Simon and adopted by Engels, between the State as the organ of power and the State as the organ of administration, between &quot; the govern-ment of persons and the administration of things.&quot;   This! is a sonorous phrase, but it has more sound than meaning, for you cannot administer things without governing per-sons.   We need not follow the argument into the in-tricacies of Socialist speculation, but it does indicate a re; distinction between nationalisation and Socialism, and i is pertinent to the present inquiry because it leads Ml Vandervelde to discuss nationalisation as it exists.    He points out some radical defects and weaknesses and main, tains that even if the Socialist ideal were reached and government placed in the hands of the workers instead of the capitalists, it would still be a Government capable, like its predecessors, of abusing its powers and resources Consequently, he argues, an indispensable condition fa the collective appropriation of the means of work is the separation of the governing State from the industrial State, He propounds two ways of doing this (i) by conferringi
iaro-e measure of autonomy on Government undertakings; (2) by creating statutory bodies; and he illustrates both from fisting examples. His analysis is a valuable aid towards precision and a clear view of the problem before us.The Grounds for Public Ownership.It is clear, not only from these considerations, but also [rom the patent facts, that Socialism, in the technical sense, has not been the motive for the processes of nationalisation aS hitherto carried out, though some groups of Socialists regard it as an ideal and constantly urge it in principle. The actual motives are quite different, and there are several. \ powerful and prominent one is war or the preparation [0r war. It accounts directly for most of the railway nationalisation on the Continent; and this explains, as M. fandervelde points out, why the only great countries ifhich have not nationalised any railways are Great Britain jnd the United States. Circumstances have relieved them j having to regard railways as means of attack and Jefence. The force of the argument is seen from their action as soon as they became engaged in war. Indirectly, jar is also largely responsible for another capital motive, vhich is revenue. The State needs money to finance Army jnd Navy, and looks about for lucrative monopolies. Prussia is the leading example, but the State spirit monopoly in Russia shows still more clearly the working if this influence.. It was originally introduced to control he traffic in the interests of temperance, but it became K rore and more lucrative, until it produced nearly half the :otal revenue, and after the Japanese War military needs rere so urgent that this financial resource was exploited to :he utmost and temperance ignored. This fact, by the way, makes the step of prohibition at the outbreak of war all the more creditable to the Government; under the Revolution it has been reversed.Apart from war, finance in general has been a great motive for nationalisation; and it has a particular action of its own in promoting the extension of public ownership. Once the State is in! possession of a revenue-bearing monopoly it cannot endure competition, and is moved to absorb new industries that threaten to reduce its gains. So the Post Office swallows up telegraphs and telephones as soon as they are sufficiently developed by private enter-prise. In promoting municipal ownership finance plays a particularly strong part.   In taking over water, lighting.
trams, markets, and so on, stress is always laid on the pecuniary results to be anticipated, and subsequent battles over the effects of the change generally turn on that point. But there are other motives. One is pure emulation or imitation. It exercises a considerable influence in both national and local politics, but chiefly in the latter. The example of some other State or town is held up as a reason for doing the same thing. &quot; See what they do in the happy land of X or the progressive town of Y&quot; is one of the most familiar arguments.But the motive which operates most frequently of all and serves most effectively to overcome opposition is the interest of the consumer, who is promised, and expects to get, a better service at less cost. Of course all the motives enumerated are in a sense based on the public interest, which the State or the municipality is supposed to repre-sent; but what I am referring to is a direct appeal to the consumers interest. The conviction that it will be served by the change from private to public ownership is, I think, the determining factor in most cases. It is brought to bear in a different way from the other motives. It begins in dis-satisfaction with the existing service, which is the object of complaints and denunciations. Whether well founded or not, these are fomented and multiplied until popular pressure compels the change. This accounts for the strik-ing lack of uniformity and regularity in the process. If it were governed by any fixed principles there would be far more uniformity in its application both in time and in extent. There &quot;is a certain common character in the enter-prises; they are all mature concerns, fully developed and running more or less on routine, and are either monopolies or quasi-monopolies. But the conversion takes place very * irregularly, and all sorts of exceptions and anomalies occur. For instance, the supply of gas is one of the ser-vices which have been most generally taken over by muni-cipalities; but in London it is still in private hands, nor is there any demand by consumers for changing it. Trams are another such service, but in many places they are still provided by companies; in London public and private ser-vices exist together. The same holds good of railways as well as trams on the Continent. Indeed, I do not know of a single service, except the mails, that has passed com-pletely into public ownership. If the transfer were deter-mined by some such condition as the maturity of the in-dustry, or its place in daily life, there would certainly be far greater uniformity.
WHAT IS NATIONALISATION ?  .   &apos; 23 Results of Public OwnershipThere would be greater uniformity also if the benefits ffere definite and well marked. It is, of course, quite impossible here to discuss such a vast and controversial question as the comparative results of public and private ownership; but I have two general observations to make which justify some broad conclusions. One is that once the change is made it is never reversed, so far as I know, people would sometimes like it reversed. The State matches in France are an instance; they are intolerably bad and the subject of universal dissatisfaction. Presum-ably they are retained because it is a matter of finance; and consumers console themselves by smuggling, which is done by common consent by everyone who has a chance. But in general there is no demand for a return to private ser-vices. From which we may conclude that the results of public ownership are at least not worse than the previous condition. On the other hand, we have the slow, partial, irregular, and chequered adoption of public ownership just noted, which suggests that they are not conspicuously better. That is certainly the impression gained from ex-perience by comparing the two, where they co-exist.But whether the change is successful or not, there can be no doubt that the motive for it is the public welfare in one form or another. The benefit of the persons employed in the industry or service affected the benefit of the pro-ducer as distinguished from the consumer has never been ihe motive.CHAPTER IVThe Present ProblemIt has been shown in the previous chapter that the trans-terence of an industry or service from private to public ownership, whether of the State or the municipality, has hitherto been based on the ground of public interest in the form of the military and financial needs of the State or in ihat of direct benefit to the consumer. The principle of promoting the interests of the persons employed in the industry or service is new in practice. And this is the dis-inguishing feature of the present proposal to nationalise :he coalmines.I do not mean that the public interest has been ignored

The principle of promoting the interests of the persons employed in the industry or service is new in practice. And this is the dis-tinguishing feature of the present proposal to nationalise the coalmines.I do not mean that the public interest has been ignored
in the advocacy and investigation of the question. Ti could not be, because such an enormous change, vitally affecting the whole population severally and collectively in many different ways, could not be examined withoul reference to its general effects; and since it can be carried out only by Parliament with the support of public opinion, and has to meet determined opposition on public as well as on private grounds, it is obviously necessary to make out a case which will earn&apos;- the balance of opinion in its favour. The case has, in fact, been laboured at much length on both sides. Nevertheless, that has not been the most prominent feature of the inquiry, nor is the public interest the strongest force making for nationalisation. The problem has been forced to the front by the Miners&apos; Federation. The Coal Commission was appointed to investigate it, not because the Government want to nationalise the mines or because public dissatisfaction with the existing system has called for the change, but solely because the Miners&apos; Federation insisted upon it with so much determination that the Government could not resist. The fact is reflected in the composition and the proceedings of the Commission. I will not say that (he Federation is unmindful of the public interest; but its function is to look after the miners&apos; in-terests, which come first. And the presentation of the miners&apos; case has been the most striking feature of the in-quiry. The need of nationalisation on iheir behalf, to relieve them from present sufferings, has been pressed to the utmost. The hardships of their work and their homes have been held up to public commiseration and contrasted with the ease and luxury of titled royalty owners, who draw large incomes from the mines and do nothing in return.The public have been more impressed by this part of tin case than by calculations of the waste involved in the present system, and I have devoted ihe first two sections of this study to it for that reason. But there would be no mean-incr in emphasising these things unless it implied that the miner&apos;s lot will be improved by nationalisation. Thf miners themselves expect it, and the secondary position assigned to the public interest by the Federation is plainly revealed by their scheme, in which only two seats out oi ten on the proposed Mining Council are allotted to repre-sentatives of consumers presumably to include all in-terests, domestic, industrial, and foreign trade-while Ihe miners themselves are to have five. The proposal dor-, not pretend that the interests arc identical; the separate
interest of consumers is recognised by separate representa-tion, but made conspicuously secondary by the very small representation accorded.Cui Bono?The reconciliation of different interests is the pivot on which any new system of conducting the industry must turn, and its form must depend on the question cui bono?  for wdiose benefit? But the problem is not clearly per-ceived. It is obscured by the campaign against the exist-ing system, which is held up to odium as the common enemy all round, and by the sequential process of trans-forming all the counts against it into merits under the new system. This is the delightfully simple plan on which all Utopias are built. You set out the defects and evils of society as you know it and construct your Utopia by con-verting them, into the corresponding merits and blessings. The advocacy of all sweeping reforms proceeds on the same principle. The evils of the existing system are enu-merated and then exchanged for so many benefits under the new; the merits of the first and the drawbacks of the second are ignored, or rather it is implied that the first has no merits and the second no drawbacks. The Fabian pamphlet on the Nationalisation of the Coal Supply is a very complete specimen of this method. The existing system is presented as an unbroken series of evils from start to finish, without any compensating advantages whatever. It is so defective at every stage that the wonder is that it works at all, and that any coal ever reaches anybody. All the persons engaged in supplying it appear to be bent on not supplying it. They so mismanage their business that pits stand idle, trucks stand idle, and ships lie idle, to the great loss and detriment of the community. There is nothing but loss and waste. But at the magic touch of nationalisation all this will be changed; all-round loss will be turned into all-round gain, and everyone will benefit except, perhaps, a few scoundrelly or incompetent but wholly superfluous persons who have somehow thrust them-selves into the business and contrive to make fortunes by mismanaging it. The characteristic thoroughness with which the argument is worked out in detail has the merit, for which acknowledgments are due to the writers, of bringing out the several interests that will be served by the proposed change. Their shares in the general shower of blessings are enumerated.   But this all-round and simul-
taneous distribution of hypothetical benefits hides the real divergence behind the illusory veil of a fictitious community of interest and obscures the problem.Producers axd ConsumersThe gulf between the interests of producers and con-sumers has been emphasised by the recent revelation thai a progressive diminution of output has accompanied the advances of wages secured by the miners at the cost of the public; and it appears to have startled the Coal Commis-sion. Sir Richard Redmayne connects the two and finds the main explanation of reduced output in high wages. What, then, when they are still higher and hours shorter, as the miners intend that they shall be ? We niusi remember that their demands have not been satisfied, quite apart from nationalisation. The concessions recommended by the Commission were accepted as an instalment pending further inquiry, and in view of nationalisation, which is noi only part of the &quot; national programme,&quot; but is obviouslv intended to ensure realisation of the rest. The present position is that the miners will carry out the strike for which the mandate still stands unless they get what they want. Can anyone reasonably suppose that if they do gel it the result will not be a further reduction in output ? even if the leaders took a more moderate view and were willing to subordinate sectional interests to the general good, tin rank and file have been taught to expect so much and have been so thoroughly educated in putting their own claims first that the process cannot be suddenly reversed. an interesting article in the Railway Review, the organ of the National Union of Railwaymen, of June 6 on nationali-sation, with special reference to the railways which are coming up along the same road close behind the mines contains some instructive remarks which bear upon the point:  for just as men now say they are not going to work their utmost just to make profits for the few, under state ownership they would say they were not going to work their utmost to make profits for anybody and everybody but themselves, for even if they were well paid, they would not be satisfied while somebody got more.I do not know the conclusion to which the writer is leading up, because it is not reached in the article; but lie is arguing that State ownership will not solve the problems of increased production, etc., and I believe that the sen-tences quoted express the truth. An article on the diminishing output by Mr. Hodges, the secretary of tl&quot;
Miners&apos; Federation, and a member of the Commission, in the National News of June 8, points the same moral. He lays stress on the &quot; psychology of low production,&quot; and says of it:  The latter consideration is by far the gravest. It is a question of motive in industry. A solution of all the other difficulties would be no solution for this one.The Motive of Public Service Some advocates of nationalisation rely for the cure of this admitted danger on the motive of public service, and they draw arguments from war experience. But such examples are obviously fallacious. The war was a great emergency which called special motives into play. Men and women gladly gave themselves up to public service, and worked like slaves without thinking of reward, but the chief motives that actuated them were patriotism the defence of their country from a frightful danger and the elementary human love of combat the desire to win, to beat the enemy. These are war motives that ceased to operate with the cessation of war. Even so a great many people had to be stimulated by lower motives, by emula-tion, pecuniary reward, power, uniforms, decorations, and so on, and many others failed to respond to any motive at all. They got as much as they could out of it, avoided all the hardships they could, and did as little as possible. Even in the intense atmosphere of an extreme national emergency the motive of public service bad but a partial and chequered influence. How anyone can believe that it would change the psychology attributed to miners and railwaymen by their own spokesmen passes my compre-hension. Experience furnishes no reason for it and every reason against it. There are men in public services, 1 agree, who work with not less zeal and devotion than in private employment or on their own account; but they are a limited class and they operate under certain conditions. Their work is intellectual, and they take pleasure in it because they are fitted for it; they exemplify the due per-formance of function. But in order to do so they must be free; if not they chafe, lose heart, and either go or become apathetic. They generally occupy positions of authority and responsibility or work in the background, but in com-plete freedom, and they are comparatively few. The typical public servant is a routinist bent on getting through his routine with as little effort as possible. And what in-fluence has the motive of public service on the rank and
wi vi( lout)v(file ? We come into contact daily with them in post offices and they present a noticeable contrast to those with whon: we come into similar contact in private business. Friendli ness and alacrity are replaced by a frigid and repellcn demeanour, which at best is curbed to a weary indifference and at worst expands into positive rudeness. Public ser vice ! They perform it with the air of conferring a favou very much against their will. And we all know the zeal o corporation workmen and their demeanour towards thi public they are supposed to be serving. Tested by ex perience, public service in general has exactly the opposit effect to that claimed by idealists. Why should we expei it to have any other on miners, whose regard for it is show by the present strikes against the payment of income-taxThe Risks of Nationalisation1The point I am coming to is this.   The nationalisatio of the whole coal supply of the kingdom is universal! admitted to be a great experiment, though how great a experiment it is seems to be little understood.   Nothing o the same scale has been attempted in any ordered Stai The transference of an entire industry, so vast and so r portant in so many respects, from private to public own ship at one stroke is something new.   It must be attorn with some risk, and I believe no one seriously denies th, though opinions may differ about the degree of risk, fancy that the Coal Commission is rather acutely conscioi of the risk.   There is at least a possibility that the sic: may not after all be to the public advantage, and that supply of coal  may be not increased but diminish and its cost not lowered but raised.    If that  were happen.the effect would be disastrous to the domestic c sumer in proportion to his poverty, to the great industr and to the export trade.   It would raise the cost of livim paralyse some industries, and depress them all and damn; the financial stability of the nation.   I am not one of the who believe that these things must necessarily happen, n have I been much impressed by prophecies that they wi I have long regarded the coal trade as one that might nationalised.   There are some special difficulties, but l proposition is conceivable, and it might turn out which cannot be said of many others.   That was my when I began to study the question closely.   I tin that there was a risk of failure, but that it might be *
come, and I was inclined to think that it would be. That is not my view now.The conviction has grown in my mind that failure is far more likely than success, and what has led me to that conclusion is the way this demandjjias been brought to the issue with the conflict of interests that it betokens. If the sole object in view had been the common welfare of the nation there would still have been a risk; but it is greatly increased by the dominating influence of the miners&apos; sec-tiona! claims, which have been the effective force in bring-ing the question to a practical issue. If the considerations advanced above are sound, then risk becomes certainty. All the economies promised under nationalisation and I will grant them, though many will prove illusory -will not counterbalance the working of the &quot; psychology of low production &quot; ; and the chances of changing that now or quickly seem very slender, as Mr. Hodges rather intimates.The Case for ReformI have also been influenced by the arguments used at the inquiry. I do not refer to those urged against nationali-sation, which were familiar, but to those on its behalf. They have impressed me by their irrelevancy on the negative side and their unsubstantiality on the positive side; by which I mean that the declared defects of the existing system are all curable without nationalisation, and that the reasons given for thinking it the best remedy are weak, hypothetical and fallacious, if not false. I think the defects are established, but they can all be remedied without running the risks undeniably involved in nationali-sation. Misuse of the power possessed by the owner of the surface to prevent or obstruct the exploitation of minerals could be met by taking the power away, and the royalty system could be brought to an end without inter-fering with the conduct of the industry. Backward methods of working, obsolete appliances, slack or incom-petent management are among the weaknesses that occur in every industry and are daily being remedied as a matter of course; they can be remedied in coalmining. Wasteful competition could be eliminated by organisation, as it has been elsewhere and in other.industries&quot;; distribution might be similarly reformed. The claim of the miners to have more say in the conduct of the industry and the conditions of work can be met, as it will be met in other industries.
Housing and sanitary conditions have nothing to do will nationalisation; the mining population comes under tin same law as the rest, and the provision of proper living conditions for them should be part of the general polin in these matters. One might as well argue that becaus: some theatrical dressing-rooms are wretched holes th diama should be nationalised as that the mines should h because some housing is old and bad.I can see no compelling need of nationalisation in the case put forward nor any grounds for confidence in its effects.   The Commission has converted me from a half, belief in it to a thorough disbelief, and has convinced nil that the public interest would be best served by a thorough reformation of the existing system, which would remove defects and abuses without throwing away the valuable asset of private enterprise which has developed  coal, mining and all our other industries. An unconscious tribute to it was paid, by the way, at the inquiry by those who dem its value and wish to stifle it.   In order to discredit Britisi coalowners and show their lack of enterprise stress \va* laid on the operations of German companies who did whai sorne of our own had neglected to do.   But that was ar example of private enterprise, too, and evidence of ii-value.     The contrast is between British slackness and German energy, not between private and public enterprise and  the cases  cited  show how competition   corrects slackness.The AlternativesBut retention of the present system, however reformed seems past praying for.    The Commission  has alreadi pronounced against it.     Half the members are avowec rationalisers, and the centre, with the Chairman, havi already gone too far in the same direction to retrace tlici steps.   Even if they did it would have no effect on i! miners, who will not work for the owners or with then and that is the deciding fact in the whole business.   When I say the miners I mean the whole body of them as corporate entity.   There are many who would, under fai conditions;   probably  the  majority  in   some  distrins. perhaps a majority of the whole; but those who carry til sway and determine the policy of the Federation will not An attempt to make them would only precipitate a genera strike, and the Government will not face that; though i might be argued that since there will be a general strik
sooner or later under any system, the shortest way out would be to have it now and get it over. Some dispas-sionate observers take this view, but it is hardly practical politics.The practical question, therefore, is what form an alternative system should take in order to get the best results and minimise the risk of failure. I have only space to deal with it very summarily and inadequately. The ordinary bureaucratic Government Department will not do. It is not necessary to dwell on this, because the objections to bureaucratic control are now generally realised. Nor will the scheme of the Miners&apos; Federation work, for the sufficient reason that the technical staffs would refuse to work under it, and they are not less necessary to the industry than the miners themselves. It is to the credit of the Coal Commission that it has not altogether ignored this most important class, as the fashion has been in the interminable discussions on &quot; Reconstruction,&quot; and the innumerable plans for securing industrial peace. How to &quot;bring Capital and Labour together&quot; is the perennial theme, and the only persons considered are the heads of concerns and the trade unions. The technical staffs are never mentioned or taken into account; and when the Society of Technical Engineers put in a modest plea to take part in the deliberations of the Industrial Commission they were turned down with scant ceremony. But this class is becoming more and more &quot; pivotal,&quot; and in some modern industries it is the only one that is really indispensable. The Coal Commission has been well advised to call some mine managers; and it is clear from their evidence that they will no more work under the miners&apos; scheme than the miners under the present system. Indeed, they could not, for the proposed composition of the Mining Council would not give them more than one representative out of ten, if any, and they would be under the thumb at headquarters of the representatives of the men over whom they have to exercise authority in the pit. It would be an impossible situation. But, further, the miners would carry the sway and really control the machine, while responsibility would fall upon the Minister. If, on the other hand, he exercised an effective control, we should get back to a bureaucracy. What remains? The most successful forms of public ownership are (i) that in which the undertaking is operated by private enterprise under a lease; (2) a statutory corporation with autonomous powers.   Examples of the
Printed by Spottiswoode, Bam.antyne 6- Co. Ltd. London, Colcliuster S- Etonfirst are the State-owned Dutch railways, which have been operated by a company since the Government tried and failed to carry them on, and municipal tramways in Ger-many. But for coalmines a statutory body somewhat on the principle of the London Dock Authority or the local railway administration in Belgium, or the federal railways in Switzerland, is, perhaps, the most promising solution. The Coal Council proposed for the new German scheme may furnish some hints. It is to consist of 100 members, divided into four equal groups of twenty-five representing the management, the miners, the consumers, and the State&quot; This scheme deserves close attention, for it is carefulh designed to secure efficiency and to safeguard the publii interest, which are the exceedingly knotty problems tin; Commission has to solve. The best form of nationalisatio; appears to be a statutory corporation with adequate repre-sentation of all interests and large autonomous powers; but that it or any other will do much for the consumer I take leave to doubt. The Miners&apos; Federation has got a strangle-hold and does not mean to let go. It can always threats a general strike.

wrictly Private and Confidential.lA SUGGESTED SCHEME OF RECONSTRUCTION FOR THE COAL MINING INDUSTRY.On October  24,  1916,  at a meeting  of the Parliamentary Committee of the Association, a Committee was appointed to consider the position of the coal trade after the war.   The Committee held several meetings, at which various proposals, including the Garton I Foundation Scheme, the Whitley Report, and other suggestions were I fully discussed and considered.   The Committee came to the conclusion that none of these afforded a sufficiently sound basis for the future conduct of the industry and the establishment of satisfactory relations between the employers and the employed, and it was further relegated to a small representative sub-committee to draw up a scheme for submission to the main committee.   Thereupon the sub-committee set to work, and formulated a scheme which was submitted to the Com-mittee, and by them to the Executive Council of the Association, at a meeting held on the 20th inst.   That meeting recommended that the following scheme be submitted to the districts for consideration.The demand for nationalisation of the mines is being determinedly pressed by the workers. The broad grounds for this demand are diat under the existing system the workers do not receive their fair *liare of the profits of the industry, and that the conditions of employment generally would be materially improved by State ownership and control. The Committee believe that nationalisation would be inimical to the national interest. State control will not secure the highest efficiency either in management or production ; &quot;hile under nationalisation the cost of production will be materially &quot;&quot;creased.In order, however, to secure conditions that will make it possible to obtain the most efficient results in respect of volume and cost of
production and in other ways, and at the same time to remove all reason-able cause for unrest and dissatisfaction on the part of the worker-it is evident that some alternative scheme requires to be adopted.One of the greatest difficulties confronting the industry will 1m the necessitj&apos; of obtaining an increased production to meet firstly the requirements of this country, and secondly to provide iii&apos; necessary export of coal in exchange for our imports of food, rov materials and other commodities. It is not to be anticipated that the cost of production will be materially diminished for some time, and only by larger production per person will it be possible to meet the heavy charges which will necessarily require to bo carried. It cannot lie too strongly emphasised that an increasing output, and an expanding export trade must supply the basis of prosperity for all concerned in the industry.In order to secure such increase in production, the Committee regard it as necessary that employers and employed should work in ;1 spirit of harmony and co-operation, and that the feeling of antagonism which has in inany cases; been apparent in the past should be overcome and replaced by a conviction among all the interested parties that tiny equally with employers are concerned in securing the largest possible output. In order to bring this about, opportunities for full and free discussion of all matters connected with the industry should 1&quot; afforded to the workmen and their representatives, and information should not be withheld from the workmen relating to matters on which a fuller knowledge would enable them to appreciate the difficulties confronting employers in carrying on the business in which both they and the men are engaged. In this way the workmen might ha brought to realise the fact there is, an identity of interest between them and the employers. The matters on which information might be supplied would probably include particulars as to demand and supply in this and other countries, not only of coal but of all the commodities into which coal enters as an important factor determining the cost oi production, and how the price of coal is dependent on these factors, the causes leading to variations in the cost of production, and a
statement of the average district or sub-district selling prices and the costs of production from time to time, the commercial and technical difficulties experienced in management, and the necessity of large production to enable adequate wages and other costs to be met.It is suggested that co-operation could be secured in the following manner: Committees representing the management and the men at the mines could be established which would discuss local difficulties and prevent disputes, and would also have oppor-tunities of obtaining information on general questions. These committees, however, should not have power to arrive at any decision on questions other than those affecting the colliery concerned. Any other matters and any local questions which the pit committees are unable to agree upon might be referred by them to a committee representative of employers and employed in the mining district in which the colliery is situated. In many districts joint committees and conciliation boaids exist at present which could act as the district committees, witli such alterations of their present regulations as might be found necessary to enable them to act in accordance with the scheme.By working in a spirit of harmony and goodwill with the workmen it is confidently anticipated that it will be possible to increase the production to such an extent as materially to reduce the average cost per ton.If these principles were adopted, some scheme of mutual 1 &quot;-operation must be applied.The price obtained for the coal must provide fail&apos; wages for the men, proper remuneration for the best possible management, and a reasonable return on the capital employed.Freehold Minerals. Undertakings owning such minerals will be entitled, in arriving at costs, to include a charge for royalty, according to the class of coal won.
Investments Outside the Undertaking. Investments will tie excluded in arriving at capital values, and the income theiefrom will be excluded from profits.The scheme in its practical application would further develop n follows:  There would be adjusted, for each district, by agreement with tin representatives of labour 1. A standai-d wage for eacli class of labour.2. A method of ascertaining the cost of stores ami materials, rents, ro3&apos;alties, rates, insurances, compensation and other charges.3. Rate per ton to cover cost of management.4. Returns on capital.5. Provision for amortisation.It would lie necessarj&apos; to have a periodical review.For each district or sub-dibtrict the average labour cost per ton would be ascertained by quarterly audits of the colliery books, the average cost of stores and materials, rents, royalties, rates, insurances, compensation and other charges would be similarly ascertained, and also the average cost per ton of management. To these would be added the rate per ton representing interest on capita] and amortisation. The sum of these will represent the average cost of production.The average selling price per ton of all coal sold having been ascertained, a margin will be disclosed between the cost and the selling price, and this will be divisible between the workmen, the management, and capital, in proportion to be agreed with the workmen.When that is done, the workmen&apos;s share of the surplus will be expressed in a uniform percentage addition for the district to the standard rates in operation at each colliery in that district.
wo!Thus each colliery will stand on its own footing, paying its .,.kmen upon their individual standard rates plus the percentages awarded from time to time as the result of the above quarterly ascertainments, and receiving the money realised by the sale of its own coal.The great factor  in  securing  a  reduced  cost  would  be an reased output per man, and under the scheme there is a direct lucement to labour to increase output and reduce cost. The whole scheme is based upon district average results, and the reference to labour is intended to apply to all labour employed at or about the collieries.UKim

(     .    in   i . u       im    imii urn i  tti iri-m--m--1 h-1-1-ttt^In response to a request by the Prime Minister that I should make some constructive proposals to help the Govern-ment to meet their difficulties, and that I should formulate suggestions for legislation in regard to improving the pro-duction and distribution of coals, I report as follows:?;hen consideration is given to any proposals to amend or alter the existing system based on private enterprise, the follovdng bedrock facts should not be forgotten,1.   Before the war the output produced not only met home demands, but enabled a most valuable export.trade to be builtup. *(1883, 16 million tons.    1913, 82 million ton3*)2*   The average profits derived from coal were less thanthose in other staple industries, and did not exceed 9 per cent,and out of these profits provision had to be made for amortis-ationt    A substantial proportion of the profits were reinvest-ed in extensions, developments, electrification, new houses,and thus gave employment to an ever-increasing number of per-sons.(1873, 492,000 persons.      1913, 1,118,000 persons.) 3*   In July 1915, in order to prevent coal prices being unduly inflated, through diminished output consequent on a1 vlarge number of the miners joining the Colours, the Govern-ment passed the Limitation of Coal Prices Act.    This ms followed by Government control of coal distribution, in December 1916 in South TTales, and in Maroh 1917 throughout Great Britain,    The Coal Agreement was made in July 1917 and the confirming Act was /
-   535passed in February 1918.     !Ehis.Aet- guaranteed&quot; to the owners a standard yearrs profits, but their control of bc*tK costs ond^ellin prices was considerably curtailed.4. During the period of Government control many demands made by the miners have been conceded, including a 3/- per shift war bonus and a 2/- per shift Sankcy Award (equal to 30/- per week) and this pay was in addition1 to the existing standard and percentage rates.   The result of these inflated wages - for which the management could not be held responsible., has necessarily produced a general sense of dlsctsiragemont,. which is indirectly reflected in lack of discipline and diminished output,,$* Tender Government control the output per maim per shiffthas steadily dcclincd?.-1907................2M tons per man employed.1909 .................2:S3 tons- per man employed(after the Eight Hours Act)1S13..................2.5$ tons per man employed((Before the War)1918     ................236 tons per man employed(Last year of War)1919*..................2I4 tons per nan employed(Present rote of output) .1920...................1S3 tons per man employed(Estimated.rate after the Seven Hours Act is passed!Shc allegation that the -shortage of wagons and tubs hpsbeen a main factor in the diminution of output has not be err sub-stantiatcd.   I give, as an illustration, a Cfsc where a complaintwas*made of the shortage.of tubs.   The Home Office was asked togive a priority order for 500 additional tubs; it sent the orderfor 50 per cent, more than was asked for, but after the *T50 tubshe,d been delivered, no incrcr-so whatever in the output&apos;resulted./-vA    6. The fr.ct remains that, men have not worked so well for theGovernment as they did under private control; and with high rates of minimum wages conceded by the Sovernment (varying fromabout 12/&amp; to 16/8 per shift) there is nO indueernorft to exertion,as lit four days men can get more pay than meets their needs.
- The question arises, what can be d*ne to i^e^t the si tuation and to secure increased production?It is submitted that from any alteration in the system in the direction of Nationalisation (i.e. by either increased Government control or&apos;the transference of the property- to the State) no better results can be anticipated.The natural    desire fcr a department is to expand and to become important.     Under the Civil Servicedt is impossible to expect that anyone will recommend a reduction in his staff, or that anyone will complain of the shortcomings of his fellow-workers.     It is always easier for a Civil servant to go slow than to speed up, and if Government control of an industry is contrasted with private enterprise no real net economy in production or increase in output can ever be expected. This view is supported by Sir Arthur Duckham.     See Paragraphs VI and XVIII.The evidence disclosed at the Coal -Commission proved, moreover, that mining is so uncertain, the physical conditions and the quality of oc al: varies so much in seams, as well as at collieries and in districts-, that   of all industries it is the least suited to an experiment in Nationalisation.- No reply was made to meet three main contentions of the Coal Owners :(a) That there was nothing inherent in. the coal industry to justify the application of Nationalisation to coal mining in preference to other industries..  (b) That there were so. many other trades, industries (iron, steel, chemical, agriculture, building, shipping, etc) inextricably intertwined with collieries, that it was impossible to nationalise one industry without nationalising all other profit-producing enterprises, and without also inflicting gross injustice.
(c)   That the export trade, for reasons&quot;given &quot;by me inxmy evidence in chiof,   made it impossible for this trade to be conducted by the State.See also paragraph 55* of the five employers who report-ed on June 20, 1919, in which they assert:    &quot;It is impracticaliLe for the State to carry on an export trade in coal.&quot;Apart from Nationalisation opening the door to political influences and electioneering pressure, a Government in the conduct of such an industry,would be under the constant attack and threat of miners, who would unceasingly complain of Ministerial inactivity and the conditions of their employment.It has been asserted, on the other hand, that the present system of private enterprise stands condemned, &quot;but Mr. Justice Sankey and his colleagues came to that conclusion on March 20th, before they had heard the evidence, which proved that any other system was open to still graver objections, and if any of them were adopted the results would be worse.   Defects have been admitted, but the defects can be remedied without resort to a system of nationalisation which is condemned by every business man of repute in the country.Expert Trade.There are two other considerations w^ynationalisation should not be accepted, which I wish the Commission to bear in mind.   One is that it is practically impossible for the export trade to adapt itself to any centralised system.The exporter finds the foreign buyer, arranges conditions of sales (f.o.b. or e.i.f.), and frequently makes himself liable^ for the tonnage and sea freight, and the discharge of the coal at the port of destination, he stands the racket for the difference between the lading weight and the delivered quantify, for the import duties, and occasionally for the sampling and analysis of the coal, he finds the money for long credit., and takes the risk of the foreign buyers1 solvency and commercial probity, often a considerable source of loss, and has to meet the variations in currency which occur between the trading countries.It must be apparent a National Department is quite un-suited to undertake such obligations which are essential to thi9 class of the trade.   Some districts, notably Northumber-land, depend almost entirely in normal times on their export trade, over 80 per cent, of its output being shipped.All exporters I have met aver that if nationalisation is anything like &quot;control,&quot; it spells disaster to our export trade.   And may X add here that I am convinced that until we get rid of State control, such as it now exists, all further enterprise, development and reproductive employment in the industry will be stopped.

the conclusion of my evidence-in-chief &quot;before the Coal Corn-mission.     Sir Arthur Duckham, in his report, of June 20, criticises these proposals in the following words ( Paragraph 121):   They show, he says, &quot;a desire to meet the aspirations of the warlcers ..... but are unacceptable at; they fail to include workmen^ representatives on tho Board of Directors, and there is no unification of collieries in the same district.VIf some of oir Arthur DucfchamVs recommendations, are acceptable to the Government, they must, I think put them forward on their own responsibility without the preliminary approval of either the employers or employed.But I suggest that if the advantages secured by private enterprise, reasonable competition and trade profit are to be maintained, his recommendations IXII fjjx * 22X1, XXXIII and IXX1X, should not be adopted as they stand,   paragraph  2X71 however, which deals with mineral rights, might bo accepted (see also recommendations of the five employers, 63, 77, 78 and 82), and the other recommendations contained in the following paragraphs XL to XLLX, might in substance be a3s o adopted.XXVI deals with the creation of a Ministry of Minos,   I suggest it should be assisted by an Advisory Board as recommended    by the five employers in paragraph 45.XXVII deals with the creation of an area commission.This commission should consider in the first place wither any alterations in existing concerns are desirable, so as to secure better economies and efficiencies.XXVIII is the proposal for unification by districts.^ This scheme apparently contemplates a dividend upoix the capital employed, depreciation, and a reserve fund.   It is presumed that tho selling price of coal would have to.be so regulated as to provide for these outgoings.   There does not, however, appear to be any provision for the introduction of new capital necessary for extensions, new openings,, and generally to keep the industry progressive.* Under this scheme,, if a net loss was incurred during the- period, the shares would a$ ?9-ia&amp;%f&apos;  bo confiscated; this would obviously be unfair.
In my judgment, the application of compulsion to secure unifi-cation should be deferred.. A period, say of four years, should be given to allow such amalgamations to be voluntarily arranged,, as might be suggested by the authorities set up under paragraphs XXVI and XXVII.    I believe amalgamations could be and would be entered into voluntarily.   Where advantages can be shewn there would always be an inducement to amalgamate, and but for the war and apprehension as to the future of the industry, many such amalgamations would have been already promoted, or would now be the subject of negotiations.   To hurriedly force amalgamations is not the way to secure cordial co-operation, or the best results.XXXII confers powers on Government representatives which are ^unobjectionable..XXXIV enables working men directors to sit on Colliery Boards.The leaders will try and secure these positions, but only the men employed should vote for those nominated, and the selection should be made by secret ballot, and the chosen candidate must be in the employment of the Board and have a clear  majority over any other nominee. . I suggest one working man director should be placed upon any Board for any output up to two million tons per year, and two representatives when this output is exceeded..XXXVI creates the machinery for fixing standard wages by the^ Industrial Council..X7XVII creates the machinery for the settlement of all local disputes. .XXXVIII relates to payments being made by results..   This is excellent in theory but most difficult in practice, as many men prefer flat rates and dislike rewards going to their more industrious colleagues.. .XL retains the responsibility of managers...XLI deals with the creation of Pit Committees (see also recommendations Ho... 47 of his five colleagues)..
The adoption of these suggestions would retain all the more important advantages of private enterprise, but at the same time it would concede to.(1)   Labour - adequate representation on :-( a)    Pit Commi ttee s.(b) The Colliery Company Directorate.(c) The Advisory Committee of the  lining Department. (&apos;2)   Consumers :-(a) The nomination of a representative on the various Colliery Directorates.(&apos;! su&apos;gge t that -the consumers1 nominees should be selected by the County Council, one for each Board in the administrative County),(b) Their rights and just claims for recogni-tion through Government officials.(c) In regard to the better distribution of coal, the recommendations of the five em-, ployers, 50 and 51 and xTo. XLV, made by Sir A. BucMiam, might be adopted.(3)   The State - powers and oversight to promote co-ordination of the industry and co-operative action (see Paragraphs XXVI. and 7,7^11) tSuch proposals, moreover, uould meet the case made out for all those economies which can be promoted by unifi-cation, and to which the Government are committed by having adopted in spirit and in letter Hr. Justice SankeyTs First Report of February 20th, 1919\XLV. - Distribution -This relates to household coal, which does not exceed 15 per cent, of the total production (see also paragraph 50 of the five employers)*Finally I recommend an early conference between the Government(Minister of Labour.. President Board of Trade, and the Coal Controller) and representative Coal Owners, as to the steps which should ^ now taken to gradually de-&apos; control, for until control terminates, the output will remain low and costs high;It is also important to re-establish more direct and normal relations between employers and employed; reference is made to this subject by Kr. Balfour and his colleagues in their report (paragraph 20).
&apos;f .7826I have read all the above, and I find that the whole of the Commissioners are agreed only on two things. , First, that there should &quot;be increased output of coal, and second, that it is i possible to get it under the present system.   What has to be decided is, under what system can we get this increased output :hich is so necessary for the maintenance of the industries Upon phich the prosperity of the country depends?    She controversy .4seems likely to range around the question of nationalisation. Jheoretically, I believe in nationalisation of monopolies.   If I thought we should get greater goodwill, increased efficiency, and therefore greater output of coal por man under a system of national-isation, I should support it.   It is no argument against nationali-sation to say that it would remove incentive on the part of the owners, because, as a matter of fact, private ownership has prac-tioally eliminated incentive on the part of the men.   I think it is more important to get incentive on the part of the actual produ-cor than on the part&quot;of the owner.   I have grave doufcts, however, if we can get it by nationalisation,   The men have been deluded into belief that their interests are necessarily opposed to the interests, not only of the owners, but of the State; and although that might disappear in the course of time under nationalisation, I ses no prospect of it disappearning in the immediate) future.   Por that reason, I should not be disposed to risk nationalising all the mines; but I should be disposed to commit ourselves to the disciple of nationalisation, and to adopt some method of experiment ion a sufficiently large scale to be a guide, but not on so large-oale as to involve us in disaster if it should fail.   Sir Arthur Duokham puts forward a report which is .-*t least interesting end suggestive.   He would divide up into 13 areas, amalgamate the interests in each of them, guarantee 4$ to those interests (with ?-possible 6fo) and nationalise any one ;vroup, if the 4$ failed to____hai_This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic ryjajesty&apos;s Government.W A R   OA 3 1 N B T . THE COAL COMMISSION REPORTS. Note /by Mr.Gr.H,Barnes.
produced and had to be made up in four successive years ? of seven. A fatal objection to the last suggestion seems ? me to be that the men, if they new that nationalisation was only to come by reducing output, night be inclined to reduce it. ? in the meantime, the nation would suffer.  Why not adopt ? Arthur Duckham&apos;s proposal of 13 groups and nationalise one ? them? Both nationalised and unnationalised mines might be ? under unified control with all the benefits to be derived therefrom; but the bulk of them would remain under the Duckham theme. That is the direction in which I should be disposed to go. ? should buy out the minerals, set up joint control, and at the ?ame time promise nationalisation of a group at the end of three ?ars. The arrangement with the men might include, and I think ? should include, over the whole area some provision against sudden stoppage. But there might be a differentiation in regard to those conditions, as between the nationalised and unnationalised areas. The men in the nationalised area should agree to work until discussion of any disputes had taken place locally and ?ationally, and I am not sure but what they should also be asked to further agree to some arbitration in the event of failure to agree after such local and national discussion. The men in the unnationalised areas might be left their freedom to strike if they thought proper after discussion locally.

Our difficulty is the keen feeling there is on both sides in regard to nationalisation. We cannot satisfy both; but if we came down solidly and firmly in favour of experimentation, we ?ould satisfy ourselves at all events that we had done the right thing, and gone as far as the tremendous interests involved would justify us in going.

- ORGANISATION Off TKB COAX INDUSTRY Hote by Si,r H. Llewellyn Smith-.The attached outline scheme for the better organ-isation of the Coal Industry of Great Britain is based on the assumption that it is not considered possible or expedient either to revert to the pre-^ar conditions or to*establish a centralised bureaucratic management of coal mines by a State Department.    It is also assumed that Recommendation IX * of the first report of Justice Sanke^e Commission has been definitely accepted by His Majesty^ Government.    The scheme embodies with some modification several of the featyjree of the reports of Justice Sankoy and Sir Arthur Duekham but it differs from both of them in certain important features.It proposes to unify the coal mining undertakings, not nationally but in districts of suitable site and to vast them in statutory corporations constituted by scheme in each mining district.The duties of tho Central Authority in regard to the Coal Industry would be essentially duties of supervision in the public interest, rather than of direct management or control.It is proposed that the Biatriot Boards should be composite bodies representing both consumers and producers, but that they should be essentially public bodies not working for private profit.    They would, in fact, partake fcrrely of the character of eo-operative undertakings with a large representation ef the consumers Sir Arthur Duo khan.1 s so homo under which tine District Control would still lie with the existing shareholders, would not, it is thought, be satisfactory from any point of view.It is unavoidable under any scheme of compulsory consolidation that a certain measure of financial responsibility shall fall upon the State, but, in framing the present scheme, it has seemed preferable that this responsibility should take the form of direct partioip-ation in the risks of the business rather than of any 4 State guarantee.    *&apos;ith this object it is proposed that the existing private interests shall be bought out completely by tho issue to thorn of Government stock, advanced for the -purpose by loan to the District Boarde but that ag betveen the Stato and the Distriot Boards there should be a profit sharing arrangement, the return to the State consisting of a minimum rate of interest together with proper, provision for amortisation, and half of any surplus pro fits **  The following- is the recommendation referred to:-&quot;Sven upon the evidence already ^ven, the present system of ownership and working in the ooal industry stands oon-demned and some other system must be substituted for it, either nationalisation or a method of unification by national purchase and/or by joint control.&quot;Mr. 3onar Law1a acceptance will be found in Hansard for 20th March, Column 2340fl)
Although for the sake of clearness, the outline scheme is worked out in some detail, it must he emphasised that it is merely tentative and personal, and liable to considerable modification in the light of criticism.    It is not the result of any consultation with the interests concerned, and must not be regarded as tin any ^ay representing the views of the Coal Mines Department of the Board of Trade.(Initialled)   H.ICUS.23.7,9.OUTLINE SCHEME for the ORGANISATION of the COAL INDUSTRY.(l) A Cantral Authority for Coal Mines tobe established, either in the f rm of a Statutory Co^l Commission responsible to an existing Department of State (on the analogy of the Electricity Coazaission proposed under tho Electricity Supply Bill), or, alternatively, of a separate Department under a Minister of Coal &amp;ines.

the coal produced in the district;   of persons employed inCoal Mines;   and of persons possessed of technical and commercialknowledge and experience of Coal Mining.Note:-    The first District Boards will necessarily be in part nominated (like the first Port of London Authority) since there will be no other means of securing representation of consumers.    Hfrantually it mav be possible to establish some method of electing these representatives on the basis oj a register of purchasers of Coal (like the register of payers of dues under the Port of London Act), the voting power being so adjusted as to prevent the large consumers swamping the small ones, Tarious experimental scales&quot;of voting power according&apos; to purchases have been attempted for the purposes of illustration,, but at the&quot;present stage it is thought desirable to leave all this detail to be worked out after local enquiry by the Coal Commissioners so as to suit varying local circumstances.   There is no need for cast iron uniformity in the composition and&apos;mode of selection of the members of District Boards, so long as it is clearly laid down in tha Act the consumers must be adequately represented&apos;Whatever method of selection be adopted it is probable that the interest of the domestic consumer and tho small industrial user will need to be specially -Safeguarded, and possibly this mi^ht be effected o-y giving the County and Borough Authorities within the district the right to appoint by agreement one representative on the District Board^in respect of uhese interests.(3)    The Centre! Authority to acauire at a fair valuation all rivate rights in respect of Coal &quot;(as recommended unanimously y the Coal Commission).    Private owners to be paid in Government Stock, find the royalty char.ee made by the State to the District Boards for tha use of the National Coal to be adjusted so as to provide for the interests on the stock, together with a sufficient sinking fund and margin for insurance.     This ciarge to be included in working emenses*     The administration of Coal Royalties to be vested in tie Central Authority which will have its own staff cf valuers and agents and will estaolish local agencies for the purpose independent of the District Coal Boards.Note:-    It has been suggested that in the case of mining districts in ?Mch housing and other SSSfiSSare bad a certain Reduction should be Fade from the purchase prjee of Coal rights to be allocated el the Boyalty owners; contrxbu^ ticn to a special fund for. emeliorating these conditions.    There is much to be said -for such a proposal which is quite consistent
witlrtho present scheme.   The relation of the.. Ameli^ition fund and its administration to Ns . arri local Housings schemes generally would require care: exploration.   There is little doubt that bad housing conditions are a fertile source of discontent,and oad. social relations in the Coal Mining industry in certainareas.undertakings with-v ) to passshall(0in anyinto the poSowwcompensate the disoossessed Owners in manner hereinafter provided, pending the settlement of the Compensation the District Board to., continue to guarantee to the Owners the -profits secured to them under the present Esergency legislation.&quot;Note:-The precise demarcation &quot;between the undertakings that shall and shall not be acouired by the District Coal Boards is sure to present &quot;considerable nractical difficulty,i tentatively it is suggested that:-(ii/   Coal Mines which are nearly auxiliary to other industrial undertakings and which do not produce   &quot; coal for sale to the public should not be acquired.(d)  Coal Mines of which the product is partly con-sumed within the undertaking and partly sold to the public should be dealt with iji their merits, the principle being- that if the bulk is internally consumed, the Goal Kines should be left as part of the undertaking, and all surplus coal should be sold to the District Coal Board at the current price fixed.   If. on the other tend, the bulk of tho &quot; Coal is sold to the public, the Mine should be acquired by the District Board.(c)  In certain cases (but it is hoped not in mmy) it may be necessary for the District Coal Board to acquire the whole of a composite undertaking if the severance of the Coal Mines from the rest of-----    , ........ lesby such expedients as releasing the Coal Mines on conditions&quot;to the former owners.   On no account should the District Coal Board be allowed to carry on other industries than Coal Mining (except the raising of minerals such as ironstone which occur in connection with coal mines).(d)    he Coke Oven and by-product business should be separated from the Coal Mines and either left to its present owners or re-leased to the.4*   The Dis^Tic-; Ooal Boards sh6uld(at present&apos; at all &quot;even tt have aothi:&apos;]g to do with the utilisation of Coal, but11101*677 *&apos;     &quot;* ^&quot;^^     &quot; i r\vn    o-nri , r\th its extraction and &quot;sale.,e)    Tnere should be a special Arbitral Tribunal preferably the same which determines compensation) ;b settle m disputed cases whether any particularCoal Mine should&quot; be acquired by a District CoalBoard.

The salt prices of coal to be fixed by each District Board, subject to the provisions of irtiole (12) as to undue preference, and also subject to the right of any Local Authority or recognised Association of rianufaoturers, Traders or Coal users to appeal against unreasonable prices to the Central authority.   The Central Authority will also bo empowered under &amp;rtiole (fi) to order a District Coal Board to raise its prices in tho event of its being unable to meet its obligations.^Alternatively, the standard price of coal (or changes in the standard prioe) might be fixed periodioally (as in the case of Wages under Article 8) by a Central prices Conference with tha approval of the Central Authority, tho District Coal Boards being retjuired to keep thoir prices within (say) 5$ of tho standard so fixed exoopt by special permission or direction of the Central Authority.   Tho syctem suggested above, however, viz. freedom to the Distriot Coal Board to fix prices subject to certain definite safeguards in tho public interest is more elastic and avoids unnecessary intor-ference by the Central authority J-
(8) General - changes in the Standard rate of wages in Goal ;lines to &quot;be settled periodicall^r-flub^e^t to-the approval of the Central Authority &quot;by a Wages Conferenoe, consisting of ose person repre-eentd^g-Cr^aJL &quot;tiners and one person represent-in g &quot;lanagement selected by each District Board.The District rates of wages must not, without the special authorisation or direction of the Central Authority, diverge from the standards so fixed by sore than (say) 5 per cent,(9)   The Distriot Coal Boards&apos; share of any surplus profit to be applied (within oertain limits) pari passu for develop-meat a*d improvement and for the benefit of employees. There might be power to raise the rates of pay of employees (up to a maximum of 10 per cent above the standard rates), or to benefit tho employees in other ways up to an equivalent amoulJv   Any surplus still remaining to be applied for pur-poses of development.(10)    If in any year the Distriot Coal Board is unable to meet its working expenses and to pay the minimum interost of 4 par cent on its loan and the contribution to sinking Tund, the Central Authority to be empowered to require   the Distrlet Beard to raise the price of coal and, si+uultanoous-ly, to decrease the rates of pay of its employees in the same proportion (within a maximum of 10 per cent above or below the standard rates), the increases and reductions to continue to operate until the deficiency and arrears are made good.(11)   Baoh District Coal Board to render to the Central Authority such periodic returns and other information as may be required, as to oosts, output, etc. and to give all facilities&apos;to the Central Authority for inspection and for obtaining information as to the working cf the District,   .(12)   Tho Distriot Coal Boards to take steps for tho constitution of Looal Fit Councils of an advisory oharaoter (as reoommended in paragraphs ZLVI and ZLVII of Justice Sankey&apos;s Report, paragraph 47 of the Coal owners1 Report and paragraph ZLI of Sir A. Duckhan^s Report). They should TQpresent the workers and the management in equal proportions, and be conoorned with looal questions of well being, conditions of work, safety and health, causes ?/hioh restrict out-put, oto.(13) -The Central Authority in oonsultation with the Ministry of Labour to consider at onoe what modifications in tho existing machinery for dealing withwiges and dispute questions, both distriot and looal are rendered neeessary by the scheme. Justice Sankey&apos;s proposal for the prohibition of strikes unless and until all means of negotiation looal and central have been exhausted to be insisted upon, (see paragraphs L, LZIY and LZXII.)Note;-   it soems clear that some Joint Wages andConciliation machinery representing work or s and management in equal proportion will still be required, in addition to the Distriot Coal Boards, (whioh will, in effect, bo the employers), though tho language of tho Sankcy Report suggests that he intended the Loeal Distriot and National Councils to deal direct with labour questions.
This however, would not, he satisfactory, as it would inevitably lead to an irrtstible demand to give tne Miners half the seats on the District Board, which would exclude the Gensumers altogether and make a  body quite unsuitable for management. The best reply to the Miners&apos; contention (see their separate report) that their representation on the District Boar&amp;t should be increased is to set up joint machinery (on which &apos;      they shall have half the seats) to deal with questions of wages and disputes.Justice oankey&apos;9 proposal as to strikes is in substance to embody in all contracts of employment an under talcing not to join m a strike until the question in dispute has teen dealt with by the appropriate local district *nd national Authorities.    The Labour Representatives made a reserfelJtion on this point, and it is probable that the Miners&apos; Pedljitian -will not willingly submit&apos;to any restriction on the right to strike.    On the other hand, the proposal of Justice Sasn$ey involves an extremely mild form of restriction against unauthorised strikes, and would strengthen the hands of the Miners&apos; Federation in dealing with recalcitrant members. It would, of course, have no effect whatever in preventing a national stoppage in pursuance of a deliberate policy of the Federation and it is therefore easy to exaggerate its importance.    But it is desirable as a matter of principle and as a precedent- for other industries that may hereafter bo nationalised, (e*g. railways) to incorporate the recommendation in the present scheme.(14)    Provision to be made for prohibiting undue preference on fcht part of District Goal Boards as between different customers or classes of customers in the supply or price of coal*    A Tribunal which might perhaps be the Bailway and Ganal Commission with enlarged powers to be authorised to deal with complants of undue preference.Rotft:- It is essential that Districts Boards which willpredominantly represent local interests should not be ableto give preference to local customers and thus oenalise such n$non-producing areas as London and the Uouth of Sagl&amp;nd generally,,    On the other hand, to insist on maintaining the same price for coal for export as for home consumption, rna^ result in enormous profits to the export mere loan t, so long as the present very abnormal conditions of world coal supply and demand continue, and the existing restrictions on export are maintained.    Justice \Jenkeyfs; Beport proposed to meet the difficulty by providing that all profits of exporters above one shilling per ton shall be shared equally&apos;with the district Board.    This would diminish but not extingui&apos;e&apos;fi excessive profits of private exporters.V/e must expect strong representations from foreign countries, e.g. France, if what will be regarded as practically -a.State organisation attempts to maintain a   substantial - -difference between inland and export coal prices to the advantage of home industry.    &apos; he difficulty is only a transitional one, since the difference between the home price and the price obtainable for exoort depends essentially on the maintenance of export restrictions.     -.7hen normal con-ditions return the diffijbslty will disappear.    If, however the proposed District^ Boards, are established and m working before   export restrictions have ceased, it will be necessary to adopt some transitory scheme to avoid excessive prof&amp;t-eering by private interests in the export trade.     This may either be Effected (partially]) by Justice Sankey&apos;s scheme of storing excess profits, or I by some other method of temporary control.    The onession needs further exploration       , in consultation with poal &quot;experts at 8 lcter stage.
