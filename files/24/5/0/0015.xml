[This DeenraeBt is&quot;the Property^ His Britannic Majesty^ Government]Printed for the War Cabinet   July 1918.SECRET.G-215.REAFFORESTATION.Report by Lord Ctjrzon and Mr. Barnes.1. A SUB-COMMITTEE of the Reconstruction Committee was appointed in July 1916, &quot; to consider and report upon, the best means of conserving and developing the woodland and forestry resources of the United Kingdom, having regard to. the experience gained during the war.&quot;The sub-committee reported in favour of the creation of a new Central Authority to control forestry in the United Kingdom (Cd. 8881). To this proposal strong objection was offered by the Minister of Reconstruction and the Secretary for Scotland (G.-189 and G.T.-3433). It was, on the other hand, powerfully supported by representations received from the leading Forestry Societies and experts (G.T.-3319). In these circumstances the War Cabinet referred the matter to us for consideration and report (W.C. 411, Minute 17) *2. We have held four sittings, and had the advantage of hearing the views of the Ministers whose departments are chiefly concerned, and of representatives of the Boards of Agriculture and the Development Commission. Lord Lovat, Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, Major Courthope, and Mr. Acland (who acted as chairman of the Sub-Committee), have also given us valuable evidence.3. We confined our enquiry to the one important question on which there appeared to be a fundamental divergence of opinion : the constitution and functions of the future Forest Authorities.As stated above, the A eland Committee (with the exception of one member) reported in favour of setting up an entirely new Central Department to inspire, direct, and control the forestry policy of the United Kingdom. This was deemed to be an essential condition, if any bold and consistent policy was to be successfully pursued over several generations. Forestry in recent times has been assigned to three separate agricultural authorities, each independently responsible through a different Minister to Parliament, The result has been the absence of any large forestry policy, aud a tendency to subordinate the claims of forestry to those of agriculture. The Committee urged that a central authority, entrusted with adequate funds, would be able to distribute its resources with a single eye to securing the greatest possible return of timber, and would be less amenable to local or political pressure. A long continuous programme was essential to any sound forestry development, and it was therefore desirable that, once such a policy had been started, it should not be subjected to frequent and capricious revision. &quot; The authority, like the trees, must have a chance of striking deep root.&quot; It was therefore proposed by the Acland Committee that Parliament should be asked to provide a block grant sufficient to cover the work of the first ten years, the cost and result of each year&apos;s work to be annually communicated to Parliament by the Minister representing the new Department. The chief executive officers of the department would be Assistant Commissioners in England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively, and for the purpose of maintaining close relations with agricultural interests there should be set up Consultative Committees on which, among others, the Boards of Agriculture and the holders and owners of land should be represented.4. This policy was earnestly pressed upon us by Lord Lovat, Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, and Major Courthope, whose great knowledge and wide experience of practical forestry problems cannot be questioned. Mr. Acland and Professor Bryner Jones (the Agricultural Commissioner for Wales), also strongly supported it, and Mr. Prothero admitted that in the abstract it was the proper course to follow, though he feared it might not be found practicable in view of the opposition from certain parts of the* It had been referred on the 6th March to Lord Milner aud Mr. Barnes, and Lord Ourzon took Lord..... . &apos;
United Kingdom. Expression was given to this opposition by the Secretary for Scotland and by Mr. J. R.&quot; Campbell of the Irish Department of Agriculture.5. Mr. Munro represented that Parliament had in 1911 definitely decided to assign the direction of Scottish agriculture and.forestry to a board located in Scotland. Any attempt to reverse that decision, to repeal the forestry clauses of the 1911Act, and to deprive the Scottish Board of its forestry functions, would be regarded by the public as a vote of censure on that Board, and would meet with strenuous opposition from both political parties, from the agricultural press in Scotland, and from such important organs of opinion as the &quot; Scotsman &quot; and the &quot; Glasgow Herald.&quot;Mr. Munro denied the charges of slackness and inefficiency which had been brought against the Scottish Board. The forestry side of the Board only dated from 1913, and it had been provided with neither the money nor the men required for a big policy, but in the preliminary tasks of education, research, and survey, considerable progress had been made with the limited funds available, and with a staff seriously depleted by the war. He was certain that under one and the same Board justice could be done to the claims of both forestry and agriculture, and it was important to maintain the closest relation between them.It was only with considerable misgiving, Mr. Munro assured us, that he had been able to accept the compromise put forward by Dr. Addison, according to which the Central Forestry Authority would be a new section of the Development Commission, while executive, action would continue, as at present, in the hands of the three Agricultural Authorities. Even this, he feared, would meet with some opposition from the Scottish Members of Parliament.6. The evidence given by Mr. Campbell on behalf of the Irish Board of Agriculture followed much the same lines, with the addition that, since its formation in 1899, the Irish Department of Agriculture, apart from its work in education, research, and survey, had acquired, and was dealing with, some 15,000 acres of land in connection with its forestry schemes, a figure which would probably have been greatly increased had not the war broken out.The Department had already laid the foundation of State forestry, and it had a well-defined Forestry Section which could count on the co-operation of the agricultural organisation in facilitating the more rapid development of forestry schemes so soon as funds were provided. The experience of the last fifteen years had shown that extensive forestry operations in Ireland could only be accomplished by an authority fully acquainted with local conditions, able to co-operate with the Estates Com-missioners and the County Councils, and to co-ordinate public and private interests. Mr. Campbell would prefer complete Home Rule, but, failing that, he thought an extended branch of the Development Commission (which should include Irish representatives) would be a not unsatisfactory compromise. Its functions as regards Ireland should be limited to advising the Treasury upon schemes submitted to it by the Irish Department, to whom should be left the execution of the work.7. It will thus be seen that the official representatives of Scotland and Ireland are prepared to accept the administrative compromise put forward by Dr. Addison, but that the remaining authorities whom we consulted are unanimously of opinion that a much bolder solution, involving the creation of a new central authority with control of policy and finance, and with, if possible, a separate forestry service subordinate to it, should be adopted.8, If we are to recommend to the War Cabinet what we regard as the best solution, with a view to the inauguration and prosecution of a definite, far-reaching, and continuous scheme of afforestation for the British Isles in the future, we have little hesitation in preferring the broad general outlines of Mr. Acland&apos;s scheme to the more cautious proposals of the Minister of Reconstruction, admittedly framed on grounds of political expediency, and with a view to conciliate national sentiment and disarm formidable opposition. The proposals of the Acland Committee seem to us to have been carefully devised with the object of providing the maximum crop of home-grown timber in the near future, and ultimately of making the country very largely independent of foreign supplies. The Committee were deeply impressed, as we have been, with the timber situation, which has been revealed by the war. For lack of reserves at home a very large proportion of our tonnage has had to be used to import timber at an enormously enhanced cost, while serious inroads have been made on such stocks as were in the country. Major Courthope informed us, on the basis of a newly completed census, that all large blocks of mature conifers are likely to be exhausted before the end of 1919, that of pitwood there is only six and a half years&apos; supply, and that the South Wales coalfields, which consume one-third of the total pitwood, can
only be supplied after overcoming considerable transport difficulties. We agree with. the Committee when they say that had our statesmen, even thirty years ago, shown equal foresight with the French Government, most of the timber required for the Welsh coalfields could have been grown on the Welsh Hills, and there would have been a very considerable saving, both in land and sea transport, if the bulk of the timber which this country has sent to France during the war could have been drawn from the sandy heath lands of which there is so large an area in East Anglia, Surrey, Hampshire, and Dorset.   (Report, pp. 26, 38.)9. A Forestry Department established in this country on the lines of that set up in France or in India, and charged with the control of policy, finance, personnel, education, and research, would, we believe, work a vast improvement in a single generation. We can see no reason why such an authority need involve the creation of a large and expensive staff or of a new Ministry (though it should, in all probability, have a spokesman in Parliament), or of an unduly centralised Administration. It should be compatible with a wide devolution of executive and administrative powers to the various parts of the United Kingdom, since it is only natural that Scotland or Ireland, not to speak of England and Wales, should wish the local work to be carried out for the most part by local men. Such a central authority would be far more likely to be free from those political influences of which, in the course of our enquiry, we have heard so much, and Avhich are alleged to have produced the lack of confidence in the Scottish Board of Agriculture to which emphatic testimony was borne by some of our witnesses. Above all, a single Administration under a central authority is, so far as we can see, the only means by which a strong and efficient forest service, such as exists in France and in India, can be created in this country, providing an adequate field for promotion and securing an interchange of the best men. With three independent forest services the same results can never be expected.10. Whether if such a central authority were erected it should be a new and entirely independent body, or whether, it should be grafted on 5to an existing organisation, we find it difficult to say. It was represented to us that the existing Development Commission has not done much for forestry either before or during the war, that it has too many interests to serve to be able to devote close attention to forestry, that it is at the mercy of the Treasury for such funds as it may be willing to devote to that object, and that its Forestry Section does not carry widespread confidence. For these reasons we should ourselves prefer to see an independent body set up, and that is the recommendation that we make. But if it be decided to utilise the Development Commission, then we think that the branch of it which is henceforth to be charged with the care of forestry should be greatly strengthened, and should he given a considerable measure of financial independence. Whichever it be, care should be taken that it is representative of all parts of the United Kingdom, so as to satisfy the legitimate local sentiment to which we have more than once referred.11. As to the constitution of the administrative and executive bodies in the different parts of the United Kingdom, who would be charged with carrying on the general policy, determined by the central authority, full regard should be paid to local feeling and experience in their composition. We were not. convinced that the interests of forestry and agriculture are so inseparably intertwined that a Board of Agriculture alone can do justice to both. On the contrary, there seems to be some ground for the belief that Boards of Agriculture are apt to place the claims of agriculture before those of forestry. In any case, where land is partly suited for planting and partly for cultivation, we can see no reason why, the division between the two having been made upon expert advice, the two should not coexist each under its own administration. The. ideal solution therefore would be that there should be forest departments or branches in each part of the United Kingdom, acting under the general orders of the central authority.12. On the other hand, the Secretary for Scotland foreshadowed grave oppositior if any attempt at a centralising policy were pursued, and if the Scottish Board of Agriculture were deprived in the smallest degree of the authority which it at present enjoys. The two rival pictures of this department which were placed before us were indeed irreconcilably contradictory ; and we came to the conclusion that personal and political considerations had engendered a heat which we were not fully competent to understand and were wholly powerless to allay. In Ireland the Board of Agriculture seems to have started upon its career without arousing so much prejudice ; although there was evidence that it had been to some extent swayed by political considerations.13. Attaching. supreme importance as we do to the creation in any case of a central authority, we recommend that it should make such arrangement in the different
parts of the United Kingdom as it may think desirable. Absolute uniformity may not be essential. The central authority may decide to employ the existing Boards of Agriculture to carry out its policy,- subject to inspection by officers appointed by itself. Or it may prefer to create new bodies for the purpose. We think that the Government would be well advised to be guided by its opinion in the matter. In the case of Scotland, Mr. Munro assured us that public opinion was almost unanimously on the side of the Scottish Board of Agriculture. On the other hand, Lord Lovat and his friends, whose views are shared by Sir R. Munro Ferguson, one of the greatest authorities on the subject, assured us that so long as forestry is left to that Board no real advance can be expected, and produced powerful evidence in support of that contention. 14. Our final recommendations are therefore as follows : (1.) That a Central Forestry Authority be created, preferably an ad hoc body, but, as second best, a special branch of the Development Commission, in either case to include representatives from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales ;(2.) That local bodies or branches be set up in the four parts of the United Kingdom to carry out the policy of the Central Authority, or, failing this solution, that the existing Boards of Agriculture should, as regards afforestation, be subordinate to and should work in co-ordination writh the Central Authority;(3.) That the Central Authority should, be set up by the Government on the advice and with the assistance of Mr. Acland, Chairman of the Reconstruction Sub-Committee.;(4.) That a block, grant covering ten years be passed through the House of Commons for the purpose of launching an. afforestation policy ; and(5.) That a Parliamentary Secretary should be answerable to Parliament for the new, authority, and should issue a statement at least once a year.15. Our attention was called to one feature of the Acland Report which has been ignored in the proposals of Dr. Addison. This is the suggested grant to private landowners to encourage them to bear their share in the national task of reafforestation:. To the landowner this cannot possibly, in the vast majority of cases, be a remunerative undertaking. On the other hand, even a modest subvention such as has been proposed; would be money well spent by the State, inasmuch as it would encourage the idea of co-partnership between the private owner and the State, would lead to a much more rapid and scientific scheme of replanting by the former, and would give the State a prospective lien upon the produce of the- land so planted. When it is remembered that 97 per cent, of the existing woods in the United Kingdom are in private hands, as.well as;nearly the whole of the lands suitable for planting, and the great bulk of the expert foresters, the advantages of co-operation are so obvious as to need no emphasis at our hands.16. The decision of the Government on all these matters is awaited with no small-anxiety by large and important sections of the public ; and we feel that it should not be arrived at except with the full authority of the Cabinet.   Hence this Report.C. of K.G. N. B.July 1, 1918.o
