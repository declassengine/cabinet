TEEMS OF REFERENCE.AT a Conference of Ministers, held at 10, Downing Street, on Monday, February 17, 1919, it was decided that the Minister of Reconstruction, with the full authority of the War Cabinet, should examine the whole situation of Unemployment and the State of Trade, and report to the Prime Minister in the course of the next few days, as to the best way in his opinion to remove the various difficulties and obstacles, and restart the machinery of Trade. Pending the further decision of the War Cabinet, Sir Auckland Geddes would have power to give decisions. In the meantime, the Board of Trade should actively continue their present policy of relaxing control where feasible.
-   198SECRET.UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE STATE OF TRADE.I.METHOD OF THE ENQUIRY.1. I have endeavoured to arrive as speedily-as possible at considered decisions with regard to the position of trade and industry in the country and to the action which can usefully be taken by Government to stimulate both. I have examined carefully a great number of official documents and reports of committees. I have discussed the matter informally with business men and with representative workmen, and I have held a series of conferences of Ministers and officials. It has not been possible to cover the whole ground, but throughout I have endeavoured to select subjects for examination which might not unfairly be regarded as typical. In the result I believe 1 have reached a sufficiently accurate appreciation of the position to enable immediate action to be taken, and this appears to me likely to be more helpful than to prolong the enquiry until it can be said that the whole field has been surveyed. To do so would take months.II.CAUSES OF THE PRESENT STAGNATION.War Strain.2. I find there is widespread stagnation both in trade and industry and that the causes of this are complex. The first and most obvious cause is psychological. Ministers, officials, employers, and employed-all are showing the effects of war strain in a certain lassitude.   This, it may be hoped, is a passing phase.Uncertainty.3. It is coupled with a sense of impending change. We have heard so much of the new and better Britain that the people await a sign. Employers do not know whether it is to be heralded by confiscation of capital, by nationalisation of the great industries, by a marked increase in income-tax, or by the imposition of some new form of taxation. The workers expect that it will be inaugurated by new houses, less work, more wages, or a combination of all three. These uncertainties will pass when the Budget statement is made to Parliament, and as the Bills designed to secure improvement in the lives and conditions of the workers are published.4. Added to these there&apos; is acute anxiety concerning future Government action affecting foreign trade, overseas markets, prices of raw material, &amp;c.5. Still to be added are impatient and unreasonable demands on the side of labour associated with &quot; lightning strikes,&quot; and on the side of capital a tendency to interpret agreements in an illiberal and niggling spirit.6. Finally, among the psychological factors there is a feeling of instability naturally arising from the transitional character of the international situation.Bolshevist and German Propaganda.7. Among the less intangible factors is propaganda, now being carried on in this country in the interest either of the Russian Bolshevists or of Germany. This links on the one hand with industrial unrest, but is definitely revolutionary. On the other hand, it is fostering the natural difficulties of our foreign relations. I understand that all possible steps are bemg taken to combat this propaganda.Limitations on Capital.8. Clearly and definitely, however, one of the greatest difficulties of the moment is for industries and trade to find the capital, necessary for their re-establishment, within the limits imposed by the Treasury. The position requires to be discussed in some detail.Note. Reference is made at the end of paragraphs of the Report- to the relevant Appendices: thus, App. 11,4; XXIII; XXIV.
III. FINANCE.The Wage Problem.9. The general financial position of the country is one of great difficulty. Daily expenditure on war services is still very high, only about 1,000,0001. less than it was at the end of October. It is impossible to reduce it materially until normal trade restarts without producing widespread hardship and destitution. It is equally impossible for normal trade to be resumed without large capital sums being made available The dilemma is obvious. The solution must be to reduce Government expenditure on war services at such a rate that the sum of the wage element in the reduced expenditure and the increased wage payments on account of new civil business remains constant.1.0. There is a further factor to be taken into account. Government reconstruction schemes, e.g., housing, are approaching the point at which they will demand considerable expenditure. This expenditure from the immediate financial point of view is similar in kind to war expenditure, and therefore enters into the problem, which, in its complete form, is to keep constant the sum of the diminishing wage element in war expenditure, including unemployment benefit, plus the increasing wage element in reconstruction expenditure, plus the increase of wage payments on account of the new civil business(App. Ill, 2a; IV, 8.)Control of Capital and the Rehabilitation of Trade.11. The need of stabilising in this way the weekly payments to the wage-earning classes adds to the difficulty of the financial position, and undoubtedly is retarding the rehabilitation of trade. If the Treasury were in a position to cease borrowing to meet its residuary war expenditure and had not to find money for reconstruction, it could, with advantage, end its control of internal capital issues, though it would still require to maintain its control over the emigration of capital. As things are, the control must continue, but equally that control must be highly intelligent, rapid in decision, and of such a character that it is not suspect by commercial men.[&apos;2. This is absolutely vital.- If the Treasury fails to develop a control of the nature indicated, the rehabilitation of. trade will be delayed and priceless opportunities lost.1 3. I therefore recommend to the War Cabinet that it be an instruction to the Chancellor of the Exchequer :-(I.) That he should spare neither labour nor expense if, through either, he can establish a control over capital that shall be intelligent, rapid in decision&apos;, and accessible.(2.) That he should, through reasonable publicity, secure that full information as to the procedure of the control is readily available to the public.(3.) That the policy to be adopted should be to allow the greatest possible amount of capital to be devoted to business development consistently with meeting the essential expenses of the State, which must continue to have first claim on the resources of the country.Inflation.14. Apart from control over capital, business is hampered by the fact that working capital has fallen in real value by approximately one half as a result of the existing infla-tion. It is impossible immediately to get rid of inflation, even if it were desirable. Rapid deflation would certainly lead to a sharp fall in terms of currency in the wages it would be possible to pay. The social results, in the present^ temper of the country, would, in my opinion, be disastrous. The difficulty of finding an immediate solution for the business problems arising from inflation is therefore extreme. During the transition period, while war expenditure is still heavy and profits from overseas trade have not yet had time to accrue, I recommend that it be an instruction of the War Cabinet to the Chancellor of the Exchequer :  (App. XL)(l.) That he delays action designed to secure deflation.(2.) That, if need arise, he even permits a slight further inflation to develop, which would have been necessary if the war had continued to Midsummer 1919, as was at one time deemed to be not unlikely.I further recommend :-That the situation with regard to inflation be reviewed in six months&apos; time.
Foreign Exchanges.15. I have considered the question of continuing the artificial support which is given to the Foreign Exchanges. Such support must be regarded as of the nature of a temporary expedient devised to meet exceptional conditions, and the real decision to be taken is not whether it should be continued, but for how long. The Conference (vide Minutes of the 8th Meeting) were unanimously of the opinion, in which I concur, that from the purely commercial point of view it has ceased to be sound in so far as it is now undoubtedly delaying the recovery of normal trade. Its continuance, if it is to be continued, must be justified by the social, political, and economic factors which enter into the problem.It is clear that one result of supporting the American Exchange is, in effect, to subsidise the American exporter of goods to this country ; whereas, if the Exchange is allowed to find its own level, British exports to the United States will be benefited. Analogous arguments apply in all cases in which the rate of exchange is artificially maintained.On the other hand, it must be remembered that a serious fall in the American Exchange would correspondingly increase the sterling price of American foodstuffs. Unless special steps were taken, such as the grant of a subsidy on all American food-stuffs, this might produce a serious reaction on the domestic situation. Moreover, as the Canadian Exchange is likely to move in sympathy with the American, any advantages we may secure as against the United States by ceasing to support the Exchange will also adversely affect Canada.I request an early decision from the Cabinet Whether the political or other advantages of the policy of supporting Foreign Exchanges outweigh its manifest commercial disadvantages. (App. VIII, 4.)Taxation.16. The position with regard to taxation is also hampering industry. There is no doubt that the 80 per cent. Excess Profits. Duty has had the effect of making it extremely difficult for industry to accumulate sufficient capital to meet the turnover from war to peace, and to finance the initial stages of resumed trade. There is also no doubt that the tax is very uneven, in some cases unjust, in its incidence. I have had an opportunity of discussing this matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and of hearing the views of Lord Inverforth, Sir Albert Stanley, and Mr. lllingworth, and I believe that the tax proposed to replace in some measure the Excess Profits Duty will be less hampering to industry. After careful consideration, I agree that a partial announcement as to the nature of the impending change of taxation would, by producing further uncertainty in the mind of the business community, tend still further to hamper industry. (App. V, 2.)17. I therefore recommend to the War Cabinet :-That no announcement of the Governments intentions with regard to taxation be made in advance of the full Budget statement, but that this be made on the earliest possible day.Settlement of Government Accounts.18. Another unfavourable influence on the present difficuIt business situation is the great delay which Departments of Government are allowing to occur in settling their accounts with the traders and manufacturers of the country. This is or should be an avoidable evil, and I recommend to the War Cabinet: That it be an instruction to all Departments immediately to take steps to pay their bills, in full if possible, but if in any case that be impossible, to pay a very substantial proportion of each bill on account. (App. IV, 11.)Government Assistance to Industry.19. Bequests are continually being received from industries for Government financial assistance in restarting their export trade. Sometimes this assistance is asked for in the form of bounty ; sometimes as a concealed bounty in the form of an allowance equal to the increased cost of production estimated to be due to transitorv war conditions ; sometimes as a guarantee against loss to middlemen ; sometimes it is disguised as a request for Government orders (Government to make the loss on ultimate
sales); sometimes the suggestion takes the form of a request for cheap capital. Applications of this kind are difficult to deal with in view of the fact that the State is paying large sums in unemployment benefit and it is argued, not unreasonably, that the amount distributed in unemployment benefit would be sufficient to rehabilitate the trade while giving full employment to the workers. (App. V, f ; XII.)20. After full consideration of the good and evil which might flow from such assistance, I recommend the War Cabinet to decide : (1.) That the general rule shall be.to withhold direct assistance from industry, except in those cases in which the Government itself requires goods, but that in such cases it should place orders freely to the full limit of its requirements.(2.) That it should appoint an Inter-departmental Committee of the Treasury, the Board of Trade, the Foreign Office, and the Ministry of Munitions to examine all such requests, and that, if direct assistance from the State is necessary in any case other than those in which orders are placed for goods which Government itself requires, it should take the form of a bounty on export, limited in amount to the cost which might otherwise have fallen on the Exchequer for unemployment benefit to the workers.(3.) That if any bounty is granted the conditions attendant on the grant should be published in full.21. The assistance which can be given by Government to trade and industry by the removal of existing restrictions which have survived from the war period is con-sidered in a subsequent section of this report (see below paragraphs 43-56). I need only refer here to the enormous importance of doing everything possible to recover and develop the entrepdt trade, which was one of our most valuable commercial assets before the war, and to the recommendation on the subject which I make hereafter.Financial Risks due to holding Stocks.22. Another aspect of the financial problem has already been presented to the Cabinet in the report of the Committee appointed by Dr. Addison to enquire into the financial risks attaching to the holding of trading stocks. There has been an almost unexampled rise in the prices of raw material during the war, and the reaction which was expected to foliow the close of hostilities has already set-in. Traders feel that it will extend and rapidly become intensified, and that the selling price of manufactured goods will fall in sympathy, without regard to the fact that the raw material of which they are made was bought at war values.   The resulting losses may be great.23. Concessions have already been made by the Government which give partial relief, and, after careful consideration, I am not prepared to recommend further action, although I fully recognise the great difficulties which confront the trader.,   IV.GOVERNMENT MACHINERY FOR DEALING WITH TRADEAND  COMMERCE.Government Departments concerned.24. There are seven Government Departments or sub-Departments actively engaged in trade questions: The Board of Trade with its subsidiary the War Trade Department.The Foreign Office with the Ministry of Blockade and the War Trade IntelligenceDepartment. The Overseas Trade Department. The Ministry of Munitions.After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that the control of our commercial and trade interests by so many departments is radically unsound in principle. The Report of Lord Haldanes Committee on the Machinery of Government indicates clearly that one Department, and only one, should be primarily concerned in rendering a single service to the State. The violation of that principle in this case not only hampers administration, but, as will be seen, tends to confuse policy.
25. In my opinion, much of our present difficulty in getting overseas trade restarted is the direct result of the complexity of our central machinery for dealing with commercial questions. Now that it is probable that the Board of Trade will lose many of its important functions to the Ministry of Ways and Communications, there is, 1 believe, an excellent opportunity presented for transforming it into what may be called a Ministry of Commerce. Such a Ministry must not be a machine which merely administers regulations, but a Department responsible for the formulation of our Trade policy, consciously doing all in its power to stimulate internal trade and to foster and develop our commercial interests within and without the Empire. Obviously the Ministry of Commerce would be separate from the Foreign Office, ahd from the Ministry of Munitions (or Supply), in so far as the latter is concerned with producing and purchasing articles required by Government Departments. (App. Ill, 1.)I therefore recommend : That the Board of Trade should absorb, not only the War Trade Department, but also the Overseas Trade Department and the War Trade Intelligence Department, and that it should take over from the Ministry of Supply, and from Departments, such as the War Office, which have functions to hand over to the Ministry of Supply, the control of raio materials that are held on Government account, but which are required by our manufacturers and traders to re-establish their businesses.26. It appears to me that all questions concerning the Consular Service, commercial attaches, &amp;c, belong primarily to the Ministry of Commerce, but clearly such services are also of the greatest interest and importance to the Foreign Office. Again in accordance with the principle laid down, in the Machinery of Government Report, I recommend : That some joint machinery, possibly of the nature of a Standing Inter-departmental Committee of the Foreign Office and Board of Trade, should be established to control these services.27. In this manner I believe the present advantages which arise from the existence of the Overseas Trade Department will be,retained, and the main disadvantages of its existence as a quasi-independenf department obviated.Government Control of Stocks of Material.28. At present, the Government is more directly involved in the conduct of business than ever before. It holds large stocks of many important materials and similar stocks of many others. The general policy to be followed in regard to the disposal of these stocks has been carefully studied, and I recommend : (1.) That the general policy to be followed by the Departments which hold or contra stocks of material is : (a.) To endeavour to force dowm the price of each material to a leve not higher than the anticipated normal post-war price of the material.&apos; (b.) As a safeguard while prices -fall, to retain sufficient reserves of each material to enable the Government to defeat any attempts at a hold-up by merchants.(c.) In the case of any commodity the price of which falls to a level below, the anticipated post-war price, to raise the price gradually as the stock in hand dwindles, from the point to which it has been forced to the level of a fair post-war price.(d.) Where agreements permit, Departments disposing of stocks of material to discriminate if possible in favour of British users. The amount and nature of the discrimination to be determined by Ministers responsible. (App, I, 3 ; II, 1 ; IV, 10.)(2.) That if in any case the general policy cannot be rigorously followed because of conditions attaching to the holding or disposal of stocks, the underlying intention to provide British industry with cheap raw material is to be accepted as the guide in all departmental action. [1312] * C
(3.) That detailed questions relating to the supply of raw material for the United Kingdom shall no longer be dealt with by the Raw Materials Board, but by the Board of Trade, and that, if it is necessary for the Raw Materials Board to continue in existence, its functions should be confined to substantial questions of Imperial policy regarding raw materials so far as the Dominions and Colonies are concerned ; otherwise the Boar-d shall be dissolved.(App. I, 2.)I may add here that I have carefully reviewed the whole series of controls imposed by Government Departments during the war. The great majority have now been, or are in course of being, removed. Those which, as for example in the case of certain articles of food, it is still necessary to retain for a time will be carefully watched with a view to their early abolition. The precise position is fully set out in Appendices VII, XVI to XXI.     * (Cp. also App. XIII to XV and LI1I and LIV.)Material for State Services.29. A further point in this connection is . the supply of material from State supplies for State services. It appeared in the course of the enquiry that the Post Office was delaying putting in hand certain contracts in order to await a fall in the price of metals held in large quantities by the Ministry of Munitions. Directions have been given which will obviate such delays in future, but I call attention to the urgent necessity of co-operation between all Departments of State in matters of this kind. (App. Ill, 2a.)Co-ordination.30. Another instance of defective co-ordination that was brought to mv notice was the action of the War Office in fixing the price of wool for a considerable period without any reference to the Board of Trade, This is clearly wrong, and I advise the War Cabinet to record a definite decision:   (App. V, 7.)That no action shall be taken by any Government Department in regard to stocks of material held by them Without consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, except on the direct instructions of the War Cabinet.31. A series of minor questions which have considerable administrative importance sbouM also be dealt with at once.Office Accommodation for Trade Departments.32. The first of these is the question of accommodation. The fusion of Trade Departments which I have recommended will not be effective unless the unified Ministry is housed as far as possible under one roof. At the present time the Overseas Trade Department is distributed in several different buildings at a great distance from the administrative centre in Whitehall, and much time is wasted in journeying between one branch and another. If we are to have any approach to efficient administration this defect must be cured. Similar considerations have arisen in connection with other Departments, and it is clear that this matter must be com-prehensively dealt with. I therefore recommend that the War Cabinet instruct the First Commissioner of Works : That in allocating accommodation to Government Departments he is to establish a definite order of priority based on urgency of service, in which a very high place must be given to the Trade Departments. (App- III, 1.)Postal anl. Telegraphic Communications.33. The next question in this series is the improvement of the system of postal aud telegraphic communications. Serious complaints are being made of the delays in business correspondence, whether by letter or by cable, and there can be no doubt that this is a subsidiary cause of the present difficulties in placing orders abroad. It has been stated that Government Departments are partly responsible for the existing cable
Tcongestion, as they are in the habit of using their priority for comparatively unimpor-tant communications of excessive length. The use of codes would greatly relieve the pressure, and I think the time has come when the use of private codes might be permitted, at any rate so far as non-European countries are concerned. The views of the Postmaster-General on this subject are set out in a memorandum attached to this Report (Appendix XXII). \ ...     (APP- 5^34. I therefore recommend that it should be an instruction of the War Cabinet to all Departments concerned : (1.) That they consider forthwith how far the use of codes can be allowed ; and (2.) That they reduce their cable messages as much as possible, both with regard to .the number of messages sent and the number of words employed.Travelling Facilities for Business Men.35. It is of urgent importance, in the interests of our foreign trade that rhe facilities afforded to business men for foreign travel should be improved. Many such men, who occupied important positions at the foreign centres of British trade, returned to this country during the war for military service and are now being demobilised. There are many others whom British firms in this country desire to send abroad as commercial travellers.   Both classes are finding great difficultv in securing passages.&apos; &apos; .        &quot; &apos; (App. II, 5 ; XXIV.)36. As regards the return overseas of the demobilised men I find that difficulties which ought not to have arisen have been caused by the condition into which the Repatriation Record Office at Winchester has been allowed to &quot;fall. I understand that steps have been taken which it is&apos;hoped will remedy this highly unsatisfactory state of affairs, but I am not convinced that everything possible has yet- been done, and I recommend :-That the War Cabinet direct the Army&apos; Council to give their immediate attention to this matter. (App. XXIII.) -37. Apart from this administrative breakdown, there is no doubt that on certain sea routes, more especially those to the Cape and to South America, there is congestion due to lack of accommodation. This affects more particularly the ordinary civilian commercial traffic, and I find that it is being aggravated by the absence of a strict system of priority, which should in present circumstances be based on the commercial interests of the nation.38. I recommend the War Cabinet to instruct the War Office and the Ministry of Shipping : That such arrangements should be made as will ensure priority in obtaining passages to persons vouched for by the Overseas Trade Department as travelling in the interests of our foreign trade, both in regard to the accom-modation at the disposal of the War Office for the repatriation of demobilised soldiers and to the passenger accommodation in the hands of the shipping companies.Passports and Permits.39. I find that persons wishing to go abroad have suffered considerable incon-venience owing to delays in obtaining the necessary passports and permits, and it is clear that some simplification of procedure is required. These delays have been partly due to the inadequate accommodation of the Passport Office, but this has been rectified. Another cause is ignorance on the part of the public of the passport and -permit regulations.   This must be taken in hand at once.[App. II, 4 ; III, 1; XXV ; XXVI.)40. I recommend that it be an instruction of the War Cabinet to the Foreign Office :-To give full publicity to their requirements with regard to the issue of passports.41. Complaints have been brought to my notice of the inadequacy of the arr&amp;nge-ments at the Permit Office.   I advise the War Cabinet:-       (App. II, 4 : XXVI.)To instruct the Army Council to direct its attention to this matter
42. The general impression produced by a survey of the Government machinery for dealing with Trade and Commerce is that there is a lack of energy, imagination and appreciation of underlying general principles which is doubtless due to the impossibility in present circumstances of securing a unified higher control.OVERSEAS TRADE.Imports: Main Lines of Policy.43. The main lines of the policy which should be followed as regards imports are clear. It is agreed that raw materials of all kinds should be freely imported, and the same is true of such partially manufactured articles as are, in effect, raw materials for some of our industries. As regards manufactured articles, the case is different. British industry is not, and cannot for some time, be ready to produce on a peace basis in competition with the industries of other countries which have not been dislocated by the war. It is, moreover, necessary to shield for the time industries shown by war experience to be pivotal, and those which, like dyes and optical glass-making, have originated or been specially developed during the past four years.(App. II, 3; IV, 6; XXVIII.)44. Finally, the difficulties of the international financial position require the exclusion in most cases of articles of luxury, the purchase of which abroad would exhaust credits required for obtaining necessities.Imports from the Dominions and India.45. Complaints have been made of the basis on which imports from the Dominions and India are admitted, and the discussion showed that these are not altogether unfounded. The question arose specially in regard to Canada, where the year chosen for a basis was one in which Canada was at war, while her chief competitor, the United States, was still at peace. This matter has been considered by a sub-committee, and I agree with their recommendation :  (App. II, 3 ; IV, 3 ; V, 5 ; XXVII; XXVIII.)That no import restriction shall be or continue to be imposed on goods coming from any part of the Empire without the consent of the War Cabinet, which will not be given unless some unforeseen necessity arises.46. With regard to imports from foreign countries, so great a concession cannot be made without seriously damaging both our international financial position and our home manufactures.I accordingly recommend to the Cabinet: (1.) That all raw material shall be admitted free of restriction.(2.) That semi-manufactured materials which are necessary as material for themanufactures of this country shall be admitted free without restriction,j ..... .except so far as they are produced by industries which it is essential to foster in this country, and which require shielding, in which case they will be restricted.(3.) That manufactured articles shall be subject to restriction when not necessary for consumption in this country ; or when produced by industries which require to be shielded from foreign competition while re-establishing them-selves; or while passing from war work to peace work ; or which have been created or encouraged to expand owing to circumstances arising out of the war. The restriction to continue for a period not extending beyond September 1st without a further decision from the Cabinet.(4.) The Board of Trade to take steps to consider what shall be done to maintain in the country industries which it is the policy of the Government to foster. This policy shall not be limited to existing restrictions. .       (App. V, 6.)Paper.47. The particular case of paper has attracted attention recently, and it was discussed in detail at the conferences which I have held. It is a leading example of a manufactured article which forms the basis of other industries, and, in principle, its free importation is desirable.   The difficulties which had to be met were that, while it
is easy to import large quantities of cheap manufactured paper from abroad, the price of pulp is being kept up against us. particularly by Sweden, and that the removal of restriction was likely both to cause some hardship to British paper manufacturers and to affect unfavourably the Swedish exchange. After an exchange of views between the Treasury, the Board of Trade, and the manufacturers, these difficulties have been overcome, and, as already announced to the public, it was decided :-That the restrictions on the import of paper and paper-pulp be relaxed to the extent of allowing imports up to 75 per cent, of pre-war imports, and that this arrangement should have effect until the end of April next, when all paper control should be abolished.       (App. II, 3 ; IY, 4; Y, 3 ; VII, 4 j.)Timber.48. The position as regards timber is that there is a shortage for certain purposes, such as joinery, railway wagons, and railway sleepers.. The Government holds large stocks in the United Kingdom and foreign ports fur rough carpentering, and the difficulty as regards railway sleepers is being eased by the return of sleepers from France. The control of hard woods was removed at the beginning of February, and I understand that the President of the Board of Trade proposes to remove all control on importation by the end of March.   I recommend that :-After the 1st April timber should be dealt with as a raw material in accordance with the general recommendation in paragraph 46 above.(App. VII, U; VIII, 1.)Export: Difficulty of removing Restrictions.49. The interests of the export trade, which is vital to the Empire, would best be served by the removal of all restrictions. I am convinced that we must advance as rapidly as possible in this direction, but there are serious practical difficulties, the chief of which is the necessity of maintaining the machinery of the blockade&apos;in working order until peace is secured.(App. I, 4; II, 2; V, 5 ; VI, 3, VI, 7 ; VIII, 4 ; XXIX to XXXVII; L; LI; LIT.)50. The first step that should he taken is the obvious one of making sure that the commercial community is kept fully informed of the situation, of the reasons for the restrictions which are imposed, and, above all, of any relaxations which from time to time are allowed.Publicity.51. It does not appear to be clearly understood, even in commercial circles, that many restrictions on our exports are due to action which foreign Governments like ourselves are forced to take, for financial and other reasons, to limit their imports. Nor again is it sufficiently realised that there is already a wide field for unrestricted exportation. My attention was called to a resolution passed on the 24th February by the British Chamber of Commerce for the Turkish and Balkan States which showed that the Chamber was unaware of the fact that restrictions on trade with Turkey and our other former enemies in South-Eastern Europe had already been removed. (App. Ill, 1 ; V, 6-7 ; VI, &apos;2.)&quot; 52. I recommend that the Cabinet instruct the Board of Trade : (1.) To take steps to makesit widely known to British traders that the obstacles in the way of exporting goods do not necessarily arise from export restrictions enforced in this country,.but rather by reason of the import restrictions enforced by the foreign countries concerned ; and,(2.) To establish a system of publicity whereby British traders at home and abroad are kept regularly and promptly informed of any variation of the restrictions which this country may find it necessary to enforce.Restrictions on Exports to Countries outside the Blockade Area.53. I have carefully considered the restrictions on export which, in present circum-stances, it will be necessary in the public interest to maintain, with the object of reducing them to the minimum, and I recommend that : In the case of exports to countries not included in the blockade area there shouldbe no restriction, except as regards  [1312] D
. (1.) Goods required for naval and military purposes. (2.) Goods which are or will be required for home consumption or home manufactures.(3.) Goods which are or have been directly or indirectly benefited by a subsidv or guarantee.(App. I, 4 ; VI, 3 ; VI, 5 ; VI, 7 ; VIII, 4.)^Restrictions on Exports to Countries within the Blockade Area.54 In the case of exports to countries which are included in tbe blockade area I rind that no general line of concerted policy has yet been agreed upon by the Departments concerned, and I make the following recommendations to the War Cabinet: (1.) The restrictions set out in the previous recommendation in paragraph 53 should apply.(2.) The Departments of State concerned should establish efficient contact between themselves for the purpose of preparing, after adequate discussion and consideration, the details of proposals affecting exports to the blockaded area, which are to be pressed by British representatives on the appropriate Allied bodies controlling; international trade.(3.) The general policy by which they should be guided in settling these detailed proposals should be :  (a.) The inclusion of the maximum number of manufactured articles in the Free List.(o.) The inclusion of the maximum number of other manufactured articles in List C..(4.) * In general it should be regarded as in the interest of this country to remove restrictions on exports to neutral countries in the blockaded area, full consideration being given to the fact that it will take from one to three months for any material quantity of manufactured goods ordered by a neutral after the removal of blockade restrictions to reach Germany. (App. LV.) (5.) Special consideration should be given to the question of restoring the re-export trade, which, before the war, was most important and highly valuable, and gav3 direct and indirect employment tolarge numbers of people. In particular, the Treasury and the Board of Trade should immediately consider whether the restrictions on the re-export of unrestricted imports, such as cotton, cannot be removed.&apos; (App. I, 4 ; VI, 5c ; VI, 7B ; VIII, 4 ; XXXVII.)55. I have considered the question whether the prohibition on trading with firms on the &quot; Black List &quot; should not be withdrawn, but, as at present advised, I am not prepared to recommend that any action should be taken. (App. VI, 6.)Export of Railway Material.56. The case of railway material and rolling stock was brought to my notice in connection with restriction of exports. Early in January an announcement was made to the effect that all restrictions on the export of railway material were removed. At a later date a further announcement was made, limiting the removal to second-hand material. This incoherent action checked production and caused embarrassment and annoyance to the trade, more especially in view of the fact that no valid reason was adduced against the export of this commodity. This incident appeared to me to be a conspicuous example of the defects in our administrative machinery relating to trade, to which I have drawn attention above (paragraph 42), and I decided : That all restrictions on the exportation of railway materials, including rolling stock, whether new or second-hand, or on any commercial transaction regarding them, should be removed forthwith, and that immediate steps should be taken to give effect to this decision.(App. I, 4 ; IV, 5 ; XXXVIII; XXXIX.)Development of Empire Trade.57. From a general review of the possible overseas markets it is clear that, ifour commercial prosperity is to be restored, much depends upon a great development oftrade within the Empire.   I would direct attention to a decision of the Imperial War* As a result of recommendations arising out of the enauiry, the Supreme Blockade Council ,in Paris decided to deration the northern neutrals to a large extent.   (App. LV.)
Cabinet that, in making their purchases, Government Departments throughout the Empire should give preference to British traders, both as regards price and terms of contract.   This principle should be followed also by local authorities and by the Crown A o-ents in their purchases on behalf of the Crown Colonies. 8 (App. I, 4; IV, 9: XXVIII; XL.)VI.HOME PRODUCTION AND TRADE.Necessity for the Development of Internal Production.58. Overseas trade is a vital interest of the Empire, but the utmost developments which are possible at present will not in themselves be sufficient to bring about the revival of trade and industry and the consequent expansion of wage payments which is required. British firms, owing to the sacrifices they have made in the war, will not, for some time, be in a position to compete on level terms with their foreign competitors ; world communications and trade connections have been completely disorganised, and cannot be immediately re-established. Many of the countries which would afford a market for our exports have been ruined by the war. it is therefore vital for the nation to develop. home production and trade. Opportunities will be offered by the Government reconstruction work, particularly the Housing Scheme, and by the arrears of public works which have accumulated during the war.(App. I, 3 ; II, 3 ; III, 2 ; IV, 6 ; IV, 8; V, 4; VI, 5a.)The Housing Scheme.59. The Housing Scheme is the most conspicuous, as well as the most urgent, item in the Government programme, and it is of the greatest importance that there should be no avoidable delay in the provision of sites and materials in anticipation of the com-mencement of actual building operations. It is evident that progress has been retarded by discussions between the Treasury and the Local Government Board on questions of finance. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recognises the necessity of finding money for housing, but I understand that this has not actually been made the subject of a War Cabinet minute, and I think a decision should be formally recorded that: The money required for the Housing Scheme should be given the very highest degree of priority by the Treasury.      (App. Ill, 2g ; IV, 8 ; XLI; XLIi.)60. Some hesitation on the part of contractors is being caused by uncertainties as to the possible reimposition of controls of materials which have been recently withdrawn, and I recommend : That the Board of Trade should arrange for an announcement to be made in the press that if, in regard to building and building materials, it should prove to be necessary, owing to unforeseen circumstances, to reimpose any restric-tion, no contract entered into before the reimposition of the restriction shall be affected. (App. IV, 8.)61. So far as I have been able to gather from the discussions which have taken place, no provision has been made, either in the Housing Bill itself or in the proposed machinery for carrying out its provisions, for systematic surveys by Government experts of such areas as counties in regard to the actual needs for houses. I think it is very necessary that there should be such a provision, in order that the houses which are to be built shall be intelligently distributed in accordance with ascertained needs.62. In view of the decisions taken at the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 4th March it seems unnecessary to add anything further on this subject or as to Land Acquisition or Land Settlement. (See War Cabinet 539, Minutes 1 and 2 ; War Cabinet 540, Minute 1 ; War Cabinet 541, Minutes 1-3.)Land Drainage.63. As regards Land Drainage, there can oe no doubt as to its desirability or that it would absorb an appreciable amount of unskilled labour. The dilemma that arises is that private owners of land are not in a position to carry out the necessary work entirely at their own expense, while the proposals of the Board of Agriculture to assist them involve a contravention of the principle that private persons should not be enabled to improve their property at the public expense. (App. Ill, 2d.)
Afforestation.64. The control of Afforestation has been removed from the Board of Agriculture and is at present in charge of an interim authority. A Bill has been drafted for placing this Department on a permanent footing, and it is very desirable that a decision should be arrived at as soon as possible, since re-afforestation is an important part of the reconstruction programme and would provide a large amount of employment.(App. Ill, 2e.)Public Works.65. Apart from the Housing Scheme there are many complete plans for carrying out works of public utility all over the county, most of them postponed from the war period, involving the expenditure of many millions of pounds. Some of these are under the control of Government Departments such as the Office of Works and the Post Office, but the majority are in the hands of the Local Authorities, and include such undertakings as waterworks, tramways, sewerage, hospitals, schools, &amp;c(App. Ill, 2a ; XLVI; XLVIII.)66. It is obvious that the carrying out of these works-which in many cases is a matter of urgent public necessity is not only desirable in itself as part of the reconstruction of the country, but is certain to stimulate both trade and employment.67. The limiting factor is, of course, finance, and I recommend that: It should be an instruction to the Treasury, the Departments of Government responsible for expenditure on State undertakings, and to the Local Govern-ment Board in so far as they control the expenditure of Local Authorities, that the allocation of the money available for such purposes should be guided by a comprehensive policy framed in accordance with the urgency of the services required and with a view to securing the greatest possible volume and variety of employment.To give effect to this recommendation I requested the President of the Local Government Board to prepare schedules classifying the works in accordance with their employment value (see Appendix XLIII), and I have arranged with the Treasury that the Local Government Board should sanction loans set out in their Category A up to a total of 6,000,OOOL without submitting individual cases to the Treasury. (For the terms of the Treasury Letter, see Appendix XLV.)&apos; (See also App. Ill, 2a ; IV, 8 ; XLIV ; XLVI.)VII.CONCLUSION.68. The broad result of the enquiry has been to demonstrate that there has not been a clear, coherent Government policy with regard to trade. The effects of this have been aggravated by administrative inco-ordination. The complexity of the central machinery has already been described; there can be no doubt that it clogs the efficient working of this most important branch of the Public Service. I do not believe that there can be any permanent improvement until the President of the Board of Trade assumes full responsibility for all the functions which properly belong to a Minister for Commerce and works in the closest possible co-operation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The leading features of what should be our immediate commercial policy are indicated in the recommendations which I have made. In summary, so far as the rehabilitation of business activities is concerned, it is imperative that we should secure the maximum of freedom with the minimum of delay. Undoubtedly by far the most hampering of the controls which remain is that governing capital issues. As has been pointed out it is clearly necessary to control the emigration of capital, but, in so far as internal enterprises are concerned, provided the weekly wage aggregate is maintained approximately constant, there is room for doubt as to whether fairly free new issues would in fact add to the difficulties of the Treasury. Analogous considerations apply to the restrictions which it is still necessary to maintain on overseas trade. An early peace is a paramount British interest, if only because without it British imports and exports cannot in the near future be wholly freed from controls. As things are, and until peace is signed, a certain measure of restriction is unavoidable. But a heavy responsibility falls on those whose duty it is to administer the necessary regulations, for, if they exercise their powers unwisely, they may damage the basis of our national prosperity beyond repair.A.

1. The Chairman stated that as a result of a Conference of Ministers (G.T.-6835) held under the Presidency of the Prime Minister on the previous day, he had been authorised to examine, with the full authority of the Cabinet, the whole position relating to unemploy-ment and the present state of trade, and to report to the Prime Minister as to the best way of removing the various existing diffi-culties and obstacles in the way of restarting the inachinerv of trade. With that object he had summoned the meeting so that it might be ascertained what Government machinery there was avail-able for assisting industry, or, on the other hand, what Government machinery there might be in existence which was inadvertently hindering the re-development of industry.Eaw Materials: 2. The Chairman raised the question as to the position in regardPiaw Materials to flaw Materials.Colonel Amery said that the War Cabinet had appointed a Board of Ministers (known as the Raw Materials Board), with the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. Walter Long, as Chairman, ex ojjicio, to consider with the Departments directly concerned with the supply during the war of each of the raw materials referred to in the resolutions of the Imperial War Conference, 1918, what action was necessary in order to provide that the necessary supplies should in fact be available for the United Kingdom after the war, and to arrange for such administrative action, beyond what had already taken place, as was necessary to secure such supplies. Lord Milner had now assumed the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies, but had not yet had any opportunity of taking up actively the duties of Chairman of the Board; and it was understood that Mr. Long was willing to remain associated with the Board, if desired. The Board of Trade had suggested that detailed questions relating to the supply of raw materials for the United Kingdom, which did not raise any substantial question of national policy, could now be best dealt with by that Department in direct consultation with any other Department which might be concerned, and a draft memorandum for submission to the War Cabinet had been drawn up in the Board of Trade embodying this suggestion and also recommending that the Raw Materials Board should be continued only as a Committee to determine any large question of policy which might arise, especially m regard to schemes for the development of Imperial resources. In view, however, of Lord Milner&apos;s absence in Paris, no consideration had so far been given to this proposal.The Chairman enquired whether the functions of the Board were co-ordinating or executive.Colonel Amery replied that the terms of reference, which he read in full, showed that the functions of the Board were both co-ordinating and executive. The Board had taken decisions, which had been communicated to the Departments concerned, with instruc-tions to give effect to them.The Chairman raised the question as to the necessity for the Control Raw Materials Board remaining in existence. He pointed out that it originated with the idea of advising on raw materials purely from an Imperialistic point of view, and had for some reason or other taken executive? action in regard to raw materials from all points of view. He was of opinion that the Board should be dis-solved immediately, and that all matters in connection with raw material should be dealt with by the Board of Trade, who were willing to deal with them, and who were the proper Department for doing so.*Colonel Amery strongly deprecated the dissolution of the Board, and asked that a caveat on behalf of Lord Milner should
-   205Raw Materials: 3. The Chairman then enquired what machinery was used by theGovernment Stocks.   Ministry of Munitions in regard to raw materials.Mr. Larke stated that the Ministry of Munitions dealt with ferrous and non-ferrous materials, and that large stocks were held by the Ministry. There was an Interdepartmental Committee of the Ministry known as the &quot; Raw Materials Committee,&quot; dealing with the question, and the Ministry of Munitions were in process of liquidating their stocks. The policy of this Raw Materials Committee was to follow the world&apos;s prices, and that if these prices fell the Ministry would accordingly lower the prices of their stocks. This was so that competitors might not get the advantage of cheaper raw materials. Mr. Larke then, in reply to a request from the Chairman went into detail in regard to the stocks of the t various articles which the Ministry of Munitions held.   He said thatthe stocks of copper and spelter amounted to about eight months&apos; supply, the stock of brass to approximately three years&apos; supply, and . * the stock of lead amounted to two and a-half to three years&apos; supply. The Ministry were not holding stocks of tin. Mr. Larke explained that the policy of the Committee was not to break the market, but to follow the world&apos;s prices closely without giving any lead to a fall. They realised that if the bottom price could be found, the ultimate result might be recovery of the market and a rise in prices. He said that they were anxious to avoid speculation in raw materials, and that this would follow if they unloaded stocks too quickly. They were endeavouring to place the articles with the users.The Chairman enquired whether bringing the price below the American prices had been considered, and Mr. Larke replied that it had, but that it had not been done for the reasons he had stated.Lord Emmott said that he did not see why the articles should not be sold to speculators. He thought that, on the contrary, it would be a good thing to do, provided there were sufficient stocks retained to readjust the market if it became necessary to do so as a result of the speculators&apos; operations.Mr. Larke having given details of other raw materials which the Raw Materials Committee dealt with, and having explained the constitution of the Committee, the Chairman- requested Sir Arthur Goldfinch to explain to the Conference the position in regard to textile raw materials.be.recorded in the minutes of the proceedings; he added that he also understood that Mr. Long would be opposed to the proposal. He reminded the Conference that the Raw Materials Board originated in resolutions of the Imperial War Conference, 1918, and said that if the Board were dissolved the control of raw materials, from the point of view of the British Empire as a whole, would be seriouslv endangered.The Chairman replied that the dissolution of the Board would mean that the Secretary of State himself could deal with all such questions as might arise.It was agreed that Detailed questions relating to the supply of raw materials for the United Kingdom should no longer be dealt with by the Raw Materials Board, but by the Board of Trade ; and that, should it be necessary for the Raw Materials Board to continue in existence, its functions should be confined to substantial questions of Imperial policy regarding raw materials, and to the questions concerning raw materials so far as the Dominions and colonies were concerned; otherwise the Board should be dissolved.
Sir Arthur Goldfinch stated that the Ministry of Supply were now dealing with the stocks of wool, jute, hemp, flax, hides, &amp;c, and that the machinery consisted of various councils. He mentioned that this work had been under the War Office, but had been trans-ferred to the Ministry of Supply. The polic)^ in regard to these articles was the same as that explained by Mr. Larke. They were endeavouring to sell at replacement value, which meant that they would lose on the transactions to a certain extent. He then explained the position in regard to the different commodities dealt with hy his Department, and the stocks which were held, and explained that wool stood by itself. He said that the stocks of wool in the United States were larger than the stocks in this countiy, but that we had large reserves in Australia and New Zealand, and he mentioned that the United States kept their prices at English level. In regard to leather, stocks were smaller than before the war and all leather was either held by the Government or by users.Mr. Chapman then referred to the articles controlled by the Board of Trade. Egyptian cotton had been acquired by the British and, Egyptian Governments, and countries were rationed; other cotton was iree, and the Cotton Control Board had ceased to exist as a control board. The control of timber was being removed at the end of March.    The question of paper was under discussion.The Chairman pointed out to the Conference that now that they had heard the actual position in regard to raw materials and the machinery that existed for dealing with them, it seemed to him that they should consider the general policy that should be adopted in either holding or unloading the stocks held by the Government.Lord Inchcape said that he could see no advantage in holding up stocks. He agreed that the immediate effect would show a Iops to the Government, but he thought it profitable to suffer that loss if by doing so the industry of the country were revived, as the profits of industry contributed very materially towards the Exchequer.Ijord Emmott pointed out that the difficulty to be considered wras that in later months the prices would fall, and he again referred to the question of avoiding speculation. It appeared that the objec-tion was that prices would immediately rise, but he himself did not see why prices should not be allowed to rise.The Chairman asked what the objection was to selling to British users at prices lower than the market prices.Sir Arthur Goldfinch stated that it had been decided by the Government that stocks must not be sold at lower prices to British purchasers than to Allies, such as France or Italy.The Secretary said that, so far as his recollection carried him, no such decision had been arrived at by the War Cabinet.Mr. Montagu thought that if stocks were sold below replacement value it might be undesirable for the articles to be subject to the operations of speculators, but Lord Emmott pointed out that this difficulty would be met if sufficient stocks were retained in hand.Sir Percy Bates said that the Ministry of Shipping had been in a good position to follow the. reasons for the present stagnation of industry. It seemed that one of the factors was the uncertainty which was current in regard to the Governments intentions, and that a large number of people were satisfied that the Government would take steps to assist industry, but the point that he himself laid most emphasis on was the fact that many businesses were content to carry on with a small turnover and few risks. He thought that it ought to be announced clearly that industry must not rely on Government action for stimulation, but must help itself, and he
206also thought that it was very necessary to urge the Admiralty to release as much shipping as possible.The Chairman said that the question before the Conference was as to whether they should adopt the policy of getting rid of large stocks and of thus bringing the prices flown to a pre-war level, and of encouraging manufacturers to produce articles in their place, or else to hold the stocks on the policy at present being followed, and thus delay the rapid revival of industry.Lord Ernie agreed that it should be adopted as a general policy that the stocks of raw materials should be unloaded at once, and that the prices should be brought down, as suggested by the Chairman, but tie inferred to a difficulty that might occur, which was in the case where the stock was not in hand, but had been brought forward.Sir Arthur Goldfinch pointed out that in regard to wool Australia would need to be consulted, as she regarded England as a trustee.Mr. Ijarke deprecated the unloading of stocks, and explained that the Ministry of Munitions had a number of liquidation contracts, and he feared that unloading the stocks, and thus lowering the prices, would have the effect of discouraging producers and leaving them unable to meet demands later on when existing stocks might be exhausted.The Chairman pointed out that, on the contrary, by retaining stocks they were hampering the manufacturers, and he thought that this question had been regarded too carefully, and that it was necessary to look at it not only from the point of view enunciated by Mr. Lirke on behalf of his Ministry, but also from the point of view of the stimulation of industry, with a view to the relief of unemployment.(At this stage, Mr. Chamberlain joined the Conference.)The Chairman explained the sense of the discussion to Mr. Chamberlain, who agreed that it was good policy to suffer a loss in regard to stocks if it meant that it would prevent unemployment. He thought that the aim should be to bring the prices down to post-war normal prices.The Chairman thought that, if it had the effect of stimulating industry, it might be well to get the prices below post-war normal level. He then said he thought himself that, notwithstanding all disadvantages, it was desirable to get rid of stocks as quickly as possible at any price, provided that (a.) We should not sell below replacement price, unless we havesufficient to prevent speculation ; (b.) We should only adhere to this policy until industry isrestarted;(c.) There may be exceptions necessitated by Inter-Allied, Imperial, or other agreements ;and he would ask the Conference to consider the advisability of such a policy, and to put forward any objections to its adoption at the next Meeting.   ^ (App. II, 1; IV, 10.)Exports10118 0f 4&apos; Chairman then raised the question of restrictions onexports and imports into this country. lie proposed to deal with the question of exports firsts and he enquired what were the restric-tions at present in force regarding the export trade.Mr. Chapman said that, apart from the prohibitions affecting the &quot;blockade&quot; countries, there were very few restrictions nowin force,
and that they were largely confined to cases where it was anticipated there would be a shortage of material in the countryLord Emmott said that the Committee of which he was President had drawn up lists of commodities upon the exportation of which certain restrictions were placed, either absolutely or in regard to particular countries. He said that suggestions tint were made to his Committee for relaxing the restrictions were very rarely turned down, unless it was pointed out by some Government Department that there were good reasons for maintaining the restrictions. He pointed out how, through the practice of placing restrictions in this respect, other countries had been driven to manufacture goods which before the war they obtained from this country, either entirely or in very large quantities and in this connection he mentioned Holland, Japan, United States of America. Lord Emmott expressed the opinion that throughout the war neutrals were affected more by the military situation than by the power of the blockade, and he gave it as his opinion that the time had come when we should run the risk of allowing materials to percolate into Germany provided that thereby we could benefit our own trade.Mr. Chamberlain agreed with Lord Emmotfs view, provided that Germany would get no more of any particular commodity than it might be safe for her to have. 1 le pointed out that if we exported articles direct to Germany we were thereby increasing German)&apos;&apos;s obligations to us, and it was of course apparent that the obligations of Germany to the rest of&apos;the world were at the present time already sufficiently great. If, however, we could supply goods through neutrals, allowing them, if they so desired, to forward them to Germany, the neutrals making their own terms for payment, we should not only stimulate our trade, but we should place ourselves in an infinitely better position financially.* (App. VI, 4; XXXVII (c).)Mr. Montagu agreed that the neutral market was at present by far the most profitable one for us to trade with.Mr. Cecil Harmsworth said that the Ministry of Blockade were not concerned with the question of whether goods should go to Germany direct or via, neutral countries, but only with maintaining the machinery ready to bring the blockade to bear on Germany should necessity arise. The machinery of blockade must perhaps bear hardly on industry, but its operations concerned mainly and chiefly those countries which might be termed &quot;economic bridgeheads of Germany,&quot; e.g., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland. He emphasised the view supported by the Allied naval and military leaders, and in particular by Marshal Foch himself, and by the War Cabinet, that when the Allied armies are reduced by demobilisation the threat of blockade is our best method of enforcing our will upon Germany. He explained that the Ministry of Blockade worked in close touch with the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee, and he said that the Committee keep constantly in view the desirability of making the blockade less oppressive. He also referred to the removal of restrictions announced only one or two days before on the exportation of materials to the south-east, including Bulgaria and Turkey and to the Black Sea. This had been done, as it was felt there was little fear of goods percolating into Germany by this route.Lord Emmott agreed as to the undesirability of allowing too much material to enter Germany, but he questioned whether at the present time it was worth while simply for that reason entirely stopping the export of commodities like cottcn and wool to neutral countries.The Chairman enquired whether there were any restrictions on exports toother countries, such as Spain. For example, could rails or railway-carriage wheels be exported to Spain at the present moment.
Lord Emmott replied that he did not think there were any restrictions, unless they were maintained on account of the demand in this country making it necessary to restrict export.Sir A. Goldfinch stated that the French Government were refusing to grant permits for the importation of certain commodities into France, e.g., light woollen goods.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that it was preferable to stimulate the export of goods to neutral countries rather than to the Allies, and thus keep the transactions on a cash basis, rectify our exchange, and get trade flowing.Sir James Stevenson enquired what the position was in regard to priorities, and whether there was a board or a committee dealing with the question.Mr. Larke replied that the War Priorities Committee had ceased to exist, and that no committee had apparently been established to take its place in regard to peace time priorities. He, said priorities were still established in certain cases, but that there was no priority by definition.Further discussion ensued, in the course of which Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Manville laid emphasis on the point that this country must be prepared, if it were desired to maintain export trade, to go without its full requirements in order to satisfy overseas demands.It was agreed that Lord Emmott, Lord Inchcape, Sir James Stevenson, Sir Arthur Goldfinch, and Mr. Chapman should form themselves into a Sub-Committee to revise drastically the regulations governing the restrictions on exports, and to report their recommendations as early as possible.     (App. V, 5; XXIX.)Mr. Cecil Ilarmsworih thought that the Ministry of Blockade should be represented on the Sub-Committee; but it was pointed out that the question would be considered by the Sub-Committee purely from the point of view of trade interests, and before a definite decision was given the Naval and Military authorities would be consulted.Sir Herbert Walker then raised the point that other countries had placed orders recently for goods which we urgently required ourselves, e.g., certain railway materials, and he asked to be con-suited on any question relating to the removal of restrictions on exports of such materials.The Chairman asked Sir Herbert Walker whether the makers of railway material in this country Wire at the present time in possession of orders which would &quot;keep them fully employed, as from various facts within his knowledge he doubted whether this was the case.Sir Herbert Walker replied that he thought the unemployment in the railway manufacturing trade was due mainly to the shortage of materials.The Chairman pointed out that the Conference had already&apos; come to the conclusion that in the majority of cases materials were in this country, and that the difficulties arose really by reason of the hold-up of commodities and the transition from war conditions to peace conditions.(Initialled)   A.

-   208v ...Raw Materials: 1. With  reference to  Minute  3 of the  1st Meeting, theGovernment Stocks.   Chairman invited Lord Inverforth, who had not been present at themeeting, to make any observations he might wish to submit for theconsideration of the Conference.Lord Lnverforth said he had had an opportunity of considering the decision which had been arrived at by the Conference on the previous day, and he announced that he was in agreement with the general policy involved in that decision.Mr. Larke said that the stock of lead, which was held amounted to a year&apos;s supply, and not three years, as he had stated from memory at the previous meeting.Sir Cecil Budd explained the policy of the Ministry of Supply in dealing with their stocks. He said that the Ministry followed the world&apos;s prices (which in some cases were already below the cost of production), not selling too early, but rather waiting for trade to revive, as the effect of reducing the price too low would be that merchants would buv the material rather than the manufacturers. Another danger was that there was a prospect of large consumption, and by forcing down prices a lot of production would, in his opinion, be stopped. He pointed out that one of the difficulties that the Ministry had to face was that the Americans were cutting our prices. He thought that the question of price was a subsidiary cause of the present state of trade stagnation and unemployment.Mr. Montagu said that he did not see why manufacturers would be induced to refrain from buying if prices were forced down, as, if ultimately the bottom price should be reached, their position would then be sound in that their anxieties about falling prices would disappear.Sir Vincent Caillard thought that the decision arrived at at the previous meeting was a good one, though it would have to be accompanied by other measures to secure the objects for which the Conference was sitting. He pointed out that the manufacturers were afraid of a fall in prices after they had bought.Mr. Arthur Pease stated the Admiralty held no stocks, except of timber which were being disposed of.The Chairman pointed out in regard to the Americans cutting our prices, that if we lowered them the Americans would continue to cut, and a good indication would be obtained, when they ceased cutting the prices, of what the correct level was.It was agreed that (i.) The general policy to be followed by the Departments which hold or control stocks of raw material is : (a.) To endeavour to force down the price of each raw material to a level not higher than the anticipated normal post-war price of the material.(6.) As a safeguard while prices  fall  to  retain sufficient reserve of each material to enable the Government to defeat any attempt at a hold up by merchants. (c.) In the case of any commodity, the price of which falls to a level below the anticipated post-war price, as the stock in hand dwindles, to raise the price gradually from the point to which it has been forced to the level of a fair post-war price. (d.) Where agreements permit, Departments dis-posing of stocks of raw material to discrimi-nate, if possible, in favour of British users. The amount and nature of the discrimination to be determined by Ministers responsible.
Restrictions on 3. The Chairman said that this was a matter which requiredImports. very careful consideration, and he requested Mr. Chapman to explainthe present position.Mr. Chapman explained that there were three factors to be considered : (l.) Restriction on imports into this country.(2.) Restrictions placed on exports from foreign countries.(3.) Financial considerations.The shipping position was easier, and goods were coming more freely into the country, but the reasciis why restrictions on imports had not been removed were that, while the imports subject to restrictions had begun to increase in quantity, some manufacturers complained because they were unable to keep up their production, and others who had started to produce during the war, and also new industries, complained because they were prejudiced by the increase in imports. Mr. Chapman said that the Board of Trade had proposed to the War Cabinet that they should go slowly in the relaxation of import restrictions, and, if necessasy, to put on other restrictions, particularly in the case of articles the manufacture of which had become a new industry in this country, and the Board thought that many of the complaints which had been made were justified.The Chairman pointed out that the Dominions, and in particular Canada, were complaining of discrimination in regard to import restrictions. He understood that the amount which could be imported was definitely fixed by the Imports Restriction Department, and that that amount was apportioned out to the importers.Mr. Chamberlain stated that Canadas view was that the basis which the Board of Trade worked on was disadvantageous to her, partly owing to her development of new industries and partly owing to the year chosen as the basis being one in which Canada was at war and her chief competitor was still at peace.Mr. Chapman pointed out that there might have been dis-crimination against Canada owing to questions arising out of the ra]tes of exchange. He said that, as a matter of fact, recornmenda-tions were before the Board of Trade for modifying the basis in certain cases in regard to Canada, and he did not think there would be any difficulty in doing this.Mr. Belterton.thought that the basis ought be taken on a pre-war year, as things were not normal in 1916, which was the year taken as the basis.Restrictions on Exports.(ii.) If in any case the general policy cannot be closely adopted because of conditions attaching to the holding or dis-posal of stocks, the underlying intention to provide British industry with cheap raw material should he accepted as the guide in all Departmental action: It was decided that the policy outlined above should be forthwith carried into effect. (App. IV, 10.)2. With reference to Minute 3 of the 1st Meeting, Mr. Cecil Earmsworth stated that he bought that it would not be possible to carry into effect any alterations that might be recommended by the Sub-Committee without consulting the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee.The Chairman pointed out that only British trade interests were being considered by the Sub-Committee, and that it did not appear that the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee would be con-cerned in the matter. If they were, however, they would be consulted, but, in any case, Mr. Harmsworth would have the oppor-tunity of considering the recommendations of the Sub-Committee when thev were submitted to the Conference.
The Chairman, speaking generally on the subject, pointed out that the question of restrictions on imports had a very great bearing on the export trade of the country.Mr. Chamberlain said that the problem was to find goods for the outward journeys and not for the inward journeys, and he understood that while inward-bound ships were carrying to their full capacity, the outward-bound ships were not. The inward-bound ships were carrying raw material and food, and relaxing restrictions in imports would not assist in the payment for the.-e articles, which must be met by reviving the export trade.Mr. Vernet spoke in regard to the paper trade. He quoted figures showing that the import of paper had gradually diminished since control had been imposed, and that the imports for the last year were 400,000 tons (or 550,000 tons, allowing for the fact that it was&apos; dry fibre), as against 1,800,000 tons immediately prior to the war. He said that there was a large demand for more paper, and the question arose as to whether restrictions on imports should betaken off. The newspaper proprietors desired this, and said that they had been neglected to the benefit of the mills. He thought that if the restrictions were removed certain mills would be put out of business. In answer to an enquiry by the Chairman, he agreed that half the mills were not properly equipped, and he was sure that these mills would not be able to make any profit if the restrictions were removed, and that even the properly equipped mills would have difficulty in doing so. Mr. Vernet mentioned that there were two considerations to be considered: one was that the foreign exchanges were against us, and the other was how much money should be permitted to go out of the country.The Chairman said that he understood the price of cigarettes had been put up because of the rise in the price of cardboard boxes, and that there was unemployment in the cardboard-box trade, and it appeared that the price had gone up on account of the lack of raw materials.Mr. Vernet said he had no knowledge of this, and that the price of boxes had fallen since the armistice, but he thought that the reason for this state of affairs was probably stagnation in other trades.The Chairman said that in regard to the paper trade, it appeared desirable to remove the restrictions on the import of pulp and paper as soon as possible.Mr. Chapman said he was in favour of doing away with the restrictions on the import of pulp, subject to the Treasury view.Mr. Vernet was of opinion that the paper control could not end in sixty days, in which time the mills would have the chance of preparinu to compete with other countries, but he thought that, if it were announced that control would be removed a month hence the effect would be that manufacturers would cancel their contracts. He pointed out that the Scandinavian exporters were trying to capture the British market for paper, and that the price of pulp had been raised two or three times. He mentioned that there were 500,000 tons of pulp available in Canada for export, and he thought it was desirable to allow a large increase in the import of pulp to this country.Mr. Chamberlain said that, from the Treasury point of view, it would be desirable to limit the imports from Sweden especially on account of the rate of exchange, and also on account of the fact that they had put up their prices, and he therefore suggested that the imports from Sweden should be decreased, and that the import of pulp from Canada should be encouraged as much as possible. It was, of course, a. matter that would require consultation with the Foreign Office, and he thought that it would perhaps be better not
Passports and 4. The Chairman then proceeded to deal with the question ofPermits, passports. He stated that he had heard from many sources that, at thepresent time, considerable difficulty was being experienced in the obtaining of passports by those men who wanted very urgently to proceed overseas in order to represent, or to stimulate, British interests in other countries, and he asked Mr. Martin of the Passport Branch of the Foreign Office, to tell the Conference what the position was.Mr. Martin stated that special priority was given by his branch to men such as commercial travellers, especially if their application were supported by the appropriate Chamber of Commerce or trade organisation. He said, however, that, in his opinion, the delay was due rather to the (perhaps unavoidable) restrictions on shipping. If any delay did occur at the Passport Office at the present time, it was due to the great increase in the number of applications recently received, which had placed very great stress upon the accornmoda-tion and staff at the disposal of his branch. The number of applications received daily at the present time was, approximately, 1,200, which was three i imes the number received a few months ago. He added that since the armistice the greater number of the restrictions which had formerly been in operation had been removed, as it was not now considered necessary to exercise the same rigidity of control over the issue of passports. In reply to an enquiry from the Chairman, Mr. Martin said that an applicant should receive histo make any public announcement on the subject if it were decided to carry out this suggestion, but that it should be as far as possible arranged with the trade.Mr. Vernet said that he was entirely in favour of this suggestion.It was agreed that Mr. Bridgeman should consider Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s suggestion in regard to limiting the import of pulp from Scandinavia with the Foreign Office, in the light of the discussion that had taken place, so that the Board of Trade might be able to come to a decision at an early date. (App. IV, 4 ; V, 3.)Sir A. King then reverted to the general question of removing restrictions on imports, and pointed out that in his view there were two dangers in continuing the restrictions. One was that the prices would be kept up as against the consumers, and the other was, that if we shut out other countries they might retaliate in the same way, which would have a disastrous effect on our export trade. He thought that what was required was a definite announcement that import restrictions would cease at a certain date, and that this announcement would greatly assist industry.Sir Vincent Caillard said he felt sure that manufacturers were not yet ready to deal with the situation that would arise if restiic-tions on imports were removed, and if such an announcement were made, the date named being, say, the 1st June, the effect would be that they would cut down their programmes, unless it were clearly stated that the date was named subject to reconsideration.Mr. Chamberlain was not sure that the effect of such an announce-ment would be desirable.It was agreed that Mr. Bridgeman should discuss the whole subject with Sir Albert Stanley as sooa as possible in the general sense of the discussion that had taken place, with a view to Sir Albert consulting Lord Emmott, and subsequently having a meeting with the Ministers concerned, when a definite decision could be arrived at.
1210passport in twenty-four hours, but that delay occurred in a very-large number of cases because applications were made without photographs being submitted in the first instance, or all the necessary particulars and recommendations being produced. As regards the steps which had been taken to make the require-ments of the Passport Office generally known to the public, he stated that banks, Chambers of Commerce, and similar bodies were in possession of the necessary information. He expressed doubt as to the value of a publicity campaign in the press, in view of the general failure of the public to read its newspapers carefully. He drew attention to an important concession which had just been made by his branch, namely, that, when once an applicant had obtained a passport to proceed from this country to another country, he could make further successive journeys to that same country for a period of two years (i.e., the period of the validity of the passport) without making any further application to the Passport Office.Mr. Chamberlain enquired whether passports were now necessary in every case.Mr. Martin replied that passports were still required by all persons embarking from the United Kingdom except in the case of demobilised soldiers and their dependants returning to their homes overseas, for whom special arrangements had been made. He added that, apart from embarkation requirements, passports would in any case still be required in cases where the applicant proposed to come back to this country. In the great majority of cases a passport was necessary for the additional reason that a man could not enter the foreign country concerned without one.Mr. Chamberlain suggested the desirability of circularising Chambers of Commerce and commercfai editors of newspapers, asking them to give the method of obtaining passports the greatest publicity to all concerned.Mr. Montagu thought that the time had now come when some change might be made in the regulations.Mr. Martin said that this could not be done until other countries brought their procedure into line by withdrawing some of their existing regulations..  The Chairman said he would like to know what the present regulations were as regards the. issue of permits. &apos;Mr. Martin stated that the Home Office were withdrawing their permit system in respect of neutral countries with effect from the 28th of this month, but he added, as regards military zones, that he understood the military authorities considered it necessary to maintain the permit system until peace was signed. He then made the suggestion that the issue of passports could be considerably expedited by instituting a number of branch passport offices throughout the country. At present it was necessary for a man in the north of Scotland who wanted a passport to apply either in person or by letter to London, which necessarily entailed a certain amount of delay.Mr. Manville suggested that the Chambers of Commerce might afford great assistance in this respect.It was agreed that Mr. Pease, Mr. Manville, Mr. Martin, and Captain Hotham should form themselves into a sub-committee to investigate the whole machinery for the issue of passports and permits, and to make suggestions with a view to facilitating the procedure in future/ (-4pp- XXV, XXVI.)
Arrangements for 5.   In response to a request from the Chairman, Sir Percy BatesTravellers proceed- proceeded to outline the whole question (from the point of view of mg 0verseas- the Ministry of Shipping) of providing facilities for travellers toproceed overseas. He stated that where the stream of individuals proceeding overseas for trade purposes coincided with that of demobilisation and repatriation, there was necessarily considerable difficulty owing to lack of accommodation on the ships available. He added that shipping companies had been requested to give preference to commercial travellers in allotting accommodation, but he feared that any system of reserving accommodation not required for demobilisation purposes would be inconsistent with the terms of the agreement which had been entered into with the various shipping lines. He was not aware that arrangements had been made for the repatriation of men who had come voluntarily to this country during the war for the purpose of enlistment, though he knew Govern-ment munition workers were provided for. Hestated chat on theNorth Atlantic route there were some 4,000 first and second-class berths available over and above those already required for demobilisation during the month of March ; that in the case of India, 50 per cent, of the accommodation was reserved for demobilisation purposes; and that with regard to the routes to South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, there was very great congestion, and it was practically impossible for a private individual to obtain a berth unless.a Government Department obtained it on his behalf. He considered that no real improvement on any of these three routes could be achieved unless the Ministry of Shipping weie authorised to make arrangements which would slow down the rate of demobilisation.The Chairman remarked that the number of cases which the Conference had in mind could form only a very small proportion of the total shipping accommodation which was available for all purposes.Captain Hotham observed that the anticipated release ot German liners would considerably relieve the situation: but that for the moment some difficulty was being experienced in making the Germans hand o,7er the ships required of them. The Germans were holding hack the first batch of fifty-three German ships (of which only u small proportion would be passenger steamers) in the hope of obtaining a decision first on financial questions; but considerable pressure was about to be placed upon the Germans to prevent their causing delay. He added that the passenger liners to be handed over by the Germans were to be distributed equally between the United States of America and this country.Sir Percy Bates pointed out that a considerable proportion of British shipping was at present being employed in the repatriation of American troops.After fuither discussion it was agreed that Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, Lord Inverforth, Sir Percy Bates, and Mr. Foley (Ministry of Shipping) should form them-selves into a sub-committee to investigate the arrangements that could le made for accommodating in the available shipping commercial travellers and those who had come to this country voluntarily to enlist and were waiting to be repatriated, and to report to the Conference as soon as possible.

With reference to Minutes 4 and 5 of the 2nd Meeting, the Chairman invited Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, who had not been present at the Meeting, to submit such observations as he might have to make.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said that he observed that sub-committees had been appointed to deal with these matters, and he said that he would arrange for one of his staff to get into touch with the Sub-Committee on Passports and Permits so that it might have all the information before it that it might require.   With
regard to the arrangements for travellers proceeding overseas, he was having a scheme prepared which he proposed to lay before the Shipping Controller.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said that there were a lot of business people who had very little knowledge of the procedure that was now necessary to enable them to trade. The big firms, of course, were fairly familiar with the various technicalities, but the smaller firms were not, and they were constantly applying from all parts of the country to his department for information. He felt sure that if he could increase his staff and have proper office accommodation he could greatly help to revive the export trade, as his department would then be in a position to guide business people and advise them not only on restrictions on trade that existed in this country, but also in regard to restrictions in foreign countries. He also thought that some sort of publicity ought to be kept up. The Ministry of Information had in the past arranged for certain publications in South America which had been dropped. He understood the Americans were doing this sort of thing, but so far as he knew only through their trade institutions. The British Trade Federation was beginning to do some of this work and to help firms in this country, but they had not got properly going, and they said that they were not in a position to deal adequately with the matter.The Chairman said that, if lack of office accommodation was really holding up the revival of the export trade, then it was a very important question. He suggested that Sir Arthur Steel -Maitland&apos;s point might be met by establishing information bureaux in various parts of the provinces.It was suggested that this work was the function of the Chamber of Commerce, but Sir Arthur Sfeel-Maitland stated that nevertheless the enquiries received in his Department amounted to a very large number.Sir Alfred Mond said, on the question of office accommodation, that an extension of the Foreign Office building had been contem-plated, but that it had been stopped owing to lack of materials, and, he added, in regard to Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland&apos;s point, that he had been given to understand that the Overseas Trade Department was shortly to be absorbed in the Board of Trade organisation. *Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said he had heard nothing of that, and he added that, while his Department must remain associated both with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, what he desired was that it should be housed within a reasonable distance of each.It was decided that: (1.) That the question of the desirability and (or) necessity of establishing an information bureau of the nature sug-gested by Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, either at his head office or in the provinces, be referred to the Sub-Committee appointed in Minute 3 of the 2nd meeting to consider the question of passports and permits, as an addition to their terms of reference, and that Mr. Butler, of the Overseas Trade Department, be added as a member of the Sub-Committee.(2.) Enquiry be made of the President of the Board of Trade as to the prospective position of the Overseas Trade Department.(3.) It was essential that the Overseas Trade Department should have adequate office accommodation, and that subject to (2) above, the locality of the Department should be in the vicinity of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade.* This paragraph was subsequently discussed at the Seventh Meeting of the Conference, and it was then decided that the wording of this paragraph should be amended as recorded in the Minutes of that Meeting.
The Possibility of 2. The Chairman mentioned that this was a very importantgiving Employment   branch of the subject which was before the Conference, as it opened on Public Works.      Up ^e financial aspect of all these questions, and he proposed to take first of all public works, excluding housing, land settlement, land reclamation, drainage and afforestation, and then to take these exceptions separately.Public Works. (a/)  )r. Addison said that public works, with the exceptionsreferred to, and excluding roads (other than those necessitated by the housing scheme), were divided up under various groups, and he quoted figures which showed that there were public works to cost about 11,000,000Z., either in progress or fully authorised, and in the case of which the local authorities were willing to proceed, and that there were other public works to the cost of 16,482,0001., with which the local authorities were also willing to proceed but were not yet fully authorised.Dr. Addison then drew attention to a letter which the Local Government Board had received from the Treasury containing the Treasury&apos;s sanction for the carrying out of certain schemes (including housing), with, however, certain qualifications, which would make it necessary for application to be made to Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee where it was desired to exceed the sanction contained in the Treasury&apos;s letter. It seemed to him that from the point of view of unemployment, which they were considering, what had to be considered was what loans by local authorities should be sanctioned  and they proposed to do all in their power to induce the larger local authorities to borrow on their own account in respect of works to cost 11,000,0001., and how far the local authorities were likely to proceed with such works. He thought this was more important than considering the actual nature of the works, which, he pointed out, were limited by Lord Colwyn&apos;s Committee.The Chairman pointed out that the amount that could be borrowed would be a limited sum, and he laid stress on the fact that the employment that should be offered should be of a varied nature.Mr. Montagu questioned whether the stimulation of building would help employment, as it seemed to him that the cause of the unemployment in the building trade was want of materials and of pivotal men, and, above all, the unwillingness of private persons to build.Sir Stephenson Kent said that building contractors were cancelling their contracts because of the uncertainty of the position, having regard to the probable absorption of materials by the Government.The Chairman thought that the reason for unemployment in the building trade was the cessation of building in aerodromes, which left large units of unemployed, the shortage of materials, timber difficulties, and a certain shortage of pivotal men, other than those contained in the units referred to.Mr. Chamberlain said that what the Treasury wanted, and what they had never had, was a statement from Dr. Addison, and also from Lord Ernie, of what money they required for their schemes, how much could be usefully applied in the coming year, and how much it would be necessary to raise by Government borrowing. He emphasised the necessity of making local authorities who could do so borrow on their own market credit, and he gave an indication of the total amount likely to be available on local loans funds for all purposes, namely, 30,000,000LThe Chairman said that the question before them was as to the best way of spending that 30,000,0001 from the point of view of getting public works carried out in such a way as would meet the problem of unemployment. He said that the point that had to be borne in mind was as to whether the credit of the country was sufficient to carry its population, and, in his opinion, this question of
credit was at the root of all the points they were considering, and it was essential that, in some manner or other, steps should be taken to meet it within the next few months.Dr. Addison said he thought that the credit of the country was satisfactory, and that what was at the root of their difficulties was the question of the revival of trade.After further discussion, it was decided that The President of the Local Government Board should arrange for his Department to prepare for the Conference analyses of the public works contemplated, in terms of their potential values from the point of view of labour absorption and relative cost (including differentiation between local authorities who might be in a position to borrow and those who might not be in such a position).(See App. X.LIII; also IV, 8 ; XLIV to XLVI.)Mr. Montagu drew attention to the fact that, assuming that the sum available for these various purposes was about 30 millions, and assuming that the housing scheme and the land settlement scheme were estimated to cost respectively 10 millions and 20 millions, it was difficult to see how it was proposed to provide for the large expenditure on public works which had been referred to by Dr. Addison. He laid stress on this point because the housing, scheme and the land settlement scheme were matters which the Government were pledged to carry into effect.The Chairman agreed that this was a very important point, and one that laid stress on the necessity for discovering the relative values of the various schemes that were in contemplation from the point of view of absorbing labour.Proposals of Office Sir Alfred Mond spoke as to the public works that were inof Works. contemplation by the Office of Works.   He said that the buildingwork they had in contemplation was chiefly Post Office work, and it was estimated that after three months&apos; work 10,000 persons wrouldbe employed on it. The total estimate for the Post Office work was 5 million, which would be spread over a period of three years. . The proportion in the next financial year would be about 1^- million. He deprecated building more than was necessary, as he thought such a policy might conflict with the Government housing scheme.It was decided that: Sir Alfred Mond should arrange for a schedule to be prepared for the Conference, showing the classes of work that were in contemplation, and the amount of labour that it was estimated these classes of work would absorb.(App. XLVII.)Proposals of Post ,^r- Ulingworth said that the engineering programme of theOftice- Post Office was carried out by them entirety, and that the estimatewas 8 million, half of this being for maintenance and half for new works, and all their orders would be placed in this country. He referred to the difficulty in regard to the telephone system, and he pointed out that, as matters were at present, there would be difficulty in the way of supplying, to any large extent, new businesses in the city with the necessary apparatus. He mentioned that the Post Office was in arrears in executing telephone installations to the extent of over 200,000, and, out of 800 applications weekly in London, only 200 could be dealt with. The completion of the Post Office Tube was being held up until metals came dowm to a more reasonable level.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that they had discovered that there were large stocks of raw materials held by the Ministry of Munitions, and he could not see why an arrangement should not be come to between the Post Office and the Ministry of Munitions, whereby the Ministry should hand over such materials as were required. The point as to what price the Post Office should be charged was quite immaterial to the Treasury, and was a matter of arrangement
-   213between the two departments, but it seemed to him perfectly-unnecessary for the Post Office to wait for the price to fall when the material was already in the hands of the Government, and, if not supplied to the Post Office, would have to be sold later to the public at a loss.The Chairman said that this was a curious case of one department waiting for another to bring down the price, and he wondered whether a similar situation had arisen in regard to railway material.It was decided that (i.) The Postmaster-General should arrange for figures to be supplied to the Conference indicating how much of the 8 million estimate would be absorbed in wages and how much in material. i-^pp. XLVIII.)(ii.) The Post Office and the Ministry of Munitions should arrange forthwith that the former department obtain the necessary supply of raw material without delay. &apos; (iii.) Mr. Chapman should make enquires whether the difficulty in regard to obtaining raw material for railway replacements was analogous to that which existed in the case of the Post Ofhce.     (App. XXXVIII; XXXIX.)Land Settlement. (5\       Chamberlain said that he thought before the Conferenceconsidered this matter, it would be useful for him to have a consultation with Lord Ernie on the subject. He mentioned that it would appear the scheme was proposed to apply not only to ex-service men, but to everybody, and with this he could not agree.Lord Ernie said that he thought himself that the. scheme should be limited to ex-service men, but that there was a strong body of opinion which held that men who had not been allowed to join the colours should also have the opportunity of settling on the land.It was decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Agriculture confer on the subject and report the result to the Conference. (App. IV, 7.)Land Reclamation. (Ci) Lord Ernie stated that two  main  questions presentedthemselves in connection with reclamation, namely: How to obtain land by reclamation, and what price should be paid for it. The landowner would claim a high price, and argue that he was justified by reason of the fact that the value of the land would be enhanced by the improvements that would be wrought upon it. He had been authorised by the Treasury to spend the sum of 1,000,000Z. on reclamation, and he hoped to obtain powers by the acquisition of Land Bill to enable him to carry out his scheme. If necessary, possession could be taken under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.He gave one or two examples of land reclamation throughout the country. There was an area of about 8 square miles at Wareham, which could be reclaimed at a cost of about 51. an acre, and would probably be worth ultimately about 201. an acre, so that, from a financial point of view, this scheme had something to commend it in connection with the question of land settlement for ex-soldiers. Again, schemes were formulated for the reclaiming of parts of the Yorkshire moors for grass pasturage. The labour which would be employed would be almost entirely unskilled, under the supervision of a few skilled gangers, but he feared that the scheme would not produce any valuable solution to the unemployment problem, owing to the fact that the conditions of the work would discourage the unemployed men in town areas from volunteering for such work.Mr. Chamberlain recalled the decision  of Lord Selborne&apos;s Committee, which came to the conclusion that from the point of [1312] K
Land Drainage.Afforestation.Deforestation.Government Housing Scheme.view of solving the unemployment problem, reclamation of land was useless, and he drew attention to the fact that the vast proportion of the unemployed population in this country at the present time was to be found in the towns, and that that class of worker would he most unsuitable for&quot; work of that description. If, however, Lord Ernie proposed that the labour employed on this work should consist of ex-service men, who would ultimately settle on the land they had worked on, he had no objection to the scheme.Sir Stephenson Kent expressed the opinion that in so far as the unemployed population consisted of ex-soldiers, it was not, perhaps, altogether unsuited for work, such as reclamation of land largely entailed.(d.) Lord Ernie proceeded to deal with the question of drainage of the land. He said that no grant irom the Treasury had yet been authorised, but that there were many millions of acres throughout the country which could be made more profitable by a proper system of drainage. The landowner would, of course, profit by any such scheme, but he feared that if drainage work was left to private individuals, little or nothing would be done, although he hoped that something might be accomplished by affording the private landowner assistance in the way of provided labour. He agreed with Mr. Chamberlain that the idea of making a Treasury grant for improve-ments to private property would be difficult to carry through, as a private landowner should carry out&apos; his own improvements, but he could see no other way of getting drainage works carried out.(e.) The Chairman then raised the question of afforestation, but, in the absence of Mr. Acland, who was in charge of the interim forestry authority, the consideration of the matter was adjourned.In the course of discussion, however, it was agreed that a con-siderable amount of employment might be given by carrying out the schemes of afforestation, but here again no real solution of the unemployment problem would be found, as the work would not attract the unemployed population in the towns, but would, if any-thing, tend to deplete the man-power available for agricultural purposes.&apos;(/.) Mr. Pease mentioned that 75 per cent, of the pit-props required would have to be obtained in this country, and he pointed out that this would provide employment, particularly in view of the withdrawal of the Canadian forestry companies.(g.) Mr. Pease stated that, according to his information, there was at present a labour shortage in the West Riding of Yorkshire.Mr. Illingworth confirmed this statement, and said that he understood that the reason was that there was not sufficient housing accommodation for all the workers who could find employment in that part of the country.Dr. Addison said that, up to the 21st January, he had received applications for the building of 10,506 houses. Schemes were only now beginning to be brought before him ; last week he had given approval to fourteen schemes, which entailed the construction ol&apos; 600 houses. In view, however, of the fact that a thousand local authorities stated that they wished to build, and he had only received fifty-two definite schemes up to the end of January, he was not in a position at present to give any useful figures on the subject, but he thought that this was not a satisfactory state of affairs, and he was having enquiries made. Probably no contracts had been placed up to the present, and there was some difficulty in connection with the acquisition of land, but he hoped that by the passing of the Acquisition of Land Bill he would be enabled to carry out schemes more quickly. He agreed that this Bill was the real basis of the scheme, and mentioned that already it was found necessarv
-   214to acquire 246 sites. He added that in his Housing Bill he was proposing that, when once the acquisition of a site had been sanctioned, the local authorities should be able to start work at once, without waiting for the usual preliminaries.Mr. Pease said that he feared that the cost of building a cottage was a greater difficulty than the cost of acquiring the land, and he thought that local authorities could only build houses at a cost of about 10 to 20 per cent, higher than what it would cost a private builder to carry out the work. He suggested that, ,to get houses built quickly, it was necessary to encourage the private builder as well as the local authority, and that a subsidy should be given at a decreased rate according to the time at which the houses were finished (e.g., 40 per cent, on the cost of approved plans for all houses completed and ready for occupation within twelve months, and for houses finished later decreasing 10 percent, for each month), so that the subsidy would gradually disappear, and the building would then be carried on, on an economic basis.        (App- XLII.)Sir Stephenson Kent expressed a fear that a scheme of this nature might tend to encourage jerry-building.   *Mr. Pease replied that he thought this objection could be overcome if the local authority inspected the plans prior to the commencement of building operations, and also the completed work prior to the houses being occupied.Mr. Montagu drew attention to the state of affairs in country districts, where existing cottages were in an appalling condition, and also the labour available was totally inadequate to meet requirements. There was the additional difficulty in the country that if a builder put up a cottage now he must charge a higher rental in order to recover the high expenditure entailed.Colonel Amery remarked that private builders were holding back all over the country because they knew they could never get an economic rent on the present high cost of-building. The only thing to do was to come to a rough decision as to what future cost would be, and to give the builders the difference as a bonus, with possibly a further small bonus for speedy building.The Chairman remarked that it was not an exaggeration to say that a million new houses were required in the country at the present time, and in such a serious position, he thought that the question should most earnestly be considered of obtaining powers to help Public Utility Societies by means of a subsidy, which would go some way towards meeting the point made by Mr. Pease and Colonel Amery. A very important point in connection with .the scheme was the supply of materials.Mr. Drower said that the difficulty in restarting brick fields, so far as labour was concerned, was not in getting pivotal men out of the army, but in securing casual labour required for clay mixing. This class of labour would receive a comparatively low wage, which would be at least 30 per cent, less than the rate which had been paid in aerodrome construction of a similar kind. Owing to the fact that there was little competition, brickyards, as a whole, were not up-to-date or enterprising, and they must in many&apos; cases be re-equipped. Larger brickyards did not want subsidy so much as orders to induce them to commence work, though a few of the smaller concerns might require assistance to obtain the necessary machinery. He estimated that the output of bricks in the last year of the war was 600 million, whereas the output just before the war had been rather over 3,000 million, the greatest output in any one recent year having been 3,600 million. The scheme of the Local Government Board would require about 6,000 million bricks, which, at the present rate, it would take about three years to supply, allowing
for ordinary demands, which would have to be met simultaneously. The cost of bricks at the present time was from 30 to 80 per cent, higher than it was just before the war, but he anticipated that it might be possible to make a reduction in the near future.Dr. Addison suggested that it might be a good plan for the Ministry of Munitions to control the brickyards.Sir Stephenson Kent remarked that the cost of brickmaking depended very largely on the class of labour employed. The higher the skill the cheaper would be the rate at which bricks could be manufactured.Mr. Drower stated that the situation was satisfactory as regards the supply of ordinary timber for housing and as regards fittings, but he feared a shortage of good joinery timber and also possibly of paint.Sir Percy Bates stated that he believed that sanction had been given for the export of linseed (which, in the form of oil, was largely used in the manufacture of paint), so that he did not think that difficulty should arise in the case of paints, although for three to four months there would be a shortage of white lead, an essential ingredient of paint for woodwork.It was decided that A statement should be presented to the Conference as soon as possible by the Ministry of Munitions giving the whole position with regard to the materials available for con-structing and equipping houses and making suggestions as to the steps necessary for stimulating and maintaining the supplies. (App. XLI.)It was also decided that It is inexpedient to adopt the policy of subsidising private persons or interests out of State funds.(Initialled)      A. C.

1. The Chairman stated that the result of the deliberations of the Conference during the previous week were being considered next morning by a Conference of Ministers under the presidency of the Prime Minister, when it was hoped that a uniform policy to be followed would be adopted. He added that before proceeding with the agenda he wished to deal with one or two points that were outstanding from the Minutes of the previous meetings.Permits and Pass-ports and Informa-tion Bureaus.2. With reference to Minute 4 of the Second Meeting, Mr. Pease stated that the report of the Sub-Committee had already been drawn up and was in process of circulation among the members of the Sub-Committee for their approval, and that it would be presented almost immediately. He added that Mr. Butler was at present indisposed, and that therefore they had been unable to deal with the second part of the business, which was referred to the Sub-Committee at the Third Meeting, and that the Sub-Committee proposed therefore to submit their recommendations regarding the issue of passports and permits without waiting for the remainder of the enquiries to be carried out. (App- XXV, XXVI.)Basis for Deter- 3. ]j/n Bridgeman said he had enquired into this matter, andfrom^anair68 thought that it must be admitted that the basis taken to determine the quantity of imports operated inequitably in the -case of Canada. This had already been pointed out to the Import Restrictions Department, and something had already been done to increase the share of imports given to Canada. Unfortunately, carrying this out had been limited by the fact that this country was under obligations to receive definite quantifies of certain things from Allied and other countries, so that the Canadian imports could not be increased with-out increasing the total imports.. Moreover, the question had been raised of the need of protecting industries in this country, and this entailed consultation with the interests affected. Pending this discussion, the Import Restrictions Department had felt itself unable to take further action, but an enquiry would be conducted into each case, and every effort would be made to arrange for larger imports from Canada. The Board of Trade thought that there would not be any difficulty in substantially meeting the Canadian claim.Mr. Chamberlain said that he understood Canada felt that she was at a disadvantage on account of the basis upon which restrictions on imports were settled. Canada alleged that the actual basis handicapped her in two ways. It took no account of the present potentialities of new industries developed during the wat; and yet the year chosen as the basis being one when Canada was at war and her chief competitor was at peace, it was equally unfavourable to her pre-war industries. Canada of course would like to be treated on a pre-war basis for her pre-war industries, and on a war basis for her industries developed during the war, but as matters stood she had neither of these advantages.Sir Albert Stanley said that the question of fixing a basis was not so simple as it appeared, as it had to be looked at from the point of view of different countries, and, if a favour was shown to one, another was quick to expect the same. He agreed that it was a matter which wanted very careful consideration, but he hoped that no definite decision would be come to on the point, as the Board of Trade had the matter well in mind.
-   216Export of Railway 5. The Chairman drew attention to the fact that the export ofMaterial. new railway material had been prohibited quite recently, almostimmediately after the complete removal of all restrictions had beenannounced.Sir Herbert Walter stated that he was unable to make any statement to the Conference at that meeting, but that he hoped to do so at the following meeting. He added that the object of placing a restriction on the export of new railway material was that at present we could not manufacture sufficient for our own requirements in this country.Sir Albert Stanley stated that, according to his information, locomotive manufacturers in this country were not at the present time fully occupied.Mr. Chapman stated that the change of policy to which the Chairman had alluded originated through an error. The announce-ment issued early in January, removing all restrictions on railway material, was made, inadvertently, to apply to all radway material, instead of only to second-hand material. Later on a mistake was discovered, and was unfortunately rectified by a further announcement to the effect that the restrictions removed only referred to second-hand material and not to new material.It was decided : That all restrictions on the exportation of railway material, whether new or second-hand, should be removed forthwith.Paper Control.I4. Sir Albert Stanley stated that, in his opinion, the control of paper should be abolished at once. He fully realised that the question of allowing paper or paper pulp to be freely imported from Scandinavia presented difficulty from the Treasury point of view, but he thought that the restriction on that import and the removal of restrictions on its importation from Canada and the United States of America would not have any useful effect, as by far the greater proportion of our imports of this commodity came from Scandinavia. He favoured the removal of control as quickly as possible, with a view to encouraging traders to rely upon themselves, and he thought that this principle should be adopted in the case of paper. He was aware that such action would hit paper manufacturers in this country very hard, but he considered that this was a lesser evil, provided assistance could be given to manufacturers in very special cases where the results of the proposed policy showed it to be desirable.Lord Emmott observed that if the War Cabinet accepted the recommendations of his Sub-Committee the difficulty of rectifying the rate of exchange would be modified, owing to the possibility of exporting more commodities to Sweden and other blockade countries.Lord Ernie enquired whether the increase in employment in trades manufacturing paper-made articles resulting from the removal of restrictions on the import of paper would counterbalance any increase in unemployment which might arise through stagnation in the paper manufacturing industry in this country.Sir Albert Stanley replied in the affirmative, and urged that the restrictions should be withdrawn forthwith.Mr. Chamberlain said that before the Conference arrived at a decision on the points he would like to have an opportunity of conferring with his Department on the bearing the matter had on the Swedish exchange.The Chairman said in that case they would postpone their decision to the next meeting. (App. II, 3 ; V, 3.)
It was agreed that the necessary steps should be taken to carry this decision into effect. (App. VII. 1.)-p , . ,. 6. Sir Albert Stanley said that the policy in regard to restric-xCeBtrictions on . .        ,     i * i        n     i   rt&quot;   i        &apos; i*Imports tions on imports which the Board ol lrade were recommending to theWar Cabinet was very simple.   Briefly, it was that the import of allcompletely manufactured articles should be restricted over a period,say, up to the end of June next; that restrictions on the import ofall partly manufactured articles would seriously impede manufacturershere; but by keeping up certain restrictions over a period, theGovernment would be enabling our own manufacturers to placethemselves in a position to set up their plant and generally equipthemselves for competing with foreign traders.   The Board of Tradewere alive to the fact that our foreign trade connections should notbe imperilled, but they were anxious that all dumping of goodsin this country should be prevented.    Sir Albert mentioned thecase of motor cars, on which there was a 30 per cent. duty.   Ifmotor cars were allowed free into this country a good-will would beestablished by foreign traders, and our own manufacturers would beunable to compete with them, particularly as the manufacturers ofmotor cars in this country had in many cases during the war beenmanufacturing nothing but aeroplane, engines ; but manufacturersof motor cars in, for instance, America had not, speaking generally,ceased making motor cars, and, even if they had, the changefrom war conditions to peace conditions there was a very simplething compared with  what  it  was  in  the  United  Kingdom.Sir Albert thought, with regard to the Board of Trade recom-mendations, that, before the restrictions contained in them weretaken off, the advice of both manufacturers and consumers inthis country should be taken.   He mentioned that there was oneother class of imported article, the import of which it might beadvisable to prohibit, and that was goods that might be described asluxury articles.   He thought, however, that this was more a matterfor the Treasury than the Board of Trade, as it was a question ofspending money, of exhausting foreign credits for articles that werenot absolutely necessary.Lord Emmott said that his Consultative Council had not made detailed enquiries into this question, as they thought it was better to wait until a definite policy was laid down. He thought that all the various interests concerned should be consulted, and that pre-war and present prices should be considered, and also the amount of profits that had been and were being made, and then that it should be made known definitely to the trades how long restrictions on imports were going to remain, and he did not suggest that the period should be necessarily the same for every industry or article. It was uncertainty that was hindering industry, and arrangements could be made with the trades concerned without publishing them in the newspapers.Sir Alfred Mond pointed out that an anti-dumping Bill was being introduced into Parliament, and for that reason alone it would be necessary to keep up the restrictions for the present.Mr. Manville said he understood that the United States would be glad to see the restrictions on imports into this country removed, and that the American Chamber of Commerce was calling a meeting with the object of arriving at some settlement of the matter.The Chairman pointed out that what w7as being recommended was not complete prohibition, but what might be termed rationing&quot; of prohibition.Mr. Chamberlain addressed the Conference on the subject from the point of view of rates of exchange between this country and others, and laid emphasis on the necessity for preventing the import of any unnecessary articles or goods into this country.
The Chairman said that in considering this matter they must look into the future, and he asked Sir Albert Stanley what machinery the Board of Trade possessed for shielding the various classes of industries in this country.Sir Albert Stanley said that generally the protection existed in the retention of restriction on imports that he had spoken of, and in the prevention of dumping of foreign goods in this country. He explained that the Board of Trade had set up an organisation for recording, investigating, and considering the &quot;pivotal&apos;&apos; industries in the country, and also what might be called &quot;nascent industries, and that this organisation would consider each particular industry  as time went on, they would, it was hoped, cover all the ground and would make recommendations for affording such industries any pro-tection that they might require. He mentioned the case of the dye industry, and pointed out that the import of dyes into this country was prohibited for ten years, but that there was a special Board appointed to deal with the question of such imports. The protection that the &quot; nascent&quot; industries would require would not &quot;nly be from impons, but would take the form of Government financial assistance. In some cases only protection from imports would be required, but in others both forms of protection would be necessary. In reply to an enquiry from Sir Alfred Mond as to how long the restrictions could kept up without further legislation, Sir Albert, said that most of these restrictions were based on pre-war legislation, but that he was bringing forward a Bill shortly which would give him, as far as could be ceen, all the authority he would require.Mr. Pease said that it should be borne in mind that, in considering the question of removing the restrictions, the existence of the blockade was very essential towards exacting from Germany what was required.The Chairman referred to a letter which had been received from the Triumph Cycle Company (Limited), complaining of the restrictions on exports to France and Italy. He thought what was really referred to was import restrictions imposed by those two countries, and, that being so, the subject was one allied to the one they were discussing. The Triumph Cycle Company (Limited) had agencies in both these countries, and were naturally anxious to get their business flowing again.Mr. lllingworth referred to a similar case in respect of wroollen goods, where it had been impossible to discover whether the restrictions were on exports imposed by this country, or on imports imposed by a foreign country.Sir Percy Bates reminded th - Conference of a statement that had been made at a previous meeting to the effect that the French Government were reducing their imports of woollen goods by 50 per cent. He understood that the French were using their import restrictions to control tonnage, and that the same remark applied to Italy.Sir Albert Stanley said the restrictions in question must be import restrictions, imposed by France or Italy, as the case might be, and he mentioned that the French Minister in charge of the subject was coming to London to hold a conference with the Treasury and the Board of Trade on the subject very shortly.The Chairman pointed out that it would be just as necessary for the French to impose import restrictions as for us, and, in fact, they might have additional reasons, but in any case it was apparent that the obstacles in the cases quoted had arisen out of French import restrictions and not out of British export restrictions, and he thought British traders should know of this.
Mr. Manville said that he understood the restrictions of imports of British goods into France were more stringent than those dealing with American goods.Mr. Chapman said the Board of Trade had been anxiously-examining the position that lie understood was arising by reason of the demands for goods from France passing over this country and going to America He thought that what might be done was for us to sell our stocks in France as against such indemnity as the French Government might receive, and that the British Government should finance our producers.Mr. CJiamberlain pointed out, in regard to the United States being more favoured than the United Kingdom, that the reason was no doubt that America was in a better position to sell on credit or to-give Government credit to France than we were. With regard to Mr. Chapman&apos;s point, lie mentioned that his predecessor had made an arrangement with Belgium whereby all new money became a first charge on the amount of indemnity received. He had made a similar arrangement with Italy, and was endeavouring to do the same in the case of France.The Chairman stated that the principle should be that new money should lie a first charge, even-before reparation requirements.It was agreed that: The policy as regards imports should be as follows : (a.) All raw material shall be admitted free of restriction.(b.) Semi-manufactured materials that are necessary as material for the manufactures of this country shall be admitted free without restriction, excepting so far as they are produced by industries which it is essential to foster in this country, and which require shielding, in which case they will be restricted.(c) Manufactured articles shall be subject to restriction when not necessary for consumption in this country, or when produced by industries which require to be shielded from foreign competition, while re-establishing themselves in passing from war work to peace work, or which have been created or encouraged to expand owing to circumstances arising out of the war.The restriction to continue for a period not extend-ing beyond 1st September, without a further decision from the Cabinet.(d.) The Board of Trade to take steps to consider what should be done to maintain in the country industries which it is the policy of the Government to foster.This policy shall not be iimited to existing restrictions.It was decided that the foregoing polic)r should be brought into operation immediately.It was also agreed that : The Board of Trade should take steps to inform British traders that the obstacles in the way of exporting goods did not necessarily arise out of export restrictions enforced in this country, but rather by reason of the import restrictions enforced by the foreign countries concerned.Land Settlement. 7. With reference to Minute 2 (b) of the Third Meeting, HieCJiairman said he understood that Mr. Chamberlain and Lord  rule had oonfenped on this matter.
-   218Housing Scheme. 8. With reference  to  Minute 2 (a) of the Third   Meeting,Mr. Symonds submitted a statement prepared by the Local Govern-ment Board. (App. XLIII.)The Chairman emphasised the necessity of recognising that the provision of employment was one of the most important considera-tions of the Government housing scheme. An important point in the whole question was whether orders for fittings required in houses should be given to the builders themselves.Mr. Symonds said that the builders took the view that they should make windows, doors, &amp;c, pari passu with the houses, and that they were opposed to orders for these things being placed with Government factories. He added that the action of the Ministry of Munitions in placing some orders of this nature recently had evoked considerable protest, and there was a further consideration that such a course probably entailed an increase in the total cost of building the houses.Sir Alfred Mond observed that, generally speaking, builders did not make doors and windows themselves, but let the contracts out to others, and he thought that the reason why builders were so anxious to obtain the contract for fittings as well as the houses was partly that thereby they were enabled to reap greater profit.The Chairman said that our main object at present should be to adopt such a policy as would stimulate employment. At the present time the Government was paying vast sums in unemployment donations, and if by a change of policy unemployment could be reduced an economy would be effected for the State, even if the cost was increased through giving separate orders for fittings.Mr. Symonds remarked that, in regard to contracts for bricks, it had been found that the limited tenders had been so hedged with conditions that they could not be accepted. With regard to placing orders for fittings with national factories, there was another objection, in that in many cases the work would be carried out by workpeople who were not properly accustomed to the work.Mr. Chamberlain said that, in his view, the proper policy to adopt was to give to firms whose normal occupation&apos; was the making of fittings such orders as would keep them fully occupied, and then to give the remainder to national factories. With regard to the analysis of the public works contemplated by the Local Government Board, he was afraid that the information contained therein was not what he really desired, and he asked if the information could be given in the form of answers to the following questions: (l.) What works under each head could be proceeded with at once ?(2.) What sum would be required for such works in the year 1919-20?Lord Ernie said that this was so, and that, while it must be admitted that the preseut prices made the launching of the land settlement scheme a very difficult matter, it was necessary, of course, to carry out pledges that had been given.Mr. Chamberlain said that the arrangement that he and Lord Ernie had come to was that 20,000,000L should be allocated to this scheme, which was to be limited to settling ex-service men on the land, with the exception that if it were discovered that small holdings existed for which no ex-service men could be found, then suitable persons, other than ex-service men, should be allowed to take over such holdings. He regarded the scheme as uneconomical, but he also thought it was necessary to carry out our obligations to ex-service men.
(3.) How much of the sum so required must be found by Government loans ?(4.) If further Government funds were available, on what works could they best be spent with a view to giving the maximum of employment at the earliest possible date?He asked whether the Local Government Board intended to spend the full amount of money sanctioned by the Treasury. As the Treasury was not in a position to provide sufficient money for all the work contemplated, it was most important that those works should be chosen which would use the money available to the best advantage. Some local authorities could, of course, raise money, although the amount which they could raise was very uncertain, but it must be borne in mind that the terms on which money could be raised might be prohibitive.Mr. Symonds said that he would endeavour to supply the information desired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but at the same time it would be difficult to give any very explicit answers. If a local authority obtained sanction from the Local Government Board for a particular scheme, it did not necessarily proceed to borrow the money at once ; it might have funds available already, or, at any rate, it might not be necessary to pay within the present financial year. He would, however, arrange for local authorities to be asked to notify the Board when they proposed to borrow money.(App. XLVI.)Mr. Chamberlain said that local authorities should be encouraged to raise money themselves, and it was intended to maintain the rule that any local authority with a rateable value exceeding 200,0007. must endeavour to obtain it in the open market. In order to make it possible for local authorities to obtain money in the United States, arrangements had been made for municipal loans of this description to be free of income tax.Mr. Symonds said that the fear that restrictions which had been relaxed might be subsequently reimposed was delaying the signing of contracts, and he suggested that some public statement upon this point might be desirable.Sir Percy Bates asked that if any such statement was made the Ministry of Shipping might be consulted, as shipping contracts often lasted over a protracted period, and also the question of freight charges was often an important factor in estimating the cost of a particular piece of work.The Chairman thought it most desirable that a statement should be made in respect of the building trade.Sir Alfred Mond suggested that it should.be extended to other industries, e.g., that of making cardboard boxes.The Chairman, however, thought that this point could better be met when announcing the removal of paper restrictions.Mr. Larke suggested that if any announcement of this kind were made it might induce some contractors to enter into long contracts, and that the Government might meet with difficulty if it were desired to reimpose restrictions.Mr. Symonds said that he believed that a number of the very large building contractors had at the present time no orders of importance owing to the extreme uncertainty of the position.After further discussion, it was agreed that The Board of Trade should arrange for an announcement to be made in the press that if, in regard to building and building materials, it should prove to be necessary, owing to unforeseen circumstances, to reimpose any restriction, no contract entered into before the reimposition of the restriction
219should be affected, unless the power to reimpose it be specifically reserved; and, further, that such reimposition should not apply to any contract in fulfilment of which work had already been commenced.Preference to 9. Mr. Pease suggested that all Government Departments shouldBritish Traders.       agree to buy from manufacturers in England, even if the cost of sodoing were greater than the cost of obtaining the article in a foreigncountry.Mr. Chamberlain agreed with this principle, and added that if it were not possible to obtain the article in England, the order should be placed somewhere in the British Empire, and that only in the last resort should an order be placed with a foreign country. He added that instructions had been issued by the War Cabinet that, in placing orders, preference should be given within the Empire.Mr. Manville suggested that these instructions should be made quite clearly to apply to local authorities.Sir Henry Lambert said that it was a settled policy to place within the Empire orders sent by the Colonial Governments to the Crown Agents, but that it was occasionally necessary, to place a contract in a foreign country.The Chairman recalled an occasion on which railway material for one of the Colonies was bought in the United States just before the armistice.   He enquired whether a thing of this kind would recur ?Sir Henry Lambert said that some considerations might arise which would necessitate going to a foreign country ; for example, he believed that there had been cases in which a special type of loco-motive &apos; was required for a colonial railway, for which locomotives constructed in this country were not regarded as suitable, but it might be taken as certain that all orders sent to the Crown Agents would be executed in this country, or within the Empire, in the absence of some very special reason to prevent this.Mr. Chamberlain said that, in consequence of a decision of the Imperial War Cabinet arising out of a point raised by Sir Robert Borden, he had issued instructions, in the terms of which the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law, and Sir Robert Borden had concurred, that preference should be given throughout the Empire to British traders, both as regards price and terms of contract.After further discussion, it was agreed that Recommendations of a similar tenor to those referred to by Mr. Chamberlain should be circulated to local authorities.The Conference took note that it was a settled policy to place within the Empire orders sent by the Colonial Govern-ments to the Crown Agents, but that it was occasionally necessary to place a contract in a foreign country.kaw Materials: 10. In response to an enquiry by the Chairman, Mr. Larke saidGovernment Stocks, that he did not think there had been any reduction in the prices of metal since the first meeting of the Conference. It was possible that the price of copper had been reduced, but he did not think that the price of lead was likely to go lower than 251. per ton.(App. I, 3.)The Chairman suggested that it would be an advantage if the fact that prices were now at their lowest limit were ventilated in the press.Mr. Larke thought that any such step as that suggested by the Chairman would be difficult, in view of the fact that the United States of America, or some other country, might reduce the price
below the existing price in this country. He felt that if any inspired statement should happen to be stultified by the event in this manner, it would only create a sense of instability and do more harm than good.The Chairman said that he st-ill thought that careful ventilation of the subject in the press would be of material assistance, and he added that he thought it would be desirable to try to break the market in one of the metals and then let the price come slowly up to its normal level.Mr. Larke said that he would convey the views of the meeting to the Minister of Supply.Mr. Chamberlain said he would be glad to discuss the matter personally with the Minister, if Lord Inverfortb would like him to do this.Purchasing Depart-ments: Settlement of Accounts.11. The Chairman stated that, according to the information in his possession, one factor which tended to prevent the resuscitation of trade, was that one or two of the great purchasing Departments of the State were showing themselves somewhat slow in paying for the goods which they had ordered, and he thought that the desirability of settling their accounts as soon as possible should be emphasised to the Departments concerned.It was agreed that The attention of the Departments concerned should be drawn to this matter, and that they should be instructed to take all action necessary for settling their accounts as soon aB possible.(Initialled)      A.

1. The Chairman said he thought it would not be necessary to call another Meeting of the Conference, and that it only remained, subject to one or two points he proposed to raise, for the result of their deliberations to take the form of definite instructions and action.Excess Profits Duty. 2. The Chairman said that various suggestions had been madethat trade was being hampered by Excess Profit Duty and by reason of no announcement being made by the Government on the subject. The matter had been, however, carefully considered by a Meeting of Ministers on the previous day, when it was decided that no announcement should be made on the subject before the Budget statement, and that, in fact, any announcement before then on the matter would have an adverse effect on trade.Paper Control. 3. With reference to Minute 4 of the 4th Meeting, The Chairmansaid that the Treasury had no objection to the Paper Control being abolished forthwith. * (App. IV, 4 ; VII, 4j.)Sir Albert Stanley said that he had just come from interviewing a deputation of News-Print Users, who, after consultation with the manufacturers, suggested that, rather than do away with control completely, it would be better in the interests, both of themselves and the manufacturers, for the imports to be increased up to 75 per cent, of the pre-war imports until the end of April, when all control should be completely abolished. This arrangement would suit them much better than abolishing control immediately. Sir Albert thought that it might be well to adopt this suggestion, as otherwise irritation might be caused.The Chairman,stated that he did not see it would make any practical difference, as it was very unlikely that imports would have risen to 75 per cent, of pre-war imports within two months.It was decided that: The restrictions on the imports of paper and paper pulp be relaxed to the extent of allowing imports up to 75 per cent. ofpre-wrar imports, and that this arrangement should have effect until the end of April next, when all paper control should be abolished.Cotton Industry. 4. The Chairman said that numerous suggestions had been madeas to the desirability of subsidising the cotton industry, and the question arose as to whether it was desirable or not for the Government to interfere financially with industry. He was not referring to subsidy in the sense of giving financial assistance to public works which were being carried out in execution of a policy. He said there were three suggestions which had been made as to how cotton industrv should be subsidised : (i.) That the Government should place large orders and eithertake the profit or suffer the loss, (ii.) That the Government should underwrite or guarantee themiddle-men in the trade, (iii.) That the Government provide a margin up to a certainpercentage of the extra cost due to war conditions.The Chairman said he would be glad to hear the views of the Conference on this point.Sir Percy Bates remarked that from the information he possessed, he felt sure that one of the greatest hindrances to the revival of the cotton industry was the cable congestion which existed, and prevented
221a large amount of business being done. He thought it was a real hindrance.Mr. Illingworth pointed out that the cables were not a Post Office matter,&quot; but that he thought the Government Departments were very much responsible for this, as they had a priority, and exercised it to a large extent on matter which was not always of supreme importance. He thought that if the use of private codes was permitted congestion would be greatly relieved.(App. VIII, XXII.)Sir Auckland Geddes said that it certainly appeared that the cable situation had a strong bearing on the subject, but the state of the cotton market was a greater difficulty.Colonel Amery thought, while not favouring the last two of the three methods of subsidising suggested, that something might be done on the lines of the third, which was, in fact, simply a form of bounty on export. The advantage of a bounty was that it was only paid if results were actually achieved, and it acted as a direct stimulus to individual initiative. He reminded the Conference that the Lancashire cotton trade w7as the creation of the export bounty which had been enforced from 1783 onwards.Mr. Illingworth said the question of subsidising was considered at the beginning of the war. It was then considered very risky, as it was impossible to foresee whether the benefits expected would emerge. He thought the policy was a dangerous one, and would create apathy in the trade. He mentioned that a very similar situation arose in the cotton industry after the beginning of the war, but that it righted itself in due course.Lord Emmott was opposed to the principle of subsidising, but was not altogether opposed to the suggestion made by Colonel Amery. He felt, however, from his knowledge of the trade that it would be a dangerous thing to carry subsidising into effect, and he thought that the wisest course was to give the trade an opportunity of adjusting itself. Nobody knew yet what costs were going to be, and tnat was what the trade was waiting for. He thought it very desirable to investigate the question of relative costs in this country and other countries, and he referred to a case where another country had been able to produce at a much cheaper cost than could be done here. He presumed that the Chairman was considering the question only from the point of view of unemployment, as employers themselves had had so good a year in 1918 that they could afford to wait for a time.&apos;The Chairman said that the point as to whether it was wise to subsidise or not was one of the basic matters to be considered in connection with unemployment. He reminded the Conference that unemployment in the cotton industry was very high, and that it was desirable to bear in mind that the amount which might be paid in unemployment donations might well cover any subsidy which might be granted, either in the shape of bounty as suggested by Colonel Amery, or otherwise. He merely mentioned this, not as expressing his own views, but in order that the possibility might not be lost sight of.Mr. Chapman said he was opposed to any principle of subsidising the cotton industry, as he thought it would have dangerous results. He was inclined to think that too much anxiety was being felt in regard to this industry. It was necessary to bear in mind the peculiar psychology of the people engaged in the cotton industry, and to remember that they were waiting for the market to get to the bottom. He said the China market was recovering, and he expected that the Indian market would recover by the latest in the early summer, and the expectation in cotton circles was that
freights would go down very soon. He strongly urged taking no action in the matter.Sir Percy Bates said he was in complete agreement with Mr. Chapman, and he suggested that not only should nothing be done, but that the trade should be informed that nothing was going to be done by the Government.It was decided that: (a.) It was unnecessarjr and undesirable for the Government to take any steps, by way of subsidies or otherwise, for stimulating the cotton industry.(b.) This was to be regarded as typifying a general principle, which should not be departed from without specific War Cabinet authorisation on individual application.5. With reference to Minute 4 of the 1st Meeting, the Chairman said that the Report of the Sub-Committee, appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Emmott, had now been received and circulated, and he would be glad to hear Mr. Harmsworth&apos;s views on it.(App. XXIX.)Mr. Harmsicorth said he had not had an opportunity of studying the report, and feared he would have to take time to consider it.Lord Emmott pointed out that it was very urgent that this matter should be pushed through without delay, and he thought that it was for the Government to decide to adopt these alterations, and thus to give the Allies a lead.He gave a short explanation of the methods with which the Sub-Committee had worked in getting out the revised Lists &quot; A,&quot; &quot; B,&quot; and &quot; C,&quot; and reiterated his conviction that, if the export trade were to be revived, nothing should stand in the way of these alterations coming into force.Mr. Ilarmsiwrth said he thought it would be necessary for him to consult the Allied Blockade Committee and the Superior Council of the Blockade in Paris. In the meantime he would discuss the matter with his own experts. The United States were anxious to break up the blockade, and if independent action were taken by this country, it would very much strengthen their hands, he therefore urged caution. The naval and military authorities were firmly of opinion that the blockade should not be relaxed, as it was the strongest weapon the Allies had in their possession for imposing terms upon Germany, and he felt that List &quot; C,&quot; as submitted by the Sub-Committee, made a very considerable inroad into the blockade machine. The blockade would cease when peace was sigued in fact he understood that legally it automatically ceased then and as that might only be a matter of a couple of months, he urged that List &quot; 0,&quot; as amended, should not be carried into effect until that time, so that the machinery of the blockade might remain untouched. (App. XXXVII.)Lord Emmott remarked that if the blockade was only going to last a couple of months longer, Mr. Harmsworth need have no hesitation about agreeing to the revised list coming into operation, as the quantity of goods that would percolate in that time into German)- would be negligible.The Chairman suggested that it might be possible to have a short list of articles which were not to go through the blockade, and another list of articles which could.Lord Emmott felt that it might be good policy to let the Germans have some goods going to their country, so that iftit were necessary to reimpose restrictions for bargaining purposes, they would feel the change back to complete embargo all the more.Restrictions on Exports.
222Trade Publicity. 6, JTjg Chairman read to the Conference a letter which he hadreceived from Sir A. Steel-Maitland, with regard to the export of materials to Roumania. Sir Arthur said that there was great want in that country of articles which we could supply, such as agricultural machinery, textiles, &amp;c, if the necessary arrangements could be made as regards credits and the question of exchange. Sir Arthur mentioned that he understood that the Americans, Canadians, and French were already managing to get their goods imported into Roumania.Mr. Rarmsworth said that since the removal of restrictions on the export of materials to South-eastern Europe, there need be no difficulty so far as the blockade was concerned. He felt that we could with safety grant freedom of trade to all the enemy countries except Germany, and he did not think that there was any great danger of goods sent into what was formerly Austria-Hungary filtering into Germany. In reply to a question whether the fact was generally known that restrictions had been withdrawn so far as South-eastern Europe was concerned, he said he was by no means satisfied with the present arrangements for publicity.Lord Emmott said that his Department was in the habit of communicating to the newspapers practically every day such information as was of importance.Mr. Rarmsworth expressed the fear that the newspapers could not be relied upon to do what was wanted in every case, especially if articles sent to them for publication were very long or dull.The Chairman thought it essential that really adequate publicity should be given.Mr. Betterton suggested that if the newspapers did not publish the information desired, it might be given in the form of paid advertisements, especially in the case of newspapers dealing particularly with technical matters.Lord Emmott, however, pointed out that this practice would require Treasury sanction before it could be adopted.The Chairman expressed the view that something might be done by arranging interviews with press representatives.After further discussion, it was decided that: The President of the Board of Trade should be responsible for arranging that adequate publicity be given in connection with decisions regarding British Trade.Wool. 7. Sir Albert Stanley said that he had heard unofficially thatthe War Office had decided to fix the price of wool for eight months, but he was not able to give definite particulars, as his Department had not been consulted. The decisions might be quite correct, but he thought it was a matter for consultation with the Board of Trade. Sir Albert also referred to the anxiety at present felt in Bradford because France had reduced her imports of wool.Mr. Rarmsworth said he was mainly concerned with articles which might by some means or other be used as or for munitions, but he would consider the report of the sub-committee with his department, and be prepared to discuss the matter by the following Monday at the latest. (App. VI, 3.)
Mr. niingworth pointed out that the demands for Bradford goods greatly exceeded its supply, and that the imposition of restric-tions on imports by France was due to financial considerations.It was decided that The Board of Trade should enquire further into the position with a view to obtaining precise information.De^rtrrf^ri ^ 8* The Chairman decided that the point raised by Sir A. StanleyPoHc&quot;1 a *n connect^on with wool showed that there was insufficient co-ordina-tion between Departments with regard to the interchange of informa-tion. It is essential that the President of the Board of Trade should be consulted about all action relating to stocks of raw materials held by Departments of State. No action regarding these materials should be taken by any Department without the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s concurrence, except on the direct instruction of the War Cabinet.(Initialled) A.

Mr. Chapman referred to the timber question, and said that theBoard of Trade had announced that the control would be removed at the end of March, but they were not clear if this would include import restrictions.The Chairman said that timber Would come under paragraph (a) of the decision in Minute 6 of the proceedings of the 4th Meeting, and therefore there would be no import restrictions on it.(App. IV, 6 ; VII, A4.)Publicity regarding 2. The Chairman referred to a telegram that had been forwardedRestrictions on        to him by the Prime Minister from the British Chamber of Commerce,Trade in the Near    complaining of the restrictions on British trade in the Near East. ISast. r        SMr. Harmsworth, referring particularly to Roumania, said thatsuch restrictions had been removed; he understood, however, that
Roumania, for the purpose of exercising control over the kinds of commodities to be imported, was proposing to impose import regulations.The Chairman said that the position was that the British Chamber of Commerce were objecting to the presence of restrictions that had already been removed, and he asked Mr. Chapman whether the Board of Trade were carrying out the decision arrived at in Minute 6 of the proceedings of the 5th Meeting.Mr. Chapman said that the question of publicity was being carefully considered, and announcements were being prepared.At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Chapman undertook to give special attention to seeing that the removal of the restrictions referred to in the telegram from the British Chamber of Commerce were given full publicity, and to expedite generally the carrying out of the policy of publicity.Eeetrictions on 3. With . reference to Minute 5 of the proceedings of theExports. 5th Meeting, the Conference further considered the Report of theSub-Committee on-the subject. (App. XXIX.)The Chairman said that, leaving blockade countries aside for the moment, the question which came before them was as to whethei exports could be free except as regards : 1. Goods required for naval and military purposes. 2. Goods which are or will be required for home consumption orhome manufactures. 3. Goods which are or have been directly or indirectly benefitedby a subsidy or guarantee.He then read to the Conference extracts from letters which showed clearly that there was considerable apprehension existing at the present time in British trade circles regarding the export of wool and cotton. Large stocks were at present held by British traders of manufactured woollen goods, which they could not dispose of owing to the export restrictions. They were in danger of having to sacrifice a large part of their stocks on a falling market in order to realise sufficient cash to pay what they owed. If export restrictions were removed at once, they could dispose of their high-priced goods abroad without loss, whereas, if the restrictions were maintained until the autumn, many houses would have to sell in this country at such a loss that they could not continue business.    (App XXXII.)Mr. Harmsworth said that, about a month previously, a new Free List had been submitted to the Superior Council of Blockade in Paris, and that he had no indication as to what had happened. With regard to the report of Lord Emmott&apos;s Sub-Committee, he stated that he and his advisors had considered it, and they agreed that a large number of articles referred to should be unrestricted, subject to the concurrence (in the case of some of the more important articles) of our Allies, and the naval and military authorities. They had not considered each item scientifically. Apart from the undesirability of ceasing to back up our friends and giving equal facilities to our enemies, one of the results of taking independent action would be that our Allies would prepare Free Lists of then-own, and so the blockade machinery would rapidly be broken up. As an example, he said that if we removed the restrictions on the export of manufactured cotton goods, there was a danger that America would immediately claim the right to export raw cotton, which was one of the ingredients of explosives.   He urged that the
removal of the blockade should not be hurried, seeing that it was improbable that any great increase would be effected thereby in the British export trade, while, by so doing, we ran tiie risk of sacrificing the attainment of some of the objects for which the war had been undertaken. So far as he knew, the ration allowed to neutrals under the blockade was amply adequate to meet their requirements.Lord Emmott maintained that the ration allowed was, in some cases at any rate, ridiculously small, and that the effect of our present policy was that neutrals were being compelled to start manufacturing articles which they had formerly obtained from us. He stated that he believed that the ration of cotton goods allowed to Holland1 at present was only one-third of their pre-war imports. He did not think that if we removed restrictions on the export of manufactured cotton goods, America would insist on being allowed to export raw cotton. He doubted whether Germany was dependent on raw cotton for the manufacture of explosives, since that commodity had not been allowed to go into Germany for the last Z\ years of the war. In any case, Germany would be quite unable to finance any large importation of raw cotton. He entirely agreed that the proposals of his Sub-Committee must be laid before our Allies and before the naval and military authorities, but he felt that it was absolutely necessary for us to do something to steady Germany at the present time, and he thought that the best way of doing so was to give her trade a chance.Mr. Higginson urged that if we too far relaxed our hold on goods imported by Germany, we might be faced with a state of affairs that Germany might refuse to accede to our peace terms. The possibility of further bloodshed was unthinkable, and therefore we could only enforce our terms by economic pressure, which it would be almost impossible to exert if the blockade were lifted. He further pointed out that it was extremely probable that large private German credits had been established in neutral countries, and that these credits would be used by Germany to obtain commodities placed on the Free List.Mr. Harmsworth said that, once we had removed the blockade, we could not possibly reimpose it. He hoped that the blockade would only last for two or three months longer, and by removing it now we should only achieve very small results, which could not justify the risks which &quot;we should be running.Lord Emmott urged, on the contrary, that something must be done to get our trade going, and said that, so long as restrictions were maintained and the necessity for obtaining licences were continued, trade would not be in a position to flow freely.Sir A. King pointed out that it was not proposed to abolish List &quot;C&quot; altogether; in any case, though reduced, it would still be in existence, and therefore the machinery of blockade must to some extent be kept going.4. The Chairman raised the question whether it was desirable to trade with the Germans, in view of the fact that they were not in a position to pay. He recalled the conclusion arrived at by the Conference at a previous meeting. It was advantageous to this country from a financial point of view to export articles to neutral countries, who would pay us for them, and allow them to make what terms they liked with the Germans on reselling the goods.(App. 1,4; XXXVII (c).)Mr. Higginson deprecated any policy of trading with the Germans through neutrals surreptitiously, but he agreed that, if tlie
blockade restrictions were withdrawn and articles were transferred to a Free List, then it was certainly preferable to deal with the Germans through a neutral market.The Chairman expressed the view that whether we wished it or not, the only method by which we could trade with Germany at the present time, would be through neutrals. During the past A\ years, our traders had severed all connection with German traders, and, even if they wanted to do so, months would elapse before they could reopen direct communication. He thought that, if the blockade were withdrawn, and we thus entered into trading communication with neutrals, it would be at least three months before any goods despatched from this country would percolate into Germany.Mr. Cliapman said that he thoroughly agreed with this view, and added that there was another consideration, namely, that, by reopening trade with neutrals, we should enable our manufacturers to start work at once.Mr. lAndon, in connection with the question of the rapid perco-lation of commodities to Germany, pointed out that America had exported ten years&apos; supply of malt to Denmark in the space of a month, and that, no doubt, this large supply was destined, in due course, to go to Germany. It was conceivable that a similar situa-tion might arise in regard to other commodities. He mentioned that America now issued their own export licences against cable advices and guarantees, and that we were handicapped in competing with America, inasmuch as we made it a principle that the guarantee must agree with the application.Mr. Brooke said that he thought lack of shipping Would prove to be a great obstacle in the waj7 of reviving our export trade. As regards food, he thought that foodstuffs, if we exported them, would reach Germany in. a much shorter period than three months.Lord Emmott raised the question of doing business with occupied territories. It had been mentioned to him that day, and he felt that it was undesirable that this should be done through the machinery of the Netherlands Overseas Trust.Mr. Harmsworth agreed. It was decided that Goods destined for the occupied parts of Germany should not necessarily be consigned through the Netherlands Overseas Trust.Eecommendations by Lord Emmott&apos;s Sub-Committee.(a.) Dyes.5. The Conference then proceeded to consider the recommenda-tions put forward by Lord Emmotfs Sub-Committee as regards the transference of certain commodities from Lists &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;to List &quot; C.&quot; (App. XXIX.)In the course of a long general discussion, reference was made to a proposal to keep dyes on List &quot;A&quot; at present, because of the present shortage in this country.The Chairman said that he thought that, except in so far as food was concerned, it should be accepted as a principle that the vague-possibility of shortage at a future date should not be considered a reason for maintaining restrictions on the export of a commodity at the present time. He considered that the dye question required further examination. It seemed most undesirable to retain the products of a new industry solely for domestic use and so prevent them getting a footing in foreign markets.
The question of technical oils was raised, and Mr. Brooke explained that at the present time the Government is the sole importer of oi] seed. They supplied the seed to the mills by which the oil was extracted, and they again supplied the crude oil to the refiners for preparation. He said that at present we were supplying to manufacturers at prices below the cost price. If oil were to be transferred to List &quot; F,&quot; then we must charge a different price on supplies intended for export from the price of supplies intended for home consumption, and this would involve elaborate machinery.Lord Emmott drew attention to the fact that we must beware of the possibility of the United States of America cutting in and offering supplies at a price below that at which we ourselves were offering.Mr. Brooke took oil, which we had accumulated for the manufacture of glycerine for explosives, as an example to show that if we liquidated our stocks below the post-war normal price, we should stop importation. He added that the Food Ministry found difficulty in fixing the prices in many cases, because the proper prices could not be discovered without offering supplies for auction in the market; and as this procedure would have to be applied to each several commodity, a lot of time must necessarily elapse before such experiments could be completed.The Chairman drew Mr. Brooke&apos;s attention to the decision with regard to raw materials held by Government, and said that it laid down a clear policy as applicable to the transactions of the Ministry of Food as to those of the Ministry of Supply, for example.Mr. Brooke said that he was working on the policy defined in that decision.The question of the fruit trade was raised, and The Chairman read a letter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which Mr. Chamberlain stated that, owing to the state of the Spanish exchange at the present time, we should, in his opinion, hesitate before doing anything which would tend to increase our financial obligation to Spain.The Chairman, however, observed that this objection need not apply to the entrepot trade in fruit.Mr. Brooke said that stocks, especially of citrous fruits, were being held up in this country on the chance of export being allowed. Sellers hoped that, if export were allowed, they could obtain better prices for their stocks in Northern neutral markets. He explained that whatever arrangement were made with regard to the import of Spanish oranges, must be applied in the case of the import of Italian oranges. If we allowed Spanish oranges to be re-exported from this country to Norway, we must allow Italy to export some of her oranges to Norway direct. The effect of this would be that we should get a smaller supply of Italian oranges.Mr. Chapman said that he wished especially to emphasise the fact that the whole question of the restoration of the re-export trade required investigation. This trade, he said, was at the present time practically dead, whereas it used to be a most important trade, employing directly and indirectly numbers of people. The present prohibition on re-export did not relate solely to restricted imports, but also to others. For Instance, the prohibition of re-export of cotton was retained to keep down purchases from United States of America (and so protect United States of America exchanges). It was presumed that the re-exports would not have a beneficial effect on other exchanges in a degree that would make up for theR
detrimental effect on the United States of America exchanges. If there was some gain from this purely as exchange policy, there had to be set up against it the great damage that was being done to the economic interests of this country.The Chairman said his intention was to submit recommendations of policy in regard to the restrictions on exports with the following ends in view : (a.) To get the biggest possible Free List at once ; (6.) To get as many manufactures as possible transferred from Lists &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; to List &quot; C.&quot;It was agreed That the possibility of future shortage of manufactures should not be sufficient reason for retaining restrictions on the export of any particular commodity at the present time.The &quot; Black List.&quot; q     r. Lindon raised the question as to what bearing the &quot; BlackList &quot; would have on the matter.Lord Emmott said it was pait of the blockade machine. The removal of it would, of course, help Germany to get her trade back; he could not say that there was any particular outstanding reason for retaining the &quot; Black List,&quot; and it had to be remembered that the French and Italians were precluded by their laws from trading with Germany.Mr. Ilarmsworth said that before removing the &quot; Black List&quot; it would be necessary to consult the Allies, and he thought that the question ought first to be considered as to whether those who had been our enemies should have the same facilities for trading as those who had been friendly to us.Mr. Higginson thought that if trading were going to be allowed with Germany, it would be much better for the Allies to come to a decision upon that point immediately. He pointed out that the &quot; Black List&quot; applied not only to German traders in foreign countries, but that it had a direct economic eflect on the firms in Germany who had established branch houses abroad.Mr. Butler said that the question of the &quot; Black List&quot; had been recently discussed in Paris, and that it was intended to reduce the number of names on the list in South America to 150. The &quot; Black. List&quot; in South America existed rather for economic reasons than for blockade reasons, and thus was different to some extent to the &quot; Black List&quot; in the Northern neutral countries, which included names added both for economic and blockade reasons. He said that he did not think we could abolish the &quot;Black List&quot; in South America without abolishing also the &quot;Black List&quot; in Europe. The French and Italians were prevented by their laws from trading with persons or firms of enemy nationality, and France and Italy looked to us not to let them down by removing restrictions which could not be removed in those countries until peace was signed. He added that the whole question was really a matter for the Foreign Trade Department of the Foreign Office.The Chairman asked whether maintenance of the &quot; Black List &quot; was really hampering British trade at the present time.Mr. Butler said that he thought it was, but not to any very great extent. During the war British traders had broken off&apos; connec-tion with &quot; Black List&quot; firms, and, if the list were abolished, our traders
-   226would not be able, even if they wished to do so, to reopen business at once. Whenever British firms had been advised or compelled to give up trade with undesirable neutral firms, the names of desirable firms to take the place of the former customers had, as far as possible, been supplied by the Foreign Trade Department and the Department of Overseas Trade. He said that American firms were anxious to reopen connection with foreign firms, and as they had been in touch with &quot; Black List&quot; firms more recently than British firms had, he thought that the removal of the &quot; Black List&quot; would help American traders more than ours. The removal of the list would, it was true, enable a certain amount of goods to go to Scandinavia which were at present held up in this country, but it had been the policy of his Department, prior to the imposition of the restrictions under the list, to recommend our traders to dispose elsewhere of goods sold to &quot; Black List&quot; firms, so that he thought that very little stuff was in fact being held up on this account.The Chairman raised the question whether all American firms were as scrupulously avoiding trading with &quot; Black List &quot; firms, and -whether it was possible, if they wished to do so, for American firms to export goods to &quot; Black List&quot; firms in South America.Mr. Butler said that he did not think this was the case, because, first of all, licences had to be obtained from the American Government before the goods could be exported, and the American Government had agreed not to issue licences to export to &quot; Black List&quot; firms; and, secondly, because if any cases had arisen of goods thus being illegitimately exported, we should have received information from our consuls. As to the question whether the removal of the &quot; Black List&quot; would benefit British traders, he remarked that if the List were removed, &quot; Black List&quot; firms would now be in a position to obtain goods at the present prices, whereas other firms who had placed their orders previously would probably have to pay the old price in force at the time of giving the order, which would have been higher than the present price. This might cause trouble with British exporters, as firms who were not formerly on the &quot; Black List&quot; might wish to cancel orders when they found &quot; Black List&quot; firms getting goods at a lower price and at a not much better delivery date.Mr. Chapman asked if a decision on this question could be postponed to a subsequent meeting, as he was anxious to consult the President of the Board of Trade on the question.The Chairman decided, in view of the facts stated by Mr. Butler as to the drastic reduction of the list for South America That it was not necessary for the Conference to take action in this matter.,. With regard to the general policy to be adopted in respect of our export trade, it was decided that (A.) In the case- of exports to countries not included in the blockade area, there should be no restriction, except as regards (1.) Goods required for naval and military purposes.(&apos;Z.) Goods which are, or will be, required for home consumptionor home manufactures. (3.) Goods which  are, or have been, directly or  indirectlybenefited by a subsidy or guarantee.General Policy regarding Exports.
(Appendix VI. )t58(B.) Subject to the above, the policy to be adopted by Depart-ments, with a view to the removal of export restrictions in the case of blockade countries, should be (a.) To establish an efficient contact between themselves for purposes of preparing the details of the proposals to be pressed by the British delegates on the appropriate Inter-Allied bodies.(h.) The general policy which is to guide them in preparing details is (1.) The maximum number of manufactured goods to be included in the Free List.(2.) Of the remaining manufactured articles, as many as possible to be included in List &quot; C.&quot;(3.) It is in the interest of this country to have the restrictions on exports to neutral countries in the blockade areas removed, full consideration being given to the fact that it will take at least one month, and possibly three months, for any manufactured goods ordered by neutrals, after removal of the blockade restriction, to reach Germany in any material quantity. -(4.) All possible steps should be taken with a view to stimulation of the entrep6t trade.Mr. Chapman urged that, when making any announcement as regards the removal of restrictions, we should aim at saying what may not be exported rather than what may be exported.(Initialled)      A.

But in order to compensate officers for the increased responsi-bility of work at the Admiralty, they have recommended special. allowances for officers working there (see Appendix I. Pay of Officers working at the Admiralty).To be increased by 50 per cent, and to be free of income-tax, if this can be arranged with the Board of Inland Revenue without legislation; the number of servants on which the rate is based to be limited, in general only one being allowed below flag rank, unless an officer is in charge of a ship or establishment.To be allowed to all officers working at the Admiralty on the same basis as officers on lodging allowance and compensation at the present time.The Committee agree that married allowances should cease at the end of the present year. In the meantime children&apos;s allowance should be continued, and Officers now receiving the allowance should not become ineligible for it if the effect of the increases in pay now decided upon is to raise their salaries beyond the limit of income laid down for the grant of the allowance.The Admiralty, in Appendix II to their Report on the Halsey recommendations, set forth a number of allowances which they propose should be increased, reduced, or abolished. These proposals, which involve a saving of 65,OO0Z. on the present rates, the Committee approve, subject to modifications on account of other decisions shown above.It is not thought necessary to print here the list of those allowances.THE ARMY.Table Money.1. Under the system at present in force the War Office receives an annual sum (before the war about 10,000Z.) of money from the Treasury for the purpose, the allocation of the money being within the discretion of the War Office.

With reference to the decision recorded in Minute 5 ofMaterial. the 4th Meeting, Mr. Chapman mentioned that he feared thatsome difficulty might be occasioned in the carrying out of the decision, in view of the fact that under regulations until recently m force no second-hand railway wagons could be sold without the sanction of the Minister of Munitions. He thought that the word-ing of the decision contained in the draft Minutes referred to was not sufficiently explicit upon this point.Mr. Layton said that the Ministry of Munitions were removing their control in the matter. It was agreed that In order to remove any possible misapprehension, the wording of the decision in Minute 5 of the 4th Meeting should read as follows: That all control on railway material, whether new or second-hand, and all restrictions on its exportation should be removed forthwith.
Return of Stocks. 2. Mr. Chapman said that the President of the Board ofTrade was of opinion that it was desirable to publish a report of the stocks created during the war in order that the public might know exactly what the position was.The Chairman said that he thought that this matter should be taken up by the Board of Trade., and that such action as was necessary should be taken by the President of the Board, without the question being considered by the Conference.Ee-Axporte. 3. Mr. Chapman raised the question of re-exports, to whichhe had made reference at the previous meeting (vide Minute 5, 6th Meeting). The question was closely connected with that of main-taining our foreign rates of exchange.The Chairman said that he considered that the question should be considered at a subsequent meeting of the Conference, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India would, he hoped, be able to attend.Controls Eier-cised by the Board of Trade.(a.) Coal.     .(b.) Railways.(c.) Canals.(d.) Tramways.(e.) Road Transport.(/.) Horses.4. The Conference then proceeded to consider the question of controls maintained by the Board of Trade, which were set out in a table produced before the Conference. (App. XIX.)It was agreed that This question should be held in abeyance pending the receipt of the report of the Coal Mines Commission.The Chairman said that in view of the fact that the control of railways was to be maintained for two years after the war, and of the fact that it was proposed to transfer the control from the Board of Trade to the new Ministry of Ways and Communications, he did not consider that the question need be considered by the Conference.The Chairman said that the same remarks applied as in the case of railways.The Chairman pointed out that the Ministry of National Service no longer exercised any control as regards priority of labour&apos;, and that the Ministry of Munitions had similarly ceased to control the priority of materialIt was decided that Any remaining control with regard to tramways should be abolished.It was decided that Such regulations as still remained in force should be abolished forthwith.The Chairman pointed out that the only remaining control was over hay and straw, and he asked General Morgan to state what the attitude of the War Office was with regard to the con-tinuance of this control.General Morgan stated that the Army Council did not intend to exercise any control on this year&apos;s crop of hay, but in view of the shortage of fodder in the country it was absolutely necessary that some rationing scheme should be enforced for the present.It was decided that The Board of Trade should communicate with the Controllerof Horse Transport on the subject.
Mr. Chapman said that he understood that the present system with regard to the rationing of petrol and petroleum was necessary for the collection of taxes under the current Finance Act.. Mr. McFadyean stated that this control must be continued pending the passing of this year&apos;s Finance Act. In addition it wTas necessary to exercise a control on the import of petrol and petroleum with a view to securing proper distribution between the Allies.The Chairman expressed the view that it was most desirable that the internal control over retail distribution should be removed, as soon as possible.It was decided that The Treasury should investigate the question with a view to removing the control over retail distribution at the earliest possible date.Mr. Chapman stated that with regard to Egyptian cotton, the British and Egyptian Governments had bought the entire crop, and that an arrangement had been made between the two Govern-ments for the sale of this cotton in this country, which was due to expire on August 31,1919. He said that the Board of Trade were in favour of the removal of the control at the earliest possible date. With regard to non-Egyptian cotton, he said that there was no control in force at present, except as regards the maximum price for raw cotton. Liverpool traders wished to retain the maximum price, as it proved most useful to them in framing estimates for contracts. He, personally, however, recommended its removal when the present arrangement terminated on April 30.It was decided that All control on cotton should be abolished on April 30, 1919, excepting that the control over Egyptian cotton should terminate on July 31, 1919.With regard to timber, Mr. Chapman said that there was no control except in the case of pit-wood, and that the Coal and Timber Controllers feared that a crisis would arise if this control was removed, owing to the shortage of wood for pit-props.The control was of two kinds: (a) Area control, by which pit-wood cut in a particulardistrict could not be sold outside that district.(b) Control of imports, by which the import of pit-wood waslimited to South Wales ports.With regard to the second of these two controls, as it was probable that a higher price could be obtained for imported pit-wood at ports other than those in South Wales, it was feared that if this control was removed all imported pit-wood would go to other ports, and thereby, in view of tonnage&quot; restric-tions, cause a serious shortage of pit-wood in South Wales.It was decided that All control on non-pit-wood timber should-be removed, and that the control on pit-wood timber should be removed on March 31, 1919, unless the Coal and Timber Controllers put forward to the President of the Board of Trade, before March 24,- adequate reasons for the continuance of the control.The Chairman pointed out that a decision had already been arrived at by the Conference regarding the abolition of the paper control (vide Minute 3 of the 5th Meeting).Mr. Chapman said that there was still some question with regard to the continuance of the &quot; no-returiis order.&quot;   It had
(k.) Matches.Commodities controlled by the Admiralty.been agreed that the order should not be revoked without consult-ing the newspapers. The present position was. that the news-papers could not agree, and so the order remained in force.Sir A. Mond said that he thought the reason for the difference of opinion among newspapers was that those newspapers which were endeavouring to increase their circulation desired the aboli-tion of the order, whereas those whose circulation was stationary desired it to be retained.It was decided that This order should be rescinded at once, subject to the concurrence of the President of the Board of Trade, together with other restrictions on paper.After a short discussion as to the necessity for the order restricting the sale of matches other than those of particular brands, it was decided that-All restrictions on the sale of matches should be removed forthwith.5. Mr. Chadwyck-H ealey said that the Admiralty had exer-cised control over various commodities, such as shipbuilding steel, oxygen and hydrogen cylinders, but that the only cases in which they were still exercising control were over hemp, jute and flax, over which the control was exercised by the Admiralty in conjunc-tion with the War Office, the Admiralty being interested in the question in order to ensure an adequate supply of coal bags. The Admiralty was also concerned in the control of Japanese silk. He was of opinion that there was no longer any necessity for these controls to be exercised, and he promised to make arrangements for a tabular statement, showing all the commodities over which the Admiralty had exercised control, to be submitted to the Chairman. (App. XVI.)It was agreed that (a.) The control on hemp, jute, and flax should be considered in connection with the War Office controls.(&amp;.) Steps should be taken to remove the control of Japanese silk.CommoditiesControlled by theMinistry ofMunitions.(a.) Iron and Steel.(b. Fertilisers.(c ) Seeds, Oils, and Tats.6. The Chairman then proceeded to deal with the question of the controls exercised by the Ministry of Munitions, of which a statement was submitted to the Conference. (App. XVIII.)It was agreed that All control should be abolished on April 30, 1919, unless the War Cabinet came to a definite decision to the contrary.Mr. Layton said that the control of ammonia had been rescinded, and that the control of (Kelp group) potassium compounds had been removed. The control of other fertilisers was necessitated at the present time by the Government&apos;s agree-ment with the farmers, but the Ministry of Munitions were taking the necessary steps for the agreement to terminate on May 31*It was agreed that All control of fertilisers should be removed on May 31, unless the War Cabinet came to a definite decision to the contrary.Mr. Layton said that this control was being maintained at present at the request of the Food Ministry.Mr. Coiler said that a meeting was taking place at the Ministry of Food that day on the subject, and that the Ministry hoped that arrangements might be made for the discontinuance of the control at an early date.   He feared that if the control were* The Board of Agriculture were, however, asking for the announcements to be withheld pending consideration of the position after May.
(d.) Blast Furnace Dust(e.) Glass and Glassware.(/.) Clinical Thermometers.(g.) Tungsten Ores.(h.) Mica.[13Tss]removed at the moment some confusion might arise, but he thought that if adequate notice were given this could be avoided. It was decided that The control of seeds, oils, and fats should be removed on April 30, 1919.Mr. Layton said that the control had been maintained up to the present in order to obtain the by-products, but he agreed that this reason for the continuance of the control no longer held good.It was decided that The control of blast furnace dust should be withdrawn on April 30, 1919.Mr. Layton said that the control of glass and glassware (including potassium compounds other than Kelp) had been maintained entirely in the interests of the trade, which was of recent development in this country, and was practically a &quot; key industry.&quot;It was decided that The control of glass and glassware should be transferred to the Board of Trade.Mr. Layton said that the control had been preserved in order to maintain a standard of inspection for the sake of the general public.Mr. Chapman said that two problems appeared to deserve consideration: (1) The maintenance of the industry. (2) The inspection of the product.It was decided that The control of this industry should be transferred to the Board of Trade, arrangements being made, if necessary, by the Local Government Board under their health administration for the requisite testing to be carried out.Mr. Layton said that this control was maintained in order to protect what was a key industry. An agreement had been signed that the output of the Empire should be purchased by the Ministry for six months after the ratification of peace. Negotia-tions were going on with a view to modifying the agreement, as it was clear that, if production continued at the present rate, there would be no demand for tungsten for five years after the removal of the control (say at the end of 1919).The Chairman said that, as the Government had made the agreement, they must adhere to it; but from the point of view of both parties some modification of the agreement was clearly desir-able, and he thought that the Ministry of Munitions should lay emphasis on this.It was decided that The Ministry of Munitions should do everything possible to secure a modification of their agreements with regard to tungsten.Mr. Layton said that mica was required largely for the manu-facture of magnetos, and the Ministry of Munitions hoped that arrangements might be made by which the mica trade would be centred in London. The trade was a very small one, and there were no notable merchants in the trade to whom they could entrust the supervision, e.g., the work of classifying the products by a standard. He thought that the Industrial Section of the Board of Trade would be the proper authority to take up the necessary supervision.T
(i.) Gas.( j.) Gas &quot;Works Retort Carbon.(k.) Machine Tools.(I.) Bricks.It was decided that The control of mica should be transferred to the Board of Trade, and that the Board should use every endeavour to make the necessary arrangements with the most pro-minent firms in the trade.. Mr. Chapman said that the Board of Trade had approached the Coal Controller on the subject of the control of gas. This control was of two kinds: first, in respect of the by-products; and, secondly, as regards the quality of gas manufactured. In consequence of the cessation of hostilities, there was no longer any demand for the by-products, and therefore there was no necessity for the continuance of the first-named control, which it was proposed to revoke. It was necessary, however, to maintain some control of gas in view of the shortage of coal, and for this reason it was not possible to allow the gas companies to restore the pre-war calorific quality of gas. (App. XLIX.)Mr. Layton said that the control had in both these cases been preserved for financial reasons connected with the liquidation of contracts.It was decided that The control of these commodities should be withdrawn on April 30, 1919.Mr. Layton said that the Ministry of Munitions had abolished the control of prices and the licensing system, but decided to reserve the right of allocation of output in order to safeguard supplies for the Government building scheme, because it was feared that if control were withdrawn manufacturers might take advantage of any chance that might arise of disposing of their output at a higher price and so delay the date of deliverySir Alfred Mond suggested that this difficulty might be over-come by including in the contracts some condition as to delivery by a particular date.The Chairman thought the control should be abolished, and that if powers were required later on to ensure the fulfilling of contracts the necessary steps could be taken as and when the occa-sion demanded.It was decided that The control of bricks should be abolished forthwith.Food Restric-tions.(a.) Sugar.(&amp;.) Jam.. 7. The Chairman then referred to the question of food control dealt with in the statement submitted to the Conference by the Ministry of Food. (A pp. XXI.)Mr. McCurdy said that every commodity presented a new question. For example, in the case of milk, negotiations were pending for the control of distribution in order to ensure an adequate supply of clean milk to all classes.Mr. Coiler said that the control of sugar was necessitated mainly on account of the lack of supplies. It had to be borne in mind that five-sevenths of our pre-war supplies came from enemy countries, and the position was further aggravated at present by strikes (e.g., Cuba) and shipping difficulties. He said he believed there were twenty-seven weeks&apos; supplies of sugar in the country, and he added that the Sugar Commission had carried out their task extremely well, and he thought the control could safely be left in their hands until the autumn, when it might be possible to. remove it.Mr. Cotter said that the control in this case also was necessary on account of the lack of supplies.

(c.) Butter.(cl.) Cheese.(e.) Milk.Export Eestric-tions Affected by Abolition of Domestic Controls.Overseas Trade Department.8. Captain Hotham drew attention to the fact that certain articles were never controlled as regards export owing to the fact that the internal control exercised in this country precluded the possibility of export. He said that it might be necessary to see that, after the internal control was removed, restrictions were retained on the export of certain commodities to certain other countries.9. The Chairman referred to some correspondence which had taken place regarding an amendment proposed by Sir A. Mond to the Minutes recording a statement made by Sir A. Mond regarding the Overseas Trade Department. (App. Ill, 1.)After a brief discussion, the Chairman decided that the passage in question should read: &quot; Sir A. Mond said, on the question of office accommoda-tion, that an extension of the Foreign Office building had been contemplated, but that it had been stopped owing to lack of materials, and he added, in regard to Sir A. Steel-Maitland&apos;s point, that he had understood recently from Sir A. Stanley that in a scheme that is contemplated for reorganising the Board of Trade it is proposed that the Overseas Trade Depart-ment should become attached to or even absorbed in the Board of Trade.&quot; In view of the possibility of such a reorganisation, the question of where the accommodation of the Overseas Trade Department should be situated had become more than ever doubtful, and must be postponed until the other question was settled.&quot;(Initialled)        A. C, G. .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., March 12, 1919.this year&apos;s fruit crop was rendered more difficult owing to the fact that no sugar could be allowed to private makers for this purpose. It was true that arrangements had been made for a special ration of sugar to jam producers last year, but he doubted whether it could be done this year. On the other hand, it had to be borne in mind that confectioners were now allowed an unlimited supply, and that the ration of individuals had been increased.Mr. Cotter said that from the point of view of supply butter was the worst commodity with which they had to deal. He did not anticipate there would be an adequate supply of butter until June 1920. However, he hoped that rationing could be abolished this summer, the control of distribution only being maintained.In the case of cheese, Mr. Cotter said the difficulty of supply was largely connected with tonnage restrictions. The Treasury had been asked to sanction the purchase of the Canadian crop of cheese, but he feared that, owing to lack of tonnage, we should not obtain it when we required it, even if the Treasury gave their sanction.With regard to milk, Mr. Cotter said that, as already stated by Mr. McCurdy, it was not proposed to withdraw the control of milk, as it was hoped to institute extra standards of purity and to grant permissive arrangements to municipalities for reasons of public health.-Mr. Cotter, in conclusion, said that his Ministry were anxious to know on what permanent department the question of the control of prices should devolve.

Mr. Chapman said that the Coal Controller and the TimberPitwood. Controller were both strongly against removing pitwood control,but that they were prepared to modify it.The Chairman said in these circumstances it would be advisable for him to discuss the matter with the Coal Controller and the Timber Controller, and he asked Mr. Chapman to arrange with them to see him the next day, and for him to be present as well.Paper Control: 9. With reference to Minute 4  (;)  of the  7th Meeting,No-Pveturns Order.    Mr. Chapman said that Sir Albert Stanley was particularly anxiousthat the Paper Restrictions (No Returns Order) 1918 should not berevoked for the present.
Control of Road 3, ]jf r Chapman said that, although he considered the organi-Transport. sation for the control of road transport could be reduced to aminimum, it was desirable that it should be maintained, and it was proposed that it should be transferred to the Board of Trade with a view to subsequent transfer to the new Ministry of Ways and Communications. The maintenance of the organisation waR also very desirable just now in view of the railway trouble. It was decided That the machinery of control over road transport should be maintained.Re-Export and 4. Mr. Chapman said that the re-export and entrepot trade wasEntrepot Trade. 0f great importance in this country. It had been destroyed during the war, and it was essential that it should be revived as quickly as possible. The Treasury refused to agree to freedom of import into this country for the purpose of re-export, as it was calculated to vitiate their support of the foreign Exchanges. The Board of Trade were extremely anxious to restore this trade which was in form partly trans-shipment and part entrepot. Mr. Chapman pointed out that the Liverpool cotton market was maintained because it was possible to hold large stocks in Liverpool, as there had been a big re-export trade in cotton; but if the re-export trade was lost this country would probably lose the cotton market. He thought that the proper thing to do was for the Treasury to let the exchanges go. The rates of exchange were purely fictitious, as the real par was, at any rate, in the case of the American Exchange far below the figure to which the rate was kept.Mr. MeFadyean pointed out that the question of ceasing to support the American Exchange, which was the only one at present being supported directly, was not only a financial one, as political considerations entered into the case as well. So long as the Chancellor of the Exchequer felt it necessary to support the American Exchange, he would not be willing to sanction unrestricted re-export in articles of American origin. Unrestricted re-export might result in a considerable proportion of the commodities in question being sent from this country to France, Italy, and Belgium, which in effect would mean that we were borrowing money in the United States in order to lend it to our Allies. The withdrawal of support would simplify the problem, though it would not necessarily prevent the re-export of American goods to our Allies and the consequent burden on the sterling exchange. The amount of re-export of this nature would then depend upon the comparative ease with which the Allied trader could raise credit in the United States and in this country. He pointed out, further, that it was only a limited amount of re-export trade which was being hampered by the financial considerations alluded to.The Chairman said he understood that American traders were giving longer credits to the French. The American Government had decided to give no credits to France except in respect of orders for American goods placed by the French Government. He asked whether we were losing much of the trade that formerly went through England, by reason of this arrangement between America and France.The Chairman said that he felt unable to alter the decision without discussing the matter with Sir Albert Stanley, and he sug-gested that Mr. Chapman should ask Sir Albert to be present at the meeting with the Coal Controller and the Timber Controller on pitwood, when this matter could also be discussed.
Sir Percy Bates was of opinion that we were not losing much. He thought it was cheaper for the French to import into this country by reason of the British freight rates being lower.The Conference then considered some articles which were the subject of re-export and entrepot, and it was stated incidentally that there was a surplus of rubber in this country.Mr. Amery said, in regard to rubber, that the only restrictions were those which prevented the export to the blockade countries which were very greatly in need of the material, and for which we were the natural entrepot.Lord Inverforth was of opinion that the proper course was to open the markets in respect of all these materials, and he did not think this would cause a slump, but he would not recommend doing this until the blockade was lifted.The Chairman said that the question before them was as to whether it was probable that our re-export and entrepot trade would be helped if it were decided that support should be withdrawn from foreign exchanges. He said it was necessary to consider not only raw materials, but also manufactured goods. The point that was very strongly before him was that this country appeared to have a chance of having a larger entrepot trade than ever before. Germany would have no long credits, but would require raw materials (in fact, the whole of Europe was short of raw materials), and it would be possible for this country with foresight and enterprise to hold stocks of materials and to build up a very large entrepot trade.Sir Percy Bates pointed out that if this support were withdrawn the exports from the Empire generally to America would be stimulated. He was strongly in favour of withdrawing the support.Mr. Chapman agreed and pointed out the effect it would have in addition in the way of simplifying the import restriction policy, as once the Treasury ceased supporting the foreign exchanges they would have no reason for asking that imports should be restricted.Lord Emmott said that all the advice he had received from business men and others was in the same direction.Lord Inverforth was of opinion that there was no other course open but to withdraw this support from the exchanges.Mr. Illingworth agreed, but he was not sure as to how far it was wise to do this before the blockade was lifted ; he thought this appeared a point which required careful consideration. Apart from the question of blockade, he had no hesitation in letting the exchanges go.The Chairman agreed with Mr. Chapman that one of the effects of this would be that restrictions on imports would be removed except in the case of manufactured goods not essential to the needs of the country. Carrying this policy into effect might work hardships in certain cases, but it was essential for the general benefit of trade in this country that the step should be taken, and in the long run it would have nothing but beneficial effects. He thought, therefore, that strong representations should be made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer drawing his attention to the commercial advantages which would result from the discontinuance of the present policy of artificially maintaining the exchanges.Mr. McFadyean said that he thought that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would welcome such a recommendation from the Conference.
Cables and Com-munications.5. Mr. lllingworih referred to a Memorandum which he had prepared for the Chairman on the subject of Cables and Com-munications, and drew attention to the difficulty he was experiencing in obtaining the demobilisation of men required for his services. He also drew attention to the manner in which he was limiting the Government priority on cables and telephones in order that every possible hindrance in the way of trade improvement should be removed.GoreinmentControl.6. Mr. Chapman said he was not at all certain that all controls had been considered by the Conference, and he thought that steps should be taken to ascertain what controls there were outstanding.The Chairman instructed the Secretary to take the necessary action for ascertaining if any, and, if so what, controls were still outstanding.The Chairman said in reply to Mr. Chapman that, in deciding to remove controls, the intention was that the Control Orders should be revoked and not merely suspended.(Initialled)      A. C. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 18,1919.It was agreed-That the War Cabinet should be asked to give an early decision as to whether the political or other advantages of the policy of supporting foreign exchanges outweigh its manifest commercial disadvantages.It was also agreed That it should be an instruction to the Board of Trade that they should urge the Port of London Authorities to take immediate measures to assist and encourage the tranship-ment trade in every possible way.

With reference to Minute 4 of the 8th Meeting, theChairman announced that the support of the American Exchange had been withdrawn as from the 20th March.Controls not already specifically dealt with.
Publicity. 3. Mr. Chapman suggested that it should be announced thata list should be published of all controls that were being retained and stating that all other controls were abolished.The Chairman said he proposed to have this done at the end of the month, but that some special wording would be required in the case of food controls.Restrictions on Exports to Places within the Blockade Area.4. Lord Emmott submitted the following resolution for con-sideration: That all yarns, piece-goods, and other manufactures of cotton, wool, jute, and silk, be transferred from the Prohibited List to the Free List with the least possible delay, to which be added linen manufactures and rubber manu-factures other than tyres.Lord Emmott said that if it were not possible to have a. com-plete Tree List, he urged that at any rate, the proposed resolution should be adopted.   One of the main reasons for trade being in a state of stagnation was the difficulties of the guarantee and certificate system.   It was practically impossible to obtain these guarantees, and consequently the United Kingdom was in a very disadvantageous position compared with other countries.   The only remedy for this was to put as many articles as possible on the Free List.   He understood that one of the reasons against this proposal would be one of a- purely military nature, but as against the military reasons for not relaxing the blockade, he desired to point out that one of the most potent weapons they would have if the blockade or part of the blockade were removed, would be the re-imposition of the blockade or the fear of it.   As a matter of fact, however, he. was not asking for the complete removal of the blockade, or for the destruction of its machinery, but only that it should be partially raised.   It had already been partially raised in the case of food. Another argument which he understood would be advanced against his resolution, was that if cotton manu-factures were allowed through the blockade, the United States would immediately want raw cotton to be allowed through, but those who put forward this argument seem to forget that the raising of the blockade in respect of raw cotton might well have a steadying effect on prices and so benefit rather than injure the cotton industry in .this country, but in any event, it was not at all clear that the&quot; United States would tak^ the attitude suggested,:setting out the principles that it had been decided should govern the question of food controls. He enquired whether the decisions of the Conference on import and export restrictions were being fully carried into effect.Mr. Chapman replied that there was a Committee sitting and at work in regard to imports, and that the decisions of the Conference were being given full effect. In regard to exports to places outside the blockade area, Lord Emmotfs Council were making recommendations which were being adopted.Lord Emmott remarked that he was quite satisfied that all was being done that could be done, but he pointed out that in the case of raw cotton, the Treasury had raised difficulties, and though the control of the American Exchange had gone, they were still obdurate.The Chairman pointed out that the decision in Minute 7&apos;(a) of the 6th Meeting did not provide for Treasury objection having any effect, and that the matter should be raised at once with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Before the War the textile markets of the Northern Neutrals were almost wholly British, but now the United States were exploiting the markets, as they were in a position to promise to fulfil new orders, but this country was not, because it could not complete the old ones. He felt sure that the bulk of the odium of the blockade fell almost entirely upon this country, particularly having regard to the large number of orders which had been placed here and paid for, and in respect of which no delivery had been made. Lord Emmott quoted Dutch figures which had been obtained by the War Trade Intelligence Department, and from these figures he showed how the export of various articles from this country to Holland had dropped, by reason of the embargo placed in October 1917, to practically nothing in the year 1918. On the other hand Germany had kept up her export trade as far as she could. He felt that the very rigid blockade of manufactured goods as a weapon of war had not proved to be of any great value. He thought that this was proved by the figures he quoted, for it had really only succeeded in hampering our own trade while it had not intimidated the neutrals concerned. He wondered whether the Foreign Office really felt that the military reasons outweighed the tremendous advantages that would accrue to the trade of this country and its morale if his proposition were accepted.The Chairman enquired what the unemployment figures were in the cotton districts.Mr. Chapman replied, speaking from memory, that there were about 200,000 out of work in the north-west district, of whom 70,000 were cotton operativesMr. Illmgworth said that the position in the West Riding was getting serious.,   Mr. Harmsworth pointed out that he and his advisors were doing their utmost to preserve the blockade and its machinery, and he believed they had succeeded in keeping it intact, notwith-standing the tremendous pressure that had been brought to bear upon it.  He did not think that Lord Emmott&apos;s argument could prevail.  If manufactured textile goods were allowed through the blockade he understood the United States would immediately demand that the same freedom should be applied to raw cotton, and France and Italy to raw silk.  Both these commodities were essential materials of War.   The blockade was an instrument of war, the preservation of which, for the time being, the very highest military opinion,  including Marshal  Foch,  demanded.    The onslaught that had been made on the maintenance of the blockade had been tremendous.  There had been demands that such articles as nickel, glycerine and rubber be allowed through.   These were all essential ingredients of munitions.   The United States were doing their utmost to break the blockade and for this reason it was all the more essential that this country should not in any w-ay weaken it.  He thought that German opinion was hardening and he understood it to be the view that it might in certain eventualities be necessary to threaten Germany with further hostilities, or with a stiffening of the blockade.    If matters pursued their normal course it was quite possible that the blockade would be removed within a very short time and he thought that any good that might accrue from its immediate relaxation would, therefore, be infinitesimal.   Mr. Hafmsworth reminded the Con-ference, however, that the Bolshevik disturbances in Europe might lead to such eventualities as would make the retention of the blockade, with its machinery unimpaired, absolutely imperative, and, furthermore, if there were Bolshevik disturbances in Central Europe, the military argument for retaining the blockade would be all the more strengthened.
The Chairman thought that the various points at issue re-quired to be considered separately. He asked Mr. Harmsworth if the machinery of the blockade would disappear when commodities of the class mentioned in Lord Emmott&apos;s motion which had been bought and paid for but not delivered, were treated as being on the Free List.Mr. Harmsworth said he did not think that such a limited export would have the effect of breaking the machinery.The Chairman pointed out that it followed, therefore, that the export could be increased at any rate up to a point, without the machinery being broken. He reminded the Conference that so far as the feeling in this country was concerned, it was not a matter so much as to what was the reason for unemployment as to what the people of Lancashire thought was the reason for un-employment. He asked if the Foreign Office would object to goods of the nature he had described, which had been bought and paid for but not delivered, being allowed through the blockade.Mr. Harmsworth said that he, personally, had no objection whatever, but that it would be necessary to consult the Allied Blockade Committee.Lord Emmott pointed out that even if his resolution were passed, very little would percolate into Germany.Mr. Harmsworth pointed out that on the one hand it was urged that by passing this resolution the unemployment problem in Lancashire would be greatly assisted, while on the other hand, when the military reasons for maintaining the blockade were put forward, it was urged that very little would percolate into Germany. He thought that we wanted our goods to get into Germany but that we fought shy of the words &quot; direct trade,&quot; and were endeavouring to get them into Germany under disguise. He thought there would be many advantages in starting direct trade with Germany again.Lord Emmott said that he was of course only referring to goods that could be used for War purposes when he said that very little would percolate into Germany.Mr. Illingworth questioned the value of the blockade as a military weapon. He thought perhaps the Food Blockade was useful, but that was already partially raised. He felt that a very strong case had been made in support of Lord Emmott&apos;s motion.Colonel Amery said that it woidd be interesting to know what percentage of these goods would percolate into Germany, and what percentage would be available for War purposes. If this motion were adopted the trade of the country would be greatly helped and the country would be strengthened for meeting any possible renewal of hostilities, and this factor would more than balance any ill that might accrue. This was looking at the matter in its very worst aspect, and he felt that there was no doubt Lord Emmott&apos;s motion should be adopted.The Chairman said in considering this question it was necessary to balance two psychological factors, one was the feeling of the country that, for some extraordinary reason, the Govem-ment was preventing trade getting underway, and the other was the effect on German opinion if we removed the, restrictions against the import of these goods into Germany. In regard to the latter point it was open to argument as to what effect that
5. Mr. Black.stated that the fundamental reason for the con-tinuance of the Road Stone Control was shortage of supplies. In 1918, the output of road stone was 2,188,000 tons, whereas it was estimated that the present requirements amounted to rather more than 5,000,000 tons.    There was a similar shortage in tarred* Subsequently Captain tlotham stated that the Admiralty were unable to give tbeir assent to this decision until the figures to be submitted by Mr Chapman were availableRoad Stone Control.removal would have. It might make German opinion think we were softening, or on the other hand it might create fear off the reimposition of restrictions. His own feeling was that it was unwise to adopt Lord Emmotfs motion particularly as it was hoped that the blockade would very soon be removed. He thought a great effort should be made, however, to secure passage to neutrals of goods, of the class dealt with in Lord Emmott&apos;s motion, which have been ordered and paid for, but which had not yet been delivered. It was a half-way step that might well placate opinion in this country. In a very short time the whole question could be reconsidered and then they might be able to see clearly what the main decision should be. But in any event, even if they decided then to adopt Lord Emmotfs motion, it would be weeks before it would be in operation on account of the necessity of putting the matter before the Higher Authorities. His suggestion, however, would not entail delay as he understood Mr. Harmsworth would put it before the Allied Blockade Committee in London immediately.Captain Hotham enquired whether there would be any rationing of these goods, and if supposing there were nine months&apos; supplies in store in this country for the neutrals the ration would be affected.Lord Emmott thought it would hardly be necessary to ration, as he understood there was not a full year&apos;s supply in store.. The Chairman requested Mr. Chapman to submit figures showing what proportion the total quantity of these goods bore to a full year&apos;s supply.Mr. Chapman thought that the Chairman&apos;s suggestion as to removing the restriction on goods, (of the class mentioned and which had been ordered and paid for) should be extended to goods which had been ordered before the embargo was placed on their export in October, 1917, and in respect of which no payment had been made. If this were not done, as soon as the blockade was lifted a large proportion of the latter orders would be cancelled.It was decided *(1;) That all yarns, piece-goods and other manufactures of cotton, wool, linen, jute and silk lying in stock in this country in respect of which(a.) orders have at any time been placed in this country by neutral countries and payment has been made,(&amp;.) orders were placed in this country by neutral countries before the embargo was put on their export, whether the goods have been paid for or not,should be treated as if on the Free List.(2.) Mr. Harmsworth should be responsible for submitting the proposal to the Allied Blockade Committee with a view to giving practical effect to this decision forthwith. &quot; (App. X.)
materials. The output in 1918 in this case being f million tons, &quot;Whereas the requirements were 1.800,000 tons. In consequence of the shortage of supply, it was necessary to control prices and supervise distribution. They feared the removal of the control would be followed by a considerable rise in prices, and would * also mean that supplies would not be available where they were most required. The roads of this country had suffered most in districts which had been occupied principally by troops, namely, counties south-east of a line drawn from the Wash through Salisbury, whereas supplies of granite and other hard materials used in road making were mainly obtained in Wales, the North Midlands and the West of - England. Prior to the war, the southern counties of England had been mainly dependent upon the Channel Islands for supplies. War conditions had interfered with supplies being brought over from the Channel Islands during the war and now the high freight charges prevented supplies being obtained from the Channel Islands. Mr. Black said that as regards facilities for rail transport, the Committee had at its disposal only 11,000 wagons, whereas it was considered that 37,000 wagons were re-quired for the proper transport and distribution of supplies by land. He believed that approximately 1\ million tons of road making material was imported from other countries, such as Germany, France and Belgium before the war.Mr. Killick stated with regard to the question of imported material a suggestion had been made that boats should be placed at the disposal of the Road Board, who should purchase granite f .o.b. Channel Islands for use in the south-eastern counties of England. This proposal had conditionally been approved of by the Treasury, but the -shipping facilities at present available were limited. The result of freedom of control of shipping had resulted in ship-owners taking the most remunerative routes, to the detriment of the Channel Island granite tradeMr. Killick stated that the Committee had, after careful con-sideration of the whole question a month ago, come to the con-clusion that it was xinost desirable that the control should be continued for at least three months more, pending the arrange-ments for allocation of supplies for this season&apos;s work. He felt that the Government ought to help Local Authorities to make the necessary arrangements to obtain the stone where it was wanted to make good the damage done by the Military. He urged that the removal of the control -should at least be postponed for a month to enable the contemplated allocations for the year to be carried into effect.Mr. Chapman thought that whereas the control had unques-tionably been necessary during the war, it was now no longer necessary. It was, in fact, undesirable, inasmuch as it meant that the Control Board stood between the producer and the con-sumer and was frequently a hindrance to both. He urged that the way to increase supply was to let the trade alone and allow private enterprise to look after itself. The Control Committee did the work as well as it was possible for any Committee to do it, but mistakes were bound to occur, with the result that employment was limited. He added that if the control were to be abolished, it ought to be abolished before the allocations for next year were made, as otherwise thev would not merely be leaving the industry free.The Chairman said that, as in all controls, the psychological factor had to be borne in mind when considering the question of continuing the control. There was bound to be a period of un-certainty while the trade was finding its own feet after resting
upon Government support. He realised that during this period some local inconvenience might be caused, but he did not think that there was any danger of disastrous consequences, and he thought that the risk might as well be faced at the present moment as at the end of one or two months&apos; time. He added that as the control of the Board originated in a Defence of the Realm Regulation, it might be necessary for a general licence to be issued as a temporary measure until the necessary steps could be taken for the Regulation to be revoked.It was decided that: The Road Stone Control should be discontinued with effect from the 31st March, 1919.Cement Control. 6- Ifc was decided thafc :&quot;The Control of Cement should be rescinded as from the 31st March, 1919.(Initialled)   A.

Litchfield, Assistant Secretary.Restrictions on Exports to Places within the Blockade Area.1. The Chairman referred to the decision arrived at in Minute 4 of the proceedings of the 9th Meeting, and said that he understood Mr. Harmsworth desired to reopen the question.Mr. Harmsworth said that since the 9th Meeting he had had correspondence with the Chairman on the subject, pointing out that his advisers were dismayed at the decision that had been arrived at, as it was felt that it would mean the dissolution of the blockade. He pointed out that the Allied Blockade Council had considered a resolution to the effect that certain important categories of goods such as raw cotton, cotton manufactures, wool manufactures, yarns and silk should be derationed for the northern neutrals, and had communicated it with a favourable recommendation to the Supreme Blockade Council in Paris. Again, a largely extended Free List had been prepared. Curiously enough a communication from Paris had crossed that of the Allied Blockade Council, stating that the American Representatives were proposing that restrictions imposed by the Associated Governments upon trade with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland should be suspended. This proposal had yet to be considered, and therefore he thought that
the operation of the resolution of the Conference should il suspended pending the decisions of the Supreme Blockade Counc, and particularly having regard to the fact that in a very short time the blockade might be removed.The Chairman asked Mr. Hannsworth whether, in view of the general desire for the relaxation of the blockade, so far as the northern neutrals were concerned, he thought that there was any danger in putting the resolution into force.Mr. Harms-worth replied that he would like time to consider the point. He was not in favour of the American proposition which he had outlined. It was clear that the Supreme Blockade Council must consider both proposals. He himself saw no objection whatever to the resolution in itself, but he could not assent to it, having regard to the ulterior effects it would have. If it was brought into operation, the whole of the Inter-Allied arrangements would have to be reviewed, and while this might be welcomed by the United Stales, he did not think it would be so in the case of the other associated Powers.Sir Alexander King pointed out that the chief trouble was obtaining guarantees against re-exportation, and this would not be removed by derationing.The Cliairman said that the position was getting very serious in this country from&apos; the point of view of unemployment and trade stagnation. He had no doubt whatever in his own mind that the resolution should be given effect immediately. The United States were taking steps to re-establish the International Chamber of Commerce, and were making great efforts to obtain trade connections in Europe. It was only proper, therefore, that our merchants should be given every opportunity of re-establishing their own connections, and of wiping out the bad effect that had been produced by their inability to execute orders. The Conference had full Cabinet authority to take a decision on the matter, but as the Foreign Office were not able to agree, he felt that the only action that could properly be taken having regard to the urgency of the question was for him to telegraph^ to the Prime Minister that night, putting the case before him, for his decision.The Use of the Blockade for other than War Purposes.2. The Chairman referred to the Memorandum (U.A.S.T.18) by the Foreign Office, drawing attention to the fact that the blockade machinery was being used for commercial or industrial purposes, and not solely for the purposes for which it was originally instituted.Mr. Harmsworth stated that this strictly was not a blockade question, but he understood that the machinery of the blockade was being used for ulterior purposes, particularly in the case of wool, and those in charge of the blockade were receiving the discredit that attached. He believed that the recommendations made by the Wool Council were made on behalf of various elements, both labour and manufacturing. He felt strongly that the use of the blockade should be limited strictly to war measures, and that this was a point that should be cleared up.Sir Arthur Goldfinch pointed out that lists A, B, and C, really had nothing to do with the blockade authorities. He understood that the policy of the Government was, in deciding what restrictions should or should not be imposed, that the position in this country should be examined from the point of view of both employment and of scarcity of the material in question. The Wool Council was a body appointed by the Government to make recommendations to them.    When the Sub-Committee of the Conference, which had* The contents of the message sent are reproduced as an Appendix to these Minutes.
been appointed to consider the relaxation of restrictions on exports was sitting, one of the main governing points before them was the scarcity of the particular article they were considering; and that was a policy that commended itself to the Wool Council. The Council had definitely come to the conclusion that the exportable surplus was very limited. The point, therefore, seemed to be whether they were correct in adopting that policy.Sir Alexander King said he agreed with Sir Arthur Goldfinch in principle, but he thought that wool waste and rags should be put on the free list, ami yarns and noils should go on list C. What they wanted to get rid of was the licensing system, which was a great encumbrance.The Chairman said there was no question but that the scarcity in any particular commodity had to be taken into account, but he asked if anything had been done to free wool for export.Sir Arthur Goldfinch said that he did not think that there was any objection to freeing wool waste and rags, but if the export of noils was permitted, there would probably be a shortage of hats. In regard to yarn, he pointed out that we used to have large imports from Germany, but that Germany would not be able now to export yarns, and therefore it would be foolish for us to export. He also pointed out that the Bradford spinners were in a difficulty, owing to the French not having carried out their contracts. In October last, at the urgent desire of France, backed by the United States, yarns had been freely exported to France at a considerable sacrifice to the rest of our export trade; and now France was, technically, restricting the imports of yarn. The spinners, there-fore, felt that to obtain proper protection, it was both necessary and desirable to have a British guarantee as well; and the Wool Council therefore decided, having regard to the lack of protection that had been afforded to spinners during the war, that the export of yarns to France should be restricted. The spinners wanted to protect their contracts. It is true that employment was bad, but he did not think that the removal of restrictions would affect that part of the situation materially.Colonel Amery said that it seemed to him that the best way to meet the difficulty would be to impose an ad valorem licence fee in the place of the present licensing system. This would be auto-matic, and would save a lot of irritation, and at the same time would meet the point raised by Sir Arthur Goldfinch.Mr. Chapman agreed that that would be a better method, but he questioned whether it quite met the case. He thought that in coming to any decision on this matter the attitude of the labour members of the Wool Council should be borne in mind. They were strongly of opinion that any relaxation of restrictions on the export of wool would have deleterious effects on employment in this country.The Chairman asked Sir Arthur Goldfinch what the result would be if it were decided that the arrangement that had been come to for the protection of the Bradford spinners should be terminated in a month hence ?Sir Arthur Goldfinch replied that any such decision would need to make all commodities the subject of export, as the principle had been laid down that scarcity was to be taken into consideration. As a matter of fact he believed the lifting of the blockade and the consequent scarcity would, in the long run, be a good thing for the wool industry. If, however, [such a decision were taken, he felt that great irritation would be caused in the trade. The actual effect would be that there would be a scarcity for three months; and he thought it would also reflect on the state of employment. [1312] . Z

Appendix XI.RELATION OF CAPITAL TO FOREIGN TRADE AND INTERNAL INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT (cp. Report, section 14).Sir A. Steel-Maitland to Sir Auckland Geddes.Department of Overseas Trade, Dear Geddes, 73, Basinghall Street, February 25, 1919.A QUESTION vitally affecting foreign trade and employment was brought before me very prominently this morning by the deputation of men interested in the resumption of trade with Roumania. There is a great want in Roumania of articles we can supply, e.g., agricultural machinery, textiles, &amp;c. People in this country would be only too willing to supply the demand ; the gap to be bridged over is: (a) credits, (b) the question of exchange. Members of the deputation asserted to me most positively that the Americans, Canadians, and French were managing to get goods in, and had arranged in some way to bridge this gap. I think it is a question really worth discussing with the Treasury.Yours, &amp;c.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.P.S. I think that this morning you were right as regards the scarcity of capital. The trouble arose from a lack of understanding as to what exactly is meant by capital, and the confusion between it and money or credit or deposits.Fundamentally, from the point of view of economics, capital is that amount of production which is not at once consumed, but is laid by in the form of instruments to facilitate future production. This, I am sure, is the way we have to look at the national problem in its basis, before we translate it into terms of the money market. Once anyone keeps to this point of view, it is clear that capital will be short. Production during the war was amazingly increased, but it was so largely devoted to producing articles which were consumed at once without militating further production (e.g., guns and shells), and consumption of other kinds was so great (e.g., clothes, rolling-stock), that it is certain that a large amount of ordinary maintenance and renewals were neglected, and will have to be made good. In other words, our capital is really much less than it was before the war. We can only make it good through our own increased productivity; and, as you perfectly rightly said, expenditure in social improvements is like an investment which may bear great interest after years have passed, but will bring in comparatively little at the moment. Social schemes, therefore, mean locking up a good deal of productivity just when as much as possible should be set free for replacing the deficiencies of the past four years. I am sure this is the real truth, but the difficult gap to bridge is to explain how these fundamental truths work out in the language of the money market, i.e., what is the true meaning of the swollen deposits in the banks, &amp;c.Appendix XII.NOTE ON THE PLACING OF CONTRACTS IN RELATION TO PROVIDINGEMPLOYMENT (cp. Report, section 19).Sir Robert Home to Sir Auckland Geddes.Ministry of Labour, Montagu House,Whitehall, February 27, 1919. APPENDED is a note by Mr. McEwan, a very capable business man, who has been doing gratuitous work for one branch of this Department.    In considering provision of employment on reconstructive work I think his note is worth taking into consideration.R. S. HORNE.
Note by Mr. McEwan.1. In connection with concrete steamers and tugs, a very large outlay has already been incurred by the Government in starting six or eight yards in various parts of the country, which 1 understand have been entirely shut down since November, throwing about 3,000 men out of employment, mostly unskilled labour. In order to save some-thing of the initial outlay, as well as to prevent this serious influx of unemployed on a market already overburdened with men, would it not be wiser for the Government to continue these works, say for this year, in.the hope that a private enterprise might take over the whole affair and carry it to a successful issue?2. There is a smaller scheme of the same sort at Stranraer, where large preparations had been made by a Glasgow company, and where I am informed, the men, though not actually dismissed, are being held over and presumably paid without any employment.3. There are contracts for bonded stores at Bristol and at Glasgow depending upon, permission from the Treasury to utilise money from excess profits, permission which has been given in similar cases previous to November, and which is now withheld.   These contracts involve an outlay of 20,0O0L and 40,000L respectively.4. There are a jetty and wharf at Portsmouth Docks, the contract for which amounts to about 25,000/., and which would employ directly 100 men and indirectly another 50 for twelve months.5. There is a 30.000L contract for bunkers for a company at Wednesbury, also delayed because of Government sanction.6. One large Contractor is prepared to build houses in a certain district up to 250,0001. outlay, provided the Government removes the SGI. restriction as to rent, which was legalised at the beginning of the war, and which, owing to entirely altered conditions in cost, is now absolutely obsolete.7. There is a very large contract for the Watford Junction Railway, which was on the point of being fixed early in 1014 and has been shelved. This alone would give an immense amount of employment if it could be reinstated.February 14, 1919.Appendix XIII.MEMORANDUM ON THE   POSITION   OF  THE   CONTROLS   EXERCISED BY THE DIRECTORATE OF RAW MATERIALS (cp. Report, section 28).ALL these controls are in a state of rapid liquidation, and the intention is to bring them entirely to an end within a very few months.Wool. A very elaborate system of control existed in 1917 and 1918 which regulated in almost every particular both the use and the sale of wool and the semi-manufactured products. The system of rationing wrool to manufacturers comes to an end on 31st March. The collection of British skin wool on Government account comes to an end on the same date. It has already been announced that the incoming clip of British fleece wool will be dealt in without any interference from the Government. At the end of February all restrictions on the importation of wool from overseas and the sale of such wool were removed. It is intended in the month of April to cancel any of the regulations which still remain, and the effect will be that the Government will not intervene in any way in dealings in wool or wool products, except to the extent which is necessary owing to the large existing stock and the contracts for future delivery of wool purchased by the British Government from the Australian and New Zealand Governments. The disposal of this wool is being conducted under the advice of the Wool Council representative of every branch of the trade, and it is hoped so to arrange as to allow the market to settle down as nearly as possible to the normal post-war level.Export restrictions on wool are still maintained as the local scarcity due to freight shortage has not yet been remedied. It is hoped that in June or July at latest every class of wool product will be free from export restrictions, unless blockade restrictions are still necessary. Manufacturers of woollen goods are most anxious that aR export restrictions should be removed.
Jute. The import of raw jute is still only permitted under licence, but this Department has already expressed the opinion that it is time free imports should be re-established. The Government was compelled during the war to undertake the import of jute on its own account, and severely to ration the consumption, but, rationing has already been terminated, and the Department has ceased making any fresh purchases from India. The Department, therefore, is only concerned to liquidate the stocks carried over from the war period, which it is doing with strict regard to replacement prices, which of course involve a serious loss.Flax. As regards Russian flax, this Department has been for two or three years the sole importer, and.up to the present carries almost the total stocks in the country. It is not intended to make any further purchases, nor does the Department consider any restrictions are now required. Our only concern is to liquidate our stocks, which offers no difficulty as the unsettled condition in Russia is so great an obstacle in the way of new importations. Irish flax is in a different position. The Board of Trade, at the request of the flax spinning industry, is making arrangements to purchase the next Irish crop, or at least to guarantee a price, and some kind of control will be necessary in view of this operation.Hemp. This Department has been the sole importer of hemp for several years, but restrictions have now been removed, and we are only concerned iri selling off our stock which will involve some loss.Tanning Materials. During the war we imported considerable quantities of tanning materials, and licensed and superintended all other importations. We have now removed all restrictions, and are. concerned only in liquidating our stock, which as in most other cases will involve a loss owing to the great reduction of freights.Hides and Leather. A most complicated system of control grew up during the war, each step being taken to meet the present requirements of the military aggravated by the growing freight shortage. The trade were consulted throughout as the control became tighter and tighter. Since the armistice a very considerable relaxation has taken place, but it will certainly not be possible to remove several important restrictions before 30th September. Up to that date the Ministry of Food consider it essential that British hides should be taken over at a uniform price, and this entails a number of consequential regulations. The Treasury desired to restrict importations of leather from the United States, aud the Department have therefore continued to purchase the strictly indispensable supplies. It is proposed to continue the embargo of the import of American leather till 30th June at least.The importation of hides from South America is now quite free. It is necessary, however, for the present to restrict dealings in raw and tanned hides from India. The tanning of cow hides in India was artificially stimulated in order to supply material for British Army boots, and the position of stocks in the United Kingdom taken together with the position of tanners in India, make it necessary to consider very carefully what measures should be taken during the difficult transition period. The matter is being very thoroughly discussed at present between the India Office and this Department, with the assistance of experts who have been specially brought from India for this particular purpose. The leather trade of this country is kept informed of these discussions, and is keenly interested in the line of policy to be adopted, which may have far-reaching consequences in regard to inter-Imperial trade.March 10, 1919. A. II. GOLDFINCH.Imperial House.Appendix XIV.MEMORANDUM BY SIR A. GOLDFINCH ON WOOL, JUTE, FLAX, HEMP. LEATHER, HIDES, SKINS, AND TANNING MATERIALS (cp. Report, section 28).THE commodities to which this Memorandum refers are in a totally different position from such articles as lead, which are held in stock in quantities far in excess of normal peace requirements    This Department^ commodities have certainly during the
war been to a very large extent used for direct war purposes, but almost no new machinery has been set up and the process of industrial transition is simply that of bringino- back to peace production the factories which were used for that purpose up to August0].914. Broadly speaking, our problem up to the armistice in the matter of raw materials was a struggle against the difficulty of keeping supplies up to a safe level, and we have not carried over into the present period more than moderate stocks. Almost without exception it is necessary from now onwards to provide for a further stream of fresh supplies, and all our arrangements are based on the desire to bring back to the normal channels of commercial importation the provision of these further supplies.We have, therefore, to deal with stocks acquired by the Government during the war in such a manner as to keep manufacturers going continuously, to put them in a position to compete so far as possible in all the markets, and at the same time to bring about as rapidly as possible a state of affairs in which fresh importations may be made by private traders in the usual way without either interference.&apos;or special subsidies on the part of the Government.We have arrived at the definite conclusion that for all these purposes the correct and only safe method is to fix the selling prices of Government stock as near as possible to replacement value without regard to the actual cost of the stock. In most cases that cost through excessive war freights, &amp;c, is above the replacement value, but it is not so in all cases. With the single exception of jute (which will be referred to separately later), we have every reason to believe that British manufacturers using these materials are in a perfectly good position to compete in foreign markets as well as to hold the domestic market. This being so, there does not appear to be any reason for reducing the Government selling prices below replacement value, more especially as it must be evident that to do so would be virtually prohibitive of the resumption by private traders of importation on their own account. How could we expect importing merchants to begin operations at to-day&apos;s wrorld prices if the Government is to compete against them in the English markets by selling at artificially low prices ? Even as regards manufacturers, the advantage of obtaining artificially cheap materials is a doubtful one, for buyers of their articles would begin to demand that prices of the finished articles should be in proportion to this temporary cheap supply. This would increase the present very serious difficultv of maintaining the large orders which the manufacturers have on their books from the war period, and which is one of the chief -complications of the present difficult trading situation. It is evident also that the artificial cheapness thus arrived at could last no longer than the Government stocks, that is to say, four, five, or six months, as the case may be, and more harm than good would result by putting English export trade on a false basis for that period.Jute. -This is theone commodity in which this Department is interested,and in which British manufacturers are finding a real difficulty in meeting competition from abroad. The position briefly is that, before the war, jute at, say, 407. per ton could be manu-factured into cloth at a cost of 111. per ton in India and 15Z. per ton in Dundee. Owing to the increased cost of labour and other factors of much less importance the manufacturing cost in Dundee has arisen to 33Z. per ton, while in India it is practically unaltered. The pre-war difference of 4Z. per ton was not sufficient to prevent Dundee carrying on a flourishing export trade in many markets, though Calcutta had conquered some of the largest ones. The difference of 221. per ton is so great that it seems probable that Dundee will lose all the markets in staple goods, even the British markets, and will only maintain its place with regard to a number of specialities which Calcutta has neglected or is not able to deal with. Dundee manufacturers are asking for protec-tion against Calcutta by means of a tariff, and if they cannot get this they would like to have the Government stocks of jute sold to them far below the present replacement value (thus doubling the inevitable loss owing to the heavy fall of freights). It is perfectly obvious that such an arrangement would be nothing more nor less than a subsidy to the Dundee manufacturing trade at the direct expense of the Exchequer, and that it would come to an end with the present Government stocks which it is not intended to replace. While it lasted it would be difficult for private importers to undertake the responsibility of contracting for forward supplies of jute at 107. or more per ton above the British Governments selling price in Dundee. At most, therefore the situation would be alleviated for a few months, and the forward position would be made more difficult than ever. .This Department could not agree to any such short-sighted measure.) u T00^&apos; stoc^s m the United Kingdom are below normal, but the Government holds large quantities in Australia and New Zealand.   Taking, as a whole, the world
stocks of wool, they are regarded as adequate, but by no means excessive. By agree-ment with the Australian Government prices of wool in Great Britain during the war were maintained considerably below the level (about 35 per cent, below) at which the United States were buying their domestic wool and South American wool. Since the war the United States have brought down the selling price of their large stocks to the British level, and have announced their intention to follow the British action in the matter of prices.The policy of this department is to encourage a flow of wool from all sources to this country without imposing any restrictions on private trading. By this means the British market will be kept in touch with all other markets. In the matter of disposal of Australian and New Zealand wool the department regards itself as the trustee of the Australian and New Zealand Governments, and feels bound to market its stocks carefully. This means that, if the open markets of the world have a downward tendency, which is by no means certain, we shall follow their downward course rather than lead it. At present British manufacturers are at least on equal terms with any manufacturers in the world in the matter of wool materials, and it is intended that they shall be under no disadvantage in the future. There is no unemployment in the wool industry, and on the contrary there is good demand for new textile machinery to increase the power of output. The future is, however, uncertain, owing to the disturbed state of Europe and the world generally.Indian Hides. The only item in the Departments list of commodities in which there is more than seven months&apos; supply in stock is Indian hides, of which we hold perhaps fourteen months&apos; normal consumption. We are in close consultation with the trade on this matter. A very strong desire exists to increase the British power of treating these hides. It is, however, by no means desired that by any artificial cheapening of Indian hides in this market we should be debarred from taking our full share of the future production of India. It is recognised that the Government of India could not possibly consent to be deprived of good markets for future production, and if Great Britain chose to live on Government stocks for a year without making further purchases, India would necessarily have to seek, a market elsewhere. Before the war most of these hides found their way to Germany, and they will find their way there again, directly or indirectly, unless they can be dealt with elsewhere.General. If any proposals are made for re-selling Government stocks in this country below the world&apos;s value for the purpose of stimulating British manufacturers, it is evident that special measures must be taken in order to secure the advantage for those manufacturersAt yesterday&apos;s meeting a very general feeling was expressed that all restrictions upon commercial dealings and upon export should as promptly as possible be removed. To the extent to which this is done there ceases to be any guarantee that the artifically cheap prices will be secured to British manufacturers. This, it appears, can only be done so long as the war system is maintained of the issue of Government owned material direct to individual manufacturers on some rationing principle. If these ration arrangements are abolished, sales at bargain prices will, to a very large extent, find their way into the hands of merchants, who will re-sell them here or abroad, wherever they can get the best profit.On the other hand there are undoubtedly diplomatic difficulties in establishing any preferential system of rationing British manufacturers.1 enclose a copy of a telegram from Lord Beading to the French Ambassador of Commerce, dated 31st December, in which, by special authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government, Lord Reading gives certain assurances to the French Government amongst others that &quot;the economic equilibrium should be established by so exercising any controls as may be in force as to secure that raw materials are available so far as practicable to the manufacturers of the different Allied countries, at the same price, subject to natural differences due to geographical considerations, &amp;c, and to special circumstances.&quot; Although Lord Reading&apos;s telegram contains several reservations, the general purport is quite clear, and is incompatible with any policy which would give to manufacturers a marked advantage in the supply of raw materials through Government action.Finally, it is submitted for consideration that in certain leading industries, in which a heavy fall in the price of raw materials has taken place, no immediate advantage has resulted to the industries, and in fact almost the contrary would appear to be the case. A smaller proportion, for instance, of cotton manufactures was taken for Government purposes than almost any of our other leading manufactures. The great disorganisation and depression which has occurred in cotton since the armistice is due much less to the withdrawal of Government orders than to the decline of 30 per cent, in the price of the
raw material. Taken together with the &quot;fact that spinners&apos; and manufacturers&apos; abnormal profits are known to have loaded war prices to a very great extent, this has caused all contracts in existence when the armistice occurred to appear extraordinarily dear, with the result that buyers all over the world are&apos;engaged in endeavouring to cancel their contracts on one pretext or another in order to replace them with contracts at about half the price. It is not suggested that there is any patent method of avoiding such disturbances. It is only suggested that the case of cotton goods is a clear proof that a heavy fall in the cost of raw material is by no means necessarily a stimulus to trade, and, on the contrary, may precipitate the period of stagnation which in a number of our trades must be faced sooner or later in the transition from war to peace conditions.Telegram from Lord Reading to M. Clementel, December 31, 1918.I HAVE submitted your Memorandum of the 12th December as to control of raw materials to the British Government.I am authorised to inform you that the British Government view sympathetically your proposals 1. That while the governmental controls over the purchase and allocation of commodities should be removed when practicable, it is desirable that, in the&apos; case of essential foodstuffs, textiles, and leather, certain minerals, timber, and fuel, the controls shall be removed gradually, and with co-ordination of the action of the several Governments.2. That the Associated Governments should take the requisite steps (if necessary by the continued exercise of the present controls) to secure that France and other countries, whose territory has been in enemy occupation, secure the importation of commodities essential for her national existence and reconstruction.3. That economic equilibrium should be established by so exercising any controls as may be in force as to secure that raw materials are available so far as practicable to the manufacturers of the different Allied countries at the same price, subject to natural differences due to geographical considerations, &amp;c, and to special circumstances.The attitude indicated above must, however, be taken as subject to the important reservation that the question of the continuance of the control of different commodities must depend in the main upon the association of the United States in the policy. Any observations, therefore, which the British Government may make must always be taken as subject to the attitude adopted by the United States.The British Government agree that the Programme Committee should be asked to consider the question in relation to their respective commodities and to propose a plan, and they are informing their own representatives on these committees of the general policy. British attitude as indicated above. They are at the same time being informed that the communication made to them be understood as being no more than an indication of a general desire to meet the French view, and not as a specific instruction as to the course of policy to advocate on the particular Programme Committee on which they are representatives, as the application of the policy to particular commodities must necessarily be considered in the light of the special circumstances affecting the control and allocation of the commodity in question.I have not dealt in this telegram with the question of freight and shipping, as I understand that Sir Joseph Maclay has communicated with you separately on that subject.READING.December 31, 1918.Appendix XV.MEMORANDUM ON DISPOSAL OF RAW MATERIALS (cp. Report, section 28).IN connection with the proposed policy of selling off stocks of raw material at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in order to assist the re-starting of industry, the case of wool will need special consideration.
According to the latest purchase arrangements with Australia made in 1918, the basis price of I5%d. per lb. is to be final as regards wool used for British Government purposes (and as regards a certain amount of wool allotted to France). In respect of all wool sold for other purposes Australia is to receive a half of any excess obtained over basis prices.As regards New Zealand wool, the arrangement is that the bonus to be paid to New Zealand shall be calculated at the same rate per lb on the total amount of wool delivered to His Majestys Government under the contract, as is paid to the Commonwealth Government per lb. of wool so delivered by them.The arrangements contemplated by the War Office for disposal of Australia and New Zealand wool, as the result of the changed conditions arising out of the armistice, were explained to the Commonwealth and Dominion Governments by telegram as recently as 8th February (copies attached). If it is contemplated to alter these arrangements, it will be essential for Australia and New Zealand to be informed in advance. Also, it would be undoubtedly in the spirit of the whole purchase scheme to obtain the previous concurrence of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments if it is contemplated to sell the available stocks of wool at prices lower than ordinary market prices.Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand.(Sent 4-30 P.M., February 8, 1919.)February 8th. Wool situation changing rapidly in all parts of world since armistice signed. Contracts for military woollen equipment have been freely cancelled, United States and United Kingdom, and such production coming rapidly to an end. Demands civilian woollen goods have not yet fully taken place military orders, and wool markets somewhat depressed. United States Government, who are principal holders wool stocks in that country, holding fortnightly auctions. Prices, which in Boston were 30 per cent, above British level, have now fallen to British level, and at each auction many lots withdrawn for want of buyers. South American markets stagnant. There are no buyers anywhere near 1918 prices, and sellers not yet ready accept prices which buyers offer. Nevertheless, South African farmers almost unanimously declined offer made by His Majesty&apos;s Government purchase present season&apos;s clip on same terms as agreed with Australia and New Zealand. South African wool will be sold to Japan, United States and United Kingdom in the open market. Transactions up to the present limited. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided not to buy British clip 1919 because farmers in general dissatisfied with prices paid 1918, which were 60 per cent, over 1914 prices, and because Government&apos; does not now require British wool military purposes. Under new conditions therefore, British, South African, East Indian and South American wool will be sold freely British markets without restriction. Australian and New Zealand wool held by Government under Purchase Scheme will be auctioned London open to all British and Allied buyers. Reserve prices will be fixed somewhat below present Bradford issue. At present, it is intended that first auction shall be held early in April, owing to greatly improved shipping prospects which will render supply sufficient by that date.Not thought possible handle by London auctions more than 100,000 to 160,000 bales monthly, which may not be sufficient meet demand. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore proposes continue issue additional quantities wool concurrently with auction sales to British and Allied buyers at fixed issue prices revised from time to time as occasion requires.   Up to 30th April at least present issue prices will be maintained.Referring to second sentence of my telegram of 6th June, His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that purchase extends to 30th June, 1920, and will then terminate.   Is this in accordance with understanding of your Government ? Milner,
Appendix XVI.CONTROLS ADMINISTERED BY THE ADMIRALTY (cp. Report, section 28).Colonel Storr,THE following information as regards the various controls administered by the Admiralty is submitted.It will be noticed that two kinds of control have been in force so far as Admiralty are concerned, those de jure and those de facto. The de facto controls existed by reason of agreement between the Admiralty and the various trades concerned. They were considered binding, if not in a legal sense, and were loyally carried out by the trades concerned: -Controls &quot;de jure.&quot;Nature.	Date of Order Made.

CONTROL OF HAY AND STRAW BY DEPARTMENT OF HORSESUPPLIES AND TRANSPORT.B. H. Selbie, Esq., to S. J. Chapman, Esq.1, York Place, Baker Street, Dear Sir, March 13, 1919.WITH reference to our conversation yesterday, all the Orders issued by this Department have now been withdrawn, with the exception of the Hay and Straw Order, of which I enclose a copy. In view of the serious shortage of hay it is necessary that this Order should remain in force, at any rate until the end of September. The Order limits the consumption of hay by civilian horses to an average of eight pounds per horse per day and, even on this low ration, it is estimated that there will be a deficit in the hay supply for the current year (i.e., to September 30th) of over 200,000 tons. This deficit will have to be made up by importing hay from Canada or elsewhere, and this point is now under the consideration of the Army Forage Department and of the Central Council for Civil Supplies.On the 6th instant 1 sent a report to the President on the work of this Depart-ment generally, recommending that the Department should be disbanded at the end of this month subject to some other arrangement being made for the administration of the remaining Order referred to above being taken over by some other Department of the Board of Trade.As you are aware, the hay-stock of the country is controlled by the Army Council, and the probability is that that control will be withdrawn at the end of the present crop year, i.e., the 30th September next. The question as to whether any control of next year&apos;s hay crop by some other Government Department will be necessary will have to be considered later on, hut this will depend on the prospective supplies.Your faithfully,R. H. SELBIE, Controller of Horse Transport.Appendix XXI.FOOD CONTROL. Memorandum by the Food Ministry. (Reference U.A.S.T.-10.)U.A.S.T.-13.GENERALLY the intention of the Ministry of Food is to relax or remove control as far as possible before the 15th November, 1919, so that any control then remaining necessary can be transferred to permanent Government Departments. The functions of Food Control Committees lapse by statute on the 18th November, 1919.At present, the Ministry of Food exercises control as regards (1) Supply, (2) Distribution, (3) Consumption, and (4) Price, the degree of control varying in the different foods and feeding-stuffs controlled, for example : Control under all four heads is exercised in the case of sugar, meat, butter, and jam. Control of supply, distribution and prices is exercised in the case of cereals, cheese, imported bacon, and tea. Control of distribution and price is exercised in the case of home bacon, milk, cocoa, and dried fruit, while control of prices alone is exercised in respect of a number of commodities. Control wiU be removed in the case of tea on the 24th March, and in the case of bacon (except as regards prices) on the 31st March. Early removal of control wiU probably be practicable in the case of oilseeds, cocoa, dried fruits, jam, potatoes, and possibly cheese.Meat control in some form wiR be necessary until October, when the present guaranteed prices to farmers expire. Owing to a shortage of supplies, cereals, sugar, and butter may need to be controlled for some time longer for the following reasons; 
Cereals.(1.) Prices of home-grown cereals are presumed to be guaranteed to farmers. (2.) There is a shortage of feeding-stuffs (other than oats) and especiallymaize.of(3.) The bread subsidy involves some degree of control.(4.) Purchases are made in association with Allies, and independent purchases on private account cannot be resumed without Inter-Allied agreement.Sugar.(1.) There is a shortage of supplies of cane sugar, and no immediate prospect ofsupply of beet sugar. (2.) The present cost is above the present price.Butter.There is a world shortage of butter which may be expected to continue until the spring of 1920. While distribution may have to be regulated, it is not proposed to maintain the full system of registration of customers, involving considerable local expenditure, for the sake of butter alone.Control of prices will probably need to be continued after the dissolution of the Ministry of Food. The rise in fish prices on the removal of control indicates that it may be necessary to retain the power to reimpose control of prices, as a normal function of Government.It must always be borne in mind that the European food situation renders it impossible to forecast with any accuracy the ultimate removal of control, especially in view of the fact that under present arrangements the available tonnage is wholly inadequate to meet Allied demands, much less to afford relief to liberated and enemy territories.The annexed table indicates the control exercised in the case of specific commodities.Control by Ministry of Food, March 1, 1919.Supply.*Distribution fTo Dealers.To Consumers.Consumption Rationed.!Price.5Remarks, Decisions, &amp;c1.

For all practical purposes, however, the Wheat Commission could go out of business by next harvest, so far as buying for the Allies or even for this country is concerned. They are, however, entirely in the hands of the bread subsidy.   When the price of wheat is on a parity with the 9d. loaf, that is to say,
-when the average price of imported and home-grown wheat is somewhere about 62s., the activities of the Wheat Commission will be brought to an end. So far asmaize and barley are concerned, decontrol is imminent. The Commission hold very considerable stocks of pulse, but these can easily be cleared at a loss.The Sugar Commission is very doubtful about its prospects. On the whole there is every reason to anticipate that the sugar control can be removed by the autumn, but there is no certainty. For example, the Shipping Controller has asked the Commission to avoid requiring shipments from Java owing to the shortage of tonnage, and to resort to Cuba instead. Now there is a general strike in Cuba, which affects at once production and shipment. I merely mention this to show how precarious the position is.Meat and Fats. There are two considerations governing the continuance of the meat division. First, the guaranteed prices for British cattle, which continue until 30th September. Secondly, the genuine danger of the American Trust. It is, however, hoped, although it cannot be promised, that meat control will cease by the beginning of October. So far as fats are concerned, these chiefly appeal to the consumer in the form of margarine, which is already decontrolled. Other fat products, such as linseed cake, and even soap, are, of course, bound up with this branch of the Ministry, but there is every reason to expect that this division can be dissolved by the 30th June.Milk and Dairy Produce. Milk rather stands alone. For reasons of health, we have given an indefinite pledge in favour of control, and it rests with the Government to decide the details of policy. In any event, the Ministry of Health would be the natural receptacle for any transferred powers in this respect. Cheese will be entirely decontrolled in the early summer. Butter is a grave problem, for the reasons stated in the memorandum.Fish, Fruit, and Vegetables. Our experiences in respect of potatoes have been such as to decide us never again to control this crop. There is every prospect of the entire division being wound up in September at latest.Bacon, Hams, and Lard. These have already been decontrolled, and another six weeks will see the end of them so far as we are concerned.Miscellaneous. Tea has already been decontrolled, but it will take nearly twelve months to absorb the considerable stocks. Such commodities as dried fruits, coffee, and cocoa can be got rid of comfortably by midsummer.Appendix XXII.MEMORANDUM BY THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL ON TELEGRAPH COMMUNICATIONS (cp. Report, section 34).1. THE delays on telegraphic (and telephonic) communications, both at home and abroad, are serious, and on the whole greater than at any time during the war. Trade is hampered, and public complaint is general and increasing.2. On the Eastern Company&apos;s system, the delay on commercial traffic to Egypt, India, and the Far East is eight to ten days, to South Africa six to eight days, and to South America three to five days. To get a reply by cable from India may therefore take nearly three weeks, and from South Africa a fortnight. The congestion is partly due to the interruption of cables, which the company is doing its utmost to repair, but mainly to the volume of traffic, which is now two and a half times the pre-war level. The greater portion of this is Government traffic, which averages about 350,000 words a week, and absorbs from 70 per cent, to 80 per cent, of the available cable capacity. An auxiliary wireless service to Egypt has been started, but it will not carry enough traffic to afford any substantial relief. The Post Office have urged the Departments which make most use of these cables to restrict their traffic, and to allow less urgent messages to be sent part of the way by post. But the result has not been encouraging. When it is possible to remove the censorship, commercial traffic will be reduced by 20 per cent, by the readmission of private codes. But in the meantime, if a reasonable service is to be given to the business community, a drastic restriction of the Government traffic is essential.I recommend that the Departments using the cables (especially the War Office) be instructed to reduce their messages to the utmost limit, and that Government telegrams (other than those marked for special priority) should be treated on an equal
footing with, private traffic. This would mean that when the cables are congested, some of the Government messages would be posted to Marseilles or Gibraltar, and would be delayed three to five days.3. On the Government cables to France, which serve Italy and countries beyond, the delay is about twenty-four hours. Large numbers of non-Government telegrams are sent by post in both directions daily. Cable ships are at work on repairs, but at this time of year weather conditions are adverse and progress is slow.The congestion is due (1) to the number of wires allocated to various Government Departments; (2) difficulty in getting telegraphists demobilised from the army. Although several new cables have been laid to France during the war, the number of channels available for general purposes is less than half what it was before the war, and the traffic passing over them is greater.I recommend that the Departments which have had special wires reserved during the war be now asked to release some of them.4. At home there are delays on non-Government telegrams of 0 to 8 hours, and the trunk telephone routes are badly congested. The principal factors are (1) excessive Government traffic, which averages 1,000,000 messages a month as compared with 50,000 to 60,000 per month before the war; (2) shortage of staff. I have circularised the various Departments asking them to reduce the number of telegrams sent by their officers, but there has not been sufficient time for the result to make itself felt. Judging from past experience I am not sanguine. If this does not produce the desired effect, I recommend that the priority now given to Government messages be removed, except as regards those sent by higher officials at the Headquarter Offices and marked for special priority.5. But the most urgent need is the return of the skilled Post Office staff from the army. About 11,000 telegraphists and 10,000 engineering workmen were released by. the Post Office for military service. Up to the end of February not more than 15 per cent, of these men had been returned. Until a much larger proportion come back, I cannot provide the operating staff required to deal with current traffic, or the engineering staff to make good arrears of repairs, maintenance, and new construction. I have asked already for the release of 1,000 telegraphists and 1,000 skilled engineering workmen per month, and I repeat this request.ALBERT H. ILLINGWORTH.March 17, 1919.Appendix XXIII.MEMORANDUM BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL G. J. S. SCOVELL ON THE REPATRIATION OF DEMOBILISED MEN (cp. Report, section 30).1. Army Arrangements.The delay in repatriation has been very largely due to the unsatisfactory state of organisation of the Repatriation Record Office at Winchester.Owing to the inability of the Record Office to find the men to fill available berths, it has been impossible during the past few weeks to fill all the accommodation allotted by the Ministry of Shipping.The War Office are now fully aware of the urgency of the whole problem, and drastic steps have been taken by the Director-General of Mobilisation, War Office, to get both the Record Office and the Camp at Winchester properly organised, and in a few days&apos; time both should be functioning normally.An interval of one month is required from the date of the man&apos;s arrival at the camp, before his embarkation can be carried out, for the purpose of settling up, &amp;c, and final leave; the accommodation in the camp has been increased from 4,000 to 8,000 that is to say, the authorities will be able to have 8,000 men in the camp (organised in ccmpanies by destinations) and 8,000 on leave as well.Trouble has been experienced with many officers and men who elected to be demobilised and take deferred passages. Their complaint is that they had been misinformed by their Officer commanding unit on the advantages of going on the deferred group.   In practice, early accommodation for men returning overseas can
only &quot;be obtained on application through the military authorities, consequently men who have elected to take deferred passages and to be demobilised at once, having-spent their money or on finding that they wish to get off at once, then discover that they rank second in priority for passages to those remaining (in khaki) in the repatriation camp at Winchester.2. Royal Air Force Arrangements.The expected requirements in passages all over the world amount to 6,000 first-class and about 400 third-class passages, of which some 400 have sailed, and some 40 to 50 have left on their own.Up to the 3rd March, the Royal Air Force had applied to the military authorities for 844 passages all over the world, of whom since the New Year only 326 have sailed.These figures include 1,200 first-class and 100 third-class passages for South Africans, and 1,100 first-class and 200 third-class for Canada and United States of America.It has now been ruled that Air Force cadets are to receive first-class passages,, which will add to the difficulties of transportation.3. Shipping Accommodation.The whole situation is summed up in a statement made by an official of the Ministry of Shipping that &quot; We are trying to do in a few mouths with very much reduced liner accommodation what in ordinary times it would take five years to do with our pre-war shipping.&quot;It seems that the only possible method of speeding-up lies in the immediatft utilisation of the twenty or more Rners now lying in German ports. There seems,, however, to be no exact knowledge of what condition these ships are in, nor how long: it will take to put them in an ocean worthy condition, or when their fate will be settled at Paris. Apart from the above, there are two or three other factors which will assist, in some degree towards a speeding-up process, viz.: (a.) The cessation of strikes in home and in South American ports.(o.) An absence of any further strikes in the shipyards at home, thus permittingof the early reconditioning of liners handed hack by the Admiralty, (c.) The possibility of the utilisation of naval units, in connection with which itis understood that a committee is now sitting under the chairmanship ofthe Fourth Sea Lord.The following observations may be made with regard to particular routes :  (1.) North Atlantic.There appear to be no special difficulties, as the American authorities are slowing down their rate of demobilisation, and moreover the War Office exercise complete control over the shipping facilities granted to the Canadian and American authorities.(2.) South America.Strikes in the docks at London and Buenos Aires have added to the congestion, 123 boats having been held up.The position is further aggravated by the legal difficulties arising in connection with the entrance into the Argentine of third-class passengers, but with this the Foreign Office is being asked to deal.(3.) South Africa.The congestion is aggravated by the pressure which the Union authorities are exerting to have the South African contingent returned home before all others. The War Office is most anxious that some steps should be taken to place more ships on this route, if only it were possible to do it without robbing other routes.(4.) India and the Far East.iJne difficulties here are not great, inasmuch as there are three routes open, \a) the aU-sea route, (6) overland to Egvpt, (c) via North America, but congestion in [1312] 2 F*
the Pacific prevents this route being used to anything more than a slight extent. The coming hot weather will debar the repatriation of wives and families during the summer months.To relieve matters the Ministry of Shipping have arranged to have allotted further, though inferior, accommodation on board some of the slow outgoing ships, and the Japanese will be asked to do the same.4. Arrangements for giving Priority in Urgent Cases.The Director-General of Mobilisation has undertaken to go personally into the question of giving priority of passage to the 2,500 names which have been submitted to the Officer-in-Charge of Repatriation Records, Winchester, by the Overseas Trade Department.G. J. S. S.March 6, 1910.Appendix XXIV.EEPORT OF SIR A. STEEL-MAITLAND&apos;S SUB-COMMITTEE ON SHIPPING FACILITIES FOR COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS AND MEN AWAITING REPATRIATION (cp. Eeport, Section 35).A MEETING was held at the Board of Trade on the 20th February to investigate the arrangements that can be made for accommodation in available shipping for commercial men, and those who Jiad come to this country voluntarily to enlist and are waiting to be repatriated. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Bridgeman until Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland was able to attend.There were also present Sir Percy Bates and 1    r      nr . ,      P o, -   -Mr. E. J. Folev,       j of the Mimstl7 of Shipping.Sir Sydney Henn, representing Lord Inverfbrth ; and Mr. R. W. Matthew, of the Department of Overseas Trade.The representatives of the Ministry of Shipping explained that, under the agree-ments by which shipping tonnage is now being returned to the shipping companies, the space reserved on behalf of the Government can only be used for soldiers, sailors and their dependents, munition workers, who have come to this country to make munitions, and their dependents, and other persons who are entitled to have their passages paid for by the Government. This category includes, however, men who have come to this country to enlist and are entitled to repatriation, and the passages of these men are being requisitioned by the Repatriation Records Office, Winchester, through the Director of Movements at the War Office. The Department of Overseas Trade is in active communication with the Repatriation Records Office with a view to expediting as much as possible the repatriation of men required urgently abroad for commercial purposes.The passenger space reserved on behalf of the Government cannot, however, under existing agreements with the shipping companies, be utilised for commercial men who do not come within the category of those entitled to repatriation. The Department of Overseas Trade was requested to examine the cases brought to their attention of commercial men desiring early passages, and attached is an estimate prepared by the Department showing the number of men put lorward by the Department for immediate demobilisation as pivotal to overseas commerce or production. The estimate&quot; is classified by country of destination, and has been supplemented by a number of other urgent cases which have been taken up by the Department.
These figures have been thoroughly examined by the Ministry of Shipping, and the Ministry have advised that, except in the case of the Far East, the East Coast of South America, and South Africa, the requirements, so far as they are at present known to the Department of Overseas Trade, can be met by the shipping companies accepting priority certificates from that Department. The Ministry of Shipping are endeavouring to arrange that this shall be done.In the case of the Far East, the East Coast of South America, and possibly South Africa, special action will probably be necessary in order to provide the facilities required. The Ministry of Shipping, in consultation with the Department of Overseas Trade, is taking this matter up with the shipping companies concerned, and a further report of the arrangements arrived at with the shipping companies will be made as soon as possible.1. Men Recommended for Early Demobilisation.The numbers given below indicate the number of men recommended by D.O.T. as pivotal to overseas commerce or production, classified by country of destination, and excluding a number of travellers, &amp;c, whose specific destination is not certain. It is known that a number of these men have a claim to repatriation at the public, expense, but it is not clear, what numbers will avail themselves of the services of the War Office in this connection.There is a considerable measure of discontent at the delay on the part of the War Office in repatriating men whose claims are admitted, and numbers of men are abandoning their claim and asking the assistance of the Department to obtain passages for return at their own expense.The applications have been re-examined and an estimate made of the number of men who have a claim to repatriation at the public expense.

Report, section 39).Mr. Arthur F. Pease (in the Chair).Mr. E. Manville, M.P.Mr. H. S. Martin.Capt. H. G. Hotham, R.N.Mr. F. G. A. Butler, C.B., C.M.G.THE Committee have held two meetings.Unfortunately, owing to illness, Mr. Butler was unable to attend. Mr. J. A. Stirling attended the second meeting as representing the Department of Overseas Trade.Mr. Dunwoody, of the Chamber of Commerce, attended the first meeting, and Capt. Bisset (Ministry of Shipping) attended both meetings. The present position appears to be as follows : The Passport Office are now housed in new premises, and are increasing their staff, and they expect very shortly to be in a position to deal promptly with the applications for passports.The number of passports granted per day is about 750, passports, only being granted after careful scrutiny to persons who, either for trade or private reasons, can make out a strong case for the necessity for travelling abroad.It should be mentioned that passports for extra-European journeys have to be granted for months ahead, as the shipping lines will not book berths unless the applicant has a passport.Full particulars are given on the back of the passport forms as to the method of obtaining them, and Mr. Martin is also preparing a card setting forth the particulars as to the permits or vises that are required in certain countries, with a note that where this is not stated no such vise is necessary. He also informed the Committee that the necessity for the Home Office permit was being abolished from the end of the month.We recommend that these particulars be distributed to chambers of commerce, banks and main post offices (only to towns with a population of over 10,000).L-I.S12] 2 G2. Other Cases specially taken up by Department of Overseas Trade.
We also recommend that passport offices be opened at Glasgow, Liverpool and Newcastle. Accommodation could possibly be found for these offices either by the Chambers of Commerce or the Senior Naval Officers&apos; offices.The real difficulty is to obtain passages for those in possession of passports, and Capt. Bisset reported that the passports granted were far in excess of the shipping accommodation available on many routes. This specially applied in the case of long-distance overseas passages, and this would be the case for many months to come.The method of allotting berths at present was that a certain proportion, say, 50 per cent., were requisitioned for naval, military and official purposes (in which is included accommodation for the wives and families of officers and men repatriated) and the balance were left to the shipping companies to allot to persons who had been granted passports.The shipping companies had been asked to give preference in allocation of berths to persons who were going abroad for trade purposes, but even if they made an endeavour to do so, this was extremely difficult for them to carry out, and necessitated them judging as to which mans business was more important than anothers.Two methods were suggested to deal with this : 1. That a further percentage, say, 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, of the berths should be requisitioned by the Government, and that these should be allotted on the recommendation of the Department of Overseas Trade, who would obtain whatever recommendations they considered desirable, preferably from the Chambers of Commerce, large trade organisations, and other public or semi-public bodies, upon whom it must be impressed that they must be satisfied that the applicant had specific and definite trade reasons for travelling abroad.2. That the shipowners controlling the long-distance voyages should be asked independently to reserve the berths for passengers nominated by the Department of Overseas Trade.The Committee&apos;s view was that the former course would be the simpler and easier, both for the Government and for the shipping companies themselves, but Capt. Bisset informed the Committee that the Shipping Controllers view was that the matter was best left for the shipping companies to deal with themselves.With regard to the question of establishing Information Bureau under the D.O.T. at the different ports, and, if so, the desirability of them running conjointly with the passport offices, owing to Mr. Butler&apos;s absence and Mr. Stirling having been summoned at short notice, the Committee were not in a position to discuss this matter fully, and it was decided to defer this point, as it was advisable for the Committee to report on the other questions as soon as possible.February 24, 1919.Appendix XXVI.SECOND REPORT OF PASSPORTS AND PERMITS SUB-COMMITTEE(ep. Report, section 39).A FURTHER meeting of the above Committee was held at the Admiralty on the 10th March 1919.Present:Mr. Arthur F. Pease (in the Chair).Captain A. G. Hotham, R.N., Director of Trade Division, Admiralty.Mr. H. S. Martin, Passport Office, Foreign Office.Major H. G. Spencer, Military Permit Office, War Office.Lieut.-Colonel N. Eliot, Military Permit Office, War Office.Mri Paish (on behalf of Mr. Butler), Overseas Trade Department.Major Spencer explained fully the position with regard to the work of the Mihtary Passport Office and promised to embody the information in a memorandum, which is attached hereto.
The Committee consider it would not be worth while at this stage to recommend any increase in the Military Permit Office accommodation or Staff.The Committee recommend that the British Ambassador in Paris should be asked to press the French Government as early as possible to do away with the necessity for. military permits for visits to all countries and places except Paris, the zones of the British Army and the zones of the British milita^ operations, and further, if it is possible, to increase the Staff who are dealing with the visas in the French Consulate in Bedford Square.The Committee wish to make it clear that the decrease of the British Military Staff consequent on the abolition of the military permits will, so long as the French require visa, probably increase rather than reduce delay, as at the present time the French officers work with the English officers of the Military Permit Branch, and, as a rule, are satisfied with the information they are given.With regard to the recommendation in our previous report, Mr. Martin was desirous of knowing whether the opening of branch offices in Liverpool, Glasgow and Newcastle had been sanctioned by the main Committee. We understand that the view of the Home Office is that the issue of passports will continue for some time  if not permanently and the work of this department is, therefore, likely to be largely increased as shipping facilities are extended, and it may be necessary to open offices in other centres later.With regard to the further point dealt with at (1) page 2 of the Minutes of the War Cabinet Conference of 20th February 1919, when it was decided (1.) That the question of the desirability and/or necessity of establishing an Information Bureau of the nature suggested by Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, either at his head office or in the provinces, be referred to the Sub-Committee appointed in Minute 3 of the Second Meeting to consider the question of passports and permits as an addition to their terms of reference, and that Mr. Butler of the Overseas Trade Department be added as a member of the Sub-Committee.Mr. Butler, owing to illness, has not been able to attend the Committee, but Mr. Paish concurred in the view of the Committee that it was not feasible for the Infor-mation Bureaux to be worked in connection with the Provincial Passport Offices and that they should either be run entirely independently or in conjunction with the Chambers of Commerce.ARTHUR F. PEASE.March 13, 1919.Mr. A. F. Pease,Under present regulations a military permit must be obtained at the Military Permit Office, 18, Bedford Square, by the following : (1.) British subjects going to or through France, Belgium, Italy, Greece, or enemy territory.(2.) All persons going to the zone of the British Armies in France, zones of British military occupation, or zones of British military operations.For those wishing to visit France, Belgium, Italy or Greece the Consular visa of the country to be traversed or visited must also &quot;be obtained.It is proposed to do away with the military permit for visits to all countries and places except the following: Paris, zones of the British Armies and zones of British military operations.This will considerably ease the work at the Military Permit Office, and will reduce the number of complaints aimed at organisation by that section of the public that grumbles. As proposed travellers will still have to obtain the visa of the country to be visited, the public will not probably benefit greatly by the proposed change.Should the proposed change be agreed to, the existing staff at the Military Permit Office will be ample to deal with the work. Should the change not be agreed to, extra staff will be necessary, but the extra personnel should not be difficult to find, as we have been authorised by the Financial Authorities to employ officers up to the rank of Captain.   These officers will be paid at regimental rates and allowances.In the latter case the number of applications for permits will probably increase, and if it does so at the present rate the accommodation at the Military Permit Office
will possibly be insufficient for the public. As the Military Permit Office will probably cease to function when peace is signed it would hardly be advisable to move to other premises. In any case, with the necessary extra staff, the applicants could be dealt with.quickly.It should be borne in mind that under present arrangements applicants who have to apply for the military permit before obtaining the French visa are actually helped on their way, as when the military permit is granted the applicant is taken direct to the French officer who visas the passport and who sits in the same room as the British examiners.Should the change be agreed to, applicants, except in the cases enumerated, will have to go direct to the French authorities. The staff in the French office is at present a small one and will certainly have to be increased to deal with the volume of work.H. G. SPENCER, Major, G.S.Appendix XXVII.IMPORTS FROM CANADA.Colonel Amery to Sir A. Geddes.My dear Geddes, Downing Street, February 19, 1919.I ENCLOSE a memorandum from Lloyd Harris, who represents the Canadian Government here in all business matters, bearing upon the subject of our discussion yesterday. It seems to.me very important to free Canadian trade to this country, because doing so helps to stimulate the back trade from here to Canada. Generally speaking, it seems to me very important to get ahead quickly with Imperial development, because relatively to their population the Dominions and Colonies are much the best market we have got and contain far greater powers of expansion in their demand than any other market in the world. It is clear that the French mean to recover from the war by a most drastic policy of excluding competitive trade. The Italians will, no doubt, do the same as far as they can, while I doubt if in the United States market, even if the tariffs were lowered, we should ever have the same chance as we used to under pre-war labour conditions. Germany is bound, if she is to get in her necessary raw materials at all and re-establish her exchange situation, to keep out all manufactures as far as possible. Russia will be in chaos. South America and the British Empire are really going to be our main stand-by for helping the employment question in this country.More than that, the whole labour situation is developing to a point at which we shall be out of the running in competitive markets in all except a few specialised lines. I believe we have got to reconsider our whole economic position, forget that we once were a successful exporting nation mainly interested in free trade in the world outside, and remember that we are the greatest undeveloped nation in the world, with an industrial nucleus- quite sufficient to carry out a development transcending anything which the world has yet seen. We are, in fact, in the position in which the United States were 70 or 80 years ago, and we have got to follow a policy within the Empire on the lines on which the United States developed them-selves, i.e., a tremendous policy of development of communications, migration of population, &amp;c. On those lines there is no limit to what we can do. On the lines of trying to resuscitate the pre-war economic England, which itself was only carrying on. by the impetus of the past, we shall not get very far.Yours sincerely,L. AMERY.
Memorandum to the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, Prime Minister. From Mr. Lloyd Harris, Chairman, Canadian Mission in London.Effect on Canadian Trade and, Commerce of Import Restrictions in Great Britain.YOUR Government, through the Import Restrictions Department of the Board of Trade, is discriminating against imports from Canada.On all classes of goods where the restrictions are absolute Canada can find no fault in being refused import licences, but on other classes of goods for which import licences are necessary applications to permit imports from Canada are every day being refused, while import licences for the same classes of goods from foreign countries are being regularly granted.Basis upon which Import Licences are granted.On imports allowed entry to Great Britain in 1919, import licences are granted upon a basis of actual imports made by the applicant in the year 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, or 1918. Canada entered the war with Great Britain, and immediately her industries were converted into production of war materials and necessities so that Canada consequently had no exports of other manufactured products.During the same period, our boats were requisitioned and it became impossible for Canadian exporters to secure the &quot;necessary shipping space for shipment to Great Britain, and these same boats, in many instances, were being operated from the United States to Great Britain, the space reserved for commercial products being used by exporters in the United States, so that it will be seen that any basis of importation in 1919 fixed on exports from Canada during the war period must discriminate against Canadian exports.Further, basing imports for 1919 on the imports for any pre-war years is an injustice to Canada, for the reason that many Canadian industries which were not equipped for export business before the war have at the earnest solicitation of the Canadian Government made preparations to equip themselves for post-war export business and to compete for trade formerly largely dominated by Germany, and now these companies find themselves in a position where they are entirely prevented from sharing in such business, while neutral countries, who were fortunate enough to have established a trade with Great Britain previous to the war, now have the privilege of securing business from Great Britain, while Canada is prevented from doing so, and further, the policy of granting import licences to applicants who must prove pre-war importations has the effect of keeping German trade connections alive in those trades dominated by Germany before the war.Many instances of discrimination and injustice could be cited, but the object of this memorandum is to show the effect of regulations now in force, and all that Canada can desire, or does desire, is to have such regulations made as will enable all British citizens and Companies within the British Empire to have the opportunity and privilege of sharing with others within the Empire the trade which properly and naturally belongs to them.Februanj 14, 1919.Appendix XXVIII.MEMORANDUM BY BOARD OF TRADE ON IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANDCOLONIAL PREFERENCE.IT has been urged by representatives of Canada that Canadian industrial interests will be gravely prejudiced by the application of restrictions on imports into the United Kingdom from other parts of the British Empire, and the request has accordingly been made that the Empire should be entirely free from such restrictions, or, if in the case of any particular comir oditv this is impossible, that, they should be given a large preference in the issuing oi licences to import.There are very strong reasons for recognising the Colonial claim in this matter. The Dominions and India entered the war at the same time as the mother country, [1312] . 2 II
and their industrial and business system has been so transformed in re-establishing it. To assist them in the task it is most important that they should be given an outlet for their goods.It must be admitted that making the full concession asked for would prove an inconvenience, at least in a few cases, to manufacturers in this country ; but it is not anticipated that any serious consequences will follow. Consequently the Board of Trade strongly recommends that the claim should be admitted and that it should be declared by the Cabinet that no import restriction shall be or continue to be imposed on goods coming from any part of the Empire without the assent of the Cabinet. The last few words in italics are added in order that exceptions might be made if there were very strong arguments for making them; but it is not expected that exceptions will really be needed.Appendix XXIX.REPORT BY LORD EMMOTTS SUB-COMMITTEE ON EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.Neutrals involved in the Blockade.THE Sub-Committee are strongly of opinion that trade in manufactured goods, particularly in completely manufactured goods for civilian use, ought to be made free with these countries if any material help is to be given to British export trade.It is not generally appreciated how entirely exports were cut off to these countries for a year before the close of hostilities. Even now everything is prohibited and subject to licence except a certain comparatively short list of free goods which are of little importance. Licences are only issued, moreover, for prohibited goods when certificates and guarantees are received from the importing countries.The Netherlands Overseas Trust in Holland are deliberately refusing to issue certificates for manufactured goods competing with Dutch industries. In Norway there are about 17 different associations issuing certificates for different categories of goods, and confusion is frequently caused by the overlapping of their functions. In Sweden associations for distributing goods are almost openly hostile to British manufactures. In Switzerland the Paris Rationing Committee dictates rations, but in practice the French are now disregarding the rations. The machinery in existence operates against British trade and is in any case so dilatory as to prevent quick expansion. There is also much reason to doubt if some of our Allies and associates observe the restrictions so scrupulously as the War Trade Department in London. The Sub-Committee earnestly recommend that, except for goods of a dangerous character from a military standpoint, consignments should be freed from control and guarantees in the importing countries.-The first step will be to allow free export to these countries of all goods not on Lists &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot; or the rationed lists. This in itself would be an important matter, but it is also desirable, if any real help is.to be given to British trade that commodities like cotton and woollen piece goods should be absolutely free. The Sub-Committee therefore propose for consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government and their Allies that a list they are preparing (and hope to forward on Thursday) or some modification of it should be the only prohibited list for neutrals adjacent to Germany, and that free export should be allowed without guarantees in all other goods. The proposal is in their opinion an urgent and pressing matter.The proposal is made in the belief and expectation that in time a considerable quantity of the goods will filter through into Germany.^ On the grounds put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it seems desirable to allow goods to filter through into Germany by neutral channels rather than to attempt to do the trade direct. If we are to do the trade direct, it wrill require the consent of our AUies. It will take a long time to arrange details, and there is a great danger of quarrelling over who is to supply such and such manufactured materials and a great possibility of the United Kingdom being left behind in the transaction. If, on the other hand, the free list is greatly extended and completely manufactured goods can be sent in unrestricted quantities to these neutrals with the
idea that they may filter through into Germany, Great Britain being near these markets stands to benefit. A memorandum from the General Staff brought to the Sub-Committee by Sir James Stevenson contemplates with equanimity the direct supply to Germany of manufactured goods, such as rubber goods, cotton, woollen and linen cloth, boots and shoes, candles, soap, railway and building material, boilers, electrical machinery, paints, &amp;c. A fortiori, if it is in contemplation to allow these goods to be imported into Germany, it is advisable to allow them to be imported freely to the neutral adjacent to Germany. The shortage in the neutral countries in question is very great, and the danger of quantities passing through them to Germany in excess of Germany&apos;s civilian needs appears almost negligible, in addition the War Trade Statistical Department is in a position to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Allies, if excessive quantities of any suspicious article are going to neutral countries. The really dangerous articles, other than munitions which will not be allowed at all, will be raw materials of certain kinds which the Sub-Committee will not recommend for the free list for &quot; C &quot; countries.Finally, as a proof of how much trade is still hampered by export restrictions, it may be mentioned that the number of licences issued by the War Trade Department is still about 2,000 per diem. The maximum figure was only about 2,500 a day at the time of greatest restriction. The A and B Prohibited Lists only contain now one-third of the headings existing on the 1st of November, and the number of licences still being applied for shows how necessary it is to cut down the &quot; C &quot; List drastically if our export trade is to be encouraged.British traders also, being for the most part patriotic, are less inclined to trade direct with Germany in present circumstances, and would be more ready to use neutral channels for the extension of their export trade.24th February 1919.

List of Commodities involving Special Considerations.Asphalt and articles containing Asphalt.Asphalt, Coal Tar.Bitumen.To be removed to List &quot; C &quot; subject to any observations that may be made by the Road Board. Information before the Committee led them to believe that asphalt was being held up because of the fear that the Road Board might be short of it at some future time. The Committee is of opinion that possible future shortage is not a sufficient reason for retaining on List &quot;A.&quot;Bristles of European origin.These must for the present be kept on List &quot; B,&quot; in the interests of the Brush Trade, as supplies must be drawn from Russia and there is no immediate prospect of any imports from that country.Copper Sulphate.Can go on List &quot; C,&quot; so far as home supplies are concerned. It was kept on List &quot;A&apos;* because of difficulties with the French, who did not desire to take at once the quantity they had arranged to buy. We recommend it should be put on List&quot;C.&quot;Lyes and Dyestuffs, &amp;c.From the point of view of beginning to foster export trade, it appears desirable to put dyes and dyestuffs on List &quot; C,&quot; but this is an important matter and the Board of Trade has been consulted. They have since given their opinion that they should be retained on &quot;A&quot; for the present.Fats, all Animal and Vegetable, &amp;c.The real difficulty here is not so much supplies, which are fairly plentiful, for the present, but controlled prices. As regards edible oils and the raw material for them, margarine has just been de-rationed and the Controller of Oils and Fats is anxious to see what increase of consumption takes place before edible oils are removed from List &quot; A.&quot; Technical oils are going on List &quot; C &quot; on Thursday next. Putting them on List &quot; C &quot; does not, however, dispose of the difficulties of the case where control of prices is maintained.Fruit ought to go on the Free List. This is a very important entrepot trade for this country, particularly with the Scandinavian markets, which are our chief customers at present. The reason it has been kept on List &quot; A &quot; is that imports are restricted, particularly from Spain, on account of Exchange reasons. The Committee is strongly of opinion that from the point of view of British commerce, both import and export restrictions ought to be removed.Gold Leaf.Gold, Liquid, including Gold Paint, &amp;c.This is a special case in which the War Trade Department for a long time has been protesting against the action of the Treasury in refusing to&apos; allow this commodity, to to be exported at all. Gold plate can be exported to any extent and this involves an enormous percentage of solid gold. The amount of solid gold in gold leaf and liquid gold is comparatively small. The trade is most lucrative and ought to be encouraged.Hides and Leather.The Director of Raw Materials, a member of our Committee, says that wet hides, calf skins and goat skins cannot yet be put upon list C. Several other kinds of hides and leather are being released and Sir A. Goldfinch assures us that all possible is being done.Manures.The Government have undertaken to supply certain artificial fertilisers under the market price until the 31st of May, and in these circumstances it would be impossible to allow free export of artificially cheap material.The same considerations apply to phosphate rock and superphosphates.
Mica, Block, Mica Sheets, &amp;c.The Ministry of Munitions wish the - prohibition maintained because they desire to keep and use in this country the better qualities for the magneto trade, and to prohibit the export is the readiest means of doing this.Nitrate bags have been maintained on List &quot; B &quot; merely that our export list may coincide with the Indian export list. There is no export from this country. We believe that this commodity has been kept on the prohibited list in India in order to exercise pressure on Chile.Russian Rouble Notes.The Treasury should be asked about this.Opium and Opium Alkaloids.It is desired to retain these as the readiest means of controlling the quantity going to the East pending an International convention.Par a fin Wax.Candles have just been put on List 4i C,&quot; and it is desired to see what extra demand this entails for paraffin wax before that commodity is also reduced.Potash, Caustic, &amp;c, Potash Muriate, ccc, Potash Salts and following headings.A new trade has been developed involving the use of potash. This trade is of importance to the glass trade and the supply at present is short.Prepared Foods, wholly or partially derived from Cereals.Those not containing milk have already been reduced to List &quot; C &quot; It seems inadvisable at present to put those containing milk on List &quot; C.&quot;Railway Material, and some other Iron and Steel Manufactures.The Cabinet have already had put before them the position as regards the subsidy on iron and steel, and it is not proposed to disturb it. We are informed it will expire on the 1st of 4pril.Santonin. This all comes from Russia, and will be removed to List &quot; C &apos; later.Seeds. Many of these have already been removed to List &quot; C.&quot; It is suggested that the Food Production Department should be asked to revise the remainder.Silver Bullion-The demands for India are so large that it seems undesirable to reduce to List &quot; C &quot; at present.Silk. Silk of aU kinds, except raw silk, thrown silk and waste, are being removed to List &quot; C.&quot; The Committee is advised that it is essential for the present to retain the raw materials on List &quot; A &quot; in the interests of the British manufacturing trade.Spirits-Whisky is the only commodity that will be kept od List &quot; A.&quot;Wool Tops and Noils.The Committee advising the Wool Control Board desire to keep on List &quot; A &quot; for the present crossbred and merino noils, also wool tops and mixtures and wool yarns. The War Trade Department Export Committee think that all tops, noils, waste and yarns might be reduced to List &quot; C.&quot; This Committee recommends that raw wools should be maintained on List &quot; A.&quot;E.24th February 1919.
Lord Emmott to Sir Auckland Geddes.War Trade Department, 4, Central Buildings, Dear Sir Auckland, 27th February 1919.I BEG to enclose the results of yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Sub-Committee on Export Restrictions at which a possible relaxation of the blockade was considered.The report takes the form of three lists as follows : 1. Lists&quot; A&quot; and &quot;73&quot; combined comprise aR articles which, on account of Home requirements, will be either totally prohibited from export (except under licence) or prohibited except within the British Empire, assuming that the recommendations forwarded to you last Monday are approved. They are, as previously explained to you, (1) articles of naval and military importance, (2) foodstuffs and fodder, (3) raw materials in short supply, and (4) a few articles to which some special consideration attaches. It is hoped that some of these articles may, however, shortly be relegated to List &quot; C.&quot;2. Proposed List &quot; C.&quot;-Goods (other than those on Lists &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot;) prohibited from export except under licence and guarantee to the neutral countries bordering the Central Empires. It will be observed that this list consists almost entirely of raw materials not on &quot; A&quot; and &quot; B,&quot; together with a few additional articles of military value. In the absence of any knowledge of the policy governing the supply of raw materials to Germany which will be adopted by the Associated Governments, the Sub-Committee did not feel themselves competent to recommend that imported raw materials and certain foodstuffs should be exported freely to the neutrals in the Blockade area. They would suggest, however, whether tea, coffee, cocoa and high-speed steel might not be eliminated from this list.3. List &quot; F &quot; (proposed Free List). Goods which it is suggested should be exported to aR non-enemy destinations without restrictions of any sort. You will understand that List &quot; C &quot; at present includes aR articles of commerce (except a few unimportant items on the existing Free List). It is not therefore possible to compile a new detailed List &quot;F&quot; which would be complete. There can, however, be no doubt that the List &quot;F&quot; enclosed herewith&apos;&quot;5 embraces every important article of commerce not in the revised Lists &quot; A,&quot; &quot; B,&quot; or &quot; C.&quot;You will see that, roughly speaking, aR manufactured goods are recommended for the Free List, it being the opinion of the Committee that substantial relief to British trade can only be obtained by this means, and I am glad to note that the War Office share my view that it is far preferable to allow the enemy to receive manufactured articles rather than raw materials.I enclose copies of the existing Free List which you wall see is more imposing in appearance than in reality.I must add that owing to the extreme haste with which these lists have been compiled (it being understood that the matter Avas of great urgency) it is possible that a few inconsistencies of classification have crept in, but if the basic principles are approved it will be an easy matter to revise the lists and make any smaU corrections.Yours sincerely,EMMOTT.* This List &quot; F &quot; is not reprinted in this Appendix.E-1312J 2 K
RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS.Lord Emmott to Sir Auckland Geddes.War Trade Department, 4, Central Buildings, Dear Sir Auckland, Westminster, March 1, 1919.AS one example of a stream of letters that are coming in, showing how serious American competition is becoming in markets which we have considered hitherto reserved to us, I enclose a letter just received from Manchester. It does seem to me almost essential that we should insist on removing cotton yarns and cloth and other commodities, in whose export we are so greatly interested, from list C.Yours, &amp;c,EMMOTT.Mr. Macpherson to Lord Emmott.Manchester Chamber of Commerce,Cotton Exports Department, 44, Spring Gardens, Dear Lord Emmott, Manchester, February 28,1919.I WAS unfortunate enough to be in London when you kindly came to interview the members of my Committee, representing the trade to Scandinavia, Denmark and Holland, and Switzerland, on Tuesday, the 4th February. I was gratified to learn from my colleagues that you heartily approved of a policy to lift the restrictions upon exports from this country to those above mentioned at as early a date as possible, and I noted with pleasure that in the JEouse of Lords you emphasised this view of the question with such force.My Committee, representing the interests of the whole cotton trade to these countries, feel that they have powerful support in you, who so thoroughly understand the needs of the trade. They view with alarm the present conditions under which the trade is struggling. We are face to face with the condition of heavy financial burdens, so long cheerfully borne, of necessity, perhaps, but also patriotically, and without, as you are aware, any attempt to put undue pressure on Government Depart-ments, which themselves had so many anxieties to meet.Trade has fallen remarkably to all parts, values have fallen, and, on the whole, tend to weaken and invite foreign importers to cancel wherever they possibly can. There is a heavy stoppage of looms throughout the county, and demobilization is bringing home more mouths than there is work to provide for.In each of the countries I mention, a new danger has arisen. The United States are making a dead-set for our markets, and, without being able to give you chapter and verse, my Committee has positive information that, within the last few days, large orders for yarn have been placed in America from Holland and Denmark, whereas the States have hitherto traded in these goods to an almost negligible extent. They are active likewise in each of these countries for the sale of cotton piece-goods, and are meeting with no small success. Buyers have left each of these countries for the States to make purchases, which otherwise would come to this country.There are likewise persistent rumours in Xorway, Denmark, and Holland, that it is the intention of our Government to place a 25 per cent, duty on the export of yarns, and orders are being held up in those countries until certitude on this point has been reached. I do not wish to trouble you further, and have only written at this length that you might understand how much my Committee will be grateful to you if at the next conference at the Cotton Export Section of your Department you could possibly be present to guide and assist in our deliberations.We have written to the Cotton Export Committee asking that the conference should be held on the second Wednesday in March.I sincerely hope that you will find it possible to accede to my request that you should be present.Yours Sec **EVAN S. MACPHERSON,Chairman of Committee.
RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS.Lord Emmott to Sir Auckland Geddes.(W.T.D. 01528/19 P.S.) - War Trade Department, 4, Central Buildings,Rear Sir Auckland, Westminster, March 3, 1.919.THE enclosed letter summarises clearly the difficulties with which the exporters of woollen cloth are at present faced. You will have noted that amongst the recommendations forwarded to you is that of placing woollen cloth on the list of goods that can be sent to neutral countries, bordering on Germany, without either an export licence from this Department, or a local guarantee from the country concerned. If this recommendation is carried into action, it should go far to obviate the difficulties of this class of exporter.Youis sincerely,EMMOTT.Copy of Letter, from Messrs. W. J. and S. P. Herivel to Lord Emmott.28 and 29, Cheapside, London, My Lord, March 1, 1919.I herewith give you the facts of the conversation I had with you this morning regarding the position of the wool-piece goods trade.Home Trade.1. There are enough goods actually made and in the country to-day than are required for home consumption during the next eighteen months.2. It must be remembered that the ultimate end of all woollen goods is the cutter-up whether men&apos;s or ladies&apos; wear.Regarding the ladies&apos; wear. Nearly all cutters-up and merchants of this class of stuff are over bought and over stocked, including many manufacturers.3. The trade is stagnant, and unless it gets better it is anticipated that there will be many failures.4. Because of these large stocks, merchants and cutters-up are putting stuff on the market at 10, 20 and 30 per cent, lower than the goods cost to make, the reason being, for example, in some of the smaller houses, say a firm&apos;s capital is 20,000L ; they have goods in stock to the amount of 30,000i., which is 10,000L more than their capital and consequently they will have to sacrifice a large part of their stock on a falling market in order to acquire, the 10,0001. needed to pay what they owe.5. There is also a lot of high price stuff on the market owing to the large profits made by various firms through which goods have passed, and the present holders find their goods 20 per cent, dearer than the cost to make to-day.By free exports now these houses could get out of their high price goods without any loss, but if they have to hold them until the autumn money is bound to be lost, and further, many houses will not be in a position to hold their goods through the summer, and will have to sell them at almost any price.6. Whereas many mills in the north have sufficient work to keep them going for the next three to six months, I know personally of certain mills where looms are standing for want of work.lhis applies more especially to mills which have been running in the past on Government orders, and who would not book civilian orders ahead owing to the uncertain state of the market, and now find themselves with the Government orders completed and no civilian work to fill their looms, and in mills which are still busy; sooner or later their looms will fall out for want of work.7. This position can only be altered by obtaining orders from abroad for immediate and near delivery, and so take the surplus of goods off the hands of the present holders, and this cannot be done to any extent until they can export freely.
Export Trade. 8. At present one of the biggest markets is Scandinavia.9. Many houses in Sweden refuse to buy any further goods from England until they see some of their back orders delivered. There are orders placed in 1917 still undelivered.In some cases goods have been baled and ready for shipment for over a year.10. English manufacturers have repeatedly told them that orders placed now will be completed within six months, but they have no more faith in these statements.11. In the meantime, a number of firms in the United ^ States have sent their representatives to Scandinavia to offer goods, and are promising delivery in 4 to 5 months&apos; time.&apos; Their values compare very favourably with ours. They state that England has not been able to deliver in the past, and will not be able to deliver in the future, and on these lines orders have been booked with the States, which would have come to England if the goods could have been shipped.12. The reason why the United States can compete with England at the moment on the foreign market, is owing to the enormous increase in the price of production of English goods.13. Eor your guidance, my correspondents in Switzerland have written that Spain is offering, and has taken, orders for woollen piece goods in Switzerland. Switzerland is exceedingly short of woollen piece goods.I am, &amp;c,W. J. HERIVEL.Appendix XXXIII.MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER ONRESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS.I DESIRE to make a few comments on points arising out of Lord Emmott&apos;s letter to you of the 24th ultimo, and the accompanying documents respecting restrictions on exports. These comments are confined to matters in which the Treasury are specially interested: 1. It is suggested that fruit could with advantage be placed on the Free List if imports censed to be restricted. If we could be sure that increased imports from Spain would be devoted to exportation to other neutral countries, it might be worth while to remove existing restrictions, but I have no reason to hope that anything like the whole of the increased importation would be re-exported. The Spanish Exchange is exceedingly adverse, and we have spent several million sterling in supporting it. We have only just ceased to support it, and it w7ould be unwise to allow a considerable new burden to fall upon it until we can measure the full effect of our withdrawal of support, and conclude arrangements for a loan from the Spanish banks.2. Our objection to freeing liquid gold is based on the fact that it is not only a manufactured product but a raw material. We recently. considered the question with the Board of Trade and Bank of England, and were agreed that the prohibition must stand for the present, largely in the interests of the British export trade in pottery.3. Rouble notes. These are hardly ejusdem generis with the other commodities under consideration. The question of restrictions on their importation and exportation involves a variety of rather special considerations, and I should prefer that no action should be taken in the direction of relaxation without careful examination of all relevant circumstances, political as well as financial.4. As Lord Emmotfs Memorandum suggests, we are not in a position to put silver bullion upon last C.(Initialled) A. C.March 3, 1919.

NOTE BY MINISTRY OF SHIPPING ON THE REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE ON RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS.THE Shipping Controller desires to support the recommendations contained in the above report, and indeed would have been glad had it been thought possible to go a good deal further in the direction of removing restrictions.As regards shipbuilding material and auxiliaries, the Ministry of Shipping is satisfied that free export, except to countries adjacent to Germany, can safely be permitted without prejudice to British shipbuilding and engineering.March 18. 1919.Appendix XXXVII.MAINTENANCE OF THE BLOCKADE.Mr. Cecil Harmsworth to Sir Auckland Geddes.My dear Auckland Geddes, Foreign Office, March 1, 1919.WE have considered here the report of Emmott&apos;s Sub-Committee on restrictions of exports, and I venture to send you, in advance of the general meeting at which we are to discuss it, a copy of a Memorandum by Finlay, the Vice-Chairman of the Allied Blockade Committee which represents&apos;the views of our principal Blockade Departments &apos;(the Contraband Department of the Foreign Office, Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department, and the War Trade Statistical Department).I am afraid that at first sight you may think that we are adopting somewhat of a non possumus attitude in regard to Emmott&apos;s proposals, but let me try to explain shortly the sort of difficulties with which we feel we are faced.The whole question seems to us to hinge on maintenance of control over the most important of the raw materials of which the enemy are in need. As an instance let me take the case of cotton.Emmott proposes to include cotton manufactures and products of all kinds in the Free List. This means that such goods would be able to go to the northern neutrals free from any export-restrictions and free from any guarantees from the neutrals against re-export to Germany. It may be immaterial now whether Germany receives cotton manufactures or not, but we feel perfectly sure that, if once cotton manufactures are placed on the Free List, we shall be immediately faced with an irresistible demand from the United States that raw cotton should also be included in the Free List. As you will realise, the admission of raw cotton into the northern neutral countries free from any guarantee against re-export to Germany involves a question of both military and political importance. It might be argued that, in view of the prospective armistice terms, under which, it is understood, Germany will be prevented from carrying on her manufacture of armaments, it is a matter of indifference whether she receives cotton or not, since, even if she becomes possessed of the materials for making explosives, she may-fie deprived of the means of putting such explosives to. any military use. I think, however, you will agree that such a question is really one that can only be decided by the Supreme War Council.The question whether the admission of Germany to the cotton markets of the world (which would follow on the placing of raw cotton on the Free List) would result in competition between German and Allied purchases, is not properly one for the Blockade Department to consider, but I think it is a question which should not be overlooked.I have only touched on the cotton question, but you will understand that this is
not the only one of the sort that might arise out of the adoption of Emmott&apos;s proposals. We do not, of course, wish to go so far as to say that we cannot accept his proposed Free List at all. It is a list of portentous length, and careful examination of all its items will require a little time. I have no doubt there are numerous items which we shall be perfectly ready to include in the Free List, but you will understand that the Free List for the northern neutrals is no longer a purely domestic matter, since for almost a year, the Blockade has been administered as an Inter-Allied operation, and we must necessarily obtain the consent of the Associated Governments to all additions to the Free List, Emmott appears entirely to overlook this point. As long as it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage Inter-Allied co-operation, it is the dutv of the Foreign Office to see that no occasion can be given to our Allies for attributing departure from such co-operation to His Majesty&apos;s Government, If we were to establish an entirely new Free List without the consent of our Allies, we should be guilty of a serious breach of the principle of Allied co-operation.You will see from Finlay&apos;s Memorandum that our competent Blockade Departments consider that the adoption of Emmott&apos;s Free List as it stands would amount to breaking down the Blockade I do not know whether you have yet seen the Memorandum by the Board of Trade and by the Foreign Office and Admiralty on the general question of the maintenance of the Blockade which we submitted to the Prime Minister a couple of months ago. I enclose them now, and I hope you may be able to find time to read them. I expect you will have noticed the Prime Ministers latest expression of opinion on the importance of maintaining the Blockade (see his speech at the Industrial Con-ference, as reported in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 28th February).I also enclose for your information a copy of the letter from Marshal Foch, which is alluded to in Finlay&apos;s minute.I will attend the War Cabinet Conference at 4*30 on Monday, 3rd March, as arranged.Yours &amp;c.CECIL HARMSWORTH.P.S. As I have said, I have no pedantic views about the Blockade. I regard it as a necessary instrument, to be abandoned with much relief as soon as we get instructions to abandon it from the Supreme War Council. For all we know it may not be necessary to maintain the Blockade for more than two or three months longer. I trust this may be so, but meanwhile, we dare not agree to measures that involve the destruction of the machinery of the Blockade. I attach the greatest importance, too, to the maintenance of friendly Allied co-operation. If we cannot stick together now, what chance is there of a successful working of Inter-Allied arrangements under the League of Nations ?C. H.Mr. Harmsworth,A small meeting was held this afternoon at which were present: Mr. Leslie. Mr. Bland.   -Mr. Higginson. Mr. Farrar. Mr. Finlay.The meeting was held to discuss the Memorandum by Lord Emmott setting out the proposals of his Sub-Committee with reference to restrictions on exports.We did not dissent from the view that considerable additions may be made, and ought to be made, from time to time in the Free List. As you know, the Allied. Blockade Committee recently approved and submitted to Paris a Free List containing considerable additions.It is, however, essential to understand what the Free List really means. It means a list of goods which may be allowed to go to Germany, or rather which may be allowed to go anywhere. It is perhaps better to avoid mentioning Germany, in view of American susceptibilities, but the substance of the thing is that the goods will, and may go, to Germany, and it is essential to face this fact.Lord Emmott himself clearly recognized this fact, for he speaks in his memorandum of the goods filtering through to Germany We agree that this will occur, but Ave do not understand the observations which follow in his memorandum.    He seems to
suppose that if the trade with Germany takes place indirectly, that is via the northern neutrals instead of directly, trade can be done by this country without the assent of the Associated Governments.We venture to differ altogether. The essence of the situation is that the Blockade is now run by the Associated Governments. The relaxation of that Blockade would require the assent of those Governments, and equally require that assent whether the relaxation is a relaxation which allows direct trading with Germany or a relaxation which allows such trading only by the filtering of the goods through neutrals.Up to the present time the Free List has been composed either of goods which were utterly unimportant in character, or of goods which were known to be exported by Germany. Having regard to this, the filtering through of these goods did not matter. It is now necessary to consider what would be the effect if for the present trifling Free List the Free List proposed by Lord Emmott were substituted. It is sub-mitted that the effect would really be that Germany would be allowed to obtain up to the limit of her consumption, and from the countries of the Associated Governments, goods of vital importance. This policy may be adopted, but it ought not to be adopted without a clear understanding of what it means. It means the abandonment of the Blockade as it has hitherto been known, and it means almost complete relaxation of that pressure upon Germany which Marshal Foch has recently declared* to be absolutely vital in present circumstances. If any confirmation of Marshal Foch&apos;s view on this point were necessary, we w^ould refer to the striking passage in the Prime Ministers speech to the Labour Conference yesterday evening.It is impossible within the limits of this memorandum to analyse a list so long as this proposed Free List. In order to justify what has been said above, we propose to take three or four examples : (a.) Cotton manufactures. (6.) Wool manufactures, (c.) Mercury. (d.) Copper.The importance of these four commodities is too obvious to need any illustration. If cotton manufactures come on the Free List it seems to us obvious that it will be impossible to resist the pressure to place raw cotton on the Free List. The same thing applies to wool manufactures and raw wool. An illustration of this occurred this morning on the Allied Blockade Committee with reference, to cotton. There was a discussion about the possibility of fixing a separate ration for cotton waste for Holland in view of the large stocks which are held in this country, and which we are extremely anxious to export. The United States delegate pointed out, we thought with very great force, that it would really be unfair to give a separate ration for cotton waste, because it would be favouring the cotton waste which we wished to export, as against raw cotton which America was desirous to export.Mercury, above referred to, is of vital military importance for the making of bombs, and it would appear peculiarly unfortunate to place it on the Free List at a moment when the enemy have lost their main source of supply of mercury ; the Idria Mines are now occupied by the Italians, which produced about half of the world&apos;s supply of mercury.It should be repeated that the above instances are in no way exhaustive of the objections which could be taken, but they may serve as typical examples.We may point out how completely the policy of this list reverses the policy which has hitherto been pursued, namely, that of not allowing the enemy to receive manu-factured goods, either from the Associated Governments or from the adjacent neutral countries.We would further point out that this list, formidable as it is in itself, is perhaps even more formidable in what it might lead to. It has been prepared and avowedly prepared with a view to furthering British trade. It is inevitable that it will be followed by other lists, drawn up with a view to furthering the trade of the other Associated Governments. When an article is placed on the Free List it must not be considered solely with reference to itself, regard must also be paid to developments to which it may lead. Some of such developments are obvious, others may be more obscure, and may not be seen until the demand is sprung upon us. As an instance, silk and cotton from this point of view are linked up together. If the French succeed in.getting goods on to the Free List, our demand to get cotton goods on would become irresistible, and the same is true in the converse case.*&quot;See p. 136.
In conclusion, we would say that as we have already pointed out the adoption of this Free List, or of any other Free List is a matter which requires the co-operation of all the Associated Governments. If any list at all of the character suggested is to he adopted, then It is obvious that it will be essential that the authorities political, military, and economic of all the Associated Governments will have to be consulted, and any rapid decision is, therefore, quite out of the question.February 28, 1919.memorandum by president of board oe trade regarding export restrictionsto &quot; Blockade &quot; Countries.- ........ tThe provision in the Armistice that the Blockade shall be maintained, has been made the basis of a policy of maintaining rigorously nearly all the restrictions on the exportation of goods to the neutral countries bordering on Germany, i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland, which prevailed during the war.At the time of the Armistice the exportation to these countries of practically all articles was prohibited except under licence. As regards the rest of the world, a large number of articles (on the so-called &quot; A &quot; List) were prohibited to be exported to any destination, and a certain number of others (on the &quot; b &quot; List) to any destination outside the British Empire. The main object of these two latter descriptions of prohibition was the conservation of British or Allied resources. All the principal raw materials and foods were on the &quot;A &quot; List, but there were, in addition, a very large number of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods on either the &quot; A &quot;or the &quot; B &quot; Lists, over the exportation of which the military and other requirements of this country made it essential to maintain control during the war. The cessation of military operations with the consequent falling off of the demand for materials and goods for military purposes and the easing of the shipping situation have made it possible to abandon a very large number of the prohibitions of exportation previously in force, and further reductions in the prohibition list are being carried out as rapidly as possible. Before long it is contemplated that these general prohibitions of export will apply only to very few articles outside the foodstuffs and raw materials which it may still be necessary to control in the interests of the requirements of this country and her Allies. But so long as the present Blockade policy is adhered to the export of all these articles will still remain prohibited to most neutral European countries. This prohibition entails not only a strict limitation of the quantities of all goods allowed to go to the countries, but the compliance with elaborate formalities which place serious obstacles in the way even of the limited amount of trade with these countries which is permitted. Thus goods sent to Holland have to be consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust, and the consent of this body to the consignment has first to be obtained, and consents and guarantees have similarly to be obtained from the appropriate bodies in the case of consignments to Switzerland and Scandinavia.A very limited list of articles which are freed from these requirements has been agreed to by the Blockade Committee (see annex attached), and I understand that it is possible that some further additions to this free list may shortly be made.But it is evident that the lines on which the Committee are at present proceeding are so cautious that no great increase of freedom for the export trade with Holland and Scandinavia is at present to be looked for without a substantial change in policy which can only be taken by the Allied Governments acting in concert. There is no possible room for doubt what the interests of the United Kingdom are in this matter.Itjs a very serious matter that at a time when every possible encouragement ought to be given to the revival and expansion of trade, in order to maintain employment and improve the exchanges, every sort of discouragement is placed in the way of our manufacturers and traders desiring to carry on trade with a very important group of markets. There is no prospect, whilst these conditions continue, of any effort being made not merely to regain our pre-war position, but, as is certainly desirable, to secure trade formerly in German hands.We are bound to assume that our Allies and associates, such as France and America, who are represented on the Allied Blockade Committee, are loyally adhering to the common understanding in regard to these matters, but it is only right to say that many letters have reached me which indicate that there is at least a wide-spread opinion that neither France nor America regard it as necessary to adopt an attitude so rigorous as ourselves.I am of opinion that the time has come when the question should definitely be fated whether existing Blockade requirements would not be sufficiently met if adequate [1312] 2M
precautions are taken to prevent the direct or indirect exportation to enemy countries of foods, raw materials, and munitions of war, and whether all the machinery framed to prevent the possibility&quot; of manufactured goods reaching her via neutral countries, may not, in present circumstances, be safely suspended.In these circumstances I would propose that the Allies should approach the problem from the other end ; i.e., that they should not seek to determine what specified articles can, with absolute safety, be allowed to be exported to the European neutrals without guarantees, but rather what articles it is so essential to keep out of enemv hands, that the whole complicated system of guarantees, rationing and licensing must be maintained in regard to such articles, f believe that if a sturdy common sense is applied to the consideration of this question, a very limited list of articles will emerge, and should such be the case there is no doubt whatever that the greatest possible benefit will result to the trade of this country, and a very substantial step will have been taken to promote that feeling of absence of restraint and freedom from control which is the very life-blood of business.For the purpose of framing such a definite list of restricted articles, I suggest that in the first instance there should be taken as a basis the British &quot; A &quot; List of prohibited articles, which embraces practically all foodstuffs and most of the principal raw materials. To this list a few additions will no doubt have to be made (e.g., raw rubber and cartridges), but 1 believe they will be found to be very limited in number, except possibly as regards actual munitions.My recommendations may, therefore, be resumed under the following heads: 1. Having regard to the necessity of reviving trade with neutral European countries the restrictions which now hedge it round should be removed in regard to as many descriptions of merchandise as possible.2. To achieve this end a list of the articles in respect of which restrictions must be retained should be substituted for the present limited list of articles in respect of which they have been dropped.3. This list should be limited, if possible, to foods, raw materials, and actual munitions of war, and as regards the two former classes should be based on the existing list &quot; A &quot; of articles prohibited to all destinations.Further, I suggest that the decision in the above questions should apply to countries like Finland, Esthonia, &amp;c, which border on enemy countries, and are now, I understand, within the purview of the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee.Exactly to what portions of pre-war Russia these conditions should apply is a matter on which guidance would be needed. In the other portions of Russia with which the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee are concerned the conditions of trade could presumably be fixed without any reference to Blockade consideration.I regard this matter as of the most urgent importance, and shall be glad of an early decision.Annex.Adding and calculating machines.

I have had the advantage of discussing my proposals with representatives of the various Departments affected. They are strongly. supported by the Treasury, and the War Trade Department, but the Departments intimately concerned with the administration of the Blockade, such as the Ministry of Blockade and the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department, feel grave doubts. It was pointed out that a decision on the whole matter must be contingent&quot; on an authoritative settlement of the question how far the primary object of the Blockade (viz., the prevention of supplies reaching Germany of any and all goods which might be of use to her if hostilities were to be resumed), is to be maintained in the altered circumstances arising out of the armistice.It was also contended that the Blockade would be the chief weapon of the Allies, so far as a weapon was needed in the future, and that if it were lifted in any consider-able degree it would be difficult to reimpose ; but as regards the latter point, I should suggest that a Blockade sufficiently stringent for any eventualities that might arise could be restored without much difficulty. Further, a modified proposal was brought forward to the effect that the system set up by the various agreements (under which importing associations like the Netherlands Oversea Trust are bound to prevent supplies reaching the enemy) should be continued while the necessity for obtaining export licences, except in the case of a limited number of articles, should be removed ; in other words, that consignment would still be necessary to the importing associations, but the necessity of obtaining licences for export would disappear.Memorandum Drafted by Representatives of Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, and Restriction of Enemy Supplies Department Respecting the Continuance of the Blockade.THE abolition of the Blockade, and of the machinery for its administration, is being strongly advocated by the trading community in this and other countries.The Departments in favour of removing to a large extent the present restrictions upon trade, in so far as they are due to Blockade reasons, are :-The Treasury,Board of Trade,War Trade Department, andDepartment of Overseas Trade.The view of these Departments has been submitted to the War Cabmet m a memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Departments which advocate the maintenance of the essential parts of the [1312] 2 N
present machinery as perhaps the only effective means of pressure on the enemy are theForeign Office, Admiralty, War Office, andRestriction of Enemy Supplies Department.These Departments feel that it is desirable that the War Cabinet should be placed in possession of the considerations which, in their opinion, render the continuance of the Blockade quite essential, and they express the hope that, before any decision is come to which would in effect dangerously relax the stringency of the Blockade, a representative of their point of view may be called to Paris, in order that, with Sir- Hubert Llewellyn Smith already in Paris, both sides of the question may be heard by the heads of the Associated Governments.Reasons for Continuance of the Blockade.1. The Blockade is the most effective weapon left to the Associated Powers for speedily obtaining our Peace Terms.The Admiralty and the War Office are strongly of this opinion. (See important memoranda attached (A) and (B) ).2. The continuance of the Blockade is calculated to secure an early peace.The Germans are suffering chiefly from the want of food, raw material, and, for the moment, manufactured articles of certain kinds. The knowledge that these cannot be expected, except by permitting, and under the direct control of the Associated Powers, until Peace is signed must obviously have a hastening effect upon the negotiations.If the Germans realise that there is any prospect of pressure being relaxed during the next few weeks they will play for time, hoping that the Blockade, the effect of which is far more keenly appreciated in Germany than in the Associated countries, will crumble before our peace conditions are conceded.3. If the Blockade is discontinued, even for a short period, it will be impossible again to bring its machinery into operation.Even if it were possible to set the machinery going again, the effectiveness of the Blockade, if it became necesssary to renew it after a period of abeyance, would be delayed in proportion to the amount of the uncontrolled supplies reaching Germany and contiguous countries during the period of such abeyance. This is our con-sidered and unanimous opinion.4. The Blockade means co-operation; its abolition means the most fierce trade competition among the Associated Powers.The effect of competition would not help the Associated Powers to present a united front at the Peace Conference. Moreover, the usefulness of the Allied Executives and Programme Committees (which may be valuable in connection with the establishment of a League of Nations) might well be jeopardised, quite apart from the harmful results of rapidly increasing prices in all markets of the world owing to neutrals buying for German account.These are the main points upon which the case for continuing the Blockade is based. It is desirable here to explain the present Blockade policy, and how far it has been and is still being modified to suit altered circumstances.Blockade Policy.The Associated Powers have agreements in force with the Scandinavian countries, Holland, and Switzerland, whereunder those countries have been entitled to severely restricted rations only. A schedule of largely increased rations has been approved by the Allied Blockade Committee, and is to take effect almost at once, representing what are considered to be the present genuine domestic requirements of those neutrals (except Switzerland, which is dealt with not by the Allied Blockade Committee in London but by the International Rationing Commission in Paris. In the case of Switzerland similar proposals for increasing the rations are at present before this Commission). Imports in excess of these requirements will inevitably involve leakage to the enemy.The question of further increases of the rations to the neutrals in so far as com-
-   264patible with, the maintenance of the pressure on the enemy, forms the day-to-day work of the Allied Blockade Committee. .The Treasury apparently go so far as to advocate the immediate export to the Northern neutrals of the large accumulated stocks of goods for those countries now available, in order at once to improve our exchange. Our view is that the immediate financial gain is outweighed by the loss of pressure we can apply to Germany. If a comparatively speedy peace is effected, those stocks can be sold to the neutrals immediately afterwards. It is merely a question of delaying the sale for a period which will probably be short. The difference in money gained by permitting unres-tricted sale of manuf:ctured articles and certain raw materials to those neutrals as compared with that which will be gained by permitting imports on the scale of the increased rations now to be put into operation is probably small if measured against the loss of our most important weapon for bending the German will to ours.It must be borne in mind that our trade with the Northern neutrals, however important, forms only a small part of our total export trade; and further that the increase of the rations will allow of the immediate development of that trade up to the full consuming capacity of those neutrals with consequent improvement to the Exchange.Equality of Associated Powers under Present System.The Board of Trade memorandum would appear to suggest that British trade is especially hampered by the present restrictions ; in fact, however, as things stand at present, all the Associated Powers are on an equal footing, since the Blockade restrictions apply equally all round. There is no question of the Americans, for example, having any unfair advantage over us in the &quot;matter of exports to these neutrals, in consequence of the existence of a licensing system.Relief of Germany.In advocating the continuance of the existing Blockade we are anxious to make clear that we do not for a moment wish to prejudge the question of replenishing Germany. On the contrary, the Blockade system is not inconsistent with the direct supply to Germany of foodstuffs, raw materials, or of manufactured goods if it is decided that this is politically desirable.The advantage of a controlled (direct) supply of these commodities to Germany as compared with an uncontrolled supply (leakage through neutral countries) have been set out in a memorandum (see Appendix (C)) transmitted to Lord Reading in Paris about a week ago, a copy of which appears as an appendix to this memorandum. The only further point which it is now desired to make in this connection is that the effect of adopting the Board of Trade proposals would inevitably be to prejudge the question.If Germany is to be replenished at all, we feel strongly that this should be done under Allied control, and not by the casual leakage through neutrals, which would undoubtedly be the result of the adoption of the proposals in the Board of Trade memorandum. Incidentally the Board of Trade policy will have the dangerous result of building up an entrepot trade in neutral countries to the lasting detriment of British trade in particular.Manufactured Articles.The Board of Trade memorandum dweRs specially on the importance of advancing trade in manufactured articles, and there is an underlying suggestion that these possess comparatively little military importance. Experience has, however, conclusively shown that it was precisely the lack of some of these manufactures, e.g., boots and clothing of all kinds which so profoundly affected the moral of the German people, and eventually, through them, that of the German army. Nor can the fact be overlooked that, if British trade in particular is to be extended in the markets of the neutrals contiguous to Germany, it is just these commodities which will probably form the bulk of the trade and will leak through to the enemy.If it is now thought politically expedient to admit certain manufactures of this character into Germany, we would repeat that, in our view, this should be done under direct AUied control.
Conclusion.Like the Board of Trade, we feel that the whole question involved is one of the very highest importance, and that it should therefore receive careful and minute consideration by the Associated Powers. At the risk of repetition, we would ask that if and when the matter is discussed in Paris we may be afforded an opportunity of sending a representative to voice our views.APPENDIX (A).Proposals as to the Relaxation of the BlockadeTHE following is the Admiralty point of view : 1. The Blockade is the principal means we have of forcing Germany to an early peace, and the peace that we want.2. That if the present machinery is dropped we should have the greatest difficulty in replacing it, even if we could succeed in doing this at all.3. That the situation can be met by largely increasing the rations for neighbour-ing neutrals, the aim being to approach, but not -quite to reach, the point of saturation as far as they are concerned.4. That trade might safely be re-opened with ports in the Black Sea which are sufficiently far from Germany to make re-exportation unlikely, and with the districts in Eastern Europe under Allied control. But in all cases it is considered that the Blockade of Germany should be continued, and the present machinery for securing its efficiency should remain in force.APPENDIX (B).Memorandum embodying the Views of the General Staff respecting theContinuance of the Blockade.Throughout the war and during this transition period from war to peace, the War Office has regarded all economic questions affecting the enemy from a war point of view, and has watched closely the effect of the Blockade on the enemy&apos;s military resources. The details of the execution of Blockade Policy are matters for the Foreign Office and civil departments and Admiralty.The raising of the Blockade, or any general announcement that such a course is in contemplation, or that the restrictions are to be relaxed, would be seized upon by the enemy as a pretext for temporising, and would have a prejudicial effect on our troops.In principle, the full Blockade pressure should still be maintained. It is our one weapon to ensure, without further bloodshed, the carrying out of our armistice terms, to obtain an early peace, and to enable us to reduce the army of occupation, and to get our soldiers home. At the same time, in order to avoid the danger of complete Bolshevism in Germany, food and raw material to start industries and prevent unemployment, should be distributed under the control of the Associated Powers.WM. THWAITES, Major-General.January 20, 1919.
265Memorandum on Continuance of Blockade Until Peace.Premises.Admittedly the Blockade of Germany is our strongest weapon, short of further bloodshed, for compelling Germany to accept our peace terms.At the same time Germany threatens to fall to pieces for want of raw materials.These conflicting interests can be reconciled by rationing Germany until peace is signed, perhaps allocating larger rations to those portions of the country which show signs of having a settled Government as a reward to them, and as an inducement to other provinces to resist Bolshevism.Advantage of Direct Rationing as Compared with Supplying via Neutrals.1. Under a system of direct supply, the German tonnage will clearly become available; supplying through neutral means the use of neutral and. allied tonnage only.2. Direct supply ensures goods reaching provinces ; selected supply via neutrals means supply mainly to border provinces of Germany only, or, alternatively, to richest classes, which will not hold German proletariat.3. Direct supply ensures charging of reasonable prices ; supply through neutrals means Associated Powers selling to neutrals at market rates, the neutrals making large &quot; middleman&quot; profits at expense of German funds, out of which indemnity is expected to be paid.4. Direct supply ensures reopening of trade direct with enemy (we have got to come to this ultimately, and the Central Powers mean over 100,000,000 prospective purchasers). Supply through neutrals means the establishment of entrepot trade in neutral countries &apos;at the expense of British entrepot trade, and of ordinary direct trade between this and enemy countries.5. Direct supply may earn some political gratitude from the enemy towards the Associated Powers, indirect supply cannot in any- way favour our future prospects, trade, or political, in enemy countries.6. Direct supply provides a considerable outlet at once for Allied trade, larger than that which can be done through neutrals, if only for the reason that more tonnage will be available (section 1).7. Under a system of direct supply we know exactly how much of any commodity is reaching the enemy; by allowing supplies to drift through neutrals we shall not know this.8. Direct supply can be terminated or modified to suit political or other requirements ; over indirect supply we have no control.9. Direct supply will mean lower prices in the German market, we shall thus ruin the many pro-German firms in neutral countries, who have bought at very inflated prices for speculative post-war account.- 10. Direct supply is consistent with any scheme of world rationing of raw materials; free buying by neutrals for German account will send commodities to unheard-of prices, upsetting trade throughout the world (cotton, for example, would soar to terrific prices if Germany were now allowed to bid through neutral purchasers).Method of Direct Supply.Cargoes would be imported either directly under an Allied Control Board (if individual allied traders wish to avoid the illegality or stigma of direct trading with the enemy), or by individual traders, under licences issued by, and at prices approved by, the Allied Control Board.Payment.The cost of the goods so supplied would be a first charge upon German capacity to pay.General Advantage of this System.We should retain our whip-hand over Germany and obtain our peace conditions ; we should save her from Bolshevism, and thus enable her to be in a position to [1312] 2 0APPENDIX (0).
reorganise after peace and start paying an indemnity which might be spread over a considerable number of years. We should retain our enemy markets and widen our scope for export forthwith.With the abolition of the Blockade, and especially its machinery, we lose our power of coercion over Germany; we run the risk of seeing Germany crumble and becoming unable to pay any indemnity ; we lose our trade to the neutrals. Obviously the time element &apos;is all important.Marshal Foch to Earl Curzon.J&apos;AI 1 nonneur de vous faire connaitre que je suis completement d&apos;accord sur la conclusion de votre lettre au sujet du blocus de 1&apos;Allemagne.Le maintien strict des regies du blocus s&apos;impose au point de vue militaire.En effet, lorsque les armees alliees seront reduites au point de rendre difficile toute operation militaire importante, le blocus, dont la rigueur pourrait etre augmentee ou diminuee suivant les circonstances, resterait le meilleur moyen et le plus rapide d&apos;obtenir le respect de la convention deTannistice etd&apos;une maniere generale dhmposer notre volonte a 1&apos;Allemagne.(Signe)      FOCH.- Le 3 fevrier, 1919.Appendix XXXVIII.MEMORANDUM BY MR. S. J. CHAPMAN ON THE PLACING OF ORDERSBY RAILWAYS AND TRAMWAYS.1. Railways.FROM enquiries made of the Railway Executive Committee it appears that orders are not being held up to any appreciable extent, if at all, either on account of the uncertainty as regards future relations between the railways and the Government, or on account of the expected fall in prices. It is said that the requirements of the railways for repairs and replacements are so urgent that nothing can be allowed to stand in the way of their fulfilment, but it is admitted that the prices of many things are regarded as extravagantly high.Shortage of certain essential things is preventing the rapid fulfilment of some orders ; for instance, it is said to be impossible to get a sufficient supply of axles, springs, and tyres for locomotives and waggons, the firms producing these things being now full up with orders. Moreover, there is a shortage of sleepers and seasoned timber for waggons. It would seem to be advisable that special efforts should be made to get into the country the requisite supplies of these two articles. It is reported that sleepers used to come from Germany, and that now satisfactory ones in sufficient quantities can only be obtained from the western coast of Canada and America, which means of course very long journeys, so that there are naturally shipping difficulties.As regards the railway workshops, these are full up with work, and likely to be so for a long time to come.Some weeks ago it was feared that there would be unemployment in the industries supplying railways, and consequently an arrangement was made by the Board of Trade with the Treasury with a view to encouraging railways to acquire at once stores needed in 1919 and the first six months of 1920. The arrangement having been made, a circular was issued to the companies (of which a copy is attached as an appendix to this report). The Railway Executive Committee has not been able to obtain any definite information as to the action taken as a result of the circular, so far as orders of material required for use in 1920 are concerned. Certain difficulties have arisen, and it is reported also that in some cases the purchasing of stores is strictly limited by storage accommodation.In addition to urging the railways to purchase their stores ahead, they were also urged some weeks ago to arrange for the construction of additional locomotives in certain of the armament firms&apos; works. Acting on this recommendation, specifications were prepared, but when the firms were approached with a view to their undertaking the
work it was found that instead of the anticipated slackness of business having been realised, more orders had been placed than could be put in hand for many months tocome.To sum up, it would certainly seem that in the matters considered there is no boldins: back, or material holding back, of railway demand, the reasons no doubt being the urgency of the work, and the fact that under the arrangement with the^ Government, the financial considerations involved, connected with any continued fall in prices, rest with the Government. But some check is being experienced on account of shortage of axles, springs, tyres, &amp;c, and particularly of sleepers and timber. It would appear, therefore, that a special effort should be made to increase the imports of sleepers and of the kind of timber needed for waggons.As regards extensions and development, however, the position is somewhat different. On the outbreak of war the railway companies had in contemplation numerous extensions and capital works of various kinds. The value of the works then in contem-plation was probably at least 15,000,0001. or 20,000,0001. Most of these works were suspended owing to the war, but there is no essential reason why many of them and others also should not now be proceeded with.One of the principal practical difficulties in the way of such necessary works being undertaken at the present time is the arrangement between the railway companies and the Government with regard to the remuneration of fresh capital expenditure. Under this arrangement the railway companies would, during control, get no benefit from the increased receipts resulting from the construction of such works. They would merely receive interest at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum on the capital expenditure involved from the date on which the works were brought into use. Since fresh capital cannot now be raised by railway companies at 4 per cent, it follows that the companies would lose money if they were to construct new works, however much such works might be required, and however intrinsically profitable their construction might be. This circumstance is said to make railway companies extremely reluctant to undertake new works ; and, of course, with regard to new works, there is the question of the supply of capital as well as that of the rate of interest.2. Tramways.At the present time a considerable number of tramway companies and local authorities are considering the question of extending or renewing their tramways, and of purchasing additional cars or omnibuses. There are, however, two important diffi-culties which threaten to put a serious check on such action.In the first place, there is the considerable increase which has taken place in the price of tramway rails. This has now been fixed at 171. or 171. 10s.- a ton, which compares with the price of 131. 7s. 6d. for railway rails. It is true that tramway rails have always been more expensive than railway rails, but the excess cost of tramway rails is understood not to have been more than 21. per ton before the war. The Board of Trade have represented strongly to the Ministry of Munitions that the price of tramway rails should, if possible, be reduced, but the Ministry seem to be practically in the hands of the manufacturers in this matter, and have not been able to do anything.An even more serious obstacle in the way of the undertaking of tramway works by local authorities and companies is the attitude of the Treasury towards applications for borrowing powers and capital issues. During the war the Board of Trade have pledged themselves to the Treasury not to sanction any applications from local authorities for loans which could possibly be avoided, and the Treasury have not released us from this embargo. Unofficial discussion has taken place with the Treasury, and it has been suggested to them that the Board of Trade should now sanction applications for loans for purposes which appear to them to be necessary, and that the question of the amount oi employment likely to be created by the expenditure should be taken into account, f he Treasury, while holding out some hope that they might possibly be prepared to agree to some slight relaxation of the present stringent conditions, have now written to the Board of Trade saying that they are unable to sanction loans by local authorities in connection with tramways and omnibuses &quot; except in cases in which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade that the tramways or motor-buses, as the case may-be, are urgently required for the welfare of the working classes.&quot;A strict enforcement of the condition would prevent a considerable number of schemes being carried out which would otherwise be put in hand in the near future.
(Appendix XXXVIII.)    Railway Executive Committee.35, Parliament Street, (Circular Letter No. 1694.) Westminster, S.W. 1,January 23, 1919.Purchase of Stores for Railway Companies.Dear Sir,An appeal has been made by the Minister of Munitions and by the President of the Board of Trade that, with a view to assisting the various firms occupied in manufacturing materials and stores used on the railways, the railway companies shall within the next two or three weeks place orders for any materials and stores as are manufactured in this country and are likely to be required for use during the next eighteen months.2. Many of the larger railway companies have expressed themselves as willing to fall in with the proposal, but have asked that some arrangement may be come to with the Treasury in regard to the financing of the arrangement. An agreement has, therefore, been arrived at with the Treasury and Board of Trade on the following lines: (i.) The companies will agree to place orders at once for all stores required for use during the present year. The same to be paid for by the companies as the stores are required by them, and charged against the Government as and when used.(ii.) The companies would further agree to place orders for such stores as they estimate they will be able to use during the first six months of 1920 on the understanding that the companies pay the accounts, and the Government allow interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum on the amounts paid from the date of payment to the last day of the month prior to the date on which the stores are issued.(iii.) If, as a result of this action, any company finds itself at the end of the period of control in possession of a stock of any stores in excess of the stock held by such company at the commencement of the war, and such excess quantity has been purchased at a price higher than the price current in 1913, the Government shall pay the company the difference between the purchase price and such current price on the excess amount of stores.(iv.) In determining whether there is an excess of stores at the end of the control period as compared with 1913, due regard must be had to any material extension of the railway system concerned.3. The intention is that any material and stores ordered and used during the current year will be dealt with in the usual way through the railway company&apos;s accounts, and that the arrangement for charging interest will only apply to stores and materials ordered during the next two months in anticipation of the requirements for the first six months of 1920.If the proposition is one that appeals to you, we shall be glad if you will at once act upon it, advising us in due course of any orders you are able to place for stores and materials required for use during the period January 1919 to June 1920.Yours faithfully,H. A, WALKER,The General Manager (all railways). Acting Chairman.Appendix XXXIX.MEMORANDUM BY Mr. S. j. CHAPMAN, BOARD OF TRADE.Railway Materials.(A.) Restrictions on Dealings.ON the 29th December 1916 all dealings in second-hand railway material were prohibited (by Order under 30a of the Defence of the Realm Regulations) except under licence from the Ministry of Munitions. On 7th February 1919 this Order was &quot; suspended   ....   except in so far as relates to wagons of all types.&quot;
Appendix XL.LETTER FROM FEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRIES REGARDING PLACING OF ORDERS BY CROWN AGENTS.Mr. Charles Tennyson to Sir A. Geddes.39, St. James&apos;s Street, London, Sir, 22nd February 1919.I BEG to enclose a copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Crown Agents for the Colonies. This letter speaks for itself, and in this connection I would call your attention to Resolution No. B. 8, included in a number of resolutions passed at a meeting of this Federation on 26th November last, and forwarded to the Govern-ment, of which I enclose a copy also.Unless the Government is prepared to assist British manufacturers by placing all possible orders with them during the present crisis, the progress of reconversion from war footing would be made extremely difficult, and I trust that you will use your influence to secure that all branches of the Government observe this principle.Yours faithfullv,CHARLES TENNYSON, Assistant Director.The present position thus is that no second-hand wagons can be sold without a permit from the Railway Material Licences Department of the Ministry of Munitions.Extensive use has been made of these powers. It has been the policy of the Department to issue or to refuse permits in accordance not only with the relative national importance of the use to which the material would be put, but also with the price which it was proposed to charge. A scale of prices for wagons was drawn up, based upon  140 as a reasonable charge for a wagon when new, with a fixed rate of depreciation according to age ; and it has been the strict policy only to issue permits in cases where the price charged did not exceed this scale. Similarly a scale was drawn up for the hiring of wagons on the basis of 7s. 3d. per week for a 10-ton wagon. In this way it is claimed that very great economies have been secured in the transport of essential commodities, especially coal. The consideration of price which has thus been a governing factor in the licensing policy appears to be the reason for the retention of the prohibition on dealings in second-hand wagons. The removal of the restrictions on other forms of railway material was, however, accompanied by an alteration in the scale of prices for wagons, the basis being increased from  140 to  160.(B.) Restrictions on Export.The export of railway material has been prohibited during the war as being a war material. In the Board of Trade Journal, 16th January 1919, it was announced that an open general licence had been issued for the export of &quot; railway carriages, locomotives and wagons and their -component parts &quot; to all (except certain specified) destinations. In the issue of 6th February 1919 it was announced that it would be necessary to cancel this open licence the following week, and issue in its place a licence applicable only to second-hand rolling stock. In the issue of 13th February 1919 it was duly announced that the licence applicable to all rolling stock was cancelled, but the revised liceuce issued applied only to &quot; second-hand rolling stock (except wagons).&quot; Thus second-hand wagons can only be exported under special licence.It appears that the issue of the general licence of 16th January was due to a misunderstanding; and that its cancellation was due to the shortage of available supplies in this, country. The retention of the restriction on second-hand wagons is due not only to the desire to safeguard the supplies of this country, but also to the fact that, as export implies dealings, it is inconsistent to allow free export of a commodity which cannot be bought or sold without special licence.
Sir, 21st February 1919.WE have received a letter from an important member in the Railway Engineeringtrade, calling attention to an article which appeared in the Globe of 10th February,and which has no doubt been brought to your notice.   The following is an extractfrom our member&apos;s letter : &quot;It has been the custom ever since the outbreak of war for the Press to deal with the phenomenal demands for British locomotives.&quot; It is generally assumed that all locomotive builders in Groat Britain are not only extremely busy now-but are likely to be for a considerable time ahead. Speaking for our own part as the fourth biggest locomotive building firm in Great Britain, this is by no means the case. Smce the armistice we have had over half a million pounds worth of orders cancelled, but we have not received one order from any Government department in Great Britain since the cessation of hostilities. Indeed, we have only received one enquiry, and that is from the India Office for four locomotives.&quot; The Crown Agents for the Colonies have never addressed us; the Board of Trade or any of the other departments which the Press is so profuse in stating are ordering so largely, we have not heard from.&quot; In ordinary circumstances, as our plant and machinery is much more modern than any other works in Great Britain, we should be the first to hear of any such demand, and we do not say that there is not a demand, but if orders are being placed in America it must be by some unscrupulous persons who are benefiting thereby more largely than if they were placed in this country.&quot; About three years ago we approached you and protested that the War Office was getting many hundreds of locomotives in America and you were good enough to assist us by your protest.&quot; We now call upon you, especially in view of the above remarks which you can make use of with regard to our own experience since the armistice, to protest most vigorously to the Crown Agents for the Colonies or whoever may be against this wicked and unpatriotic policy, which seems to us inexcusable.&quot;I need not emphasise further the very great importance in the present condition Of industrial unrest, of ensuring that the greatest possible quantity of orders are placed with British manufacturers even should this involve some financial sacrifice to the Government, and I may say that our members have definitely stated that they are now taking orders for locomotives for delivery in two, three or four months, in practically all types. I shall be very glad to receive any observations that you may care to make in regard to this matter.Yours faithfully,Assistant Director.Reconstruction of Industry.Resolutions passed at a Meeting of the Federation of British Industries, held at the ^Offices of the Federation, 39, St. James&apos;s Street, S.W. 1, on Tuesday, 26th November, 1918, at 10&quot;30 a.m.It was resolved:(A.) (1.) That this meeting having considered the suggestion made in the attached Memorandum, forms the conclusion that it&quot; is not one which would be suitable for general application.(2.) That in principle, so far as home orders are concerned, it is sounder to finance, or secure against loss, the purchaser rather than the manufacturer. It is, however, important that the Government should guarantee against a falling market those who manufacture for stock. The Federation will be pleased to advise the Government as to the carrying out of these principles.(B.) The meeting desires to submit the following detailed recommendations :  (1.) (a.) That the Government should grant as an allowance out of Excess Profits Duty all expenses incurred in the rearrangement of existing plant from a war to a peace footing. Where buildings have to be altered back to their previous condition the same provision should apply. (b.) That an allowance for special depreciation should be made out of Excess Profits Duty free of Income Tax to meet the cost of extensions of building and plant for peace purposes on the same basis as that granted in respect of buildings or plant erected or purchased for war purposes.
(c.) That incases covered by (a) and (b) above, where Excess Profits have not beenearned or are not sufficient, an equivalent or supplementary allowanceshould be granted by the State. (d.) That these conditions should apply only to lirms who commence rearrange-&quot;ments or extensions within  twelve  months from the signing of thearmistice.*The Federation is convinced that an early announcement on the above lines would have a most beneficial effect.(2.) That ample reserves should be allowed to be made for the depreciation of stocks in assessing excess profits duty.(3.) That, as the steel supply is of such supreme importance to industry, it is urgent that the Government should immediately declare its policy in regard to the price of steel.(4.) That the Government should at the earliest possible moment make a clear statement in full detail of the system of priority to be adopted in regard to the supply and working of the various industries.(5.) That special consideration in regard to priority for demobilisation and relaxation of restrictions should be given to trades, such as the printing and paper trades, on which all industries are dependent. That restrictions on the use of paper should be relaxed immediately so as to facilitate the issue of catalogues and other forms of publicity.(6.) That authority should be given for the release of a very much larger number of pivotal men than is at present contemplated, and particular attention paid to the case of men concerned in selling and export. That skilled men already released from the Colours, who are now in employment, should not be recalled without the consent of their employers.(7.) That the system of prohibition and restriction- of export subject to licence be abolished where practicable, and every possible effort made, to secure tonnage for export at rates which will enable British manufacturers to compete favourably in foreign markets.(8.) That the Government should at once place as many prospective orders as possible, subject to adjustment in regard &quot;to prices should this prove necessary, and should press British Overseas Governments and other large purchasers, such as the railway companies, to do the same.(9.) That arrangements be made as soon as possible to enable the requirements of the devastated areas to be ascertained, and that the share which British industry will take in the restoration, and the method in which orders will be placed, should be made known as soon as possible.(10.) (a.) That the Government should give immediate orders for so much of the material required for carrying out its programme of working-class housing (including metal and woodwork) as is considered reasonably safe, deliveries ultimately to be made to local authorities and Public Utility Societies, &amp;c, so long as such orders shall not interfere with the supply of materials necessary for the carrying out of building work of a character essential to the general conduct of trade throughout the country.(b.)&apos; Further, that the appointment of the Electrical Commissioners recommended by the Board of Trade Electrical Committee should he made immediately with a view to the earliest possible settlement of the question of super-power stations, and the placing of any orders involved. (11-) - (a.) That an announcement be immediately made that the Government will give liberal financial and other assistance to any sound British commercial enterprise of public utility, at home or abroad, which is prepared to purchase British products on a large scale, (o.) (i) That a preference should be given in granting permission to issue new capital to all British or approved foreign persons, firms, companies or corporations, which are prepared to undertake to buy all manufactured material required for their entemrises from British producers.(ii) That no new issue of capital should be allowed unless an undertaking is given that at least 50 per cent, of orders for manufactured material will be placed in the United Kingdom, (hi) That the Government should take active steps to see that the undertakings indicated above are strictly carried out.
(12.) That the Government he urged to arrange for a definite column in every leading newspaper for the publication of its official announcements so that the public; may know where to find the same without undue search, and that if necessary this space should be paid for.(13.) That the earliest possible consideration be given to the representations contained in these resolutions, as it is most urgent that immediate action be taken on the questions therein dealt with.War Industry to Peace Products.In order to turn over as speedily as possible from War Industry to Peace Products, the Government should, when requested, place orders for such essential supplies as the following : 1. Standard ships (complete).2. Locomotives and parts.3. Eailway wagons and parts.4. Agricultural machinery.5. Building material (woodwork, bricks, cement, granite, limestone, &amp;c., &amp;c).6. Road material.7. Cotton and woollen goods.8. Domestic appliances.9. Standard electrical supplies, &amp;c.Payment should be made by the Government on the basis of a percentage of the estimated cost being paid to the manufacturer upon the order being placed, and the balance paid monthly on the basis of approved audited costs (labour, material, and on costs). The manufacturer should be given the option of refunding to the Government any moneys paid, and retain the right to sell in the open market any goods manufactured under this scheme, and also be allowed to determine the arrangement by giving reasonable notice. As and when material so ordered is disposed of by the manufacturer, the latter would refund the Government pro rata. The manufacturer should have full latitude as regards questions of design and material.Appendix XLI.NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF SUPPLY ON THE SUPPLY OF MATERIAL REQUIRED FOR THE HOUSING SCHEME.Bricks.DURING the war the production dropped from 3,600,000,000 per annum to 600,000,000, a quantity totally inadequate to meet actual national requirements. The first thing to be done is to increase output, and vigorous steps in that direction are being taken. The urgent needs of the trade are labour and machinery ; the questions of raw material and transport are capable of solution. The discharge of about 2,400 pivotal men has been applied for, many are released already, and it is expected that all will be released within the next three weeks. But in some cases these pivotal men cannot be used to advantage for lack of ordinary labourers who, after their experi-ence of the past four years of work in comfortable conditions, and with higher wages, are disinclined to take up the dirty, hard, and disagreeable work of clay digging, &amp;c, and for less moneysThe remedy for this lies : 1. In Improved Wages. Clay diggers and similar workmen were greatly under-paid before the war. The men had no Union; now, almost all of them have become members of Trade Unions, and are not likely to accept less than the building labourers of their districts. It would be useless for the owners to resist.2. In the Provision of Machinery. In most yards &quot;the appliances are primitive, and production would be increased and cheapened if they were improved. Inspectors are hard at work urging this reform on makers, and offering to do all that is possible to expedite the provision of machinery.   The larger and
more important yards require no financial assistance. In very many more cases the placing of substantial orders by the Government will enable ^ firms to get help from their bankers. All the help required by the majority of tbe^rest of the yards could be met by ordering bricks, and paying for them in advance. Accumulated stocks would soon cover the risk. In a residuum of cases more substantial help must be given, andit is proposed to consult the Treasury as to how this can be done with a minimum of risk. 3. Better Conditions of Employment. The conditions under which men used to work in the smaller yards were bad, and the men returning from their war work would tolerate them no longer. The men can be trusted to put this matter right.4. Prompt Payment. This is an essential condition, and the new Department of Building Material Supplies will be responsible for seeing that it is carried out.In the case of most of the smaller and poorer firms it may be necessary to buy almost all their output. This would be done to keep the firms in funds. It by no means signifies that the Government would use the whole of this output, but part would be released for private trade should the public interest demand it.The total required for the full housing programme during this year is 2,000,000,000 bricks. Ic is not likely that this can be carried out, but orders have been placed already for 350,000,000 with the larger yards, in whose deliveries there is little or no chance of failure. About 40,000,000 more have been ordered from smaller yards, who possibly mav not be quite so quick with deliveries. These orders do not exhaust, by a long way, the capabilities of the yards. They were considered ample for some time to come, and, as it was considered certain that the price would drop within the next few months, it was thought best not to order more now.Very many yards are derelict, or dormant, but reports show that in most cases the owners will reopen them if they can get labour. The reports on the machinery, such as it is, in these yards shew that it is not in bad condition, and has been looked after during the idle period,The Government will retain the right of requisitioning bricks, so that, while it is the intention to make the trade as free as possible, a fair share of bricks will be secured for the Housing Schemes and general Government demands.Portland Cement.There will be no difficulty in obtaining the necessaiy supply without imposing restrictions on private home trade. Any temporary shortage could be relieved by imposing restrictions on exports.Timber.The Government hold stocks in the United Kingdom and in foreign ports more than sufficient to supply all the carcassing and rough carpentry for the houses, without drawing on private stocks. The position with respect to joinery timber is not so clear ; it is a question rather of quality than quantity, and just possible that Government stocks may be somewhat short of demands. Recourse would then be had to private stocks. Considerable stocks exist in builders&apos; yards, and would be brought, into use by those contractors who carry out the work. There is no reason to fear that the timber supply will not be adequate.Roofing Slates and Tiles.The quantity of slates required by the country for all purposes, including the Housing Schemes, is estimated at 315,620 tons for the first year, and 295,252 tons for the second. These figures are about equal to the average pre-war output. At the present time the output is not more than about one-third of the normal. The trade can be revived more easily than the brick trade. The slate quarrymen are asking for an increase of wages, which they will probably get, but they do not object to their work and will return to it.The output is limited only by the supply of labour and machinery. The labour should be forthcoming very shortly to increase the output for those yards which are working now, and the provision of machinery should present no difficulty. The quarries in Scotland have been allowed to fall almost into disuse. Financial assistance is necessary to re-start them. It is estimated that their output would provide for the whole of the Scotch demands. .[1312] 2 q
Everyone has agreed as to the objects to be aimed at, but the exact conditions prevailing and the difficulties to be overcome do not seem to be fully appreciated. 1 The conditions, even prior to the war, were unsatisfactory, as, owing to the fact of legislation and high cost of building compared with rents for two or three years before the war, the number of houses built had been reduced from 80,000 to 100,000 per annum to something like 30,000There seems to be an increasing indisposition on the part of workers to pay the economic rent of a good house, probably owing to the many new forms of amusement and recreation which are becoming available.Since the war there has been very little building done, except where the Govern-ment have provided part of the funds for building schemes. On the other hand, the stoppage of emigration has, probably, more than counter-balanced the los3 in killed in the war, and. in addition to this, it is necessary to provide for the ordinary increase in the population.Various powers have been given to local authorities in the past, but these have only been taken advantage of to a small extent. Further, under Sir Thomas Wrightsons Bill, it was possible for individuals to borrow up to two-thirds of the value at a low rate of interest on building cottages, but this was rendered practically inoperative by the method adopted by the valuation of the Public Works Loan Commissioners. I know of a case in which it was proposed to spend over 4,000L for twenty houses where the amount offered to be advanced on approved plans was only 1,0001.Another drawback to building good houses is that if the rent of a house is more than about 5s. 6d. or 6s. a week, the rates cannot be compounded for at, say, 25 per cent, rebate, and this makes it impracticable for builders to put up houses which were worth, say, 7s. or 8s. a week, especially where the rates were high.Note. I know of a case where builders were offered the land cheaper if they would build better cottages, but they said it was impracticable commercially on the above grounds.This will be even more serious after the war, as local rates must increase owing to higher wages and salaries.My own belief is that the powers granted to local authorities to build houses as a matter of fact reduce the number of houses which are actually built, as private parties delayed taking action, waiting to see what the local authorities would do.If the position is to be met within any reasonable time, it is necessary to induce both local authorities, companies, and private parties to build houses at the earliest possible date.It is not necessary to describe in detail the kind of house which is necessary as this has been gone into by many companies and local authorities, but there are one or two general observations which I should like to make.1. The existing bye-laws often necessitated a very large amount of money being wasted on roads. There seems to be no reason, as long as the air space, or, where possible, garden ground, is provided, why there should be both a back and a front carriage road to each cottage.&apos;L The question of land is in some districts the difficulty, but, as a rule, the value of land is a small matter as compared with the value of a house.3. There is the natural desire to build the very best class of house possible. This may be overdone : -(i.) By insisting on desirable but not necessary expenditure, which renders it,impossible to build houses in large numberH. (li.) The house may be too large for the woman who nas a number or youngchildren to look after ; and (iii.) That it it most undesirable a house should be larger than is required, as thisencourages the taking in of lodgers.My suggestion would be that where properties are being laid out for house-building there should be a law that for every house there must be a certain proportion or either garden, which could be retained with the house, or open space, handed over to the local authority.Firstly, that the houses should be of different dimensions, say, five, four, and three-roomed.As to the cost of building, this is most costly if carried out by a Government iJepartment or local authority, as it necessitates architects being employed, quantities taken out, and the whole matter carried through in a most formal manner.

Secondly, building companies or large business concerns can build houses substantially cheaper, as they frequently have very special facilities for providing materials, and the latter often make use of their own stall for a good deal of the work, and they are able to contract for building the houses without the employment of an architect or taking out quantities.Thirdly, the most economical method of building is by the ordinary small builder, who is both his own architect as well as the actual builder of the house. He has, of course, to submit plans to the local authority, and the houses have to be passed before they are allowed to be occupied. He often works himself, and usually sells the houses as completed.The Limitation of Rents Bill has frightened the investor from building cottage property, and also discouraged capitalists lending thereon. Owing to the increasing cost of upkeep, in many cases the small holder has been hard hit. If it is possible for the Government to fix a date for the removal of this restriction it would have a great effect in encouraging building. It is now being got rouud by subterfuges, such as selling the key, which, I understand, is a common practice.Schemes have been put forward for the building of houses by local authorities, with the assistance of the Government, but if we are to meet the position it seems to be necessary to take some steps which will encourage and concentrate the whole of our available resources in building cottages.I would&apos; suggest for consideration that the Government offer a grant of, say, 40 per cent, (exclusive of the cost of land and architects&apos; remuneration) not exceeding 200L in the case of any one house for all houses which are erected before the 31st March, 1920, to all persons, whether local authorities, utility companies, or private owners; for all houses erected before the 30th April, 37^- per cent., and reducing by 2\ per cent, each month until the subsidy is eliminated.I realise it requires strong reasons for putting such a proposition forward and for inducing Parliament to agree, but, as stated earlier, the cost of building had already increased very considerably prior to the war probably about 70 per cent, in industrial districts, as compared with fifteen or twenty years previously. Since the war, the cost of building has increased as compared with the period immediately prior to the war-probably from 100 per cent, to 110 per cent. A 40 per cent, grant would be equivalent to an 80 per cent, increase in the pre-war cost. My fear would rather be that there would not be sufficient rush to build houses, even if such a proposal were passed into law, but the total amount of grant could be limited, and no doubt many large employers of labour would take advantage of the proposal to erect houses.I do not recommend it, but the position might be safeguarded, if necessary, by a provision that the nett rents should not exceed 0^ per cent. (5 per cent, interest and 1 per cent, depreciation) for ten years on total cost less the State&apos;s contribution.My reason for thinking the scheme would be better without this safeguard is that houses are often most required in districts where the future is uncertain, and there always has been a substantial difference in the average rent obtainable in different localities, which can be justified on the grounds of the industries in such localities being liable to greater or less fluctuations, and, as a consequence, unemployment.Even if the limitation were inserted, many houses would be erected, but it would certainly limit the number, especially in districts where they are most required.If 10,000 houses were erected and completed each month from the 1st January, 1920, to the 31st December, at a cost of 450L (exclusive of land, &amp;c), each of the grants would be as follows :-Month.Grant.Per cent.Januarjr February March ... April  ... MayJune   ...July   ...August...SeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember 1,800,000&apos; 1,800,000 1,800,000 1,087,500&apos; 1.575.000 1.4G3.500 1,350.000 1.237.500 1.125.O00 1.012,500 000,000 787,50016,538,5004037*3532^3027i25&quot;22^20
The. main grounds for justification of this is that it is equally necessary to house the population decently as it was to provide munitions of war, and, in that case, the Government made grants to private firms on account of the abnormal cost during war. The present abnormal after-the-war costs appear likely to continue for some time, and unless some exceptional measures are taken, there is no possible chance of sufficienthouses being provided.The scheme also provides for housing being ultimately placed on an economicbasis.ARTHUR F.   EASE.February 27, 1919.Appendix XLIII.U.A.S.T.-8. &apos;-ANALYSIS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARDOF PUBLIC WORKS PROPOSED.Sir Auckland Geddes,I ATTACH, for circulation, an analysis of the public works which have been sanctioned as far as this Boards authorisation is required. You will observe that they are divided into two groups as requested, both with respect to the provision of employment and with respect to those authorities who might be able to raise the loans themselves. You will observe also that, taking the two classes together, it is expected that authorities will be able to raise loans themselves to the extent of 11,469,0007., and that those who will require to have loans provided through the Public Works Loans Commissioners have works in project estimated to cost 2,785,600LI attach also the covering minute from Sir Noel Kershaw, and I suggest that, in view of the Cabinet decision this morning, the Local Government Board should oe authorised to exclude all these loans forthwith from the Treasury embargo.We may perhaps have been too sanguine as to the number of local authorities who can raise money in the open market.It should also be pointed out that, in a number of cases, the local authorities according to recent reports indicate either an absence of unemployment or even a scarcity of labour for these purposes. I have sent some appropriate examples of these reports to the Ministry of Labour.C. ADDISON.February 25, 1919.The President,1. We have not information which will enable us to distinguish works which can be begun at an early date from works which could be begun after June. The information given as to date of commencement is in most cases very vague.2. Usually we are told that the date of commencement depends on labour and materials being available.For example, loans for electricity are sanctioned, and the plant ordered, but we know that in many cases it cannot be started upon for some time. In ordinary circum-stances, at the present time an order for an electric generator given to-day will not be fulfilled in less than twelve months.3. Attention has already been drawn to the difficulty the local authorities have as regards staff, e.g., draughtsmen and persons to prepare quantities and revise estimates. There is also some difficulty in obtaining tenders except on the Colwyn terms, which many local authorities dislike.4. We have attempted a division of the works under the heads of (a.) Those giving wide variety of employment; and (6.) Otherwise.This has been done rather superficially without reference to the files, in order to save time. Speaking generally, we have put under (a) buildings, electricity, gas, tramways, and machinery generally. Under (b) we have included road and street works, sewerage and sewage disposal, waterworks, &amp;c5. The cases in which local authorities can borrow in the open market will be almost entirely those of county councils and large boroughs and urban districts, except [1312] 2R
perhaps for housing purposes. Where they borrow for housing the State will be behind the local authority, except to the extent of a rate of Id. in the   so far as the interest and repayment of moneys borrowed are not covered by the rents. Hence the security would seem to be good, and there would seem to be no reason why insurance companies and building societies should not lend fairly readily for this purpose.As regards other purposes it seems doubtful whether there will be much open market borrowing, except perhaps in the North and Midlands, where the short-term loan system still lives. Even here it will probably only be possible for local authorities having a rateable value of about 200,000/. to raise loans themselves unless the sum required is very small.Consequently, we have arranged the groups under (a) and (b) according as their rateable value is greater or less than 200,000/.N.

Here again only part of the money will be borrowed.As most of the largest and more important counties and districts have been visited by the Inspectors, it may perhaps be anticipated that the works already authorised&apos; or likely to be authorised during the current financial year, so far as local authorities are concerned, will not exceed  15,000,000, excluding housing loans. The period required for the execution of the works varies, according to the Inspectors&apos; Reports, from a few months up to four years. As a rule, of course, the long periods required for execution of works are in respect of substantial undertakings by im-portant authorities, such as schemes of water supply, electricity, road improvement or sewerage, involving expenditure from  100,000 upwards, and it may well be that the works will not be completed within the periods mentioned by the Inspector. The usual practice of local authorities is to raise loans by instalments, borrowing only such amounts as are necessary to meet the expenditure as it becomes due, and thus avoiding the payment of unnecessary interest and postponing the charges for the repayment of the principal. It is not therefore probable that a considerable proportion of the costs [13121 2T
of the more substantial undertakings will be borrowed before the 29th of September next.A separate letter will be addressed to you as to the housing loans included under heads (6) and (d) in Statement &quot; A,&quot; but of the remaining works a selection has been made for the purpose of eliminating those less likely to proceed, and Dr. Addison has had the remainder analysed, for the use of the Conference of Ministers who are considering, inter alia, the question of unemployment and public works, so as to distinguish as far as is practicable  -(1) Works affording a wide variety of employment, (2) Other works.Each heading is sub-divided further so as to distinguish the cases in which it may be anticipated generally that the local authority will, or will not, be able to raise any necessary loan in the open market.The latter division is based on the assumption that local authorities with a rateable value exceeding  200,000 will be able to borrow in the open market, but Dr. Addison regards it as very doubtful whether this will in fact prove generally to be the case, especially as regards local authorities in the South of England where the system of short-term loans is less usual than in the North.These statements may be of some service to Their Lordships, as they indicate the nature of the works which the local authorities are prepared to cany out.Roughly the totals for the various works (omitting miscellaneous) would be :  Buildings (excluding housing)     ... ... ...   2,000.000Electricity Gasworks HighwaysSewerage and sewage disposalWaterworksTramways3,800,000 500,000 5,400,000 2,000,000 2,500,000 1,000,000The best rough idea which Dr. Addison can give of the amount which will be raised by means of loans prior to the 29th of September next is  8,000,000. excluding housing. Of this a sum not exceeding  200,000 has been included for sanatoria, but it is not likely that the whole of that sum will have been borrowed by Michaelmas.The Board of Trade may perhaps be able to furnish further information as regards tramways, and as regards education loans it is understood that all schemes of new school buildings are being considered by a Committee of the Board of Education * from the point of view of the priority of the schemes, but as he has received no notification of the decision of the Committee, Dr. Addison is unable to furnish any figures.I am, &amp;c.NOEL T. KERSHAW, Assistant Secretary.Appendix XLV.PUBLIC WORKS.Mr. A. Chamberlain to Sir A. Geddes.Dear Geddes, Treasury, S.W., March 4, 1919.I HAVE now been able to consider the points raised in Dr. Addison&apos;s memoran-dum of the 25th February with regard to loans to local authorities. In all the circumstances, I am prepared to agree that the Local Government Board should sanction the loans set out in their category A, i.e., Works affording a wide variety of employment, up to a total of 6,000,000Z. without submitting these cases to the Treasury specially. When their sanctions have amounted to the 6,O00,00OL the position must be considered again.  With regard to category B, Works not providing a variety of employment, I do
not feel able to go so far, and I must ask that these loans should be submitted to the Treasury, with the following exceptions, which may be passed by the Local Government Board without such submission: viz., sewage works where necessary for urgent reasons for public health, or where plant is immediately available; water works where the supply is necessary for industrial purposes; roads if incidental to new housing or if approved by the Road Board; street improvement if required to remove a danger, or if the local authorities are under an obligation for the purpose. It seems to me that these exceptions should enable the Local Government Board to meet urgent cases without undue delay.I have sent a copy of this note to Dr. Addison.Yours sincerely,AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.Appendix XLVI.PUBLIC WORKS-PROPOSALS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD.THE Chancellor of the Exchequer puts four questions. These and the answers are as follows : 1. What works under each head can be proceeded with at once ?This depends upon the position of the local authorities concerned.They have to revise their estimates in many cases and to get out bills of quantities and tenders and enter into contracts. We don&apos;t know how far they have done this, and can only say that, so far as this Board are concerned, the local authorities are in a position to proceed : (1.) In all cases where the Board&apos;s sanction is necessary and has been obtained. (2.) Where the sanction of Parliament or any other Government Department thanthe Board is required, and has been obtained, and the works are not stoppedby the Treasury embargo. (3.) Where the works are to be paid for out of accumulated funds or revenue.2. What sum will be required for such works in the year 1919-20 ? This is very roughly estimated at 16,000,OOOL3. How much of the sum so required must be found by Government loans ?Taking it for granted that local authorities, having an assessable value exceeding 20O,00OL, will be able to borrow in the open market, which is somewhat doubtful at the present time, it may be estimated that about 5,000,000Z. will have to be found by the Government.4. If further Government funds are available, on what works can they best be spent with a view to giving the maximum of employment at the earliest possible date 9The employment must as a rule be given where unemployment prevails. Subject to this, the works in List 1 should have preference as giving employment to more classes of labour, but regard must also be had to the class of labour available. Many types of labour are only suitable for particular classes of work, e.g., building work can to a large extent only be done by those who are skilled at it; cotton and lace-workers can only be employed on light work; and road and navvies&apos; work, though somewhat unskilled, cannot well be undertaken by those not used to heavy labour. It would usually be best to leave the local authority in such cases to select the work to be carried out, having regard to the nature of the work and labour available.The Board are not in a position to require local authorities to-carry out particular works to which the Board might wish to give preference.The figures in this minute exclude borrowing for housing purposes.

Works now in progress(6.) Works fully authorised and Councils intend to proceed .. (c.) Works fully authorised, but Councils not disposed to proceed (d.) Works not yet fully authorised, but Councils wish to obtainauthority and to execute the works (e.) Works required, but Councils wish to consider their position, and todecide questions of priority, modifications, &amp;c. (see also (6) intable below)(/&quot;.) Proposals under consideration.   (Lists probably very incomplete.) (Please see also item 8 in table below)Note. The estimates are partly post-war and partly pre-war, approximately half-and-half. A fair estimate of the number of man-week units of labour involved on the works might be obtained by dividing the number of pounds by five.Miscellaneous Particulars and Information reported by Inspectors.39,753,300 16,251,00020,598,800Urban Authorities.

MEMORANDUM ON THE EXTENT AND NATURE OF THE WORKS &quot;WHICH THE OFFICE OF WORKS COULD PUT IN HAND WITHIN A SHORT TIME.THREE schedules are attached :-(Approved by the Treas- I ury, but awaiting Parlia-mentary sanction.Schedule I.Works provided for in Estimates 1919-20, but which cannot be commenced in the ordinary way until Parlia-mentary sanction has been given. All these are in an advanced stage of preparation, and if special authority were given, a start could be made with them at once.Nearly all have been before the Treasury indi-vidually, and have been approved in principle as being necessary, but their execution has been deferred from time to time.Schedule II.Works not provided (for in Estimates 1919-20. This list represents for the most part schemes (mainly post office and telephone buildings) the inception of which goes back to 1914 or earlier, and which were postponed on account of the war, but it includes as well schemes like the port and transit stores at certain ports (estimated cost 1,250,000L), and housing schemes at Southampton and Hendon, which are of a special character, and have arisen out of war needs.Schedule HI.Is an addendum of works of accommodation in London and the Provinces which it would take a longer time to start than those in Schedules I and II, the reasons being, either that sites have yet to be found and purchased, or that the buildings at present on the sites are in occupation by Government Departments or tenants. ,The following points call for comment: 1. Not one of the works is a &quot;relief work&quot; in the old sense. Everv one of them is directed to meet a really urgent need of the.public service.This is especially the case as regards post offices and telephone exchange buildings and office accommodation buildings.2. The schemes- are so numerous that each large centre of employment (for example, London and all the big manufacturing towns) could be well provided for in the matter of emergency works, as well as many of the smaller towns. This remark applies equally to the maintenance services (of which redecoration, &amp;c, forms a large part, and would give considerable help in employing painters, &amp;c).3. During the war, i*edecoration both external and internal has been reduced to the lowest limits consistent with the preservation of the fabrics and the health of the staffs. The provision made in the Estimates 1919-20 will not nearly bring the buildings back to the pre-war standard, but if an additional expenditure of say 250,000L were allowed, this very necessary step could be taken, while at the same time useful employment would be given. Attention is drawn to the fact that the Treasury have approved a proposal for making employment exchanges more attractive by renovating them and decorating them in a more artistic manner. A sum of over 15,000L will probably be spent on carrying out this proposal now that the Treasury have sanctioned it in principle. This figure is contained in the lump sums for maintenance inserted in Schedule II.4. It the Government decide to approve in principle the commencement of emergency works for providing employment in the building trades, we could make a [1312]    . &quot; ^ 2 U
commencement at once with Schedule I if we were allowed to anticipate Parliamentary-sanction, and with many works in Schedule II. (i.e., those which are in the final or penultimate stage of preparation), if we were given authority to begin in areas where unemployment was reported to be particularly bad.In the past,&quot;Parliamentary sanction has been difficult to obtain before August, when a large part of the good building season is over.5. The total amount of employment which would be given by the works shown -on the Schedules is of course much greater than the figures indicate, as those figures take account only of the numbers of men who would be employed directly on the works. The manufacture, transport, &amp;,c, of the materials would give employment to a great many more.I. - Works (Not in Progress) Provided for in Estimates 1919-20.		Labour Required.

Of this, salaries, pay of men retained in the Army, and miscellaneous expenses, such as travelling, &amp;c, account for 1,850,000^., leaving a balance of 5,650,0001.This may be divided as follows:  1. Labour employed directly.by the department ...   2,500,000,, ,,      by contractors      ... ...   1,600,000Total labour cost      ... ...   4,100,0002. Material... ... ... ... ...   1,400,000The residue will be accounted for by contractors&apos; profit and a few minor miscellaneous charges.I should say that these, figures are necessarily rough estimates as they involve the splitting of contracts, placed in the ordinary market, into estimated proportions of labour and material, but they will probably be sufficient for the purpose for which they -are required.Appendix XLIX.NOTE BY BOARD OF TRADE ON CONTROL OF GAS PRODUCTION.THE Gas Works (Ministry of Munitions) Order, 1918, dated the 28th June, 1918, was made by the Ministry of Munitions at the request of the Board of Trade, with the object of bringing about a fuller extraction of by-products and securing economies of coal consumption. The question of the quality and composition of gas which gas undertakings should be required to supply in future has been referred by the Board of Trade to the Fuel Research Board, and no satisfactory alteration in the status of gas can be made pending the consideration of the report. A complete return to pre-war standards is not likely until the coal situation more nearly approaches the normal.April 1, 1919.
MEMORANDUM BY THE FOREIGN OFFICE ON EXPORT OF WOOL PRODUCTS, &amp;c (cp. Report, sections 49 and 52).AT the Conference held on the 28th March, 1919, it was decided : &quot;1. That all yarns, piece-goods, and other manufactures of cotton, wool, linen, jute, and silk in respect of which &quot; (a.) Orders had at any time been placed in this country by neutral countries and payment has been made ;&quot; (b.) Orders were placed in this country by neutral countries before the embargo was put on their export, whether the goods have been paid for or not, should be treated as if on the free lists &quot; ;and the Foreign Office were asked to give effect to the decision.The naval and miRtary authorities raised objections, on the ground that it would render the blockade null and void.Since the armistice many relaxations of the blockade have been made affecting even the countries contiguous to enemy territory, by increasing, for instance, the rations of these countries. The result has been that the War Trade Department is now practicaRy up-to-date in granting licences for which applications have been received. Considerable quantities of the goods concerned, the subjects of.old applications, have undoubtedly been sold elsewhere, and recently granted licences, for which appRcation was made long ago, are often not used when granted. There is no great reason therefore to fear that an immediate result of the decision of the Conference would be to flood the contiguous neutrals with surplus supplies for which there would be no guarantee against re-export to the enemy, especially as the home markets in these countries, where money is plentiful and goods are short, can easily absorb their imports. The relaxation would probably give some impetus to British manufacture by giving the impression that export was easier and that the blockade would soon be raised. This, however, is a speculative consideration, and the decision would certainly appear to break down some of the principles of the blockade.Wool Products.The Foreign Office and War Trade Department have lately been urging certain relaxations of blockade measures respecting the export of these products. It was hoped that all forms of wool, except raw wool, should be placed upon prohibited List &quot; C,&quot; that is to say, woollen tops, noils, yarns, and waste should be placed upon the list of goods the export of which is prohibited only to the contiguous neutrals, and is allowed without licence to other destinations.The supplies of raw wool scarcely yet allow that London should resume its place as a port from which large quantities of raw wool can be shipped, but there seems now to be no valid reason due to the blockade which should prevent the other woollen products from being exported freely to any destination except the contiguous neutrals. On the 21st March the Director of Raw Materials wrote to the War Trade Department saying that this change should not be made except in the case of a few qualities of tops, noils, and waste, for which there is little demand either at home or abroad. They agreed to a fairly liberal ration of yarn for export, but objected to the removal of the cumbrous restraint of the licensing system. Sir Arthur Goldfinch based his objections upon recommendations of the Wool Council. It is understood that, though, as&apos; Chairman, Sir Arthur pressed the Council not to be too timid as to the security of supplies for their industries, the members were strongly opposed even to the slight relaxation of the restrictions upon export, namely, removal of the semi-manufactured goods to List &quot; C.&quot; The yarn-spinners wanted the tops combed in this country to be kept here for them to spin ; the cloth weavers wanted the yarns kept for them to weave ; the labour representatives wished that, with the exceptions mentioned above, the finished piece-goods alone should be exported.
(Appendix L.) 164It is not for the Foreign Office to point out how the reconstruction of our export trade in its normal channels is hampered by the continuance of these restrictions, nor the danger of other countries becoming determined to manufacture for themselves the goods that they cannot obtain from Great Britain, but it has been a principle upon which the blockade has been conducted from its earliest days that these restrictions upon export should be used as war measures for the purposes of the blockade, and for no other purpose. When therefore the restrictions seem no longer necessary for the purposes of the blockade, but it is proposed to retain them for purposes of a commercial or industrial nature, the Foreign Office is bound to feel strongly that an unjustifiable use is being made of war measures.(Initialled)     W. V. C.Foreign Office,April 8, 1919.Appendix LI.Telegram (No. 476, April 10, 1919) from Foreign Office to Mr. Balfour.   &apos;PLACING OF ARTICLES ON NON-RATIONED LIST FOR NORTHERN NEUTRALS (cp. Report, sections 49 and 52).FOLLOWING for Edgcumbe :-&quot; Allied Blockade Committee have considered a proposal that certain important categories of goods, such as raw cotton, cotton manufactures, wool manufactures, yarns, and silk might now be placed on non-rationed list for northern neutrals. Committee, while appreciating weight of argument against making relaxations which might become known in Germany at present critical moment of blockade, are inclined to consider that, provided guarantees are maintained, results of proposed derationing would not, in view of economic position of Germany, seriously affect maintenance of blockade.&quot; Committee are therefore prepared to consider a list of commodities, including articles mentioned above, with a view to placing them on non-ration list, but they desire first to refer matter to Superior Blockade Council, and request that they may be furnished as soon as possible with CounciFs views as to advisability of proposed action with special reference to important economic considerations involved therein.&quot;
Telegram (No. 676, April 10, 1919) from Sir William Mitchell-Thomsoii toForeign Office.PROPOSED SUSPENSION OF BLOCKADE RESTRICTIONS (cp. Report, sections 49 and 52.)FOLLOWING from Mitchell-Thomson, No. 96 :-&quot;American representative yesterday brought forward at Blockade Council foRowing proposal, which was not discussed : &quot; &apos; On and after date to be agreed on restrictions imposed by Associated Govern-ments upon trade with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland shall be suspended (to be reimposed in full vigour should circumstances later warrant), provided said neutral Governments or other satisfactory agencies give guarantees against re-exportation to Germany of these articles, import of which by Germany is prohibited by Associated Governments.&apos;&quot; Resolution contemplates suspension of rations, black lists, and censorship. Latter two restrictions are receiving separate consideration already.&quot; I venture to suggest time has now come when all foodstuffs might be derationed, as this may assist Germany to secure fulfilment of amounts permitted by Brussels Agreement, and it is considered desirable that, in any case, Germany&apos;s food imports should be financed through neutrals as far as possible. This concession would be appreciated by Americans, and possibly be valuable to British Empire.&quot; I feel some doubt as regards materials other than food, since excessive supply has in past always led to some re-exportation in spite of guarantee. Though circum-stances are now altered as regards Norway and Sweden by our control of Baltic, the situation in Denmark and Holland is unaltered. On the whole, however, I incline to favour proposal, since great help to trade would probably more than counterbalance disadvantage of possible leakages to Germany. In any case period of operation of scheme is likely to be short since peace will be accepted or refused shortly; if refused, rations would be reimposed.   Tabulation of imports would continue.&quot; I should appreciate early instructions, 6ince matter will be discussed at special meeting on morning of the 12th instant.&quot;
Announcement made in Press, April 27, 1919.^CONTROLS RETAINED (cp. Report, section 28).1.

-   283171       &apos; Appendix LV.Derationing of Northern Neutrals (cp. Report, Sections 49 and 52).Copy of Resolutions passed by the Superior Blockade Council in Paris.(1.) ON and after the 25th April, 1919, commodities other than finished munitions of war may be imported by the northern neutral countries and Switzerland without limit as to quantity and without requiring the issuance of individual import certificates as a condition precedent to the issuance of an export licence by the Associated Govern-ments. Provided that allmof- the provisions of the existing agreements between the Associated Governments and the War Trade Board, on the one hand, and the Govern-ments of the above-mentioned neutral countries, or Import Associations therein, on the other hand, which provisions are not contravened by the foregoing resolutions, shall be continued in full force and effect, except as the same may be expressly relaxed by the establishment of free lists or other measures adopted by the competent Associated authorities, and administered through the I.A.T.C.&apos;s in the several neutral countries. Further, that all shipments to the above-mentioned neutral countries must be consigned to the respective Import Associations in these countries in the case of shipments for members thereof, provided the said bodies give the usual guarantees to the satisfaction of the I.A.T.C.&apos;s; in the event that the said Associations shall be unwilling to receive the consignment or shipments intended for importers not members of the said bodies, the Associated Governments will permit shipments to be made for the account of such persons, provided the same are consigned to the I.A.T.C. in the country of destination, release to be made upon the execution by the actual purchaser of satisfactory guarantees against re-export to unapj)roved destinations.(2.) Shipments to Germany from the above-mentioned neutral countries, except those authorised by the several rationing agreements, shall be permitted only in the event that the same shall have been approved by the I.A.T.C. in the country from which shipment is proposed to be made. With respect to shipments to Germany which are authorised by any of said rationing agreements, the issuance of permits for said shipments shall be administered in the manner heretofore followed.(3.) The Associated Governments maintain as heretofore the principle of the blockade, and reserve the right to reimpose all or any of the restrictions heretofore in effect, should later circumstances warrant such action.The Blockade Council are instructing the Allied Blockade Committee to make at once any arrangements with the Associations and I.A.T.C/s necessary to bring the scheme into immediate operation. The date of the commencement of the scheme is given as the 25th April, with a view to expediting the necessary preliminary arrange-ments, but, in fact, the scheme will not become operative until the Allied Blockade Committee have arranged matters with the Associations. The Allied Blockade Committee are authorised to make the necessary public announcement when ready.0
