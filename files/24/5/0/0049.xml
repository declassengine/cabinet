This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.j.Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1919.SECRET. G-248.WAR  CABINET.THE EMPIRE RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.ON the 1st April Mr. Wilson-Fox, M.P., on behalf of the Empire Resources Development Committee, addressed to me a proposal for the appointment of a Joint Committee of the two Houses with the following terms of reference: &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed for the purpose of considering whether the State can with general advantage to the community embark upon a policy of engaging for profit, either directly or indirectly, in the establishment and conduct of productive and distributive enterprises and industries, and especially such as are concerned with the provision of public and semi-public facilities and needs, or-generally in the development of the natural resources and opportunities of the Empire wherever they may be found; and, if so, what limitation should be imposed upon such activities; and what organisation should be established to ensure the prudent selection and efficient conduct of undertakings suitable for the purposes in view, and the protection of the financial interests of the State.&quot;In explanation of this proposal he wrote that &quot; 1. There is no intention or desire to discourage or supplant individual enterprise. On the contrary, it is believed and hoped that the adoption of the policy will create many new opportunities for individual enterprise.&quot;It is thought, however, that there are limits to the power of individual organisations to provide efficiently public or semi-public services of all kinds; to deal satisfactorily with certain businesses for which the State possesses special facilities or opportunities, sometimes by virtue of its ownership or control of assets, sometimes because of its power to regulate the exercising of private rights, and sometimes because international interests are concerned.&quot;The region beyond these limits furnishes a wide sphere for State activity.&quot; 2. It is not recommended that any of these activities should be managed by Civil Service methods, or operated by Civil Service departments, and it is considered to be essential that business undertakings should be run by business men.&quot; 3. For the reasons suggested in the preceding paragraph, it is thought that participation by the State with third parties will probably give the most successful results.&quot; 4. It is held that any proposal when made should be judged strictly on its merits from the point of view both of the public interest generally, and of its commercial attractiveness and soundness.&quot;This proposal had already been raised during the debate on the Address and was received not unsympathetically by the Leader of the House, who had invited Mr. Wilson-Fox to communicate with me. After consultation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the President of the Board of Trade, and the Minister of Munitions and Supply, I wrote to Mr. Wilson-Fox on the 7th May, as follows :-&quot;I have consulted informally with two or three of my colleagues, including, as you would naturally expect after your reference to him, Lord Milner.   I will not give you their individual opinions, but let me attempt to summarise some of [2059] B
the points which they raise. In the first place we already have&apos;commissions or enquiries dealing with coal and with railways. We have Government Bills dealing with these subjects and the supply of electricity also. The multiplication of Committees with overlapping functions is itself objectionable, and as their numbers increase it becomes less easy to make each of them as representative and authoritative as is necessary&apos; if their reports are to secure respect.&quot; Secondly, to appoint such a Committee as you propose at this moment might have a bad effect on public opinion, especially on Labour opinion, which might consider that it was a disguised attempt to find an excuse for postponing action in reference to these other matters.&quot; Thirdly, would not any Committee with terms of reference at all similar to those which you suggest, have an effect which you and your friends would be the first to deplore ? Would it not in fact be considered as an intimation by the Government that they were considering, or prepared to consider, the nationalisation of all or any of the industries of the country ?&quot; I thought, when you spoke to me, that you had specially in mind the development of the overseas resources of the Empire, particularly of those not already administered by self-governing dominions. I am not sure on examining your letter carefully that you did intend to confine yourself to this side of the question, but I think that an enquiry so limited would not be open to some of the objections which seem to apply to the wider proposal. In any case, before I go further, I think I must ask you to define more exactly what you have in mind, and to say whether you or your friends have definite schemes to put before the Committee for investigation. I think.bome well-considered proposals on these lines from you are an almost necessary preliminary to a Cabinet decision on your proposal.&quot;I have now received the following reply, which was formally presented to me on behalf of the Committee by the three gentlemen who have signed it. I should be glad if we could have some preliminary discussion in Cabinet as to the course of action which we should follow.(Initialled) A. C.Treasury, S.W., June 5, 1919.The Empire Resources Development Committee.The Bight Hon. Austen Chamberlain, M.P.,Chancellor of the Exchequer.Seymour House, Waterloo Tlace, S.W. 1, Sir, June 3, 1919.Your private letter of the 7th May, addressed to Mr. Wilson-Fox, M.P., Hon. Secretary of the Empire Resources Development Committee, was read, confidentially, at a full meeting of the Committee and discussed.Our Committee recognises the force of your suggestion that,&apos; in asking for the appointment of a Committee or Commission, it might be best to confine the terms of reference to the possible development of oversea resources within the Empire.With this policy we concur.In reply to your request that our Committee should submit schemes to illustrate the manner in which the development of natural resources might be expedited by Government assistance, we beg to offer the attached memoranda. But we do not desire to limit the enquiries of such Committee as the Government may set up to the projects there outlined. Our researches and enquiries have, necessarily, been limited by the fact that our Committee is purely a private body. We think that the Govern-ment, with fuller information at its command, may easily find many other sources of revenue in the development of the wide and varied field of Empire products, and we have merely given these as examples.. Preferential treatment of sugar, tobacco, cocoa, coffee, and wine, produced within the Empire, having been established, it follows that land suitable to the growth of these products must enhance in value. We therefore suggest a scheme of State-participation in land where no vested rights have already been set up as one of the possible sources of revenue.
372We shall await with great interest your views upon the proposals we submit, and trust that you will see your way to form the committee mentioned by the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in his reply to the amendment moved by Mr. Wilson-Fox, seconded by Mr. Alfred Bigland, and supported by Mr. C. Jesson, during the recent debate in the House upon the King&apos;s Speech. As the range of subject-matter for such a committee would be very wide, we suggest that it should be an instruction from you to that committee to divide itself into three sections: to report 1. Upon the acquisition of land within the British Empire. 2. Upon fisheries in the waters of the Empire.3. Upon the possible development of the petroleum resources of the Empire.In this connection we submit the attached three memoranda.Yours faithfully, *(On behalf the Empire Resources Development Committee),(Signed)        QUEENBOROUGH (Chairman).H.

Memorandum (A).State Participation in the Increment Value of Lands situated in the Oversea Territoriesof the British Empire.Whereas there are in His Majesty&apos;s Overseas Dominions large areas of fertile soil uncultivated, in many cases almost uninhabited, and yet eminently suited for the production of the necessities and comforts of life; andWhereas in the opinion of experts we shall for several years experience very high prices for raw material and food products as compared with pre-war prices, with a consequent demand for land and a readiness to pay for it prices which heretofore would have been considered impossible, and it is only by largely increasing production that we can hope to reduce the cost of living; andWhereas Parliament has enacted that certain materials and products shall be admitted into the market of the United Kingdom at a much lower rate of import duty if grown within the Empire than if produced in foreign countries ; andWhereas it is manifest that such a very considerable preference as 41. per ton on sugar and Is, id. per lb. on tobacco will almost immediately give an enhanced value to lands within the Empire hitherto unsettled and uncultivated ; andWhereas the new value or &quot; unearned increment &quot; which will accrue in these lands, will not have been in the first place created by their native inhabitants, nor by the immigrant settlers, but by the taxpayer in these islands, because he has agreed to sacrifice a portion of our Customs revenue in order to furnish this preference, and by so doing to transfer business from foreign plantations to British plantations, under such fiscal conditions, it is, in our opinion, right and equitable that our British taxpayer should share in the increased value of such lands, and we - desire that a Committee should be appointed to take evidence and inquire into this matter, with a view of reporting to the Government 1. Whether the parent State can, by negotiations with our daughter States,acquire large areas of sucli lands ; 2. Whether Crown lands can be allocated for the purpose in the Crown Colonies ; and 3. Whether concessions of such lands as have already been acquired, but not developed, might not be repurchased from the present owners ; also as to the Empire possessions that are suitable for development, and as to the terms upon which such a plan of revenue co-partnership might be worked.We submit that by generous proposals, as to the division of profits, to the Colonial Legislatures, their goodwill and hearty co-operation would be secured, since one of the results of this work should be a rapid increase in their revenues. On this subject the Committee would point out that in India, where development of uninhabited and waste land has been undertaken by the Government of India, and such land has been leased to the native cultivators, already, in some instances, as much as 33 per cent, of the capital outlay is being annually received, and is available for the relief of taxation.In connection with the ownership of any land acquired in the manner suggested, attention is directed to the fact that if large numbers of cultivators are attracted to a district, the town sites may in a few years become of great value. It is, therefore, suggested that town sites should, for a considerable period, be leased and not sold.The Government of British Columbia has established the precedent of retaining for the relief of taxation one-quarter of all town sites. These are either kept or sold by auction at the Governments option, and as population grows, the revenue from this source of income will increase rapidly.We suggest that it should be a further instruction to such Committee to report on the desirability of capital being found by the Government for emigration, railway, and other transport services, and of the guaranteeing of interest by the State on capital raised for development wTork undertaken by corporations.British Guiana maybe taken as an example. The area of this colony is equal to that of Great Britain; but the area cultivated does not equal one-fifth of the area of the County of Kent, and the total population is less than that of Bristol, The railways consist of two short lines, neither exceeding fifty miles in length.The rivers of this colony offer great opportunities for its development. The fertility of the soil is beyond question, and both climate and soil are specially suited for the cultivation of tropical products.
Professor Harrison, the Director of Agriculture for the colony, states that of the 55,000,000 acres of land still held by the Crown it is estimated on a conservative basis that 9,000,000 acres, or fifty times the area now cultivated, are easily accessible and specially adapted for the cultivation of tropical products.He says that the exports of sugar in normal years amount to about 110,000 tons, in addition to 3,600 casks of molasses, and about 2,500,000 gallons of rum, but that the land which is readily available and well suited for the cultivation of sugar could produce 2,500,000 tons of sugar, or nearly half as much again as the total imports into the United Kingdom for home consumption in 1913.He also states that the normal rates at which land is leased by the Government for permanent crops are for the first five years nothing; for the next five years 25 cents an acre, and thereafter 80 cents (^3s. Ad.) an acre.The preference granted of At per ton on sugar is certain to increase greatly the production of sugar cane and to attract immigrants. We have no hesitation in predicting that a reasonable expenditure on developing and opening up the country would enable the land to be leased on most remunerative terms, the cultivators being given the option of purchase by instalment spread over an extended period.We understand that the Governor and his Council have control of all leases of land, and can see no reason why they should not be willing to accept proposals whereby the whole of the land of this colony outside the small portions already under cultivation would be acquired on condition that an equitable percentage of the yearly profits should be set aside for their revenue purposes.Official replies to inquiries made indicate the possibility of the expansion of the British sugar industry from a yearly production of 880,000 tons to over 4,540,000 tons made up as follows : _&apos;_	Preseut		Sugar Crops	Possible	(Average of	Sugar Crops.	three Years).		Tons.	Tons.Barbados	35,000	51,000British Guiana	105,000	2,500,000Jamaica	15,000	35,000Trinidad	50,000	87,000The Windward and Leeward Islands	26,000	67,000Mauritius	244,000	305,000Fiji	97,000	164,000British East Africa	. .	500,000Queensland (consumed in the country)  ..	217,000	5.00,000Natal (consumed in the country)	91,000	332,000Total	880,000	4,541,000Southern Nigeria : Experts report many thousands of acres admirably adapted for sugar-growing.In 1913 the imports of sugar into the United Kingdom from all sources amounted to 1,969,259 tons. Of these, 1,296,401 tons were imported from Germany and Austria, 600,839 tons from other foreign countries, and only 72,019 tons from British sources. In the same year the amount of sugar produced within the British Empire and available for export was only 571,746 tons.Memorandum (B).Utilisation of Fisheries for National and International Distribution.Whereas it is understood to be the intention of the Admiralty to reward British fishermen who have given up their livelihood during the war in order to serve their country, and to convert, at Government expense, the mine-sweepers of to-day into a fishing fleet; andWhereas there are great openings for fisheries on the Newfoundland and Labrador coasts, which fisheries, in the opinion of our Committee, will never be thoroughly and efficiently worked by private enterprise alone; and
Whereas there is an enormous demand for fish in other parts of the world where fish is scarce, eg., in France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and the Brazils, we consider the whole question of the State ownership of a fishing fleet and the marketing by the State of hsh supplies is a fit subject for enquiry and investigation.Competent authorities predict a shortage of bacon and beef for some years, and the development of new sources of food supply is an urgent national need, and we suggest &quot;that the proposed Committee should enquire whether the Newfoundland Government would be willing, in return for a percentage paid to them for revenue, to grant to the British Government the monopoly right to erect cold-storage buildings, the fishermen being guaranteed fixed minimum prices for the fish delivered, and the British Government undertaking to supply or to secure specially equipped tonnage for conveying the fish to the consuming markets, and to erect in these markets adequate cold storage for its receipt and distribution.The consumption of fish in the United Kingdom in pre-war years averaged 600,000 tons per ann*um,* and could, we submit, be trebled or quadrupled to the great advantage of the consumers health and pocket. No individual corporation could possibly find the money necessary to provide all the cold-storage accommodation which would be required to hold the vast quantities available in the seasons of plenty against seasons of scarcity, but we submit that a very large revenue could be obtained from State participation in this industry. There are no vested rights in the ocean, its wealth is almost inexhaustible, and this country has, in its geographical position, such unrivalled advantages for carrying on the trade, that good organisation with command of capital is, in our opinion, certain to yield a very heavy return.We are informed that there is one harbour on the Labrador coast with open water all the winter through, and that lobsters abound on that coast in incredible quantities.The waters of other dominions also offer an immense field for development. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, running to Prince Rupert, have intimated to our Committee that, if the Government guaranteed them Id. per lb. for carriage from Prince Rupert to Liverpool, they would build special refrigerating trains and specially-constructed steamers to carry on this work, provided that a minimum freight of 3,000 tons weekly was guaranteed.Memorandum (C.)Production of Petroleum.The demand for petroleum for all purposes is growing by leaps and bounds, and the experience of this country during the war shows how all-important it is to secure an unfailing and adequate supply within the Empire for the navy and the mercantile marine.But we are almost entirely dependent on other countries for our supply, and on countries to whom our present indebtedness is so great as to cause acute anxiety as to the future course of exchange.In 1913 our total imports of petroleum, including motor spirit, into the United Kingdom amounted to 488,000,000 gallons, of which 303,000,000 gallons came from the United States and only 22,000,000 gallons from within the Empire.The borings at present being made in this country by Lord Cowdray for the Government show that the presence of workable deposits can only be proved by extensive explorations at a cost which may prohibit private enterprise. But we submit that there are certainly deposits in many parts of the Empire not yet explored for petroleum, and that reasonable assistance from the State in finding and tapping these deposits might be repaid by a substantial addition to the nations income.Further, the great success Avhich has already attended the British Governments investment of 2,000,000L in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, with a promise of immensely increased profits in the future, is a strong precedent for similar participations by the Government in other parts of the Empire.o* This is less than 1^ oz. per day per head of the population.
