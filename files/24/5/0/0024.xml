[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October L918.SECRET. G-224.-WAR CABINET.THE POSITION OF THE NORTHERN NEUTRAL COUNTRIES.Holland.(Previous Papers, G.-153, G.-184, G.-186, and G.-206.)ON the-Sth January, 1918, the War Cabinet accepted the recommendations of the Northern Neutrals Committee as put forward in Paper No. G.-186, dealing with the co-operation of British naval and military forces with the Dutch naval and military forces in the event of danger to the Island of Walcheren by German attack.The troops, which had been held in readiness for any action that might be necessary, were dispersed during the latter part of 1917, being required for the operations then taking place in Flanders. The scheme therefore contemplated uncler the recommendations, as approved by the War Cabinet (W.C. 318, Minute 12), has ceased to exist. The supply, however, of war material to the Dutch military authorities has been proceeded with, the amount delivered being dependent mainly on the amount of shipping available..During the summer a suitable opportunity occurred to reopen the question of what assistance should be given in the event of a German attack on Holland, and, as a result of further discussions which took place between the military attache at The Hague and the Dutch Cbmmander-in-Chief and officers on the General Staff in Holland, fresh proposals were recommended. The Dutch military authorities requested us to base our plans, not, as formerly, on landing troops at Walcheren, but on providing a certain number of troops to be landed in Holland as reinforcements, whilst they would under-take the defence of their waterliue until the arrival of the British troops.The Committee make the following recommendations :  1. That War Cabinet approval of the recommendations of the Northern Neutrals as put forward in Paper G.-186 should be rescinded.2. That with a view to co-operation with the Dutch military authorities in the event of an attack by Germany on Holland, the -British Naval and General Staffs should be authorised to work out the details of a scheme by means of which as many divisions as the military situation might require could be transported and landed at some port, to be agreed upon, in Holland.3. That, the supply of war material as authorised by the War Cabinet (G.-I80) should be continued as the exigencies of the shipping situation allowed.J. C. SMUTS.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., October 7, 1918.   .
