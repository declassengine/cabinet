SECRET. &quot;5.-235.WAR  CABINET.HOUSING.Memorandum by the President of the Local Government Board.THE War Cabinet has requested me by Minute of 5.18 (4) to furnish &quot; a statement on the general housing position with special reference to questions of policy which have not yet been settled.&quot;(1.) The Present Position.I have obtained a detailed statement of the applications which have been made up to the 21st January, and I regret to say that I find the position gravely unsatisfactory, so far as the preparedness for action in the immediate future is concerned. There are, however, widespread indications of readiness on the part of local authorities wholeheartedly to take up the schemes of housing, and; with the financial and other arrangements to which I shall refer later, I believe that we may confidently look forward to considerable developments before long. The present position, however, as I find it, appears to amount to this : Since the 18th March, 1918-108* authorities have submitted proposals for acquisition of land. The area involved is not known in a few cases, but in the remaining cases amounts to 2,650 acres.52* of these authorities have also submitted schemes for the erection of dwellings. The number of houses comprised in these schemes is 10,506.138 authorities have acquired sites for schemes, this number including those who. have acquired land in the above-mentioned schemes.343 authorities have selected sites for housing, including those mentioned above.1,026 authorities.have indicated their readiness to build houses either under the terms of the circular of the 18th March, 1918, or subject to conditions.I attach as an Appendix (A) a detailed statement which has been prepared for me, showing the precise position of the proposals which have been made to date. In connection with this, I have instructed the Housing Department, which I have placed under the charge of Sir James Carmichael, to sit daily upon these schemes until arrears have been dealt with in accordance with the principles of an office instruction (Appendix (B) ).An examination of the detailed statement (Appendix (A)) throws a much needed light upon the causes of delay, and it is manifest that (1) we need much more expeditious methods centrally, (2) the establishment of a considerable decentralised organisation locally, and (3) drastic curtailment of many existing proceduresThe &quot;position, therefore, on the 21st January was this: proposals had been made for the erection of a little over 10,000 houses, but no final sanction had been given to any single scheme. Under these circumstances, I trust that the Cabinet will agree (1) that I shall be afforded prompt decisions and a wide discretion with respect to the necessary staff and accommodation to undertake the task before us; (2) that the legislative and financial proposals, an outline of which is indicated in this paper, shall be considered immediately they are submitted in draft; and (3) that the earliest practicable opportunity shall be afforded for the passage through Parliament of such legislative proposals as may be sanctioned. I hope to be able to submit these proposals in the form of a draft Bill during the next fortnight.* Of these, 43 site proposals and 29 schemes (iavolving the erection of 2,498 dwellings) have beeja submitted since the 1st December, 1918.[1045J B[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]
(2.) The Steps already Taken.Central and Local Machinery.1. I have created a special Housing Department under Sir James Carmichael, and am consolidating in this all the different parts of the Board&apos;s activities which relate to housing, and certain experienced men from outside have already entered the service of this branch.2. I am proposing to carry out the policy which I ventured to recommend in August 1917, the initial steps for which were undertaken by my predecessor. The country has been divided into eight housing areas, and offices are being taken. A Housing Commissioner will be in charge of each area, with the small necessary staff of experts. Their general functions will be to settle as much as possible on the spot promptly, and to pass the applications in stages without waiting for completed schemes to be elaborated, and to give active assistance, by advice or otherwise, to local authorities in the preparation of schemes.3. As a part of this scheme, a working arrangement is being made with the Ministry of Supply with regard to the stimulation of the production of materials, the provision of standardised parts, &amp;c.4: Arrangements have been made for a small body of men who have had experience of local authority work and in the Board to make proposals for the shortening of procedure andTor expediting arrangements as much as possible.Staff.The Local Government Board&apos;s proposals for the necessary central and local organisation have been submitted to the Treasury.Financial Assistance to Local Authorities.The terms of financial assistance to the local authorities have been settled substitution for the previous circular.   They have received the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and have been issued to the local authorities.   A copy of the circular is attached (Appendix (C)).Financial Assistance to Public Utility Societies.The terms of financial assistance to Public Utility Societies, following the general lines indicated in G.T. 6497, have been drafted by the Local Government Board, and are now under discussion with the Treasury, and I seek authority to issue the scheme when it has been agreed with the Treasury.Financial Assistance to Private Enterprise.A good deal of what is necessary in this direction may be met by rural land-owners and tenants, owners of industrial undertakings, and workpeople forming Public Utility Societies, but the granting of any assistance from public funds to priyate individuals is one which raises many difficult questions. The matter is now being investigated for me by a small Committee under Mr. Henry Hobhouse, with the general instruction to frame a suitable scheme, if possible.Publications.In order to assist local authorities and others, a manual has been prepared, embodying detailed suggestions as to the preparation and submission of schemes, lay-out of sites, designs of houses, and methods of construction. The manual will contain a number of model plans, including the premiated designs of the Royal Institute of British Architects. It is proposed to issue periodical progress reports, and I attach importance to the proposals wdiieh have been submitted to the Treasury for the institution of a branch of the Board dealing with intelligence and publicity.Materials and Fittings.A number of house fittings have been standardised by the Local Government Board&apos;s technical staff, and the Ministry of Supply have been requested to place orders on behalf of the Board for various materials required in connection with housing schemes, including bricks, slates, tiles, doors, window frames, &amp;c. Covering sanction to the necessary expenditure has been given by the Treasury, ci
( ) Legislation.We are encouraging local authorities to proceed at once with their schemes as rapidly as they can do under their existing powers, without waiting for the new legislation. It is manifest, however, that very important modifications and extensions of the law relating to housing are necessary, if we are to get adequate progress fn housing either with regard to the expeditious provision of new houses, or with the reconstruction of slum areas, or of scattered unsatisfactory dwellings.The chief points of the necessary legislation appear to me to be as follows : 1. Power to the Local Government Board to replace the existing minor local authorities by the County Council without formal proof of default where tire local authority have not taken adequate steps to exercise their powers of providing houses.2. In case of default by any local authority, the Local Government Board to have power to provide houses and recover cost from the defaulting authority. In making this effective, words may be required to the effect that in suitable cases we should prescribe it to be the &quot; duty &quot; of the authority to make provision.3. Power to relax bye-laws in order to remove difficulties in carrying out housing schemes by reason of restrictive provisions in bye-laws and local acts. It maybe necessary in this connection to obtain powers to dispense with certain procedures now adopted in the preparation of schemes.4. Land : Compulsory acquisition.(a.) Power to enter into possession without first complying with certain requirements of the Lands Clauses Acts. - (b.) Power to the Board to withhold confirmation of compulsory purchase.order if they consider the land is unsuitable by reason of its character, extent, or position.(c.) Amendment of paragraph 7 of First Schedule of Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1909, which makes it necessary for the Board to appoint an outside person to hold a local enquiry in case of an objection to taking of land in London, a borough, or urban district.5. Land : Other powers.(a.) Power to the local authorities to acquire with a view to sale or lease to other bodies or persons for the erection of houses, and power to sell or lease accordingly. This power will be necessary in order that the best use may be made of certain portions of sites which have had to be acquired as a whole for promoting the development of portions of it for housing purposes by public utility societies.    f(6.) Sale of lands generally.6. Powers as to existing houses.[Note. These powers are especially necessary with respect to slum areas and with respect to unsatisfactory cottages generally.](a.) Powers as to acquisition and improvement of houses by local authority. (6.) Power to local authority to lend money to owners for improvement ofhouses for the working classes, and to borrow for the purpose, (c.) Powers to local authority to exercise further control in regard to thedivision of large houses into tenements. (d.) The basis of acquisition of slum sites is dealt with later under theheading of &quot; Slums.&quot;7. Power to all local authorities to assist formation of and give assistance to Housing Societies (Amendment and Extension of Section 72 of the Housing, Town Planning, flee. Act, 1909, which applies only to County Councils).8. General provisions as to Public Utility Societies.(4.) Notes on Certain Points, including those raised in the VariousMemoranda Circulated by Ministers.1. The question of replacing the Rural District Council by the County Council in regard to rural housing. -The proposal is that the Local Government Board should take power to replace&apos;the Rural District Council by the County Council (a) in the case of failure by the Rural District Council to make adequate provision, and also (6) if for any other reason it is, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, desirable that
the houses should be provided by the County Council instead of by the minor local authority.2. Valuation. (a.) An arrangement has been made with the Inland Revenue Department under which the Superintending Valuers in the Service of that Depart-nnent will be prepared, on the invitation of the local authority, to express an opinion as: to the present value of any site definitely selected by the local authority for housing purposes, and if desired by the local authority, the Valuation Department will undertake negotiatious for the purchase of such sites.(&amp;.) It is also suggested that where the valuer is unable to reach an agreement with the owner, and is of opinion that the price asked is too high, he should advise the local authority what, in his opinion, the price should be, and in the event of failure to reach an agreement between the local authority and the owner, that the matter should be referred to one of the Panel of Referees appointed under the Finance 190,0-10 Act or other Special Tribunal created for the purpose, provision being made to exclude expensive procedure and the attendance and payment of expert witnesses, &amp;c.(c.) It is suggested that the basis of value of land required for new housing should be the fair market value. This will, however, require modification in respect of the acquisition of slum areas.The arrangement referred to in (a) can be carried out without legislation, and is accordingly mentioned in the circular to local authorities. To give effect to the suggestions in (6) and (c) would require legislation, and it appears to me to be desirable that there should be a separate Bill dealing with Land Acquisition for public purposes generally, instead of these provisions being incorporated in a Housing Bill.3. Slums. The existing provisions for clearance and improvement of slum areas involve so heavy an expense upon local authorities that very few of them can afford to undertake clearance schemes. The Royal Commission on Housing in Scotland made various recommendations for dealing with slum areas. In particular, they recommended that the basis of compensation should .be so altered as to prevent compensation being awarded to the owner of the site on an assumption which would not be in accordance with fact, namely, that the area could again be used for crowding as many houses as possible upon that site.1 am in negotiation with the L.C.C. and others as to the provision of a new basis of valuation for these cases, and desire to defer suggestions for the present.4. Suggestion that the landlord who builds rural cottages shoidd be secured for a period of 21 years against the rating of these cottages at a higher level than the present. Differential rating of any kind is, of course, always open to objection, and this particular proposal would probably meet with a good deal of opposition from local authorities as wrell as from other quarters, while the relief to the individual landowner in any particular case would not be very considerable. In any case, the period suggested would seem to be much too long, and in the event of any radical alteration in the system of rating it might be impracticable to adhere to the bargain.5. Objection raised to appointment of Rousing Commissioners.- In regard to this objection it may be stated quite definitely that it is no part of the policy of the Local Government Board to oust the local authorities. The Housing Commissioners will advise and assist ihe local authorities in the preparation and the execution of schemes, but it is certainly not intended that they should replace the local authorities. The evidence before us shows that the local authorities will, as a rule, be glad to avail themselves of the. help which can be given them by the Commissioners and their expert staff, and there is clear evidence that they would welcome decentralisation on the lines proposed. It may be added that the appointment of Housing Commissioners has been emphatically advocated by the Tudor Walters&apos; Committee (Cd. 9191, paragraph 348), by Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee (Cd. 9087, paragraph 35), and by the National Housing and Town Planning Council on which the local authorities are strongly represented.0. Obligation of Public Bodies to provide houses for their employees.  While it is no doubt the case that, if County Councils, Railway Companies, the Post Office, &amp;c, were compelled to provide houses for their own employees, it would assist in making up the shortage in rural districts, it seems impracticable to differentiate between different kinds of employees, and to restrict the obligation to rural districts, and it is understood that the Post Office and Board of Trade entertain considerable objection to the proposal.Employers, however, will be encouraged to build by the assistance which is to be given to Public Utility Societies, and County Councils will be given enabling powers -to provide for their own employees.
7. Power of tenant to purchase house. An amendment of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899, which would meet this point, is under consideration.8. Position of Office of Works.- It has been suggested that the supervision of housing schemes by local authorities should be entrusted to the Office of Works rather than the Local Government Board. This suggestion could hardly be adopted. Housing schemes of local authorities are carried out under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, which make the Local Government Board, not the Office of Works, the statutory authority for these purposes. The loans have to be sanctioned by the Local Government Board, and grants-in-aid administered by them. To divorce the supervision of the erection of houses from the general powers of supervision and control vested in the Local Government Board would cause confusion.9. Ireland.^-It is no doubt the case that the scheme of financial assistance to local authorities in Great Britain would be inapplicable to Ireland, but this would not appear to be a valid reason for amending the scheme. In view of the great difference of conditions in Ireland, it would, in any case, seem to be doubtful whether it would be practicable or expedient to apply to that country a housing programme identical with that suitable to Great Britain.CHRISTOPHER ADDISON.February 1919.[1045]C

Apart, however, from any formal stages required by statute, it is manifest that much delay may be occasioned either in the Department itself or by reference back to councils on various revision points.As time goes on we shall certainly both acquire more experience ourselves and improve the standard of schemes submitted by local authorities, but we cannot wait until ihe last word in architecture is met before we begin to sanction schemes. With the present state of unrest and unemployment it is of great importance that work should be begun as soon as possible, and I would rather an authority got to work in erecting houses which were not up to the ideal in every respect, but which were sufficiently satisfactory as dwellings, rather than that we should hold them up for the settlement of all details with the delays attendant upon the meetings of housing committees, councils, &amp;c, &amp;c.1 have marked in Mr. Forber&apos;s list, in red pencil, a number of cases to which these remarks appear to me particularly to apply, and I shall be glad if you will give immediate attention to them, with a view to speeding up the determination of the issue on the lines of the policy indicated in this note.This will not, of course, prejudice the searching enquiries and promotion of expedition in action of the other cases detailed in the schedule.(Signed)        C.

APPENDIX C.Circular. County Councils.Councils of Metropolitan Boroughs. Town Councils. District Councils.Housing op the Working Classes.Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 1, Sir, -   February 6, 1919.1 AM directed by the President of the Local Government Board to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government have reconsidered the terms of financial assistance previously promised to local authorities in connection with the provision of houses for the working classes at the present time. The Government desire that the partnership between the State and the local authorities should&apos; be such as to secure the rapid erection of the large number of houses needed to make good the existing shortage, and they believe that under the terms now proposed they will be able to rely-upon the active support and energetic co-operation of the local authorities as a whole.2. The Municipal Corporations Association and a number of individual local authorities in the representations which they have addressed to the Government in regard to the previous scheme have referred to the element of uncertainty as to the burden which might have to be borne by local authorities, and have pressed for a declaration that in no case should the annual burden falling on the local authority exceed the produce of a rate of Id. in the  .3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been desirous of meeting these representations as far as practicable, and they have now approved the adoption of a scheme under which the burden on local authorities would be limited as nearly as possible to the amount suggested. Parliamentary approval for these proposals will be obtained at the earliest practicable date.4. In accordance with the revised scheme the terms set out in the paragraphs Nos. 2 and 3 of the circular letter of the 18th March, 1918, will be superseded by the following terms: Assisted Schemes.(a.) The housing schemes of local authorities to which the State will be prepared to grant financial assistance, if they are submitted to the Local Government Board within twelve months from this date and carried out within a period of two years from this date, or within such further period as may be approved by the Local Government Board, are : (1.) Schemes carried, out by local authorities under Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, for any area for which the Local Government Board are satisfied that it is desirable that houses for the working classes should be provided.(2.) Rehousing schemes in connection with improvement and recon-struction schemes under Parts I and II of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, except that no part of the cost of acquiring and clearing a site would be m.ade the subject ot financial assistance if either (a) the site had been acquired or cleared before the date of this letter, or (6) the needs of the district could, in the opinion of the Local Government Board, be adequately met by means of a scheme under Part ill.Loans.(6.) The full cost of a scheme will in the first instance be met out of a loan or loans raised by the local authority, and it is particularly desired by the Treasury that authorities should raise such loans in the open market wherever it is possible for them to do so. As the financial assistance to be granted from public funds for housing schemes will take the form of
*   192a subsidy, as explained below, and as it is important to secure that the whole of the State assistance may be given under one head, any loans granted from the local loans fund for the purpose of assisted schemes wiE not be made at the preferential rates ordinarily allowed for housing loans, but at a rate fixed by the Treasury so as to correspond with the full current market rate of interest.Oeneral Principle of Financial Assistance.(c.) In respect of any housing scheme or series of housing schemes carried out by a local authority within the period referred to above, Parliament will be asked to vote financial assistance calculated on a basis estimated to relieve the local authority of the burden of any annual deficit in so far as it exceeds the produce of a rate of a Id. in the   on the area chargeable, but there will be ho contribution towards the cost where the annual excess of expenditure over income would not exceed that amount.Provisional Estimates.(d) In order to avoid delay iu the commencement of schemes the settlement of the actual amount of the State subsidy will be deferred until after the houses have been built and let; but payments on account will, if necessary, be made on provisional estimates of income and expenditure approved by the Board.Settlement of Subsidy during Transitional Period.(e.) When the houses have been built and let the amount of the subsidy to be paid thereafter during a transitional period ending 31st March, 19if7, will &apos; be settled on a basis of a revised balance-sheet, showing the actual expenditure incurred and the actual rents obtained. The interest charged oh loans will be taken at the amounts actually to be paid if the loans are raised from the local loans fund or other outside sources. Where the money is provided from accumulated funds in the hands of the local authority interest will be calculated at the rate in force for loans for assisted housing schemes from the local loans fund (unless the local authority is also borrowing from other outside sources in respect of its scheme, in wdiich case interest should be charged on advances from accumulated funds at the rate paid for the loans from such other outside sources). Where there is found to be a deficit in excess of the produce of a rate of Id. in the  , the rate of annual contribution so determined will hold good for the remainder of the transitional period.In making this interim adjustment the Local Government Board will reserve the right of reducing the amount of the subsidy in any case in which there is evidence of failure on the part of the local authority to secure due economy in the erection or management of the houses, or that the best rents obtainable are not in fact being obtained.Final Adjustment.(/.) At the end of the transitional period the whole position will be reviewed in the light of the actual working of the scheme during that period, aud the annual amount thereafter to be provided out of public funds will be adjusted as follows. The amount of the estimated annual expenditure will be compared anew with the amount of the estimated annual income, and if as a result of this comparison it appears that the future annual charges to % be borne by the local authority are likely to exceed the produce of a rate of Id. in the  , the annual subsidy for the remainder of the period of the loan will be finally fixed at a sum calculated to cover this excess, subject only to such adjustment as may be required in consequence of any variation in the amount produced by a Id. rate.At the final adjustment it will be open to the Local Government Board to reduce the amount of the State contribution if there has been evidence of failure on the part of the local authority to exercise due economy in management or in securing the best rents obtainable. In the event of the local authority and the Local Government Board being unable to reach an agreement on any such question the matter will be referred for final settlement to some independent tribunal.[1045] E
(g.) In the case of a rural district the produce of a rate of a Id. iu the  for the purpose of the scheme will be based on the assessable value of the whole district unless very strong grounds are shown for a declaration under section 31 of the Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c, Act, 1909, which would impose the cost of a housing scheme on a contributary place or cOntributary places in the district.5. In order to secure that local authorities may have advice and assistance locally available to them and to avoid delays, the President is arranging for the appointment of a certain number of housing commissioners whose duty it will be to consider and discuss with the local authorities in their areas the needs of each district in regard to housing, and to advise and assist them both in the preparation and in the execution of ^schemes.Each commissioner will have an office in his district, and his address will be communicated to each local authority and otherwise notified in due course for the information of all concerned. It is the desire of the president that the greatest .possible use may be made in every instance of the commissioner and his expert assistants, but he wishes to make it clear to all local authorities that the object of the appointment of these commissioners is not to diminish the responsibility of the local authorities, but to give them assistance and&apos; advice and at the same time-to relieve the central department of some of the detailed work in connection with the schemes.Under the new organisation it will be possible for schemes to be dealt with by stages, and thus to avoid the friction and delay which might be caused if schemes did not come before the central department until they have reached the final stage.6. The local authorities will recognise that, while the revised terms of financial assistance set out in the earlier part of this circular are exceptionally advantageous from their point of view, they will impose a corresponding responsibility both upon the local authorities and upon the central department to secure economical construction and management.Under the organisation above described the housing commissioners will be working in the closest possible co-operation with the local authorities at all stages. At the same time the Local Government Board will expect the local authorities themselves to exercise effective supervision in regard to the cost of construction and the rents obtained, which should approximate as nearly as circumstances permit to the economic level.7. In order to promote economy and to assist local authorities and others engaged in. the provision of houses for the working classes, the president is causing certain articles used in the provision of such houses to be standardised. Local authorities will shortly be furnished with a list and description, with dimensions, of the standardised articles, and it is contemplated that unless the circumstances are shown to be very exceptional these shall be specified and adopted in eveiy scheme. Steps are also being taken to secure the production of large quantities of doors, window frames, and various other fittings of standardised patterns, and to secure an adequate supply of bricks suited to the needs of various localities. A further announcement on this subject will be made shortly, but in the meantime the local authorities need have no hesitation in proceeding with the preparation of their schemes on account of anticipated shortage of materials.8. The Board are about to issue a manual embodying detailed proposals in regard to the preparation and submission of schemes, suggestions as to lay-out and designs with plans, including premiated designs of the Royal Institute of British Architects and plans recommended by Sir J. Tudor Walters&apos; Committee, and the latest information in regard to improved methods of construction and building materials and house fittings.9. With regard to the acquisition of land, an arrangement has been made with the Board of Inland Revenue, under which the superintending valuers in the service of that Department will be prepared on the invitation of the local authority to express an opinion as to the present value of any site definitely selected by the local authority for housing purposes, and, if desired by the local authority, the Inland Revenue Valuation Office will undertake negotiations for the purchase of such sites provided that prior notice of their intention to acquire has been given to the owner by the local authority. This arrangement will provide for both parties the opinion of an independent authority to serve as a guide to the real value of the property in question, and it may be anticipated that the number of cases in which the parties fail to agree will thus be reduced, and the delay and expense of arbitration avoided.
10. With, a view to supplementing the provision of houses by local authorities the Government desire to encourage Public Utility Societies to undertake building operations, and it is accordingly their intention to propose to Parliament that financial assistance should be given to such societies cai-rying out housing schemes within the same period as that which will apply to local authorities. A memorandum explaining the scope of the proposed assistance, and the conditions on which it will be granted, is in preparation and a copy will be forwarded for the information of the local authority at an early date.11. I am to add that it is the intention of the Government to propose legislation during the coming session to give further powers to local authorities in regard to the provision of houses for the working classes, to enable local authorities under the Housing Acts to assist Public Utility Societies by subscribing to their capital and otherwise, to deal with bye-laws and local Act provisions which may be found to impede desirable housing proposals, and generally to facilitate the execution of schemes.12. In view of the pressing urgency of the housing situation, the preparation of their schemes by the local authorities should not be postponed until the introduction of the proposed legislation. Having regard to the terms of financial assistance now offered, the arrangements which are being made for the provision of materials, and the supply of labour which is becoming available owing to the cancellation of war contracts and the demobilisation of the Forces, there should be no reason for any delay. The Government and the country are looking to the local authorities - to start at once upon the housing schemes which are rightly regarded, as forming one of the most urgent and essential parts of the whole programme of reconstruction.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H. C. MONRO, Secretary.To the Clerk of the Local Authority.o
