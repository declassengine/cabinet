HANKEY,Secretary, War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., September 26, 1918,Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Reconstruction Committee(Mersey District).John Einegan, President. Proposed General Council for the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.Dear Sir and Brother, 19, Hodges Mount, Liverpool, 1918.I am enclosing herewith copy of proposals in regard to establishing of a General Council, for the engineering and shipbuilding industry, in this area.The matter has been carefully considered by the Shop Stewards at two recent Meetings, when it was decided to recommend it to the district.I am therefore instructed to forward it to your members, so that the scheme can be considered by them, and, if agreed upon, applied at the earliest moment.I am especially to point out that no attempt has been or is being made to question the good-faith of any official connected with the federation, as it is being sedulously asserted for obvious reasons in various quarters.The object is the creation of such organisation as will effectively deal with the rapidly changing industrial conditions, and at the same time possess the confidence of the men; the apparent injured dignity of a few individuals ought not to be aUowed to interfere with the attempt to place the industrial organisation of the district on a proper foundation.It is in this spirit that your members are asked to consider the proposals, and on agreement forward to me the names of your representatives, so that an early Meeting of the new body can be convened.Yours faithfully,FRED EVANS, Secretary.Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Reconstruction Committee(Mersey District).Draft Copy of Proposed Organisation.Annexed is a draft of the scheme proposed at the mass meeting held in the Stadium on Sunday, the 11th August, but which was not discussed owing to certain action taken by those responsible for the meeting. It is now decided that the suggested organisation shall go to the men in the district, and that their opinion shaR be taken as to whether they are prepared to have the proposals adopted. At the moment it has not been settled how the matter shaU be presented to the district, but the intention is to use the speediest channel so that the district will shortly be in a [816]
position of having the machinery to carry out any policy that may he decided upon in regard to wages and other important questions. It cannot he insisted too strongly that all resolutions are ineffective unless there exists a proper organisation with authority and possessing the confidence of the men to carry them out.The scheme outlined here, although not complete, provides for this organisation on sound lines, and can he used to the best advantage at the moment and allows for extension and improvement as the position develops.To this end all the men in the district are asked to carefully consider the question and use such influence as they possess to have the proposals honestly applied.For the Engineering and Shipbuilding TradesReconstruction Committee (Mersey District),JOHN FINIGAN, President.
