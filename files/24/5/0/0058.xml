[This document ^the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1919.SECRET. G-256.WAR  CABINET.APPLICATION OF THE WHITLEY REPORT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL DEPARTMENTS OF THE CIVIL SERVICE., Memorandum by the Treasury.(Previous Papers Nos. G.T.-845, 1107, 2176, 4873; G-213, 214, 223, 238, and 247.)ON the 13th June, 19] 9, the War Cabinet approved the adoption of the recom-mendations contained in the Report of the National Provisional Joint Committee on the application of the Whitley Report to the Administrative Branches of the Civil Service (War Cabinet 579), and on the 3rd July, 1919, the Report was submitted to a joint Conference of official representatives and representatives of the Staff Associations, presided over by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which Conference accepted the report without material modification.It is necessary to take immediate steps to set up the National Council for the Administrative and Legal Civil Service, and under paragraph 11 of the Report the Council is to consist of fifty-four members (including four secretaries) to be appointed as to one-half by the Government (the official side), and as to the other half by groups of Staff Associations (the staff side). Paragraph 12 provides that the members of the official side of the Council shall be persons of standing, who may or who may not be Civil Servants, and shall include at least one representative of the Treasury and one representative of the Ministry of Labour, and paragraph 33 states that women will be eligible for appointment to the official side of the Council.The first question for settlement is whether all the members of the official side of the National Council shall be Civil Servants or whether some non-Civil Servant representation should be provided for. When this question was discussed by the Committee certain members of the Staff side favoured the presence of outside repre-sentatives, partly on the ground that as all Civil Servants are in a sense employees, the real ultimate employer (Parliament or the taxpayer) should have direct representation on the Council, but mainly no doubt because they thought that it would be easier for them to divide the official side if that side was not composed wholly of Civil Servants, and because they looked forward to a time when decisions of the Council might depend upon an open vote of all the. members, and when some, at all events, of the outside members might be disposed to adopt the views and vote for the proposals of the Staff side on contentious matters.The members of the Official side of the Committee were unanimous in the view (which was supported by certain sections of the Staff side) that the presence of outside representatives would seriously impair the authority and influence of the Council. Apart from minor objections, such as the technical nature of most of the questions which will come before the Council and which call for a highly specialised experience and knowledge of Civil Service conditions, it is felt-1. That the presence of the outside element would be quite foreign to the spirit of Whitleyism, which contemplates direct negotiation between employer and workman without the presence of a third party. There is little doubt that the admission of outsiders would tend to introduce the element of arbitration, which it is one of the objects of Whitleyism to avoid ; and2. Certain important features in the approved Report, such as the machinery for arriving at agreements, presuppose that the members of the Official side will always act together as a side. This can be readily secured if the members are all Civil Servants acting as the representatives of and spokes-men, for Ministers, and with their powers and responsibilities clearly recognised and defined.   The StaCe can always exercise effective controliir*X

The position of an outside member would be entirely different, and while, no doubt, many persons could be found whose attainments and personality would make them most valuable members of the Council, it is felt that the dangers of admitting non-Civil Servants to membership of the Official side under the arrangements contemplated in the Report, outweigh any advantages to be gained from the presence on the Council of persons of outside experience and a different point of view from that usually found within the Service itself.The Treasury accordingly recommend that the Official members of the National Council shall be Civil Servants, and, on the assumption that this recommendation will be adopted, a list of twenty-seven Civil Servants possessing the requisite qualifications has been prepared after consultation with the various Departments, and is attached hereto. In. preparing this list regard has been had to the necessity for covering, so far as possible, the whole of the Administrative and Legal Civil Service. It is suggested that the formal appointment of the first Official members of the National Council should be effected by Treasury Minute, and that future vacancies should be filled by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, acting on behalf of the Government, the formal appointments being in each case carried through by means of a Treasury Minute.(Initialled)    &apos;   M.
