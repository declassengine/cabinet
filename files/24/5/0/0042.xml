-   309DRAFT FOR AN EXPLANATORY LETTER TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE PRESIDENT, M. CLEMENCEAU, AND SIGNOR ORLANDO.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Robert Cecil, on behalf of the British representatives on the Supreme Economic Council, have forcibly urged on the notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government the necessity of some bolder solution for the rehabilitation of the credit and economic life of Europe than is now available. For the time being the United States is providing on a generous scale for the urgent food requirements of the non-enemy countries of Europe. We, on our part, are furnishing assistance on a more modest scale. But these measures, which are primarily directed to the relief of immediate distress, are inadequate, as Mr. Hoover himself is the first to recognise, to the solution cf the whole economic problem. On the one hand, the United States may not be able to continue indefinitely her present assistance ; on the other hand, this assistance does not touch the problem of supplying raw materials to any of the countries concerned, and does not apply to the enemy countries at all.The position as it is reported by the British representatives on the Supreme Economic Council is as follows : In the case of Germany the existing financial provision is not expected to look after food supplies alone much beyond June, and for raw materials there is no provision at all, which, in view of the existing unemployment, are not less necessary if order is to be preserved in that country, peace to be signed and the obligations of the peace to be fulfilled.   The other enemy countries are at a complete economic standstill and there is at present no plan whatever for dealing with them or for preserving their social and economic organisation from disruption and decay.   The condition of the new States, of Serbia and of Roumania is hardly better.   Mr. Hoover is meeting their immediate food requirements, but their economic and commercial fabric cannot be created or re-created unless they can be put in the possession of purchasing power with which to enter the markets of the world.   France, Italy and Belgium present a different problem.   But here also the external financial position has been represented to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by the Finance Ministers of these countries to be little short of desperate, and the need of outside assistance to be essential if they are to restore their countries and re-commence the normal activities of peace.  The United Kingdom enters upon the peace in a somewhat less unfavourable condition, with the question as to how we are to pay what we owe to the United States Treasury as the chief problem of our external finance; but we are in no position to give assistance to others on anything approaching the scale that they require.   I may add this, however, that the difference between the position in England and the complete economic prostration of some of the other countries named above is so enormous, that our own serious difficulties in getting , the wheels of industry going may be some index to the appalling magnitude of the problem in these othor countries. In short, the economic mechanism of Europe is jammed.   Before the war, as Mr. Hoover has said, 400,000,000 Europeans by working their hardest just managed to feed, clothe and house themselves, and perhaps amass six months&apos; capital on which to live.  That capital has vanished; the complicated machinery of internal and external production is more or less smashed ; production has to a great extent ceased. The largely increasing population of Europe has only been maintained by the increasing development and inter-connection of world industry and finance.   If this is not only checked, hut for the time being destroyed, it is difficult to see how the population can be maintained, at any rate during the very painful period of drastic readjustment.   If free movement were possible and other countries could absorb it, there would inevitably be a vast emigration from Europe, until an equilibrium were established between the numbers of the population and the means of livelihood.  As that is not possible this equilibrium must be reached in some other way.  In Russia it is being reached, it appears, by reduction of population by starvation, and by drastic changes of occupation, e.g., by the town population being forced out on to the land as labourers.To what extent the same conditions spread over the rest of Europe must depend largely on whether or not the obstacles to the resumption of production can be rapidly overcome. *(C 1744) j,... A 2
What, in such circumstances, are the alternatives before us ? In some quarters the hope is entertained that with the early removal of obstacles in the form of the blockade and similar measures to free international intercourse, private enterprise may be safely -entrusted with the task of finding the solution. I am in accord with the view that an early removal of such obstacles is an essential measure, and that in the long run we must mainly look for our salvation to the renewed life of private enterprise and of private initiative. Indeed, so far as trading and manufacture is concerned, as distinct from finance, no other measures should be necessary from the outset. Nevertheless, in the financial sphere, the problem of restoring Europe is almost certainly too great for private enterprise alone, and every delay puts this solution further out of court. There are two main obstacles; (a) the risks are too great; (b) the amounts are too big and the credit required too long. The more prostrate a country is and the nearer to Bolshevism the more presumably it requires assistance. But the less likely is private enterprise to give it. To a small extent and with a great margin some trade will be done and some barter. But not enough to meet the situation.Apart from private enterprise His Majesty&apos;s Government see only two possible -courses direct assistance and various forms of guaranteed finance, on a very much larger scale than is at present contemplated, by the more prosperous of the Allied and Associated countries, which probably means, to an extent of not less than 90 per cent., the United States-; or an attempt to re-create the credit system of Europe and by some form of world-wide co-operation to enable the countries whose individual credit is temporarily destroyed to trade on their prospects of Reparation from the Enemy States or to capitalise rtheir future prospects of production. Every consideration of policy and interest indicates the superiority of the second. The people of Europe will have to live on the fruits of their own daily labour and not upon the bounty of another continent.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore desire to lay before the Governments of the -United States, of France and of Italy the concrete proposal contained in the paper annexed to this letter as their constructive contribution to the solution of the greatest financial problem ever set to the modern world. They are prepared to commit themselves immediately to participation in such a scheme, subject to the legislative sanction which it will presumably require in all countries ; and they invite your observations and your criticisms.I do not propose to enter upon any detailed explanation or justification of this proposal until it has been examined in outline by yourself and your advisers. There are many points in it which will require very careful discussions between our experts, and it is doubtless capable of much modification and improvement without detriment to the main ideas which underlie it.   But these ideas I recommend to your judgment.I may, however, at the present stage say this much. The scheme is an attempt to deal simultaneously in as simple a way as possible with several distinct problems. The countries which have been the victims of devastation are enabled to convert the bonds of the enemy into immediate purchasing power for the purpose of early restoration. France is probably the greatest gainer from the scheme and is offered a way out from her -almost overwhelming financial difficulties. The acute problem of the liquidation of inter-ally indebtedness, while not disposed of, is sensibly ameliorated. The Govern-ments of the new States are enabled to prepare definite economic programmes which will -consolidate their at present precarious positions and inspire confidence in their peoples. The neutrals are shown that their claims against the estate of the enemy will not be overlooked, in spite of the circumstances of these claims&apos; origin, provided they are prepared to play their part in a world-wide scheme for the preservation of the credit of Europe. The enemy peoples are shown a way of discharging a part of their obligations and are given a reasonable measure of security for their economic existence in the immediate future. The good faith of the world as a whole is pledged, for the carrying out of a scheme the sole object of which is to set on its feet the new Europe. On the other hand it opens prospects of a renewal of trade to those countries, primarily the United States and secondarily the British Empire, who have surplus goods to export or a favourable balance of trade to liquidate. It cannot be supposed that two great continents, America and Europe, the one destitute and on the point of collapse and the other overflowing with goods which it wishes to dispose of, can continue to face one another for long without attempting to frame some plan of mutual advantage.   And if it be admitted, as it must be
that trade can only re-commence on the basis of credit of some kind, what better security can the lenders hope to secure than is herein proposed ? But chief of all perhaps, only a scheme of large and broad dimensions, which can be announced to and understood by the whole world, can inspire that sentiment of hope which is the greatest need of Europe at this moment. A proposal which unfolds future prospects and shows the peoples of Europe a road by which food and employment and orderly existence can once again come their way, will be a more powerful weapon than any other for the preservation from the dangers of Bolshevism of that order of human society which we believe to be the best starting-point for future improvement and greater well-being.I suggest that the relation of this scheme to the Reparation Terms which we are about to place before the German Government might be as follows. In these terms as at present drafted we demand an immediate payment of  1,000,000,000, from which sum is first to be deducted the cost of the Armies of Occupation and of approved supplies of food and raw material to the enemy. I suggest that if the present proposal is adopted the initial payment might be  1,000,000,000, exclusive of the cost of the Armies of Occupation and of approved supplies, and that the enemy might be permitted to pay  724,000,000 out of this sum in the special Bonds thus to be created, providing the balance and also the cost of the Armies by the transfer of ships, gold, securities and so forth.
