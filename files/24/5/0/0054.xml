[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]Printed for the War Cabinet. &apos; July 1910.SECRET. G. 252 A.sumWAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAY. Pay, Allowances, Retired Pay and Half-Pay of Officers.Note from the Treasury.(Circulated with reference to &quot;Note II by the Representatives of the Admiralty,&quot;attached to Paper G. 252.)THE statement by the Admiralty representatives, that an application by the Board of Admiralty for increased pay for Senior Officers of the Naval Service made in February 1918 met with a flat refusal from the Treasury, the only reason given being that &quot;no necessity was seen for the increase proposed,&quot; is entirely unwarranted by the facts.On the contrary, the Admiralty proposal received most careful consideration, and a fully argued letter was sent to the Admiralty in May 1918. Copies of this letter and of subsequent letters from the Treasury are attached.Treasury, S.W., July 11, 1919.5144/18.Sir, &apos;        Treasury Chambers, May 15, 1918.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have had before them Mr. Walker&apos;s letter, of the 2nd February last (C.W.-5494/18), in which the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty request their Lordships to sanction, at an estimated increased cost of 86,0007. per annum for the first year, increased rates of pay to Senior Naval Officers : viz., Commanders and Captains Royal Navy, and senior ranks of other branches Pay, Medical, Chaplains, Royal Marines, &amp;c.Although it is suggested that the rates proposed should be reviewed after the conclusion of hostilities, their Lordships have formed the impression that the real ground upon which the proposal is put forward is that the Board of Admiralty are persuaded of the inadequacy of the rates generally.In so far as the proposal is based on special war conditions, the arguments appear to be three in number, viz.:  \   i(a.) Comparison with the Army ; (6.) Comparison with junior officers ;(c.) The great burden of responsibility resting on Senior Officers Royal Navy during war.It is true no doubt that, with the immense expansion of the Army, the individual Senior Officers of that Service have gained disproportionately to Senior Officers of the Navy. ^ That, however, is literally one of the fortunes of war. The Army was maintained before the war on a certain footing, and events have brought about a vast[191]
expansion. The Navy, on the contrary, has required a relatively much smaller expansion during the war. It may fairly be urged that the \Naval Service, which profited by the pre-war expansion of the Navy and indeed has received the normal and not inconsiderable advantages consequent on its actual expansion duiring the war, is not now entitled to compensatory increase because of the disproportionate war expansion of the Army. \(o.) The rates of pay of junior officers in the Army have been increased because owing to its expansion a very considerable proportion of officers now appointed to hold commissions are found to be married men, whom the previous rates of paj^ would involve in considerable hardship in view of their financial commitments. ThHe fact that this condition of affairs does not obtain in the junior commissioned ranks oK the Navy does not in their Lordships&apos; view afford any ground for increasing the pay ofVthc higher ranks of the Navy. \(c.) My Lords do not question the heavy burden of responsibility which during wan-rests upon Commanding and Senior Officers of the Royal Navy.   But the principle on which the pay of a combatant force is fixed is naturally that the pay of any rank should\ be the same during war as during peace, and their Lordships feel the greatest reluctance to depart from this essential principle.The arguments based upon special war conditions would naturally lead to a * proposal to pay the equivalent of what is known in civil life as a war bonus. My Lords would point out that the war bonus in the Civil Service has consistently been limited to persons on low rates of pay, and the present limit is 500L per annum. Nor should it be forgotten that, apart from allowances of various kinds in addition to pay, Naval Officers enjoy in immunity from war rates of income-tax, in messing regulations and Customs privileges certain rights which are not open &apos;to civilians.Their Lordships have felt that, with the immense increase of the burdens on the country, those employees of the State whose income removes them beyond pecuniary distress must, in common with the rest of the civil population, bear their share of the financial burdens resulting from the war, and that they would not be justified in endeavouring to place them in the same relative position as if such burdens had not been laid upon them. The same considerations apply in their view to Senior Officers of the Naval Service.As was stated in the opening paragraphs of this letter, my Lords think that the Board of Admiralty may have in view the permanent improvement of rates of Naval pay in senior ranks, believing them to be inadequate. On this my Lords would observe that the pay of the Naval Officers must be considered as a whole, in conjunction with the allowances, pension rights, and other privileges of the Service, and its attractions as a career. They have no doubt that, while the rates of pay, judged by a commercial standard, are not high, the attractions of the career remain at least as high as ever they were.My Lords have purposelv not dwelt in this letter on the difficulties which might be involved with the War Office if the proposals of the Board of Admiralty were sanctioned, but they have no doubt that they would be considerable.They trust therefore that, in view of the considerations above set forth, the Board of Admiralty will not desire to press their proposed increases.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) ROBERT CHALMERS.The Secretary, Admiralty.28502/18.Sir, Treasury Chambers, October 26, 1918.The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have had before them your letter of the 19th July last (W./24165/ ) further respecting the proposed increases in the pay of Senior Officers of the Royal Navy, viz., Captains and Commanders, Royal Navy, Engineer Captains, Commanders, and Lieutenant Commanders, and officers of the Accountant Branch, the Medical Branch, Chaplains and Naval Instructors, and Royal Marines, which formed the subject of your letter of the 2nd February last.In reply 1 am to state that, having given careful consideration to these proposals and to the further representations of the Board of Admiralty, my Lords regret that
&apos;*   33645303/18.Sir, Treasury Chambers, February 22, 1919.I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majestys Treasury Mr. Walker&apos;s letter of the 24th November last (C.W.-49019) further respecting the proposed increases of pay of Senior Officers of the Royal Navy.:\ Since that letter was written, a Committee has been appointed to enquire into the general question of the pay of the Royal Navy, and my Lords are unable to take into consideration the present proposals of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in anticipatioIi\of the findings of that Committee.The financial position of the officers in question has meantime been materially improved by tn\e grant of bonus from the 1st instant.I am, &amp;c.The Secretary, Admiralty. (Signed) ROBERT CHALMERS.othey would not feel justified at the present time in agreeing to a revision of the rates of pay of Senior Officers of the Royal Navy.They cannot admit that the War Cabinet Committee which considered the proposals of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty last year reached any definite conclusion as to the inadequacy of existing rates, and they consider that pending any general reconsideration of the rates of pay in the public service generally a subject more proper for the examination in the post-war period when the requirements of the public service may be more clearly foreseen the rates of pay of officers of the Royal Navy must remain as they were left by the War Cabinet revision.Nor can my Lords agree to the regrouping of the Captains&apos; list by hundreds instead of by eighties.A separate letter is being addressed to you relative to the Accountant Branch.I am, &amp;c.The Secretary, Admiralty. (Signed) ROBERT CHALMERS.
