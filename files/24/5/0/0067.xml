[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]LPrinted for the Cabinet   November 1919.EGRET.G-264. . !.&apos;  6(.M CABINET.OLD AGE PENSIONS.IFOR the convenience of the Cabinet I circulate a memorandum on the proposals )f the Old Age Pensions Committee prepared at my request by Mr. Millar of the Treasury, who was Secretary to the Committee.An early decision by the Cabinet upon the course which the Government shouldadopt will be necessarv.(Initialled) A. C.Treasury, S.W.,November 13, 1919.Report of the Departmental Committee on Old Age Pensions.I. The Present Position.The existing system of Old Age Pensions may be described briefly as follows : Subject to certain conditions as regards receipt of Poor Law relief, residence, nationality, imprisonment, &amp;c, persons who attain the age of 70 are entitled to a pension of 5s. a week, provided that their yearly means, exclusive of the pension, do not exceed  21 per annum, or roughly 8s. a week. The pension is reduced by Is. for every additional Is. of income, any person whose means exceed  31 10s., or roughly 12s. a week, being ineligible for pension. The principle of the Acts is therefore to grant a measure of support (not full maintenance) to those who are in need.Since the war an additional allowance of 2s. Gd. a week has been granted by administrative action to all persons who are entitled to an Old Age Pension, that is whose yearly means do not exceed  31 10s. per annum.The existing number of pensioners is about 920,000 persons, being 56 per cent, of the estimated total septuagenarian population, of whom 323,000 are men and 597,000 are women. Of the total number, 855,000 persons are in receipt of pensions at the maximum rate. The cost. of Old Age Pensions, including the additional allowance of 2s. Qd. a week for the present year is about  17,650,000.n. Summary of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations.There are four main questions involved in the Report: 1. Amount of pension.2. Means limit.3. Qualifying age.4. Poor Law disqualification.The main division of opinion is with regard to the means limit. The majority, ten members, including the Chairman, Sir T. Chambers, and eight non-official members recommend that it should be abolished altogether and pensions made universal. Mr. Appleton, who was unable to take part in settling the Report, indicated his adherence to this view. The minority, consisting of five officials and the two Unionist aI.P.&apos;s, consider that it would be sufficient to double the existing means limit.On the question of amount all the members, except Air. Woodall, consider that the pension must be increased to at least 10s. Three members, Mr. Rowntree and Mr. Thorne of the majority, and Lieutenant-Colonel Raw of the minority, recommend an increase to 12s. Qd. Three other members, Mrs. Baker, Mr. Devlin, and Mr. Walsh, recommend 15s. a week immediately, with  1 a week as the ultimate object.On the question of the qualifying age, both the majority and the minority agree that this should, for the present, remain 70, but recommend an enquiry as to a possible extension of the Insurance Act.   Five members,&apos; however, recommend that the
age should be reduced to 65, Mrs. Baker, Mr. Devlin, and Mr. Walsh unconditional] and Mr. Rowntree and Mr. Thorne as soon as the financial position will allow.20. The Committee are unanimous in recommending the abolition oi the Poor Law disqualifications as regards outdoor relief, or the home assistance which, is to take its place under the reformed Poor Law.21. The Committee are also unanimous in certain minor recommendations as to aliens, residence, imprisonment conditions of payment, &amp;c. The most important of these minor recommendations is that the pension should accrue as from the Friday following the date of receipt of the claim instead of as at prerent from the Friday following the date of the Pensions Committee&apos;s decision, which often involves considerable delay in the receipt of the pension.III. Examination of Main Proposals.1. Amount (and Poor Law Disqualification).In view of the course which prices have taken since the enquiry began (they are now 120 above pre-war prices for the normal working-class family), an increase of the pension to 10s. seems inevitable.From some test enquiries made by the Committee it would appear that less than half the pensioners have private means exceeding 5s. a week. Their standard of living is so low that any further reduction is impossible, and there is no doubt that, they are suffering great hardships at present. If more money is to be spent on Old Age Pensions the poorest pensioners have the strongest claim to further assistance.Closely bound up with the question of the amount of pension is the question of removing the poor law disqualification as regards outdoor relief, pending the coming into being of &quot;home assistance &quot; under the reformed poor law system recommended in the Maclean Report. With the latter system the disqualification is clearly incompatible, as it abandons the idea of deterrence in such cases and the criterion of destitution, Sir A. Symonds, of the Ministty of Health, concurred in this view, but was more doubtful as regards outdoor relief under the present system.From the Old Age Pension point of view, however, this recommendation is most desirable. On the 1st January, 11)19, the number of septuagenarians in receipt of Poor Law relief (other than Old Age Pensioners in receipt of medical relief, which does not disqualify), Avas : ,Indoor, 33,723, Outdoor, 1,891,and most of the former are too infirm to be able to come out. 10,000 new pensioners in all as the result of this concession should be an outside estimate, costing  260,000 a year.On the other hand, the proposal, though it cannot be regarded as an alternative to a general increase of the pension to 10s., is the best method of resisting claims for further increases in the amount of pension beyond that figure such as are asked for by six members, since it will enable assistance to be given from local funds in cases of special need.The cost of an increased pension cannot usefully be discussed except in connection with the means limit.2. The Means Limit.This is the line of cleavage. The majority consider that the anomalies and disadvantages involved in a means limit are so serious that it is vital to get rid of ^- them, and that this can only be done by means of universal pension which they recommend subject to a financial caveat. The minority consider that in practice the existing grievances will be sufficiently met by doubling the present limit and grading the pension in steps of 2s. The maximum pension of 10s. will then be given to all whose private means do not exceed  42 per annum (roughly 16s. a week), and the minimum pension of 2s. to those with incomes not exceeding  63 per annum (roughly 24s. a week).The arguments for universal pensions are set out in paragraph 18 of the Majority Report, and are briefly : 1. That the means limit introduces an element of pauperism or charity ; 2. That it injuriously affects thrift, benevolence, and industry; and 3. That enquiries into means are resented.
%The most important objection is the second.The majority were driven to their conclusion by the fact that different witnesses urged the exclusion of particular kinds of means in which they were interested, such as allowances from trade unions and friendly societies or free gifts or maintenance by friends and relatives, and that the^ found it impossible to distinguish equitably between the various categories of means, and saw objections to the reckoning of each. There is no doubt that the theoretical case for universal pensions is a strong one.It may be observed, however, that though the representatives of the Trades Union Congress urged universal pensions as a matter of principle, very few witnesses from Local Pension Committees and similar bodies came to urge this view, but were concerned with practical difficulties due very largely to the rise of prices during the war. Nor was there any evidence that in fact the means limit had had a deterrent effect on working-class savings ; statistics are all the other way.The majority themselves realise the obvious difficulty of imposing additional taxation at the present, time for the purpose of granting pensions to persons who do not need them, and make their recommendation subject to a financial caveat, while one body of reservations state that in fact they attach greater immediate importance to lowering the age and increasing the amount.The minority, though most of them are in fact opposed in principle to universal pensions, argue the case from the practical point of view. They consider that in practice if the means limit is doubled this will be sufficient to meet all urgent needs and to reduce hard cases to a minimum. Their main objections are, however, financial (see below).The minority propose also certain small concessions with regard to the method of calculating means of which the most important is the suggested omission from the calculation of temporary sick pay. This is designed to meet the views of the friendly societies, but is somewhat dangerous since it is difficult to define temporary sick pay, or to resist the extension of the concession to permanent sick pay, while the special treatment of one kind of means is sure to involve demands for equivalent concessions in respect of other kinds. It is probable that the doubling of the means limit will, in. fact, allow for the receipt of a maximum pension in nearly all cases in which such sick pay is drawn.It will, however, if the scheme of the minority is adopted, probably be advisable to adopt it as a whole, and this proposal was carried unanimously by the Committee as.a whole (failing universal pensions), and not merely by the minority.3. Cost of various Schemes at Age 70.The cost of universal pensions of 10s. a week at age 70, and after allowing for abstentions by the well-to-do, was estimated by the Comptroller and Accountant-General of Customs and Excise at  41,000,000* per annum, an increase of  23,350,000 per annum over the present expenditure ( 17,650,000 per annum).The cost of pensions of 10s. at age 70, with a doubled means limit, be put at  32,000,000, t an increase of  14,350,000 over present expenditure, but  9,000,000 less than the cost of universal pensions; though this figure is highly conjectural, being based largely on an estimate by the Inland Revenue that there were 130,000 septuagenarians with incomes of over  130 per annum.The corresponding figures for pensions of 12s. Qd. and 15s. at age 70 are as follows :-Pension.	Meaus Limit Donbled.J	No Means Limit.d.	 	*  12   6	40,000,000	51,250,00015   0	. 48,000,000	61,500,000* My own view is that Sir H. Clarke has over-estimated the number of abstentions, and that the cost is more likely to be  41,500,000. There will be some set-off in the form of income tax and supertax, but I think this is unlikely to amount to more than  500,000 per annum at the outside.t I think this is probably about right, but I am not at all sure that it is an outside figure, and the increased expenditure involved may be  15,000,000 per annum, or possibly even more.X In point of fact, the amount of pension and the means scale are so interrelated that if the pension was raised to 12s. 6d. or lot., which involve longer scales than are necessary for a 10s. pension, the maximum of the scale would probably have to be more than  63, i.e., the means limit would have to be more than doubled.
4. Age.Only three members press for an immediate reduction to 65, though two others ask for it as soon as the financial position will allow. The majority suggest an enquiry as to whether cases of invalidity under 70 can be met by an extension of the Insurance Acts, and say that if this is impracticable (as it almost certainly is, since the whole system of insurance depends on employment, and the great majority of the persons concerned are women who have dropped out of employment in early life) the question must be reconsidered.Nearly all the witnesses, however, regarded the lowering of the age as less important than the increase of the amount and the means limit if a choice had to be made, and the cost of a reduction of the pensionable age to 65 is prohibitive.Cost at age 65. Universal pensions of 10s. a week at the age of 05 will cost  70,000,000 per annum, of 12s. Qd.  87,500,000 per annum, of 15s.  105,000,000 per annum. If instead of granting universal pensions the means limit were doubled the cost at the age of 65 is estimated as follows: Per annum.10s. a week  ... ... ... ... ...   51,000,000*$12s. Qd. ,,    ..&apos;.............   63,750,000*$15s.      ,,    .........        ......   76,500,000IV. Co nclus ion.The practical question is whether the Government are prepared to increase the pension to 10s. and to double the existing means limit at a cost of from  14,000,000 to  15,000,000 per annum.Serious though this additional expenditure is, I fear it is almost impossible to suggest a cheaper alternative. Contributory pensions, at any rate for those over 70, are not practical politics as an immediate measure of relief, if at all.It might just be possible to do rather less than double the means limit making the new scale run from, say, 10s. to 20s. But the amount of pension and the means entitling to pension are so closely related that it is very difficult, if one is doubled, not: to double the other. This is a simple and logical scheme which merely restores pensioners to something like the pre-war position, and is one on which&apos;the Government could take a firm stand. &apos; Anything less would put claimants to pension in a worse position than they occupied before the war, would to some extent fail to meet the objections of the friendly societies and trade unions, and, in particular, would cause difficulty in the cases where claimants are in receipt of free board and lodging from relatives and friends, since the value of such support has practically doubled since the war, and this is probably the most serious grievance under present conditions. For these reasons the proposal was supported by Sir J. Bradbury.The Government will no doubt be pressed to introduce legislation this session, in which case they will have to decide whether the minor proposals of the Committee are worth legislating about at present.November 8, 1919. (Initialled) E. W. H. M.Sir J. Bradbury proposed that provision should be made for reconsideration of both the amount and the means limit in the event of prices falling, but it is exceedingly unlikely that any such provision could be enforced when the time came.o*lu fact the expenditure would probably be more.
