194[This Document is the Property&quot; of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.;Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1919.g9WAR CABINET. ^PROPAGANDA IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education.PROPOSALS have been laid before me from time to time with a view to eliciting my support for the establishment of English educational institutes in Athens, Florence, and Madrid, with the object of furthering the diffusion of English ideas and English sympathies in the Greek, Italic, and Spanish worlds. I have always maintained that this is a matter for the Foreign Office rather than for the Board of Education, and the purpose of this memorandum is to urge upon the Cabinet that the Foreign Office should be asked to communicate its views as soon as possible upon the policy underlying these projects.From information which reaches me from many sources I gather that a continuation and development of British propaganda in Italy is urgently required. Opinion in Italy appears to have taken a violently anti-French and anti-British line, and the pro-German sympathies which were so carefully cultivated by the German Government in Italy before the war are now rising to the surface again, quickened by the Allied attitude upon the Dalmatian question. In the period preceding the war we were content to leave propaganda to the Germans, but circumstances have changed now, and I doubt whether it would be prudent to revert to a pure laissez-faire and negative attitude. I am disposed to attach a very limited importance to English educational institutes ahroad. They may do some good, but they cannot do very much good. In view, however, of the fact that the institute at Florence appears to be doing some good at the present moment, and that its closure from lack of support would create a bad impression, I am disposed to suggest that it should receive a sufficient amount of assistance from the Government to enable it to carry on through the year. If anything more is done, and I think that a good deal more should be done, I would suggest that some influential Englishman should be sent out to Italy to arrange with M. Borsa, of the &quot; Corriere della Sera,&quot; for the regular appearance of articles representing the British point of view.With regard to Greece, there appears to me to be an equally strong, though perhaps less urgent, case for an organised attempt to create intellectual sympathies with England. A plan for an Anglo-Hellenic Educational Foundation has already been formed, with M. Venezelos as president and Sir Francis Elliot as chairman, with the object of establishing in or about Athens an English Grammar School, a Greek Public School under a British headmaster, and a British. College. The funds for this institution will, it is anticipated, be contributed by the Greek Government and by the Anglo-Hellenic commercial community, but it is suggested that the British Government should indicate its sympathy by making a contribution at the proper time.I think that we must leave our Greek sympathisers themselves to determine the nature of the foundations, which are to be principally established by their money, but the Cabinet can hardly take action with respect either to the Italian or to the Greek proposal without hearing the views of the Foreign Office as to the need and value of this and other forms of propaganda in foreign countries.(Signed)        H. A. L. FISHER.February 14, 1919.oSECRET. G-236.
