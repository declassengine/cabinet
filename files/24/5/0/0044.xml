The distribution of posts, the soaleo of pay, training and equipment, methods of administration and conditions of employment other than t.:ose of of salary, all require revision in the light of present conditions.The wholo of the problem has now been carefully thought out, and opinions were obtained from diplomatic representatives abroad, of Consular Officers, and of leading members of the business world.The attached scheme with appendices is the result, which I have circulated to my colleagues,It is calculated that the provisions mentioned in the scheme should cover the case of the services uentioned in normal post-war times, with possibly one exception.     That exception is in the case of allov/anoes to Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries which are probably too low.On the other hand, the scheme does not allow for the war bonuses which have recently been found to be absolutely essential in the Commercial Diplomatic Service and &amp;ich will have to bo continued until prices fall,   ior does it allow for the extra staff required for special service either in connection wi th the war or with any new duties which may be placed upon Consuls.-The work of re-organising both these -ervices on the lines contemplated will entail much ti^e and labour and the need for some such reform is becoming Increasingly urgent. Again a number of suitable candidates have presented themselves who will drift away unless they can receive an early answer.I hope, therefore, that the ..ar Cabinet will take an early decision whether the recommendations contained in the scheme should be approved and carried into effect.   If this is done, there will he no disputation on any conclusions to which the Committee may arrive that has been appointed by Lord Cave to go into the question of the Consular oervice, as the Board oi 5a*ade concur in the scheme submitted.(Intd.)

CONSULAR AND COMMERCIAL DIPLOMATICSERVICES.(A.) THE SALARIED CONSULAR SERVICE.1. The Need for Reform.FOR years the conviction has been growing that, the whole Consular Service is in need of complete and thorough-going reform. Officers at present in the Service know that if conditions remain as they are it is not likely to attract or retain good men. Indeed there is abundant proof that, unless a wholesome change is effected, some of the ablest of the younger members will leave the Service, preferring to try their fortune outside. But if the conditions are tolerable, it will always be attractive to real ability of certain kinds. Under the present conditions, however, many are likely to leave it. In the business world, the sure conviction of the need of reform is at least equally strong. Misconceptions and exaggeration no doubt exist. It is a natural tendency to compare our own Service unfavourably with the German or the American, oblivious of the fact that Germans and Americans do the same as regards their own. Moreover, the services of many individual Consular officers are mentioned with warm approval. There is, however, no question but that the conviction is justified. Nor is there really any question as to the cause of the inadequacy of the present system. For one thing the whole conception has gradually altered of the services expected from a Consular officer. It is now rightly required that he should actively assist trade. Yet at the same time the whole conditions of the Service are largely those handed down from a time when promotion of trade was the last thing desired of him. The attempt has been made to make bricks without straw and with the usual results. But if the need for reform was great at the beginning&apos; of the war, it is infinitely greater now. Foreign trade for other countries is a luxury ; for the United Kingdom a necessity. But if our Foreign trade is to be restored and developed, our commercial service abroad must be made into a reallv efficient instrument.What then is requisite to produce this result ? The reports of previous departmental committees have been studied ; as also that of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service. Many of their conclusions need modification as a result of the war. The facts therefore have been considered afresh during the last year by specialist bodies appointed for the purpose, and in consultation both with representative business men and Consular officers. The various points that arise have been worked out scientifically, and with the same care as if they were a business proposition such indeed as they ought to be regarded. The result is given in the following sections.2. Posts Proposed in the new Service.A complete list is given in Appendix I of all the posts in the Service which are proposed under the reorganisation scheme. They number 504* in all, including those who, under the new proposals, will be working in the Department at home. Of this total 84* will be consulates-general; 158 will be consulates ; and 2061 vice-consulates. The number of local posts abroad will be 404*t as against 299t before the war. The increase is by no means extravagant, if the work is to be adequately performed. Indeed, if any sudden development of work or temporary emergency occurs in any particular place little surplus staff will even now be available to fill the gap. To meet this contingency, however, it is proposed that in cases where two Consular officers are stationed in one city the Foreign Secretaiy should have the right to vary the station of the junior officer or transfer him to another town.   A certain number of Super-* This number excludes the provision for eight inspecting Consular officers,t Exclusive of Consular assistants in the Far East. In the case of the Levant, however, the former Consular assistants (who are excluded from the number 299) will now be rated as Vice-Consuls. They are included m the list under the heading of Supernumerary Vice-Consuls.[957] &apos; C
numerary Vice-Consuls have also been allowed for in the European, Levant, Russian, and South American areas of. the General Service. In the Levant portion of the Service these officers will perform the duties of the former assistants, and the change, therefore, is one of nomenclature. Some of them, however, will as before be available to act as travelling Vice-Consuls in districts where the communications are such that the absence on tour of the local Consular officer would entail too lengthy a vacation of his post. Thus, when the local conditions prevailing in some distant part of any particular Consular district require investigation, the Consul-General of the district will be able to apply to his Commercial Attache for a Supernumerary Vice-Consul to carry out the required inspection. The Commercial Attache wrll forward the request home for action. In South America the functions of the Supernumerary Vice-Consul will be almost certainly confined to travelling. One such Vice-Consul should be earmarked for Brazil, and another perhaps for Columbia. In all other instances the movements of all such Supernumerary Vice-Consuls, including their allocation to any particular post, will be regulated by the Office at home, acting on the recommendations of the Commercial Diplomatic representatives abroad.The following paragraphs indicate the principles on which the selection of posts has been made and the method employed. Commercial requirements have been recognised as the first consideration in determining the allocation of salaried Consular posts. The most obvious need is in those countries which provide an outlet for British enterprise and British goods. But commercial representation may also be required in a country ^because it is a competitor in neutral markets a competitor&apos; whose developments should be followed and analysed. Nor wiU it be forgotten that our highly developed competitors are also, in fact, some of our most valuable markets. Another distinction of importance is between the existing value of a market and its potential development. Countries such as Russia (when a stable Government be restored), China, and the South American Republics, possess an immense capacity for expansion. To this country also it is of vital importance to secure an adequate supply of raw materials. Countries such as those mentioned, great both in area and potential development, are likely to be among the most valuable sources of supply. The proportion of Consular officers, therefore, should be greater in such a case than would be warranted by the present size of its population or of its industries. Again, comparative poverty of travelling facilities in a country may also warrant a slight increase of representation above the average. Lastly, experience of German methods should indicate that especial care is needed to watch her developments, especially in those countries which she may wish to use as camouflage after the war to conceal her activities under a neutral cloak.It must not, however, be imagined that the only considerations that need to be considered are commercial. Political interests may require the presence of a Consul in a state in which otherwise a Consular post would not be justified. This, for example, is true of some of the Central American republics. Again, political needs in Persia, and the regime of capitulations in less developed countries such as Morocco and Turkey, have necessitated the presence of consuls whose functions have largely been political and judicial.In the next place, the needs of shipping in the larger ports require the attendance of a British representative. This fact is so well known that no elaboration of the points is required. In other places, Admiralty reasons require Consular representation, and in addition to these there are miscellaneous reasons which account for a small number of posts.All these reasons have been carefully borne in mind in the selection of the posts now proposed. The statistics of population and trade of different countries, though not the only guide, have been calculated and analysed. They have been reviewed together with the considerations mentioned above, in making an allocation between different countries and groups of countries. Within each country posts have been assigned, after careful analysis of the local conditions, in consultation with persons possessing local knowledge. Opinions may, no doubt, differ as to one or two places, but a reasoned case exists for every proposed post. Certain assumptions have had to be made on some points which will have to be decided at the Peace negotiations. When these negotiations are ended, and experience has been gained during the next few years by the new Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, some adjustments may be found desirable, but they will not affect the validity of the distribution of posts as a whole, nor the actual allocation of more than a minute fraction of them. It is claimed with confidence that no better distribution of posts, at once scientific and practical, could have been made.
Detailed information is given in Appendix II as to the principles observed in grading the different posts.3. The Training of Consuls, &amp;c.It is proposed that candidates for the general Service should be selected by an examination calculated to test their general ability, and also their bent for the special kind of work which they will have to perform. Subsequently they will receive a course of training in commerce and languages specially designed to fit them for the duties which will lie before them.To this end it is proposed that they should be asked to submit themselves for the new Class A examination of the Civil Service modified to suit the special requirements of the Service. The age of candidates must not be less than 21 nor exceed 24, unless by the special leave of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in exceptional cases. Candidates successful in this examination will then be held to have entered the Service on probation. They will then be put through a two years&apos; course of study, either at London University or at such provincial universities as may be certified by the Civil Service Commissioners to provide an adequate staff and curriculum. At the end of this period they will be expected to pass a qualifying examination and increment^ of salary will begin. They will then, with one exception, be ready for foreign service. That exception is in the case of Russia and the Near East. In these cases the know-ledge of the necessary languages presents a special problem: Those candidates who receive the highest marks in the entrance examination will be given a preferential choice of service in these countries, and will be granted a further period of a year of special training in Russia or the Near East before they enter on their practical duties. The probationary period of service will end in all cases on the expiration of one full year after practical work has begun. The age of compulsory retirement should be GO, subject to a power of dispensation which may be exercised by the Secretary of State in special cases.In Appendix III are given the regulations governing the new system of entry, together with detailed statements both of the modified Class A examination and of the subsequent commercial education.The qualifications requisite in a Consul are the subject of the widest differences of opinion. It has been sometimes suggested that what is wanted is to get a number of smart young men who have entered a business house at an early age and who have had a training there for some years. There is much to be said for this view. But it omits two considerations. - A Consul is the representative of his country for commercial purposes, but in other ways as well. But for commercial purposes themselves, carefully considered, it is not sufficient. The problem has been placed before men of prominence in the business world nearly thirty in number. Their views have been obtained, as well as those of Consuls who have taken a special interest in commercial work, and of the professors of faculties of commerce at leading universities. The almost unanimous opinion is that the first requisite is a foundation of general knowledge, coupled with a broad outlook. This is the more essential because success in foreign trade means not only the efficient sale of British goods, but the development of British enterprises in foreign countries and the securing of adequate supplies of material. For this purpose an acquaintance with finance, currency, and banking, and also of transport, is necessary. A Consul will not be expected to be himself a good commercial traveller, or manufacturers agent, or entrepreneur, or banker, or transport manager. But he will be expected to appreciate the co-operation which each of these may require, and to have the capacity for acquiring the specialised knowledge which may be needed in any particular district under his charge, or for any special piece of work that may be entrusted to nim. It is submitted with confidence that the proposed system of training is best devised to meet the needs of the case. . The initiation of the scheme is due to Mr. Wellesley, and thanks are also due to ah those men of business and heads of commercial faculties who have helped by their advice, and especially to Mr. Stanley Leathes and to Professor Chapman for framing the proposed courses and examinations in detail.The provision and training of skilled officers is so important that nothing should interfere with the immediate establishment of the system designed to secure this end. But what is, or should be, the Imperial nature of the service should not be forgotten. It should be felt by the Dominions to be their service and to represent them as well as the United Kingdom. This object will only be fully attained if candidates, whose qualifications are up to the standard, are able to enter direct from Canada, Australia,
and the other Dominions. Nothing in the proposed scheme is incompatible with a subsequent adjustment to meet this end. It is therefore submitted that without delaying its immediate approval, it should be communicated to the Governments of the Dominions, with a view to making arrangements designed to meet the objects just stated.4. The Problem of Open and Closed Consular Services.It is proposed that there should be one closed service the Far Eastern. The whole of the rest of the Consular officers should form one general service.Up to the present there have been two closed services, the Far Eastern and the Levant. The reason for these has been the special character of the languages and training required. Recently it has been proposed that a new special service should be created for Russia. It has further been suggested that the whole of the Consular service should be divided into broad zones determined by linguistic and racial reasons.The question has been exhaustively considered. It is clear that Consular officers should become as intimately acquainted as possible with the special conditions of the country in which they serve. For this reason, too, they should not be moved more than can be helped from countries possessing one class of languages or habits to others in which these are quite different. On the other hand, the existence of too many small watertight compartments is in itself undesirable. If promotion should chance to be rapid in one and slow in another, dissatisfaction will result and efliciency suffer. There has, in fact, been undesirable stagnation in certain cases. Again, wherever lines are drawn, borderline cases will occur, and a transfer from one side of the line to another be desirable. Is it wise, for example, to make transfer between Roumania and Serbia or Bulgaria difficult ? The ideal, therefore, is clear. Firstly, adequate training must be provided to ensure that areas of the world with special characteristics, such as Russia and the Near East, shall be staffed with officers who know the peculiarities of those areas. Secondly, while no rigid boundaries are drawn which can be avoided, Consular officers, albeit members of a general service, must be subject to a kind of natural selection according to the national characteristics, commercial conditions, and languages with which they are most familiar. For this reason there was unanimity of opinion that it was inadvisable to maintain the special service for the Levant. On the other hand, the circumstances of the Far East are so peculiar and different from the rest of the world that the special service for the Far East is retained.5. Pay and Personal Allowances.The pay and personal allowances should be equal to those proposed for the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service.   They will be : Paij.(i.) Vice Consuls; 300Z., rising to 600Z. by increments of 25L, free of income tax. (ii.) Consuls : 800Z. rising to 1,0001. by increments of 251., free of income tax. (iii.) Consuls-General: 1,200Z., rising to 1,500Z. by increments of 50Z., free of income tax.Representation Allowance (&quot; frais de representation &quot;).100Z. for a Vice-Consul serving in the same town as a superior Consular officer. I50Z. for a Vice-Consul in a separate post. 250Z. for a Consul.300Z. for a Consul-General, with the proviso that where a Consul-General is doyen of the local Consular corps, and thereby liable to incur additional expenditure, his allowance may be increased by another 100Z. per annum.Special Allowance for Expensive Places.It will be absolutely necessaiy to make a Schedule of Special Allowances for expensive countries as soon as conditions have sufficiently settled down to make it possible to frame estimates of the permanent cost of living in different posts. For the present, however, the situation may be met by existing allowances, supplemented by the grant of war bonuses.
The whole subject of pay and allowances is of vital importance. If the country is to attract and keep Consuls of first-class ability, it must be prepared to pay them not munificently, but at least a sufficiency. The scales of substantive pay (and it is-on these that pensions are calculated) are the same as those proposed for the Civil Service at home. It is clear that if ability and training of the same standard are required of Government representatives abroad, their scales of substantive pay cannot be less. Otherwise, with all the disadvantages experienced by men wdio are expected to marry and bring up families while living in a foreign country, public servants of the quality desired cannot be obtained. The rates of pay in existence before the war were acknowledged to be inadequate, and various proposals for raising them had been made by the Royal Commission and by others. The war has altered the basis on which all these calculations were made, and though prices will probably fall, they will not again reach pre-war levels. Exemption from income tax is also necessary. Without it the increases proposed are largely illusory. Nor does it constitute, as might at first sight appear, a great advantage over civil servants in the Home Service. In the countries where the vast majority&apos; of posts are situated, the greater part of the continuing burden of taxation due to the war Avill be felt by Consuls as by other residents. It is not, therefore, fair that he should pay a double war burden, both that of the United Kingdom and of his country of residence.The personal allowances suggested are largely self - explanatory. Special allowances exist already in the case of Consular posts in countries wdiere the cost of living is notoriously expensive. The representation allowances are new, hut are absolutely necessary. They will of course only be payable to Consuls while on foreign service. Nor will they be in the nature of pocket-money. They will be liable to render an account of expenditure, and only those disbursements wall be made good which, represent sums actually expended within the limits allowed. Under such safeguards the case for granting them is indisputable. A Consular officer abroad, as distinct from a civil servant or the same officer if serving at home, is inevitably regarded as the local representative of the British Government. No one can claim that the allowances suggested would support profligacy in expenditure ! But they will help in preventing the British Government being brought into disrepute. Moreover, if a Consul is to do his work properly, he must mix with the local British colony, and also (which is even more essential) with the national residents of his district. If there is a club, he ought to be a member of it, and to entertain, if only the minimum necessary. Unless he can do so he cannot properly perform his primary duties to British commerce and industry.The adoption of the above proposals, as of those for new posts and training, is absolutely necessary if a good service is to be created. If they are sanctioned officers will be secured a tolerable existence: Office allowances, moreover, can then be kept strictly for thejpurpose for which they are intended. Moreover, if members of the Service are properly cared for, then, as more is done for them, really efficient service can be required in return. But if the proposals are not adopted the whole scheme and any hope of an adequate Consular Service must be abandoned.6. Conditions of Leave and Transfer, &amp;c.It is of real importance that Consular officers should not remain too long without revisiting this country. Not only does too prolonged an absence have a personal effect upon the officer himself, but it results in his losing touch with conditions at home. It is proposed, therefore, that the amount of leave which an officer can claim should approximate to that enjoyed in the Civil Service at home (viz , six weeks in the year up to ten years&apos; service and eight weeks thereafter). Once in two years the officer will be entitled to the expense of his own journey home, and, within limits, of one-half of that of his family. In analogy also with provisions in the Colonial Service, the duration of the voyage by a direct route will not be counted as part of his leave.More detailed considerations which are involved as regards regulations dealing both with leave and with outfits and transfers are coutained in the report by the Departmental Committee which has just considered these and other points. These and other sections of the report are given in Appendix IV, and approval is desired of the recommendations contained in them.7. The Equipment of the Consulate.(a.) Generally. Hitherto the problem examined has  been that of  securing efficient workmen.    But, if obtained, efficient tools will also be indispensable. &apos; In [957]    &apos; D
other words, the Consular premises and their equipment must be adequate. Again, sufficient clerical assistance is a sine qua non unless the highly-trained official is to waste his time on mechanical work to the neglect of bis proper duties. Another matter of great importance is a proper system, uniform throughout the service, of business records of firms and other local matters of importance. In these and similar matters it will readily be admitted that adequate provision, now often wanting, is indispensable. But the danger may be apprehended and it is real that provision so made may be wasted or misapplied. Provision is made against this contingency by the proposal contained in a later section of the appointment of inspecting officers of capacity and knowledge. Sufficient experience has already been gained from such reports to warrant the belief that the danger of Avaste can thus be averted, but the suggestion by the Treasury of any further safeguards will be welcomed. Adequate equipment however is vital. An estimate is submitted in Appendix VIII of the cost of office allowances. This estimate may be subjected to revision when normal conditions are re-established, but it is not likely that the total will then be found susceptible of much reduction. In any case, the principle should be definitely approved that the equipment should not be unduly stinted, provided that adequate inspection will secure the avoidance of waste.The following paragraphs deal briefly with some of the questions involved, and recommendations are made. More detailed examination of individual points is con-tained in the report of the Departmental Committee already mentioned, and the relevant sections of which are given in Appendix IV.(b.) Accommodation. In the past, in too many cases, neither the premises of the Consulate nor the office equipment have reflected credit on His Majesty&apos;s Government. Little supervision has been exercised over the choice by a Consular officer of premises, and in many cases the office allowance has been insufficient to provide any that were at all adequate. As regards office furniture, the rule till recentty has been for the individual officer to provide the furniture, and this is still the case in most Consulates. The system compares most unfavourably with the American, under which Government furniture is provided. Recently, however, an arrangement has been sanctioned by the Treasury by which, on a change of incumbency, it will for the future be supplied by the Office of Works, and be the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government.It is proposed that :-(i.) The office allowance shall be sufficient to provide suitable offices which shouldreceive the approval of the inspecting officer, (ii.) The system under which standardised office furniture is provided by theOffice of Works for all Consulates in which there are salaried officers,should be generalised and accelerated in application, (iii.) Stationery of all kinds should also be standardised and supplied by theStationery Office.(c.) Office Staff Creation of a &quot; Chancery Service.&quot; A difficult problem has always been presented by the need for reliable clerks. As a result of much con-sideration it is proposed that a &quot;chancery service&quot; should be created of the confidential clerks that are needed both in the Diplomatic and Consular services. Additional help can be provided as before by engaging local clerical assistance.(d.) Records. It is of great importance that a standard and uniform system of commercial records should be maintained throughout the Service. The principle was recognised by the initiation in 1917 of the series of reports known as Form K, of which many expressions of appreciation have been received. Consideration is now required whether alterations or extensions are needed in the light of experience gained in the last two years, or in view of the change from war to peace conditions. The matter is one of detail and complexity, but is well in hand.8. Inspection.It is proposed that inspecting officers, not exceeding eight in number, should be appointed to visit and make recommendations with regard to Consular offices.The proposal is merely an extension of the inspectorate already sanctioned before the war. The whole essence of the proposal is to ensure that if more adequate allow-ances and equipment are provided, they shall be rightly employed, and that the standard of efficiency made possible by the foregoing proposals shall, in fact, be reached and maintained. Subject to the Head of the Mission, the Commercial Counsellor.
or Secretary will be at the head of the Consular corps in any country, will receive information and reports from them, and give instructions. In the development of the future it may be possible for him also to be directly responsible for inspections, at any rate in certain countries. But the routine work and office management of a Consulate are one thing, and the commercial and economic work another. To gain a proper appreciation of the way in which the first is done, needs experience and takes time. For both reasons, therefore, the newly appointed Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries should not be asked to undertake duties of inspection, and the appointment of a few experienced and competent Consular officers for this purpose is amply justified.A memorandum on the subject by Consul-General Clipperton is attached in Appendix V.9. Transitional Measures.It is clearly necessary that immediate approval shall be given 10 the conditions under which the reformed Consular Service shall be recruited. Otherwise it will be impossible to attract and retain the proper personnel. But it is equally clear that time must elapse before the complete scheme as contemplated, with a trained body of officers, can be brought into full working order. The Service as it exists has been depleted during the war, and thus the number of posts to be filled is large, wdiile the supply of the trained officers of the future will only be gradually forthcoming.To meet the situation a Selection Committee has for some time been interviewi candidates, with a view to making appointments on probation. More, however, is required. It is necessary that discretion be reserved to the Secretary of State to direct that any post in the complete scheme should, for a shorter or longer temporary period, be filled by an officer of a lower grade, and restored to its full grade when justified by the conditions. The allowances, personal or office, in such cases would, in his discretion, be those attaching either to the permanent or temporary grade of the post as circumstances may require. Thus at the outset there would not be so many consuls-general as are contemplated under the complete scheme, and of course the expenditure ad interim from public funds will be diminished. This is not unfair on the officers in the Service, since it would not at the outset contain the number of officers of experience or length of service, on which the final scheme is based, and important posts, which will ultimately be consulates, must in the nature of things be filled for a time by junior officers of lesser experience. The discretionary power, however, will provide for promotion in rank as quickly as if the reformed service could come into existence full-blown or completely developed and the proper flow of promotion will be, safeguarded with all that is thereby implied as regards the morale of the Service.As regards local allowances, the difficulty is of a different kind. Conditions are not yet sufficiently stable to allow of a permanent schedule to be put forward. But the principle should once again be emphasised that, as adequate precautions hae been taken to provide against waste or excessive demands, no objection should be entertained to providing allowances on a scale really necessary for the proper perform-ance of a consuls duties and the denial of which will not be an economy, but rather a waste of the other expenditure sanctioned.10. Note on the Far Eastern Service.The Far Eastern Service, which in the Financial Estimate has been grouped with the General Service, presents certain features distinct from the latter. In the past the lower grades of the service comprised Student Interpreters and 1st and 2nd Class Assistants. Sir John Jordan, however, in his despatch No. 332 of the 22nd October, 1917, recommended that the distinction between 1st and 2nd Class Assistants should be abolished in the China Service and that after two years as a Student Interpreter an officer should become an assistant with a salary of 350L, rising by annual increments of 251. to 6U0Z.. This system, it is proposed, should be adopted for the whole of the Far Eastern Service.It will further be borne in mind that an Assistant in the Far Eastern Service approximates, in so far as his age, length of service, and salary are concerned, to a Vice-Consul in the General Service. An examination of the ranks and ages of the present Vice-Consuis and Consuls in the Far Eastern Service also shows that together they roughly correspond to those of Consuls in the General Service.   The question
- ---------- - 1&apos; - 8then arises of altering the nomenclature of the grades of the Far Eastern Service to bring them into line with those of the General Service on the following basis : Former Nomenclature. Proposed Nomenclature.Assistants... ...      to be called      ...      Vice-Consuls.Vice-Consuls and Consuls ,, ...      Consuls.Consuls-General    ...        ,,&apos;       ,, ...      Consuls-General.Before making such an alteration, however, it will be advisable to consult the responsible ministers in the Far East, and, pending their replies, to retain the old system of nomenclature. Any such change, however, in nomenclature Ought not to affect the question of salaries, which should be determined (as has previously also been the case), by length of service and the nature of the duties performed. For the purposes therefore of the financial estimate in Appendix VIII, the salaries of Vice-Consuls and Consuls in the Far Eastern Service have been calculated as though they both belonged to the Consular grade, while their representation allowances have been based on the actual rank they hold.Investigation showed that officers of the Far Eastern Service suffered under a considerable disability as regards outfit. On proceeding to the East as Student Interpreters they received no financial grant to help them secure a civilian outfit suitable for the East. It is therefore suggested that in future au outfit allowance of oOL should be made to each Student Interpreter on proceeding to the East in order to meet this cost. Further, it is considered that the old and vicious system should be abolished, whereby an assistant on receiving temporarily the acting rank of A^ice-Consul was compelled to purchase the necessary uniform out of his own pocket without any prospect of getting this disbursement refunded until (years later perhaps) he received a commission as Vice-Consul. It is thought that in future the assumption by an officer of the acting rank next above his own, wherever it entails the purchase of the uniform of the new rank, should entitle that officer immediately to the corresponding outfit allowance. The latter change will not cause any increase in the average annual expenditure.Office allowances are proposed for the Far Eastern Service on the same scale as in the General Service. As far as local allowances are concerned, since the value of quarters, where provided, is deducted from the increased salaries, provision is made only for extra allowances in the case of specially expensive places, such as, Shanghai, Harbin, Yokohama, &amp;c.An item of expenditure, which for a little time to come wall loom large in financial estimates is that of exchange compensations. This has been the case throughout the latter years of the war and the principle has already been acknowledged. It is only right that officers should be safeguarded against the depreciated exchange; provision is accordingly made for this in the note in Appendix VIII on p. 3G. It will of course be borne in mind that it is a temporary and not a permanent change.11. Distinction between&quot; the Salaried and Unsalaried Services.So many misconceptions are prevalent with regard to the Unsalaried Service that a few remarks are advisable in this connection. For&apos; many years past only British subjects have been allowed to be members of the Salaried Service, and the numberless questions as to the presence of aliens in the ranks of the Consular Service are due to the fact that the distinction is not recognised between the Salaried and Unsalaried Services. It is right that where commercial or other considerations justify the appointment of a whole time representative, a salaried Consul should be appointed belonging to the regular Service. It is also right that lie should not only be a British born subject, but that his origin and connections should be more carefully scrutinised than heretofore. But, supposing that salaried Consuls have been posted to all the cities which warrant such appointments, what of the lesser towns, which do not ? The question then arises whether there should be unsalaried representatives in such places or not ? Such representatives may be willing to serue out of patriotism and love of their country, or the inducements of the position may appeal to them. Should advantage be taken of their willingness to do so ? Valuable services have in many cases been rendered by such officers in the past. Again, it should be remembered in this connection that if a British citizen should be stranded in such a town, it is of great advantage to him to have some British representative from whom advice or help may be obtained. Moreover, unsalaried officers have not recourse to the most secret cyphers.   If then in this and other respects they are not placed in the ambiguous
position of having private interests and at the same time official information that may conflict with them, it would he foolish not to utilise their services. Clearly, they should he responsible British citizens wherever such are available. But where this is not the case, it would be unwise to reject the honorary services of citizens of a friendly country, provided that an enquiry into their standing, connections, and dispositions be found satisfactory. It will be remembered that such honorary officers will in all cases I *e under the supervision and control of the Consul-General or Consul within whose district their duties are performed.(B,)-THE COMMERCIAL DIPLOMATIC SERVICE AND THE TRADECOMMISSIONERS.1. The Duties of Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries.If the Department at home is analogous to the General Headquarters, the Commercial CounseUors and Secretaries of Embassy will represent the commands and headquarters&apos; staff of the different local armies, while the members of the Consular Service are the regimental officers. A general sketch of the principles of British commercial policy abroad, including a description of the functions and purpose of Counsellors and Secretaries, and a comparison with those of Consular Officers, is given in the attached article contained in xAppendix VI. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the duties of Consuls are local, though, of course, questions possessing a general bearing or importance must not be neglected by them. On the other hand the Commercial Counsellor is the keystone of the arch. It will be his duty to keep in touch with the general development and commercial policy of the eountr\T; to report home about it, and to take action in respect to it in harmony with the policy decided at home. For this purpose he will collect information from the various Consular Officers, and will in turn serve as a clearing house to convey to them information from other sources which wiR be of use to them. On the administrative side, it will generally be his duty, as soon as the system is developed, to inspect and report upon the Consular Service in his country, subject to the British Minister.2. Posts.It is proposed that the Service (exclusive of Trade Commissioners) should consist of 55 officers, viz., 7 Counsellors, 16 First Secretaries, and 32 Second Secretaries.Application has already been made for this number of posts in connection with the estimates for the coming year, and no further posts will be required. As regards grades, however, it is proposed that there should be only three grades instead of four, as originally contemplated; The original creation of the fourth grade was due to the analogy of the Trade Conunissionerships. Experience, however, has shown that the fourth grade is unsuitable, and if the proper conception be retained of the duties of Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, and of their relation to the Consular Service, the change is necessary. It is a small matter. A list of the posts is given in Appendix VII.3. Pay and Allowances. It is proposed that there should be the following substantive rates of pay :  (1) Second Secretaries     ... ...      800-1,000, free of income tax.(2) First Secretaries        ... ...    1,200-1,500,(3) Counsellors    .........    1,600-2,000,A change has . been made in the scales of pay. That for Second Secretaries has been raised from 700L-900L to the same as a Consul; that for First Secretaries to the same as a Consul-General, and that for Counsellors from 1,500L to a scale of 1,600Z. 2,000L The change is absolutely necessary. In the original scheme the scales for the posts below the first grade were low, but they were purposely somewhat higher than the Consular rates. AR that has been done is to raise these grades to a parity with the Consular rates with wi ch they are comparable. The original salary [957j . &apos; E
of 1.500Z. was at the time that it was proposed higher than that of any other grade in the Consular or Diplomatic Services except that of heads of missions. The same relative position is now maintained. It is none too much for the few principal posts in the distinctive commercial representation of the British Empire throughout the world.The remarks made in a previous paragraph with reference to the office allowances of Consular officers apply also to those of Counsellors and Secretaries in the new Service. In those cases in which experience has already been gained, viz., Paris, Rome, and Brussels, it is quite clear that an immediate increase is urgently needed beyond the sums sanctioned when the new extension of the Service was first approved. In Rome it is necessary to extend the provision to a sum of 1,750/, per annum, together with an allowance for rent of offices, to take effect whenever these are no longer afforded by the Embassy. In Paris and in Brussels similar increases are required, and it is submitted that these and similar grants be approved. A careful analysis of the situation in Rome is presented in the Report from the Commercial Counsellor printed in Appendix VII. The report adduces convincing proof of the need for the allowances requested if the heart of a commercial representative is not to be broken in the endeavour to perform his work without the necessary material.4. Recruitment.It is contemplated that as soon as the new system of training for the Consular Service has had time to take full effect, the Commercial Secretaries will be recruited for the most part from those Vice-Consuls who show most aptitude for the work. It will be possible for a Commercial Second Secretary to be promoted to be a Consul-Gen eral or for a Consul to become a Commercial First Secretary. But the same tendency must inevitably be observed as to the case of transfer from Home to Foreign Service, viz., that while no bar is erected, yet specialisation will tend to exist to a greater extent in the upper grades.It has been said above that recruitment may be expected principally from the ranks of the Vice-Consuls. Provision, however, will always be desirable for appoint-ments direct from the business world, and this has been made in the case of a proportion of the posts. -5. The Trade Commissioners.It is proposed to amalgamate the Trade Commissioner Service with the Commercial Diplomatic Service.Relations with the other dominions of the British Empire are and, it is hoped, will continue to be radically different from those with foreign countries, however friendly. There will always be a difference in the constitutional position of our representatives. Subject, however, to this proviso, efficiency will clearly be increased if all commercial representatives can be made part of one administrative service. A great additional convenience is also gained thereby. In some regions of the world, especially Africa and South America, it may be desirable that the same official should superintend a group of districts of which some form part of the British Empire and others of foreign countries. Under the proposed amalgamation the arrangement is made much easier.At the same time, to mark the distinction between service within and service without the British Empire, the distinctive title of Trade Commissioner will be retained, and will be held for the time being by any occupant of the post in addition to that of his substantive rank in the Service.A table showing the present Trade Commissionerships and their position under the conversion scheme is given in Appendix VII.

Whatever be the grouping there will be border-line cases. Moreover, other than geographical considerations must be borne in mind. Thus it would be most unwise in any commercial grouping to separate Spain and Portugal from Latin-[957] -        -       - - j,
America. Similarly, it is probably right that the sections which deal with the Netherlands, Belgium, or France, should also deal with the Dutch East Indies, the Belgian Congo, and the French colonias in Africa other than French Somaliland. It will be observed that with one partial exception the Dominions, India, and Egypt, are kept in separate geographical sections from foreign countries. In the larger groups, however, the same distinction is not maintained. This has been done advisedly. The proper grouping is determined by the needs of the industrialist or trader. It would be-absurd to make the treatment of Rhodesian commerce remote from and unconnected with British representation, either in Lourenco Marques, or Elizabethville, or the Katanga strip. On the other hand as Empire sections are distinct any Imperial question can receive its proper separate treatment. For commercial purposes it is submitted that the above grouping is the best that can be devised.3. Interchange ability of Staff.The number of sections suggested above is none too great if the work is to be adequately performed. But it is not only necessary that the staff should be adequate in numbers. It must, like the consular officers, be able to appreciate and understand industrial and commercial needs. Each section of it must be constantly in touch with those portions of the business community interested in that part of the world with which it deals. Again, while office management and policy must possess continuity, it is equally essential that it should possess freshness of acquaintance with the conditions of the different foreign countries, and with their constant changes and developments. Lastly, personal touch between the staff at home and abroad is essential. If the enthusiasm of a commercial secretary or a consul is to be maintained, the staff at home must be siich as to allow of direct interchange of ideas, and secure him the knowledge that what he does will be appreciated and his suggestions taken into consideration. These objects are obtained by the arrangement of staff indicated. The officers in class (a),who maybe called either second class clerks or vice-consuls,will be interchangeable with the other vice-consuls serving abroad and form one cadre with them. Interchangeability between home and foreign service in the case of these officers will be the rule, and it will secure that direct acquaintance with conditions abroad will be constantly renewed. On the other hand, the period of home service should not be less in any case than two years, nor should it exceed five. This provision, combined with the greater fixity of officers of the next rank, and of the second division staff, will ensure adequate continuity.The officers in the next rank may be defined as being of consular rank or of that of first class clerks. They will draw the same substantive pay as consuls or second grade commercial secretaries, and, as a general rule, will be promoted from the rank of vice-consuls. But with this grade of seniority increasing localisation is required, if the work of the office is not to become scrappy and discontinuous. It is therefore contemplated that with them interchange with service abroad, while still possible, \rill be the exception and not the rule. Provision, however, is necessary that periodically they should be enabled to pay a visit, of at least four months duration to the countries in their group.The principle of interchangeability of staff at home and abroad has also been recently adopted in the amalgamation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Services. It is not desirable to complicate these recommendations by a discussion of the question whether the Diplomatic and Consular Services should also be amalgamated. That question can be treated when it arises, and it does not affect the desirability of the present scheme of reform. It is, however, necessary to insist here that, whether the distinction between the Consular and Diplomatic Services be maintained or not, interchange between the different parts of the Foreign Office staff at home is essential, sine otherwise the treatment of commercial and political questions will be sundered to the disadvantage of both. The interchange at home has already been accepted in principle, but little effect has been given to it in practice. The reason assigned for this has been the exigencies of war and the consequent pressure on the available taff.   These exigencies will now cease to exist.
..      , &apos;   323(E.)-NOTE ON LABOUR ATTACHES.The desirability of a new departure in the direction indicated by the title of this section has gradually become more and more apparent, and will be increasingly evident in the future. In past years Naval, Military, and Commercial Attaches have been appointed to deal with matters affecting the army, the navy, or business. Knowledge of the labour market was no doubt part of the business information about which a Commercial Attache was supposed to enquire. Similarly labour conditions, so far as they affected the political situation, fell nominally within the province of the Diplomatic * Staff. It will, however, be admi+ted that no real knowledge was possessed by our representatives of the real state and development of labour, except perhaps as a rare and chance exception. Nor, indeed, was this to be expected, since knowledge of this nature is as much for the specialist as any. But the events of the present war have shown how great is its importance. In the future, moreover, labour will show a continued development. Moreover, specific problems are likely to arise, which involve labour questions, as, for example, the special tariff treatment of the products of sweated labour, or concurrent labour legislation. For both general and specific reasons, therefore, increasing importance will attach to accurate acquaintance with the labour situation&apos; in some of the most important foreign countries. Admittedly the appointment of Labour Attaches or Commissioners is an experiment. It may therefore be wise, as in the case of Commercial Attaches, only to appoint a few in the first instance, until the value of their services is shown, and the experimental stage is passed. It is suggested, therefore, that six Labour Attaches be appointed, drawing consular pay and local aUowance. Their centres of action will be Paris, Berlin, Moscow or Petrograd, Rome, Tokio, and Washington, and, as in the case of the earlier Commercial Attaches, they will pay attention also to adjoining countries, until such time as the need arises for special representation for those countries to be created.o(D.)-COST OP  THE  SCHEME.The total cost of the foregoing scheme (exclusive of the Labour Attaches) may be estimated at about 1,232,000Z., of whicb l,005,00OZ. will be expended on the Consular Service, 178,000Z. on the Commercial Diplomatic Service, and 49,000Z. within the Empire. A tabular statement of the different items that go to make up tbis total is given in Appendix VIH. The sum is a large one in days when economy is necessary. For a few years to come, moreover, it will have to be increased by the gift of war bonuses and exchange compensations to Consular officers, until the economic conditions all over the world revert to their normal post-war equilibrium (see note to Appendix VIII at foot of p. 36). The Consular Service will cost a little more than double what it did before the war, and the new service was then only in embryo.Is the expenditure justifiable ? One thing is clear. If it is decided that the Government of the country through its representatives both can and ought to assist British industrialists and traders abroad, then those representatives ought to be equal to their task and adequately equipped to perform it. Any other course is like the hopeless undercapitalisation of a business. Viewed again from another standpoint, the expense is not so great. Expensiveness is relative. The foreign trade of the United Kingdom bears a greater proportion to her total trade than does that of any other of the great Powers. Even before the war it amounted to over 1,400,000,0001., exclusive of the earnings of British shipping. Its re-establishment and expansion therefore is vital to the country, and must be achieved even if it entails a sacrifice. But the estimated sum that the new scheme will cost, though it be great in itself, is not a farthing in the pound of our foreign trade.The main question therefore is: &quot;Can the Government help British Foreign Trade, and should it do so?&quot; If the answer is &quot;No,&quot; then it would be better to reduce the existing service, rather than to waste money in paying men to make bricks without straw.   If the answer is &quot; Yes,&quot; the proposed expenditure is amply justified.

Distribution and Grading of Consular Posts.AFTER full consideration it was decided that it would be most suitable for the Service to be divided into three grades : Consuls-General, Consuls, and Vice-Consuls. An incidental advantage in this arrangement is that the number of grades is the same as in the new proposed organisation of the Foreign Office and Diplomatic Service. The proportion between the different grades has to satisfy two different classes of requirements. The rank of a post in any city should be suited to its importance and that of the district. So judged, and having regard to the great development of certain countries and districts within the last quarter of a century, the number of Consulates-General should be between 75 and 85. On the other hand, the Service must be such as to offer the prospect of a fair career. Members of the Service have of late had to look forward to the last years of their service in the Vice-Consular grade as a period of great hardship. The period when the family of a married man was beginning to grow coincided with years on the lowest scale of pay. Such hardship, be it also remembered, is peculiarly severe on men engaged in foreign service. Again, members should be encouraged to look forward to the fair chance of service at a later period in a post of the highest grade for a reasonable number of years. In solving this problem, which is complicated by the possibility of retirements and also of promotion into the Commercial Diplomatic Service, expert advice has been obtained from a leading insurance company and from Mr. King, the well-known actuary, as to the proper age-grouping. It is desirable that promotion to Consular rank should be expected not later than the end of an officers 35th year, and that he may look forward to becoming Consul-General about his 49th birthday, the retiring age being fixed at 60. On this basis the proportion of the highest posts should be 25 per cent. ; of posts of the second grade, 37 per cent. ; and of posts of the third grade, 38 per cent. If the Consular Service be considered from this point of view, and allowance be made for promotion into the Commercial Diplomatic Service, the total number of Consuls-General should be 84, which barely exceeds the number desirable, as determined by the importance of places and localities.Only one further consideration remains to be noted in this connection. As a rule the grade of a post should be determined by the importance of the locality. But in certain cases the value of a man&apos;s services may be predominantly due to his personal connections and his knowledge of the local conditions in a given district. It may, therefore, be desirable in the public interest to retain him in the same post, say as Consul, although he himself might merit transfer to another post of a higher grade. Such cases are limited, and to provide for them it is proposed that instead of 84 local posts, which would be Consulates-General, the number of such places should be 78, leaving six posts in handKto meet cases in which the personal rank and emoluments of a Consul-General can be given for the reasons above stated. A similar allowance has been made in the case of Consulates.

Extra numerum.Candidates may, in addition to the above, take one of the translation papers of section A 1, in a language not already taken by them in that section, not more than one of the Scandinavian languages, nor more than one of the three, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, being offered by the same candidate ; for this 100 marks will be awarded, not included in the 1,050 of sections A and A 1, or the 800 of section B.(6) Special Course at the University for the Commercial Diplomatic Serviceand the Consular Service.(Memorandum by Professor Chapman.)The special two years&apos; course should be vocational, and designed to fit candidates for their career. The prime need is understanding of industrial and commercial conditions, and a power of exercising judgment with reference to such conditions. Consequently, economics should form the foundation of the course, and this should include some acquaintance with its practical aspects. At the same time, as a knowledge of languages is so important, throughout the two years&apos; course, a study of languages should be continued.The following curriculum is suggested : 1. General Economics, with Special Reference to Banking, the Money Market, Currency, Foreign Exchanges, Public Finance, Modern Industrial Organisation, Social Problems, and Economics of Transport. This course should include lectures for, say, five hours a week in each year, and the instruction should be given by more than one teacher in order that the student should learn to view economic questions from more than one angle. The teaching should, of course, be realistic and theoretical, and not exclusively one or the other.In connection with training in economics it would be highly desirable, if not essential, that students should spend two or three of their vacations in industrial centres, and make reports on certain industries after visiting works. This would be an important part of their preparation as it would bring their economic knowledge into contact with practical affairs, and start them, under direction, at work that would afterwards be required of them.&apos;1. Statistics. The aim should be twofold, viz., to instruct the student in the theory which would enable him to interpret statistics rapidly and detect errors with facility, and to give him some knowledge of the kinds of statistics published by various countries, and other reliable sources of information.3. Modern History, Political and Economic. It is essential that this also should be a two years&apos; course. Stress should be laid in particular on recent hislory. On the economic side it would link on to the course on general economics. It is essential that political and economic history should both be included, even if dealt with by different lecturers, in order that the close connection between the two should be understood.-4. Political Science. This should consist not merely of political theory, but also of descriptive politics, including an account of recent political movements ; thus it would be closely related both to general economics and modern history.5. Industrial and Commercial Geography. The connection between this subject and economics is too obvious to call for comment. Clearly a knowledge of industrial and commercial geography lies at the root of a proper understanding of the economic conditions of different countries and of the course of foreign trade. At the same time, however, it should embrace physical geography, distribution of races, and their characteristics and other matters commonly included in geography.6. Commercial and Industrial Law. While in this course attention should be directed to the main differences and similarities between the laws of different countries, the main part of the instruction would relate to English commercial and industrial law. Given comprehension of the legal principles of one country an able man would have no difficulty in grasping the salient features of the laws of any other country.7. Accounting, including Company Finance. The purpose of this course should be to give the students, not so much a technical training in bookkeeping (though a fair knowledge of bookkeeping is highly desirable and should be aimed at) as a general
-working knowledge of the principles of all accounts which would enable them to read balance sheets and other financial statements with facility, and notice the respects in which such statements were a misleading or imperfect representation of the state of affairs.8. Languages. The study of the languages that the student was already acquainted with should be continued, and, in addition, if the student has only learnt two languages a reading knowledge of a third should be acquired.
Transfer and Leave Regulations, Office Staff, Office Equipment, &amp;c.THE following paragraphs have been extracted from the Report of the Depart-mental Committee which was recently set up to enquire into certain points connected with the Consular Service : (a.) Transfer and Leave Regulations.We consider that the present regulations relative to outfit allowances and repay-ment of expenses upon first appointment and subsequent transfer should be modified so as to bring them into line with the present regulations, dated the 1st October, 1910 (copy annexed to this Report),* applicable to members of the Diplomatic Service except in so far as Part II (outfit allowances) is concerned. In view of the somewhat different conditions in which Consular officers commence their service abroad, we consider that Vice-Consuls, on first appointment, should receive outfit allowances on the present scale, namely, one-quarter of the annual salary and local allowance, and that on promotion to higher rank, an allowance should be paid to cover the cost of the necessary change of uniform. All other expenses incidental to transfer would be covered by the allowances granted under the new regulations.With regard to the question of leave of absence we consider that it is illogical and unfair that Consular officers who spend most of their life abroad in conditions, which, if not actively unhealthy, are at any rate often unpleasant, should be less favourably treated in the matter of leave than civil servants of similar standing in the United Kingdom. We are convinced that it is desirable that Consular officers should not lose touch with, home conditions, and we feel that this end would best be achieved by granting treatment in the matter of leave which would place them on a par with civil servants at home, and which would enable them to pay more frequent visits to this country. To this end provision would, inter alia, require to be made to meet the expense of the journey home, more especially in the case of the more senior officers with families. We therefore make the following recommendations as to leave: Consular officers should be granted six weeks&apos; leave (eight weeks after ten years&apos; service) in each year. They should be allowed to accumulate leave, but not in excess of that accruing for two years&apos; service, i.e., twelve or sixteen weeks as the case may be. This accumulated leave may be taken, by permission, at any time during the second year&apos;s continuous service. Time spent on the journey home and on the return journey by a direct route, should not be counted as leave, which should commence from the date of arrival in the United Kingdom. Once in each two years&apos; spell of service a Consular officer should be entitled to receive payment of his own travelling expenses both ways in full, and one-half of the travelling expenses of his family both ways, the number of persons comprised in the family not to exceed five persons beside himself. The Secretary of State should have discretion in special cases to authorise variations from the established rules as to accumulated leave.If in the course of his leave a Consular officer is required to make tours in industrial centres, to visit Chambers of Commerce, or to[perform any work of a like nature, the period so spent should not be reckoned as leave of absence. Arrangements should, as far as possible, be made for this work to be done either at the beginning or at the end of the period of leave. It would be laid down that this work was part of a Consular officers regular duties, and that by performing it he would have no claim for any exceptional treatment as regards payment of travelling expenses.We consider that some arrangement should be made by which a Consular officer should, like civil servants in this country, be given a certain period of sick leave on full pay. At present such officers, if they have no full-pay leave due to them, must at once go on half-pay in case of illness.(b.) Subordinate Staffs and Shipping Clerks.We took as our basis, in discussing the question of the subordinate staffs employed in the Consular offices, a memorandum prepared by Mr. Wellesley, of which a copy is annexed to this Report. *We are of opinion that the present system by which such staffs are found by Consular officers themselves as best they can be and paid out of office allowances is* Not printed with this Appendix
undesirable and should be abolished. We are in agreement with the general principles laid down in Mr. Wellesleys memorandum, and consider that the problem would best be solved by the creation of a subordinate service to fill clerical posts at Diplomatic Missions and Consulates. Such a service, in order to attract and retain a suitable class of employee, should be well paid, and should provide definite prospects and grades of promotion for its members. Promotion would be provided by transfer to Consulates-General and to Missions. A wide knowledge of foreign languages would not be essential, as the employment of locally-engaged foreign clerks would be in most cases necessary for non-confidential work. We are of opinion that &quot; Chancery Service &quot; -would be a suitable title for the proposed service.With regard to the question of the staffing of Consular shipping offices, we are of opinion that these could not be properly left to be managed by an employee of the suggested &quot; Chancery Service &quot; without the constant direct supervision of a Vice-Consul or of an officer of the same standing. We feel that, as regards the great majority of Consular posts where the shipping office is in the same building as the Consular office, and where there is not sufficient shipping work to justify the existence of two separate offices, the necessary supervision could be given by a Vice-Consul or other Consular officer, in addition to his other work. There are, however, a certain number of posts where the volume of shipping work is such as to render necessary the existence of a separate shipping office. They are not numerous, but where they exist we consider that special arrangements should be made. We are of opinion that the most suitable arrangement would be one by which the Board of Trade would lend the services, for a stated period, of Deputy Superintendents of mercantile marine officers, who would take charge of the Consular shipping offices. They would be considered as seconded from the Board of Trade, and, while employed at Consular posts, would be given the local rank of Vice-Consul. Provision should be made by which it would be possible for a Deputy Superintendent to be promoted to the Consular Service if he shows special qualifications.We consider that this system should be brought into force as soon as possible at the following posts : Antwerp. Hamburg. New York (2). Marseilles. Rotterdam.We understand that an arrangement of the kind indicated is already in force at New York, where, in our opinion, a second officer should be employed, and that steps are being taken to arrange for the staffing of the Antwerp shipping office on the same lines.We consider that the services of the Deputy Superintendents should be lent by the Board of Trade for a period of not less than four years, of which the first four months should be a probationary period, that they should receive their Board of Trade salaries and bonus, plus a local allowance calculated on the cost of living of the post. We consider that the rates of such local allowances should be 150Z., 200Z., and 250L respectively, and that, in the case of a married officer, the allowance should be increased by a sum of 501 We consider that an immediate start should be made on these lines, and that the Board of Trade, who are, we understand, not opposed to the scheme, should be approached in the matter. The system can be later on extended to other Consular posts, where the shipping work is in normal conditions of sufficient volume to justify its adoption.(c.) Provision of Office Equipment, Office Accommodation, and Allowances.We understand that the Treasury have recently sanctioned an arrangement by which, on a change of incumbency at any post, the office furniture belonging to the outgoing Consular officer, instead of, as at present, being purchased by the incoming officer, will henceforth, so far as it is suitable, be purchased by the Office of Works and become the property of His Majesty&apos;s Government.This is a step in the right direction. We feel that the arrangements hitherto in force, namely, that office furniture should be bought out of office allowance, which have resulted in Consular offices being furnished and equipped in what can only be described as a nondescript manner, have neither tended to efficiencv nor enhanced the prestige of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   We consider that Consular offices should
Compare favourably with, those of business firms of good standing, and that the best means of achieving this would be that the equipment of Consular offices should as far possible be standardised. This.would also result both in greater efficiency, as a Consular officer would on transfer be already familiar with the mechanical equipment of his office. The official stationery in use should be of uniform pattern and should be supplied by the Stationery Office. The cost could either be debited against office allowance or that allowance could be reduced accordingly.In the case of office furniture, as in that of equipment, we consider that the standard aimed at should be that of a good-class business firm. At all Consulates-General and at the more important Consulates a room should^ be available for the special use of the Commercial Attache.We consider that office allowances should be regularly accounted for and that the Commercial Attache, or Inspector, should be required to control the manner in which the office allowance has been expended.(d.) Office Hours, Hours of Work, and Part Retention Fees.We consider that, as the conditions vary so widely in different posts, ho general rule can usefully be laid down as regards office hours, and that the present system should continue by which Consular offices remain open for a reasonable period (not less than four hours) during the customary business hours of the place.It should, however, be made clear, to Consular officers that four hours is a minimum and not a maximum. It should also be laid down that in fixing their office hours they should take into account the hours of local institutions, such as banks, custom-houses, &amp;c, with which the public may have business which must be done as a preliminary to transactions at the Consulate. For example, if at any post the local custom-house closes at 3 p.m. the Consulate should not also be closed at 3 p.m., but at some later hour which would enable ship-masters to clear at the Customs and then to visit the Consulate.We are of opinion that, as a general rule, it should be laid down that the Head of the Mission, on the recommendation of the Inspecting Officer, whoever he may be, should have power to regulate the office hours of any post, subject to the right of the Consular officer, in cases of marked divergence of opinion, to appeal to the Secretary of State.We consider that a minimum of seven hours attendance to Consular work can fairly be required, if necessary, of Consular officers and their staffs. We do not suggest that during the whole of this period the Consular officer should be accessible to the public, and we are aware that in the majority of cases Consular officers spend this amount of time, or more if necessary, upon their work as a matter of course ; but in our opinion no harm could result from recalling to Consular Officers the fact that their duties are not limited to the period during which the public office is open.We feel, no doubt, that the present -system by which Consular officers are permitted to retain certain proportions of fees in Parts III and IV of the Consular Table of Fees is a vicious one, and we recommend that it should be abolished. In order, however, to avoid any disposition on the part of the public to abuse or exploit the services of Consular officers, the fees themselves should be retained, but the proceeds should in their entirety be credited to the Government. We understand that there are certain posts where, from the peculiar conditions obtaining, some hard-ship to Consular officers may result. In such cases the hardship should, in our opinion, be remedied by some special addition in the way of local allowance to the emolument of the existing holders of the post.
, 333Memorandum on Inspection by Consul-General Clipperton.INSPECTIONS were originally started in 1914, in conformity with a decision arrived at in 1913. Four &quot; Visitors &quot; were appointed. Two of these, Mr. Percy Bennett and Lord Herbert Hervey, were Commercial Attaches, with diplomatic rank. The other two, Mr. Clive Bayley for Russia, and myself for France, Germany, Belgium, Hollahd, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, were given the rank of Consul-General. It was not considered advisable that Mr. Clive Bayley and myself should have the same rank as the Commercial Attaches, no doubt on the ground that it was then uncertain how inspection would be taken, and what would be the results.It has now been found that inspection was necessary, and experience has proved the scheme a success. Senior officers were very antagonistic to the scheme unless they inspected one another.   This would have been fatal.The seniors whom I inspected, whilst at first not inclined to accept the new office, afterwards wrote to me (copies of their letters are with the Consular Department) expressing their satisfaction with inspection.Senior rank equal to that of Commercial Attache would, especially at the beginning, have been of the greatest assistance to me, and would in no way have changed my mode of inspection. It is my opinion that the higher grade of rank equal to that of the Commercial Attache is essential. The title &quot; Visiting Consul&quot; should be changed to &quot;Inspector-General with rank, &amp;c.&quot;Actually to describe how an inspection should be carried out, is perhaps a little difficult. It should be to a large extent left to the inspecting officer to decide in what manner he will proceed. The instructions issued to the four inspectors in 1913 can, however, be taken as a basis for a good start.My own idea, after arriving at a Consulate, has always been first of all to devote sufficient time to making the acquaintance of the Consul and his staff, so that they may feel at home ; the)&apos; are not expected to consider me as an enemy, but as a friend. I am also careful to impress on them that I am quite as ready to learn anything I can from them as to teach and correct. I find by so doing that it soon smooths over the aversion from an inspection, if such aversion is in the air.I. tell the Consul that I wish to work with his staff and prefer to be left alone with them, and ask him to continue his own work as if I were not present. I take each Vice-Consul or clerk in turn and help him with his work, pointing out anything that needs correction. I act in the same manner as regards the Consul, but perhaps more discreetly. I am thus able to judge how far each person is fitted for his work and to pick up many useful points. I discuss with the Consul what remedies are required and how they can best be effected, and try as far as possible to suggest changes in such a way that his authority will not suffer. In several instances I have had to start a set of books and show how accounts should be kept. The keeping of Consular accounts, though simple, is very often not understood this may sound surprising, but is nevertheless a fact; as far as possible, a uniform standard should be introduced. Unsuitable premises are not uncommon ; I then recommend a change to more suitable quarters, and if, as sometimes occurs, the Consul informs me that none are available, I look about for myself, and having found what I consider would make suitable offices, rent, &amp;c, I tell him the result of my enquiries. The result is that, while the Consul may not take the rooms I have seen, new but suitable premises are soon found.The question of office allowance is always gone into, and if the same is inadequate, it is noted and reported on.I always leave with the Consul, or send him in writing, a copy of my recommenda-tions as soon as possible after an inspection, another copy being enclosed with my report to the Foreign Office.An inspector must know all branches of the work he is inspecting, and the Consul must realise this, or otherwise the inspection will not be of much use.Before leaving for a tour of inspection, the inspector should call on the various Goverment Departments Consular, Chief Clerk, Department of Overseas Trade, Board of Trade Finance and Marine Departments, to enquire whether there are any points to be looked into or which may require settling, at any particular Consulate which it is proposed to call at.
The inspector should be in close touch with all Government Departments in any way connected with Consulates.The present travelling and subsistence allowance, 11. Is. per day for the continent, is not adequate*to meet expenses, and should be increased to cover actuahexpenditure.Regarding the organisation and administration of offices, it does not appear to me that the responsibility for their supervision should be placed on the Commercial Attache except in so far as commercial work is concerned. Special inspectors, or whatever official title they may be given, should be apjDointed at least for some years to come for this work. It is really one mans work to specialise and get Consulates properly working, and it does not appear to me that the Commercial Attache, besides his own work, could spare the time. In some Consulates he would want at least three weeks to one month where things are not to his satisfaction naturally I am referring to the larger offices; in the smaller ones ten days to a fortnight at the most might be all that is necessary. Of course in this I include all routine and other work, not the least important of which is the keeping of accounts. I consider that a chief should know the work of any junior or clerk and be able to step in and do that work, if necessary, together with accounts. Whilst the shipping and routine work of an office is not the most interesting part, it is, nevertheless, just as important that satisfaction should be given to shipping interests which, after all, represent a part of the commercial community. It would be wrong to leave this part of the work to shipping clerks and junior Vice-Consuls without submitting it to a thorough inspection. The junior Vice-Consul does not always have the required experience and, therefore, authority over the shipping clerk. The inspection must be made, but I think it would be a waste of the Attache s time, from a commercial point of view, to include such work in his duties.C. CLIPPERTON.September 28, 1918.
Principles of British Commercial Policy Abroad, together with a General Sketch of the purpose and functions of Commercial Counsellors and Secretaries, and a comparison with those of Consular Officers.IT is not proposed in this memorandum to traverse the same ground that has been covered by such papers as Mr. Brand&apos;s monograph on &quot; The co-ordination of British Industry and Finance.&quot; Its object is rather to connect these more general studies with the specific duties assigned to Commercial Attaches and to Consuls, to show the con-nected and organic policy, the achievement of which is the purpose of their existence. * It is hoped that by this means a Commercial Attache or Consul will know the reasons why and the objects wherefore he is asked to perform such specific duty. If so, it is believed that there may be much more effective co-operation to the common end than could otherwise be the case.1. Recent Developments and Aspects.It is not necessary for the purpose just mentioned to attempt a detailed survey of developments since the outbreak of war, but a brief outline is desirable of the general tendencies that have become manifest. In Germany the process of centralisation of industry by co-ordination in Kartels, or by amalgamation, has considerably developed. Lesser concerns have been forced to amalgamate by stress of war conditions. Com-pulsory kartellisation is in the air and has evoked vigorous protests. The great banks have enlarged their paid-up capital. Central institutions had been formed before the debacle, through which it is possible that raw materials will be purchased after the conclusion of hostilities. In any case it is clear that the organisation of German competition will be more close and systematic after the war than before.It must also be recognised that new competitors will enter the field. The United States have openly announced their intention of doing so. The activity of the National City Bank, with its newly-opened branches overseas, and of the International Corporation do not stand alone. The extension of the Mercantile Bank of the Americas, of the Irving National Bank, and of others all point in the same direction. It is possible that, being comparatively inexperienced hitherto in foreign trade, American performance may not at first be as formidable as their public utterances would warrant. That they will be a serious factor, however, is undeniable. Competition again from Japan is likely to be at least as serious in some regions in the near future as that from the.United States. As far west as India, the Persian Gulf and Egypt, and as far east as the west coast of South America, Japanese trade has been making its way during the war. It is organised much on the same lines as the German, and after the war Japan will have the advantage of abundance of capital as contrasted with belligerent European nations. Lastly,, great activity must be expected from some of the lesser European countries, such as Holland, Denmark, and Sweden, while an impetus to internal industrial development has been given by the war to such countries as Spain, Argentina, and Brazil.In Great Britain one of the results of the war has been to create a consciousness of the problems of foreign trade, which in general did not previously exist. It is realised that organised national effort is needed, although, as may be expected from a nation with markedly individualist tradition, the efforts so far made towards such organisation are partial and halting. The formation of the British Trade Corporation was a sign of the sense of need of organisation ; the opposition to it (on other grounds than those which instructed criticism might well have taken) a proof of the obscurant-lsm, either selfish or stupid, or both, that still exists. Recent amalgamations among the great clearing banks have comparatively little significance in this connection. The extensions of British banks overseas, however, is a healthy sign. . There is little indication in making these extensions that the great English banks have shown much co-operation inter se; nor yet that in general they have really consciously analysed the problem of foreign trade as a whole, and are acting on the analysis. But the move-ment is to the good.   Further and important developments may be expected, and
though the extensions so far made have not been part of any continued policy, yet it seems likely that they will not prejudice any more comprehensive scheme in the future.It is among manufacturers, as might be naturally expected, that combination has most developed. It is they who are the first to feel or anticipate the pressure from organised foreign competition. Moreover, the control of the Ministry of Munitions, much as it may have been disliked, and the pressure of war conditions, have broken down much of the old secretiveness, and have induced a greater willingness to co-operate, which in some cases is developing into actual combination. Thus it is likely that at the end of the war one or two groups will be found existing in the British electrical industry, strong enough and complete enough to face the competition of the A.E.G. or the General Electric Company. Similar movements are proceeding in the world of heavy iron and steel. In lesser industries, while co-operation has not progressed far, yet there is an increasing tendency to look kindly on the formation of common selling syndicates, and these, from the point of view of foreign trade, are a good development. Considerable interest has also been attached to the formation of the Federation of British Industries. Loose associations of industries, * indeed, amounting to little more than mutual improvement societies, have long existed, and have as a rule been very ineffective. The Federation goes further, though how far is as yet undetermined. It has been an open question whether the Federation was likely to endure or acquire much influence. It has of late, however, been organising itself systematically, according to the industrial groups into which its members naturally fall, and it now appears increasingly likely that it will maintain an established position. In the Board of Trade itself a similar movement is discernable. One great want of the past has been that of an organised body to which to apply in the case of any industry. The attempt is being made to form these for purposes of representation on, and consultation by, the new proposed Advisory Council of the Board of Trade. It will thus be seen that in the manufacturing world the progress towards greater organisation is clearly marked.It may of course be asked, and with reason, what is contemplated will be the normal condition of affairs in international trade, when hostilities have ceased and the transition period is passed. Are we to look forward to a period of acute and almost hostile competition, not only with the present foes, such as the Germans, but also with, present Allies, such as the United States ? It may be devoutly hoped that this will not be the case. It would be monstrous if the outcome of common sacrifices with the United States in war was to be mutual antagonism in commerce. The two countries ought to work together. There should be no mere competition of British versus American enterprise. It is of course difficult to devise any general forms that such co-operation should take when practical propositions have to be taken in hand. But the endeavour has clearly to be made. So much may be taken for granted. But even so the contemplation of such co-operation is a reason for, and not against, the British side of any such partnership being as well organised and effective as possible.2. General Considerations and Distinctions.In dealing with the problems before them there, are some general considerations and distinctions which commercial attaches and consuls should  have   in mind.. Particular functions will thus be more effectively performed, and their raisons d&apos;etre will be more clearly understood.(a.) Connection of Commerce and Politics.It is now a commonplace that nearly every important piece of foreign business has a political bearing, and, indeed, that in some the political and commercial aspects are both of the highest moment. But it should be again emphasised, lest familiarity should, as so often, breed neglect. It is also necessary to remember that nearly all political developments of a country, domestic as well as external, may have an important influence on commerce and on our own commercial relations with it. Not&apos; only so, but the political and commercial relations between two countries act and react. If political feeling is friendly it is the easier to obtain favourable adjustments of commercial matters. If the commercial influence of one country with another is considerable its political influence will also be increased. It may be that, as in the case of Italy and the United Kingdom, political goodwill between the two nations did not suffice to maintain for this country her leading position in Italian foreign

General Considerations and Distinctions.In dealing with the problems before them there, are some general considerations and distinctions which commercial attaches and consuls should  have   in mind.. Particular functions will thus be more effectively performed, and their raisons d&apos;elre will be more clearly understood.(a.) Connection of Commerce and Politics.It is now a commonplace that nearly every important piece of foreign business has a political bearing, and, indeed, that in some the political and commercial aspects are both of the highest moment. But it should be again emphasised, lest familiarity should, as so often, breed neglect. It is also necessary to remember that nearly all political developments of a country, domestic as well as external, may have an important influence on commerce and on our own commercial relations with it. Not&apos; only so, but the political and commercial relations between two countries act and react. If political feeling is friendly it is the easier to obtain favourable adjustments of commercial matters. If the commercial influence of one country with another is considerable its political influence will also be increased. It may be that, as in the case of Italy and the United Kingdom, political goodwill between the two nations did not suffice to maintain for this country her leading position in Italian foreign
trade. Such goodwill was more than counterbalanced by the geographical and other well-known factors that supervened. This case forms therefore no exception to the rule, and, indeed, the political influence in Italy which German commerce was subsequently able to exert is a striking confirmation of it.It is therefore of the highest importance that Commercial Attaches at British missions abroad should be as fully acquainted as possible with the meaning and progress of political developments, domestic or international, affecting the country in which they are serving. A reciprocal obligation, of course, attaches to the political officers of the mission. In other words, there should be the freest interchange of information and ideas between the two.A word also may be in place here as to the respective estimation in which commercial and political work should be held. It is customary now to say that politics for the future will be largely commercial, and that, therefore, commercial problems in international relations must not be despised. Such a statement is, of course, true so far as it goes. But it also implies an ignorant, if traditional, view. The operations of finance and industry, on their most extended modern scale are so vast, and their ramifications so diverse and intricate, that there are few purely political questions in the international sphere as difficult to master. In other words, the problems they present are as interesting as they are important.(b.) The different Nature of different Countries.From the economic point of view countries differ greatly, and for the individual attache there is a corresponding variation in each case in the comparative importance of their different duties. Broadly speaking, however, countries may be divided into two main classes : (i.) Those which are our competitors in neutral markets.(ii.) Those which it is hoped British enterprise may take the lead in developing.To the first class belong Germany, France, the United States, and Belgium. To the latter the South American Republics, Russia, and China. It must not, of course, be forgotten that those countries which are now our competitors in developing new lands are also themselves among our best customers for manufactured goods. They must not therefore be regarded from the point of view of competitors only. Other countries, again, are only partially developed, and therefore still form a proper field for British endeavour, though at the same time they are competitors with us themselves in some markets or in some commodities. Instances of such countries are Japan, Italy, and (within the British Empire) Canada.While nations therefore differ in their degree of development, yet the broad distinction should always be borne in mind of the competitor that develops and of the area or country that is developed.(c.) Corresponding difference in the Duties of British Representatives.Certain kinds of information are, of course, required in all cases. As has been said, our competitors yet import large quantities of British manufactures. Knowledge, therefore, is everywhere necessary of changes in the customs tariff, in customs or shipping i-egulations, and in the law affecting patents, trade-marks, &amp;c. Legislation affecting company law, or the conduct of industry, or developments in labour conditions, are also of general moment. In the one class of country they affect the field of development for British commerce and enterprise, and in the other the economic capacity of our competitors.Though certain aspects, however, are common to both classes of countries, yet the point of view differs and the nature of the work has to be adjusted accordingly. In the case of countries which are our rivals in the markets of the world, the close organisation of industry is an essential feature of systematic competition. It is, therefore, requisite to know the nature; and extent of industrial developments, whether in the way of kartels or combinations of firms engaged in the same or similar processes of production, or of firms engaged in successive processes, and of any new inventions or scientific developments. The size and nature of such arrangements is of importance, and the extent to which the whole of that section of the industry in the country is brought together, whether in looser or closer combination. The develop-ments in the electrical industry in Germany is only one, though a very typical and important instance of the industrial combinations which have to be arefully followed. [957-158] . H
Questions of finance are equally pertinent. The methods by which it is possible to bring out new companies is of considerable importance. Yet more important are the developments which are likely to continue in the way of extensions and amalgamations of banks, in their connection with industries, and in the promotion of important new undertakings. Pre-war instances of the above tendencies in Germany are to be found throughout, Riesser&apos;s Grossbanken in Deutschland, and Mr. Brand&apos;s monograph on &quot; The Co-ordination of British Industry and Finance,&apos;&apos; and the effect of the war has been rather to accelerate than to retard or alter the process of development.Similarly a close watch must be kept on the whole of the transport side of the question. German export trade was fostered by a regular system of preferential rates by rail and steamer. The fact is well known and the policy was perfectly legitimate. Not so well known nor so legitimate was the German practice of forming a conference with British shipping companies-a conference which included an approved schedule of freights and then of going behind the agreement when possible.Lastly, the relations between manufacturers and merchants should be constantly reviewed, as also the methods by which the merchants do business and the conditions and extent of the credit given to them by financial houses.In those countries, on the other hand, which are being developed, the problem of a field for British commerce and enterprise is predominant. In such a case there are three directions in which development can take place. They are all important, but are quite different and should be clearly distinguished. The lirst is the sale, by direct effort, of British-made goods, from a biscuit to a battleship. The second is the institution of local enterprises under British leadership. The third is the development of the potentialities of the country as a source of supply of raw materials whether animal, vegetable, or mineral. Up till recently, in any public or official consideration of the problem almost exclusive stress has been laid upon the first of these three lines of development. But the others are equally important. Each will be dealt with in order. Certain factors affect all three, factors closely related to the methods employed by competitors, and a short notice of these will also be given.It may be urged that no mention has been made of another development, the issue of loans, State or municipal, which form a field of investment which has been regarded with much favour by the British public. Information as to impending loan issues is always desirable. But it is easy to see that from the point of view of the benefit that may be conferred on British trade and industry7, the security of a contract, State or municipal, is important, but the mere investment of British capital in the loan by which it is defrayed is of little advantage unless the placing of the contract is made a condition in return for the placing of the issue.3. The direct sale.of Goods.Consular reports, as is natural and necessary, have been full of comments on the progress, or lack of progress, as the case may be, of British commerce in any particular locality, or. any particular line. Price, quality, suitability, study of the market, adaptation to local needs or to local taste, quotation in local weights, measures, and currency, the quality of travellers or agents, the nature of the packing and make up of goods, whether for its own sake or for meeting transport or customs regulations, all : these are points well known to Consular officers, as are requests for information as to agencies, representatives and the like. On these there is no need to dilate, except perhaps to emphasise the importance that where criticisms are made, their value will largely depend on precise information being furnished of the facts in respect of which they are made, so that representations may be made to the firms affected, and whose interests may be advantaged by an improvement in the methods employed.Two points, however, deserve special mention. It is neither possible nor desirable that a British Commercial Attache or Consul should be a kind of universal commercial traveller. But his office should be so conducted that the natural course of the Britisher on arriving at the town, should be to call at it, being certain both of welcome and of being given such information as to the locality as will be of value to him. To discharge such a duty adequately, a British representative must not only be cordial and anxious to help. It is also necessary that he should be acquainted with .the mechanism of commerce and exchange, with such questions as tradermarks jn localities where they are of importance, and also with the main features of the manufacture of any articles which are of particular Tjrominence in a given locality, whether by; reason of the quantities imported or the development of a local industry.
Suck acquaintance, however, does not imply so formidable a task as might appear a first sight. What is wanted is not that an official representative should acquire knowledge so expert that he could himself carry on a business, but merely such an acquaintance as to enable him to appreciate the conditions with which he comes in contact. Such a degree of knowledge can probably be acquired by studying memoranda (which are in process of compilation) dealing with particular industries and by supplementing these by visits to industrial centres.Besides such direct means of helping commerce, there are also a number of indirect ways in which very important influences are exerted. Attention should be directed to them, as otherwise being less obvious they are liable to be overlooked. Good personal relations with officials, whether of a central government, of a municipality, or of a corporation, be it a railway or a harbour board, are always important. They serve to facilitate alike, individual transactions, or the adjustment of general regulations. Each item in itself may perhaps be small, and yet the cumulative effect is considerable. There are also many private individuals whose position gives them considerable influence. The local bank manager can give valuable help in ascertaining the character or credit of individuals or firms. So can the newspaper proprietor, or the local manager of the insurance company. As more-over the effect on the minds of local consumers is all part of the problem, importance attaches to notices in the press, whether technical journals, or news articles in the non-technical press, in cases where the success of a British enterprise or commercial development can be judged of sufficient interest to the public to warrant attention.4. Local Enterprises under British Leadership.The number and extent is vast of such enterprises that have been undertaken in the past. The railway development of South America is only an outstanding instance of immense developments that have been undertaken under British leadership. Such development, however, goes through two stages. The first consists principally of the initiation of public utility enterprises, railways, tramways, water-works, electric and gas lighting, harbour construction, and the like. These are all necessary for the production and transport of produce. With the second stage, local industries and factories begin to arise.It is easy to see how the undertaking of local utility schemes is conducive to British prosperity. The direct orders thus created are immense, for constructional material, machinery, rolling stock and the like. Not only so, but the working of such enterprises lead naturally to large orders being placed in this country for renewals and extensions. Indeed, in those cases where the initial enterprise involves the adoption of a certain set of standards, the influence so exerted on the subsequent orders is immense. But if the direct effects are great, so too are the indirect. The construction of such works generally involves the presence, temporary or permanent, of officials of British nationality, whether as managers, engineers, or foremen. These all bring with them British habits, and a preference for British articles of all kinds. A desire is thus indirectly created for British commodities of various kinds, which is the greater in so far as local habits or tastes are affected, and the demand thus extends beyond the purely British residents in the country which is being developed.While the desirability of participation in such enterprises has not been disputed, that of promoting industrial and manufacturing undertakings has been questioned on the ground that it is possible that the articles so produced- may take the place of, or at least compete with, imports from the United Kingdom. It has, however, been definitely recognised that they are not to be discouraged on that account. In countries naturally suitable such a development will occur in any case, and in most is being consciously promoted. It is, therefore, far better that a leading part should be taken by British subjects, and that a full measure should be derived of the same consequential advantages that may accrue as in the case of public utility concerns.For all these purposes, much of the same information is required as for the com-mercial interchange of goods. In addition, legislation affecting the formation and conduct of companies, local bounties on production, facilities in the way of transport or otherwise, and labour conditions, are all matters of moment. It will be remembered also, that while an enterprise may be started under British auspices, much of the required capital may be obtained locally, either at the outset, or by the subsequent, disposal of shares. Such a method sets free British capital for further operations. The prosperity, therefore, of the locality, and the state of the local money market, is of importance.
5. Supplies of Raw Materials.Before the war, systematic steps had already been taken by some of the great industrial corporations to explore the world for sources of supply of raw materials, of which they then endeavoured to acquire the control. The most conspicuous instance was that of mineral oils. In other cases control was obtained through exclusive selling contracts, as in the case of non-ferrous metals on the part of the Metalgesellschaft of Frankfort and its associated interests. The tendency, indeed, had begun for industrial companies, who had sufficient resources, to endeavour to secure their own supplies of raw materials, but it had not gone to any great lengths. But the movement is one of those that has been greatly accelerated by the war, and the phase likely to supervene is one in which definite attempts will be made to dominate, or at least to secure, supplies of material. What is true of the metals and mineral oils is becoming true of rubber and vegetable oils, and the American Meat Trust is an instance of animal products being similarly treated. It will, therefore, be very important to receive reports on new discoveries of minerals, of new processes of dealing with those that are known, of new extensions of cultivation, and of the acquisition of the property in or control of any of these.tj. Foreign Competition and other Considerations affecting Trade Enterprise or RawMaterials in New Countries.It has been already pointed out that it is very necessary for good relations to be maintained both with officials and individuals of the country concerned.As regards our competitors a careful wratch should be maintained, not only as regards their methods in the case of individual trades and the success or failure attending them, but on what may be called the strategy as compared with the tactics of competition. By this is meant the counterpart in the new land to the home organisation in the competitive country. If the home banks are organised, it is likely that they will possess or control subsidiary banks in the new countries. The Banco Aleman Transatlantico or the Orient Bank are instances in point. So, too, shipping and transport agenpies will have local representatives, and the network may include subsidiary industrial corporations, railways operated by an associated group; iusuran companies or associated interests in the press. These and other actions by competitors require study, but in all cases it is very necessary that reports should state the facts on which conclusions are based. Thus it is very generally stated that more liberal credit was given by German banks both to young and enterprising German firms in new countries and indeed to importers generally, and again by German importing houses to local traders. Liberality in giving credit, however, involves either extra risk or greater discrimination as to the persons to whom it is granted, or the conditions under which it is given.. The actual facts, therefore, must be available to the department at home if they are to appeal with any hope of success for similar advantages to be extended in the case of British trade.Great importance will attach too to the work of a British Commercial Attache or Consul among the local British community. It is safe to say, after considerable enquiry, that in nearly every piece of business in a new country in which a German engaged before the war, he had not one motive but two. He was anxious to secure his own success; but the sense of Deutschtum, the endeavour to promote the national advancement, was always present with him. This additional motive led to co-operation betweeen members of a German colony, and in certain cases to a subordination of private interests, such as did not exist in the case of many local British communities. It is not a pleasant reflection that Germans should often have been able both to establish more intimate relations with persons of the local nationality, and at the same time to promote their own national interests more zealously than Englishmen. But the facts seem beyond dispute. After the war a better co-operation among British communities will be necessary. It is not an easy work for representatives of the Government to keep in touch with various and differing social strata, with the British community and with nationals of the country, yet to do so successfully and to form a rallying point for British residents and a natural centre for British voyagers will be a really important duty.7. The Respective Work of Commercial Attaches and Consuls.The object of the foregoing outline of the problem has been to render the objects and meaning of the detailed instructions intelligible in relation to the general policy of the Government, and to make clear the place of such in the scheme as a whole.   But
the rationale of the division of functions between Commercial Attache and Consul is also easy to comprehend. The duties of the Consul are local and are detailed; those of the&quot;Commercial Attache are central and general. Certain kinds of detailed work will fall almost entirely to the Consul to perform, subject, of course, always to the super-vision of the head of the mission exercised through the Commercial Attache. A detailed knowledge of a given district will be beyond a Commercial Attache but will be an essential part of the work of the Consul for the district. He will be expected to take the lead so as far as possible in the resident British community, to welcome and give information to British travellers, and to keep on good terms with the native business and official world. He must also be acquainted with local industrial and commercial conditions and advise British correspondents or visitors accordingly, and for this purpose a uniform system of commercial records is being devised. If his post is at a port it will be for him to know its harbour and other regulations, and any information as to packing, forwarding and other transport arrangements that may be of importance to trade. A most important part of his duties will be to keep a watch on the possible developments of public utility and other enterprises and to give the earliest notice of any which may be in contemplation. So, too, changes in labour conditions in the locality are matters on which he should report, and mineral discoveries or extension of the production of other raw materials will claim his attention.To the Commercial Attache, on the other hand, belong questions of the central Government. Tariff changes, import and export regulations or restrictions, legislation or legal decisions affecting companies, patents, concession rights, countries or industry, all fall within this category. So also does the cultivation of friendly relations with the officials of the central Government. It is, however, clear that no rigid or exclusive line of division can be drawn. A tariff change or a concessions law is important in that it affects individual articles or localities in a greater or less degree. While, therefore, a Commercial Attache is charged with collating information from different Consuls so as to give a comprehensive report, each Consul is clearly interested in the general question in so far as it has a bearing on his particular district. This combination of work between Commercial Attache and Consuls is indispensable * in any case, but is vital in dealing with the problem of organised competition which this country has to face. The extension of Banks, either belonging to or allied with the central financial institutions of our competitors, the elaboration of kartels or trusts in a competing country, or the co-operation in a neutral market of transport arrangements, including conferences, and through rates, all form a complex whole. They must in most cases be studied as a whole by the Commercial Attache, but as their manifestations may be ramified in detail throughout a country, theycan only be so studied if Consuls also understand the nature of the problem and co-operate whole-heartedly. Similarly, a particular district may be singled out for attack by a competitor, but the Consul, how-ever intelligent, may be unable to gauge the situation unless the Commercial Attache can supply knowledge of factors, other than local, and of which he alone is likely to have full cognizance. Co-operation, therefore, between Commercial Attache and Consul is all-important, and the very fact that the work of one is centred at the capital and of the other in a district should be sufficient, in any case that arises, to indicate the nature of the part which each should perform in the joint service.8 The Need for Combined Action.. Dp to this point this memorandum has dealt with methods for meeting systematised foreign competition, and also for assisting the development of British trade and industry on the assumption that it may proceed along the same lines as in the past. But it is to be hoped that British foreign trade also will give proof after the war of a much greater degree of combined effort on the part of British industrialists. It is true that combinations among producers in the Home country will constitute a condition of affairs under which, if no safeguards are introduced, the domestic consumer may be subject to serious danger. Such safeguards will be very necessary. They are, however, a matter of domestic concern. In foreign countries and neutral markets, however, the advantages of such combinations are obvious. Unnecessary waste is avoided. The employment in any particular business of a number of commercial travellers of mediocre capacity might be replaced by a smaller number of men of better attainments, and only gain will be the result. Similarly the competition between British entrepreneurs has often led in the past to difficulties, and has prevented effective support being given by Government representatives to any one of them. Friendly co-opera-tion in the future can obviate this source of weakness. Co-operation between industrial [957] 158 I
aud transport agencies can increase the facility for goods to enter a foreign.market, or for material to he supplied&apos; for a critical contract in some local work of construction that may subsequently lead to other development work being undertaken by British enterprise. Finance too may play an all-important part, whether in the giving of more liberal credit with the discrimination that such liberality involves, or in the securing of opportunities for profitable enterprise at an early stage. Proper notices in the local press and other suitable forms of publicity, the co-operation for British advancement of residents, bankers, agents, newspaper managers, and others, all are factors which can play their part in ensuring success and progress. It may well be that advance in such a direction on the part of British trade may be slow and piecemeal, yet signs are apparent of a readiness for such an advance. In helping it, the influence of Commercial Attaches and Consuls within the limits of their proper functions may be great. It is not for them to carry on trade or industry, or dictate how they should be carried on. But there are some sources of information open to a Government representative which are not available to a private individual, however influential; some possibilities of affording assistance or advice which cannot otherwise be obtained. Again they have no axe to grind and are in a position in which they can be trusted. Gaining that trust, they may be able to clear away doubts and misunderstandings by playing the part of the honest broker, and they may thus restore co-operation and accord, where otherwise distrust and friction would result, to the detriment of British interests as a whole. To attain such a position and achieve this end they will need to show both sympathy and understanding, but if they exhibit these qualities the service which they will render to British foreign trade, and through it, to the country will be of lasting value.June, 1918.

Despatch irom Commercial Counsellor at Rome with Reference to the Minimum Sum Necessary for the Equipment of the Office.(Confidential.)Sir, Rome, January 16, 1919.I HAVE the honour to transmit a report on the financial aspect of the Commercial Department of the Embassy at Rome, since the future utility of this Department, and indeed, the very possibility of its continuance, depends solely on the amount of financial support which may be afforded to it in the future.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland and Sir William Clark will no doubt both remember that, on the occasion of my interview with them in the beginning of May 1918, I expressed the gravest doubts about being able to carry on the Commercial Department upon the sums which had been assigned to me for the purpose. Fully conscious as I was, however, that it was necessary to make a beginning, I said that I would endeavour to meet their wishes, although the attempt must inevitably result in a heavy monetary loss to myself. Practical experience now proves that my statements made at that moment as to the inadequacy of the sums assigned were unfortunately but too correct, and the situation has been rendered much more serious by the heavy artificial fall agreed on since the spring between England and Italy in respect to the exchange. That exchange, when I spoke to the heads of the Overseas Trade Department, stood at 43.   It will be remembered that this sum was particularly dwelt on by Sir Arthur
Steel-Maitland, as a counter-argument to the one which. I was advancing that the sums assigned were too small. I replied that it would he a mistake, in my opinion, to count on the continuance of so high an exchange, and the answer given me was that when it fell, prices would naturally fall also. This, though correct in theory, has not been the case in practice. An arrangement was made shortly after our conversation by which the exchange was brought down in the course of a few weeks to 30, and I have had to run the Department with the pound sterling at that value. In other words, each hundred pounds, as assigned to me on the 1st April as of the value of 4,300 lire, was worth only 3,000 lire when I took over the Department. This loss of practically 30 per cent, has not been counteracted by any fall in wages or in prices. The latter have, in fact, as far as living is concerned, increased since the date of my interview.I will now take, one by one, the items for which certain fixed sums were assigned by the Overseas Department.1. Office Expenses.Under this heading was included in your despatch No. 25572 of the 29th May not only clerical assistance, but office rent, rates and taxes, and office expenses, including stationery. Leaving aside the first item, the others would have of themselves entirely engulfed the amount assigned, and 1 should therefore have found myself in the position of having the offices without any secretaries to put into them ; but, owing to the kindness of Sir Rennell Rodd who has given me offices in the Embassy and saved me the expenses for rent and taxes, and, in consequence of its having been agreed that the considerable item represented by stationery should be also supplied by the Embassy the sum of  600 was left to me for clerical assistance, plus the heating and lighting of our offices. Even for these three items the amount calculated is wholly insufficient if the Commercial Department is to be run on a practical and abiding basis, and not to be supported almost entirely by voluntary contributions in the shape of work kindly done by a succession of friends who may be inclined to give their services gratis for a limited time.The  600, which was worth 25,800 lire when it was assigned in April, had diminished in value to 18,000 lire when I took over the Department, and it was evident from the first that, given the cost of lighting, and especially of heating, it would be quite impossible to provide for a proper staff. Mr. John Henderson, who had given me his valuable services as voluntary assistant for a year and a half, agreed to continue at his post, and his subsistence allowance, being paid entirely by the Foreign Office, does not represent a burden to our balance-sheet. 1 had also the fortune to secure the assistance of Miss Taylor, of whose work I cannot speak too highly, at a salary which, given her qualifications, does not represent an adequate remuneration, under the present conditions of living in Rome. Of this salary.  238 1.0s., considerably more than half (viz.,  142 10-s.) is still continued to her by the Ministry of Labour, who have kindly given her permission to come temporarily to Italy.   To this I have added the sum of  96 per annum.Given the fact that Miss Taylor was free to leave, and might, in fact, have been recalled at any time by the Ministry of Labour, I was bound to budget for the whole of her stipend, though it would have been impossible to have obtained the services of anyone to take her place for the money which she is now receiving.It was then necessary to secure the services of at least two good typists, who, for the purposes of our Department, must be equally at home in English and in Italian, and must also know French well. Girls of this description, even though drawn from quite a low stratum of society, have at the present moment in Italy a value in the commercial market of between 400 and 600 lire a month. Not being able to pay these salaries which can be obtained in the good industrial houses in Milan I have given my daughter  10 a month to continue the most efficient services which she has rendered gratis to me and to the Commercial Department for the last year. I am giving her this small sum purely as an encouragement, since it is not in any way a commercial wage, such as she.could perfectly obtain any day if she were in want of it. I have also promised the same small stipend to Miss Brock, the daughter of the Embassy doctor, as soon as she has done two months&apos; of satisfactory novitiate. I must add the name of Mr. Samuelson to those of my staff. This gentleman affords me valuable assistance, and is working entirely as a volunteer.Coming to the servants of the Department, we should, of course, have a servant separate from those of the Chancery.   This was again impossible, through lack of funds, and I am therefore giving 15 lire a month each to the three Chancery servants [9571-158 K
for cleaning the windows of our offices, looking after the fires, answering the hells, and taking the letters ; and 65 lire a month to a charwoman for cleaning. Our expenses, tabulated, are therefore, at the present moment, as stated below. I have reckoned Miss Taylors salary as paid wholly by us, as any other computation of such an item would be wholly deceptive for the reasons stated above.Staff-Table of Expenses.Mr. Henderson (paid by Foreign Office).

I shall therefore be left with Miss Taylor and the two girl typists to run a Department whose work is increasing daily to such an extent that, even at the present moment, it would be necessary to have the assistance of three men fully versed in their work, besides the three ladies, to cope with what we have in hand. The Commercial Counsellors principal occupation should be that of superintending his Department and writing the despatches, of personally negotiating with the Ministers and Permanent Secretaries various difficult commercial matters with which we have to deal, and of interviewing people who daily come to us for advice and assistance. Under the present circumstances, I am obliged to devote a large part of my day to the dictation of numberless Italian letters which, though of small import, demand an answer for reasons of policy. I have consequently had to neglect my friends at the various Ministries, who have helped me so much in the quick despatch of our business in the past. It may be asked why I did not immediately apply for more help from the Overseas Trade Department. My reason is that our Department, to be efficient, must absolutely be a Department of specialists. Accord-ingly, a man sent out from London would have to pass through a considerable period before he was of any practical use, unless he had exceptional local qualifications, in the shape of the most intimate knowledge of the language and of the people, qualifications which it is hard for anybody not actually on the spot to gauge accurately.The Commercial Counsellor should have at his disposal a sufficient office allowance to be able to pay for the services of at least two men, besides those of his assistant, whose salary is contemplated in the budget, and also of three lady clerks and typists. He can then choose the people most adapted to the work in this country, without having to write to London to ask for more money to pay an extra stipend, since this practice occasions an inevitable delay, during which the best applicants find other employment. I am saying this from practical personal knowledge. There is no reason why the Commercial Counsellor should thoughtlessly expend all the money committed to his charge ; but he should be in the position of a trusted servant and able to spend it if it were necessary. I am firmly convinced that this measure is essential to the future working of the Department.
The sum at the disposal of the Commercial Counsellor at the Embassy in Rome, for clerical assistance and servants, should not be less than the following : Staff-Commercial Counsellor paid separately. Assistant paid separately.              s.   d. Two confidential secretaries at  400 a year ... ...     800One woman clerk at  270 ... ... ... ...    270Two girl typists at  240 ... ... ... ...     480One servant at  57 Charwoman   ...Lighting 117 lire at 25 Heating-2,200 lire at 25 Miscellaneous 300 lire at 255--w57 251,550   0   082   0 04 13 788   0 012   0 01,736 12   7I have put the two secretaries at  400 apiece. I may say that I have been already-asked by two men, who would be fitted for the work, sums of  800 and  700 a year respectively. I again repeat that it might not be necessary to pay the  400 a year, and that the Commercial Counsellor might even be able to get the assistance for nothing, as I have been able to do in the case of Mr. Samuelson, and am hoping to do shortly with Major Fitzgerald, but such purely voluntary assistance should not be counted on as a means of running the Department permanently, and the head of this Department should have a sum at his disposal which he should be able to expend, and should be trusted to act for the best advantage of the nation.2. Postage and Telegrams.&apos; In your letter of the 2nd October, No. D.O.T. 36060, it was decided that the cost of postage and telegrams should not be chargeable to office expenses. I was, therefore, directed to draw bills at three days&apos; sight on the Comptroller-General, Department of Overseas Trade, for the amount expended in each quarter. These bills had to be duly advised and accounts had to be furnished with the advice, giving separate details of the expenditure under each of the two headings, viz., postage and telegrams.These instructions entailed the necessity of engaging an extra servant for the Commercial Department, since the Chancery servants were unable to add to their already heavy work by keeping separate accounts for the considerable amount involved by our postage. Our telegrams, being ciphered by the Chancery, would also have entailed extra labour, if it had been necessary to keep them separate, and considerable confusion would have arisen with the post-office authorities. The Ambassador and the head of the Chancery were of this opinion, and it was therefore arranged that our postage and telegrams should go into one common account and be paid for by the Embassy.3. Travelling and Subsistence.Under this heading, a sum of  300 was assigned. I have as yet no practical experience as to whether this sum will be sufficient or not, and, in fact, this must naturally depend entirely on the amount of journeys which it is necessary for the Commercial Counsellor, or the Assistant, to make in Italy in the course of a year. Up to the present, it has been entirely impossible for me, with my limited staff, to absent myself, even for a day, from Rome. The money has therefore not been drawm upon, except in so far that I have debited to it Miss Taylor&apos;s journey to Italy and the small amount represented by official cabs used for the purposes of the Department.Under this heading, I should call to your notice the fact that it would not be just for me to pay any longer to any of my staff who might be sent to Milan, or to any other of the principal cities, the old subsistence fee of  1 a day, because, under the present conditions of living in Italy, I should be merely condemning the person to pay a certain amount out of his own pocket. His living expenses in any of the principal towns of Italy at the present moment should be reckoned at  2 a dav.
r   . 4. Furnishing Allowance.For this tke sum of  300, or, at the present rate of exchange, about 9,000 lire, bas been set apart. Given the present prices in Home, and the fact that 1 have no time to attend the sale-rooms on the off-chance of picking up furniture second hand at a reasonable cost, I have collected a certain amount of things from various rooms in the Embassy, and am at the present moment dependent on the kindness of my friends for other necessaries. I have added to this a few cheap tables, and have therefore left the furnishing allowance practically intact as yet, on the chance of prices diminishing by the time that the various articles of furniture belonging to private individuals are reclaimed.5. Salaries.(a.) Commercial Counsellor.Salary       ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   1,900Local allowance      ... ... ... ... ... ... ...     100Entertainment allowance      ... ... ... ... ... ...     200Reckoning the Income Tax at 6s. in the pound; bringing down the stipend of  1,500 to  1,050, and not taking into account the entertainment allowance, as being more than wholly absorbed for that purpose, we have the Commercial Counsellor^ income at  1,150 a year. With the prices reigning at present in Home, this sum entails a yearly personal sacrifice on the Commercial Counsellor, should he be a married man, of a sum which may roughly be computed at  2,000 a year, since it is extremely hard for him to live in this town now under  3,000 a year. I have taken the greatest trouble to ascertain my facts. I must first put out of the question, for the moment, the possibility of getting private apartments in Home, since, if they happen to become vacant, the demand for them is so great as to make them prohibitive for moderate means. I have kept my bills in a very second-rate hotel of Rome since I first came to the Embassy as a volunteer in 1914. The hotel was, in fact, so second-rate, that the Ambassador spoke to me on the subject, and I changed into another hotel at the beginning of November this year. The hotel where I am living now- the Palace Hotel is by no means one of the most expensive. It is merely respectable and quiet. I have given up my sitting-room, on account of the expense, and arn therefore obliged to entertain in the public rooms. I have three very small bedrooms, which are among the cheapest in the hotel, and a bathroom ; but though I live without any luxury whatever, my monthly bill is about 5,000 lire. My party is of three, and I am taking that as a typical very small family, presuming that the Commercial Counsellor will almost always be a married man. It will therefore be seen at a glance that, with a bill of about  2,000 a year merely for living, and for living without the slightest luxury, a Commercial Counsellor in Rome, should he be married and have one child only, is obliged to live at very nearly  3,000 a year  allowing a little under  1,000 for clothing himself and his family, and for all other expenses of every description. I am, of course, aware that the stipends given in the Diplomatic Service have never approached a living wage ; but, in the case of the Department of Overseas Trade, we are speaking of a new Department, and of a Department in which it is proposed to take commercial men and men from the Consular Service. The former of these would not look at an employment that represented to them, I do not say a gain, nor a means of putting by money for their children, but rather a large yearly tax on their private incomes. The latter (the Consular Service) is composed almost entirely of men of very small means, or even of no means at all. If, therefore, the Commercial Counsellorship at Home should in the future be held out to these men as the crown of their ambitions, it would certainly be better for them if they never reached that point in their career. The great extra cost of living in Home over living in London, or even in New York, is not as yet generally known. The general opinion is that there will be no perceptible- diminution in prices for a long time ; and it is certain that prices will never again even approach their former level.I have said that the Palace Hotel, where I am living, is by no means one of the most expensive. To be in a position to state this fact, 1 have made the most careful enquiries at the Grand Hotel, the Excelsior, the Hotel Regina, and the Hotel Boston. The two first of these are undoubtedly the best hotels in Rome, and it is here that all our missions, both permanent and temporary, engage their rooms. My figures, there-fore, can be checked against the expenses paid for these missions by the various British Government Departments who send them out, and will, in fact, be probably found to be considerably inferior to those actually paid, since I have calculated on cheap rooms and not on the expensive ones.   Coming next after these hotels, which may be put
down as being in the first category, we have the Hotel Regina, the Hotel Boston, and the Palace Hotel. After these may he mentioned the hotels of the third category, such as the Flora, the Moderno, and the Minerva, which are patronised either by second-rate equivocal society or by commercial travellers, and in which the Commercial Counsellor could not maintain &quot; the style of living and degree of hospitality demanded by the nature of his post,&quot; referred to in the despatch to the Ambassador from the Foreign Office, No. 1174, Commercial, of the-27th August, 1918.I have already stated the price at which I am living in the Palace Hotel. The prices of the Hotel Regina and the Hotel Boston are slightly higher, and would imply, for my party of three, about 2,520 lire extra a year, or, calculating the pound at 30 lire,  84 sterling. The prices at the Grand and the Excelsior are far in excess of these; for the rooms alone, for my small party of three, the Excelsior would ask 42,600 lire for the year, and the Grand 59,850 lire. These two hotels will not even consent to make a pension ; and their prices are, even in comparison to the others, exorbitant.(b.) Assistant to Commercial Counsellor. Salary ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   700Local allowance ... ... ... ... ... ... ...   200This, on the assumption that he pays 6s. Income Tax on the  700, would be  490, plus  200=  690.I am personally of the opinion that it would be extremely hard for the Assistant to live on this sum at the present moment in Rome, unless he somewhat sacrificed the dignity of the Embassy by living in a little room in some very second-rate hotel. He would, of course, have to be unmarried ; but, as he would be naturally a much younger man than the Commercial Counsellor, it might be easier to get an unmarried Assistant. He is, for that reason, certainly far better off than the Commercial Counsellor, whom it will probably be very hard to find unmarried and without a family.it will be remembered, as I have stated before, that when I accepted the post of Commercial Counsellor in Rome, the exchange stood at 43, and that such a basis was actually reckoned on in our calculations. The artificial drop in this exchange to 30 could not be counted on, since it had not yet been made a subject of serious discussion between the Governments. This drop means the loss of 13 points on  1,350, since, for this purpose, the entertainment allowance should also be reckoned. This is equivalent to a diminution of my income by the sum of  585 a year since the month of May, and for this no provision has been made. The consequence is that this sum has been added to the already very heavy loss which I am paying out of my private income.It is hard to think that the present unprecedented and colossally high rate of living in Rome, and indeed in the principal cities of Italy, can be maintained for ever ; but it is in the opinion of all that it would be fatuous to believe that prices will ever return to their pre-war level. In any case we must face the facts as they are, and the real fact is that a very serious initial mistake has been made in the calculation of all the sums to he assigned to the new Commercial Department, as far as Italy is concerned. It is obviously impossible to continue the working of this Department on these lines, unless the first qualification for a Commercial Counsellor should be made that of a considerable private income and his willingness to expend it. for the payment of the larger part of his personal and office expenses. It is absolutely essential that he should have at his disposal a sufficient office allowance on the lines that I have laid down before, and, if the Consular Service and a more extensive information bureau are to come under his Department, this allowance should be increased for the necessary extra staff:I feel that my position in bringing these facts before your notice must necessarily be an ungrateful one ; but I am deeply convinced of the truth of what I have said, and I am sending this report after careful consultation with the Ambassador, who is fully alive to the difficulties I have set before you, and with his full approval. I feel that if these difficulties cannot be remedied, so as to render the carrying on of the Department possible to my successor, I am merely doing a harm to my family in paying out of my private funds a large sum of money yearly for Government purposes, without any permanent advantage to the cause for which I have worked, since the continuance of the Commercial Department at Rome, on its present financial basis, is practically out of the question. I should therefore be most grateful if some answer could be given to me on the subject.I have, &amp;c.E. CAPEL CURE, Commercial Counsellor.
