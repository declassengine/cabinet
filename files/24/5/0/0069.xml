[This Decnaaent is tke Property of His Britannic Majestys Government,jPrinted for the Cabinet.&apos;  February 1920.SECRET. G-266.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAY.Fifth (Supplementary) Report. (Previous Papers G.-252, G.-252 a, G.-254, G.-259, G.-259 a, G.-260.)The Pay of Chaplains.1. Army Chaplains.*1. THE Committee reassembled on Friday, the 6th February, 1920, in order to consider the future rates of pay for Chaplains in the Army,2. It will be recalled that the War Office in July last proposed a scale of pay for these officers commencing at ll. a day on entry, and rising by quinquennial increments of 5s. a day to a. maximum of 21. 10s. a day, reached after thirty years&apos; service-this scale being analogous to that approved for Chaplains in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, in whose case triennial increments of 3*\ a day were granted between the same minimum and maximum rates. - ;At that time, however, the Army Council had not reached a final decision regarding the post-war organisation of the Royal Army Chaplains Department, and a. scheme was under consideration for organising the Department in classes or grades, to . each of which would be assigned a fixed establishment, promotion from any one grade to the next higher to be by selection. This scheme was to replace the old system under which promotion was based upon length of service. In the view of the Army Council a system of payment with increments, based on length of service was entirely contrary to the essential features of the proposed scheme of reorganisation ; and the original proposals as regards pay were accordingly withdrawn.&apos; At the same time, in order not to delay the work of the Committee in settling the rates of pay generally for the Army, approval was given for the assignment to the Department of the amount of money involved in the original proposals, the details of the rates to be settled by the Army Council in consultation with the Treasury.^ This was subsequently approved by the War Cabinet on the 15th August, 1919 (War Cabinet 616, Minute 1).3. A new scale of pay.has been drawn up with the same minimum and maximum rates of 11. a day and 21. 10s. a day respectively, which is estimated to cost the same as the original proposals; but under the new scale increments are based on grading instead of upon length of service, so that it conforms with the new scheme of organisa-tion for the Royal Army Chaplains Department already referred, to, which the Army/ Council have now adopted.* Third Report of the Committee, G. 259, page 4, recommendation 2.\ -f2294]   . - -:.;:/: . - .-&apos; &apos; &quot;
The following table shows this new scale compared.with the rates of pay drawn by regimental officers of equivalent rank :-Proposed Pay of Chaplains,				Pay of Officers of corresponding Rank in Infantry, &amp;c. *			Per diem.

The Secretary of State for War, however, has now intimated that he is unable to regard the rates of pay for. Army Chaplains, shown in the above table, as being satisfactory, and he supports this contention with the argument that to pay the Chaplains so much less than other officers is bound to create an impression that the Army Council set a low estimate on the value of their services, and is likely to result in a failure to obtain in the Royal Army Chaplains Department a full measure of the assistance which it is in their power to render;nor will it succeed in securing for the Army the interest of a class of the community whose support, enjoyed during the war, it is for many reasons very desirable to retain.      ....He therefore proposes that Chaplains should be paid at the same rates as regimental officers of corresponding rank.5. The Committee have carefully considered the Secretary of State for Wars proposal, and they recognise the necessity of obtaining for the service really good and capable men who will devote themselves wholeheartedly to their work. But they feel bound to draw attention to the following arguments in the contrary sense :-(a.) Clergymen as a class are not highly paid, and while the Committee agree that the admitted underpayment of clergymen in civil life forms no.excuse for : similar underpayment of Chaplains in His Majesty&apos;s Services, they feel that . . the rates set out in section 3 above, taken in. conjunction with allowances .      and the benefits of pension and security which Army Chaplains will enjoy, compare very favourably with the remuneration of the average clergyman of good qualifications in an ordinary civilian living.&apos; (bi) It is understood that the Army Chaplain is relieved of a considerable part of the expenditure upon social entertainment which the regimental officer normally has to incur, and which was one of the factors taken into consideration in settling the rates of pay of the latter, (c.) It is expected that in future Chaplains will enter the Army at the age of 26 years, when they will be graded as 4th Class, which corresponds to the rank of Captain.   They may be expected to be promoted to the 3rd, 2nd, and 1st Classes, which correspond to the ranks of Major, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Colonel respectively, at the ages of 35, 40, and 45 years.   On the other hand, regimental officers may in future be expected to attain the rank of Captain, Major, and Lieutenant-Colonel at the ages of 30, 38, and 47 respectively.    If, therefore, Chaplains are paid at the  same rates as regimental officers of corresponding rank, they will receive these rates of pay at a much earlier age than the corresponding regimental officers. (d.) Although in the case of the Army the additional cost of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposal is estimated at only 7,7001., it appears inevitable that its .    :      acceptance in this case must give rise to a claim for similar treatment on -   .       the part of Chaplains in the Royal.Navy and Royal Air Force.   The .   ;      proposed rates shown in section 3 are already more favourable to the ...      individual Army Chaplain than the. rates approved for Chaplains in the other two services, on account of the earlier, ages at which the former will . obtain increments to their pay, so that the proposal to. pay Army Chaplains at the same rates as regimental officers of similar rank will, if accepted, still further accentuate the advantage of the individual Army Chaplain over the \ individual Chaplain of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.
665EndPer diem.   s. d. 10   013 61 10 02   0 02 10 02, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, !\, February IS, 1920. -: : -pvs-Vpv^-       j-36. In face of the above arguments the Committee, are unable, after careful consideration, to accept the proposal to pay Army Chaplains at. the same rates as regimental officers of corresponding rank, and they therefore recommend the rates shown in section 3 above, viz. : -Proposed Pay of Army Chaplains,. 4th Class (on probation) ...      / ....        ...      . ....4th Class (on being accepted for permanent commission, after not less than three years&apos; probationary -. service)    ......... ... ...3rd OIelss        &apos; *. * ..     . *, *.- *. *: * * *.        . *.* *2nd Class ... ...         1st ClaSS ... ... ... ...XI.-Chaplains in the Royal Navy.The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the fact that, when the rates of pay for Chaplains, Royal Navy, were under consideration in June last, proposals were on foot at the same time.for reducing the age of retirement of these officers. As a consequence of the rates of pay which were approved, a Chaplain will only attain his maximum after 30 years&apos;, service, which he may be expected to reach at the age of about 55 years; but, consequent upon the new regulations governing retirement, Chaplains in the future will not remain in the service after this age, so that a Chaplain can never obtain his maximum rate of pay of 21. 10s. a day.The Committee accordingly recommend that any Chaplain who is retained for service in the Royal Navy after the age of 50 years shall automatically receive the maximum rate of 21. 10s. a day.&apos;, H. A. L. FISHER, Chairman.G. Mykddin Evans, Secretary.
