[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1919.WAR CABINET. 68LIQUOR RESTRICTIONS COMMITTEE.Memorandum to the War Cabinet on the Sale of Intoxicants Bill(vide Appendix A to G.246).Note. The Bill purports to deal only with England and Wales. For the application of the same general policy to Scotland and Ireland, separate hut not dissimilar Bills would probably be required.1. Establishment of an Authority (Clause 1).1. The Bills would provide for the establishment of Government authorities (called &quot;Licensing Commissions&quot;) for England and Wales, for Scotland, and for Ireland, to deal specially with the administration of the law relating to licensing and (except for fiscal matters) to the drink trade generally.2. The Commissions are made subject to the control of Ministers, and, through them, of Parliament.3. The powers of the Home Secretary and the Scottish and Irish Secretaries under the present licensing law would be transferred to the Commissions ; these powers are, however, of secondary importance, and the Commissions would rely principally upon new powers to be conferred by the Acts.2. New Restrictive Powers (Clause 2).4. These new powers are based on, and would enable the Commissions to bring into operation, the essential features which have governed the action of the Control Board on its restrictive side, namely, broken hours, with consequential regula-tiori of the hours for off-sales and of the conditions of the distribution of liquor; precautions against the sale of alcohol at excessive strengths ; and the removal of unnecessary temptations or incentives to drink.5. Clause 2 (l).(a) has deliberately been drawn in general terms, and leaves a large discretion to the Commissions, subject always to the control of Ministers responsible to Parliament. The alternative has been considered of reviewing the various restrictions imposed during the war, and specifically taking power in the Bill to continue those which it is thought necessary to continue. But it is undesirable to limit the new Commissions, at the outset, to a cut-and-dried policy, and the vitality which is necessary if their work is to be successful can only be secured by entrusting them with comparatively wide powers.6. Clause 2 (1) (6), which empowers the Commissions, in cases of urgent necessity, at the request of the local Licensing Justices, to require that the business carried on at licensed premises within a particular area shall be carried on under their supervision, is only intended to be exercised in extreme cases, where the ordinary regulations are powerless to prevent grave abuses. A similar power was conferred on the Control Board, who exercised it in only two areas, Glasgow docks and Rosyth. This sub-clause may be energetically contested by the trade.7. Proviso (iii) to clause 2, which enacts that all regulations applicable to the sale or consumption of intoxicants in licensed premises shall be made applicable also to supply or consumption in clubs, will be hotly contested, and may well be the most difficult of all points to secure. At the same time, it is vital to the whole success of the Bill; the war restrictions have applied equally to public-houses and clubs, and any severe restrictions on licensed premises, if not made to apply to clubs also, will merely create an enormous accession to the membership of clubs, and thus become futile.8. The Bill provides for the inspection of clubs by persons authorised by the Commission, e.g., their own inspectors or selected constables.   (Clause 16.)SECRET. G.-245.
3. A7ete Constructive Powers (Clauses 3, 4, and 14).9. It is believed that constructive powers, wisely used, can be of great value in reducing excessive drinking, and that a Bill which contained merely restrictive clauses, with no promise of a constructive policy, would be less likely to receive the support of parliamentary and public opinion.10. The constructive powers taken in the Bill fall under three heads : 1. Extinction of redundant licences (clause 3). 2. Improvement of /public-houses (clause 4). 3. Provision of industrial canteens (clause 14).11. 1 and 2 are two aspects of one policy, which has been termed that of &quot; fewer and better &quot; public-houses.12. The first sub-clause of the clause relating to the extinction of redundant licences goes no further than to confer on the Commission a general power to give greater efficiency and precision to the existing machinery for the reduction of redundancy provided by the 1904 Licensing Act. Under such power a good deal of desirable work could be accomplished. This sub-clause would not be applicable to Scotland or Ireland. The second sub-clause adumbrates, in general terms, a much more comprehensive aud rapid suppression, which would, at auy rate in the first instance, be State-aided; but it does not appropriate any public money for this purpose, and leaves details to be settled by the statute which would be required for such appropriation.13. The clause relating to the improvement of public-houses, with a view to the provision of more facilities for food and recreation as alternatives to drink, of better sanitary accommodation, of more floor space, healthier conditions, and better supervision, purports to do no more than remove the two principal reasons which the trade commonly allege have operated to prevent them from themselves carrying out such improvements, namely (1) that the Licensing Justices have often refused to sanction the necessary structural alterations; and (2) that, since licence-duty is assessed upon the annual value of the structure and such improvements increase such annual value, the owners are unfairly called upon to pay additional licence-duty on improvements which do not in fact add to the drink profits of the house. The clause embodies some of the leading features of Lord Lamington&apos;s recent Bill.14. The attention of the War Cabinet may be directed to the view that the questions arising both on the extinction of redundant licences under a State-aided scheme and upon public-house improvements would be greatly simplified, if the present retail licence duties assessed upon the annual value of the premises could be commuted into an additional duty on beer and spirits. The problem of securing for the State the betterment created by the State-aided extinction of redundant licences would not arise, since the trade of a closed house would be transferred to an adjoining house, and the State&apos;s revenue would be thus maintained; and the fear of incurring additional licence-duty with no increase in the trade in beer and spirits would no longer operate to deter public-house owners from effecting improvements of a desirable kind. It must, however, hs, recognised that such commutation would involve a change in the incidence of present taxation. A public-house or hotel where the trade in beer and spirits is large but the premises are small and of low annual value would, in the result, pay more to the revenue than it does at present; a public-house or hotel possessing commodious premises, and deriving a large proportion of its trade from the sale of food, the sale of wine, the letting of bedrooms, etc., and doing a comparatively small trade in beer and spirits, would pay less.15. Clause 14 relating to canteens, in the first place, enables intoxicants to be sold in them on the authority of a certificate given by the Commission, which in effect places the canteen-manager in the same position as a licensed publican as regards police supervision and amenability to the licensing law. This power, combined with the power to vary the ordinary prescribed drinking hours in special industrial circumstances, which is reserved under proviso (ii) to clause 2 (i), is likely to prove of great value in areas where industry is largely worked on a system of shifts, in meeting the grievances arising when the ordinary drinking hours convenient to the general public are inconvenient or impossible for certain shifts. Secondly, the clause enables the Commission to provide, or promote and assist, canteens. It is believed that the provision of food under convenient conditions and at reasonable rates does a great deal to diminish excessive and injurious drinking, and that such provision has been greatly facilitated by the war-time stimulus to the industrial canteen movement, which
-hould accordingly be continued, and placed in the hands of the Commission. The Labour Party may object in principle to the promotion of canteens, as being a State subsidy to employers.4. Clubs (Clause 6).16. In addition to the provisions already noticed, that restrictions applied to licensed premises shall apply also to clubs, and that clubs are made liable to police inspection, the Bill proposes to place some check on the undue multiplication of clubs.h.-Existing State-purchase Areas (Clause 13).17. The Bill provides for the transfer to the Commissions of the property acquired for the State by the Control Board in the Carlisle, Gretna, Cromarty Firth, and Enfield areas, with the powers necessary to enable the Commission to carry on the existing business and complete the outstanding portions of the Control Board&apos;s work in those areas.6. Miscellaneous Provisions.18. Increased power to Licensing Justices (Clause 5) (under authority of Licensing Commission). It is considered desirable to delegate to local benches the powers set out in clause 5 of the Bill. Extension of powers would probably enhance the Justices&apos; sense of responsibility and initiative, and, incidentally, would add to the parliamentary and public support of the Bill.19. Forfeiture of Licence on Conviction (Clause 8). Under the present law, where a licensee commits a serious offence, his licence cannot be withdrawn till the next annual general licensing meeting, held every February. The clause gives power to shut the house at once.20. Long-pull Prohibited (Clause 10). The sale to a customer of a measure of -drink larger than the measure he orders (which befcre the war was a common trade device for attracting custom) is prohibited by the Control Board. The continuance of this restriction is highly beneficial, and almost non-contentious : it would indeed be welcomed by the majority, and by all the best sections, of trade opinion. The Bill directly prohibits the practice, and does not leave it to the discretion of the Commission, since it is thought better to deal by direct statutory enactment with all points capable of being so treated.21. Credit sales Prohibited (Clause 9). The same observations apply to this restriction.22. Justices&apos; Licence required for new retail Off-licences (Clause 7). The object of this clause is to put a stopj to the evasion of the principle that a Justices&apos; licence is required for the sale of intoxicants in retail quantities by the device of taking out a wholesale licence, which enables the holder to obtain a retail excise-licence as of right on payment of the licence-duty.23. Frequenting Licensed Premises for the purpose of Betting (Clause 11).-At present no offence arises until a person has been actually found betting on licensed premises. Persons frequenting licensed premises for betting purposes are a nuisance, and also a source of danger, to licensees, who would welcome such a protection as is afforded by clause 11.24. Increased Penalties for Drunkenness (Clause 12). The trade entertain a sense of grievance at the disparity between the penalty inflicted on the licensee who permits drunkenness (involving the possible loss of his licence and means of livelihood) and that inflicted on the customer who becomes drunk (a maximum fine of 10s. for the first, and 40s. for subsequent offences). Clause 12 proposes to increase the penalties for simple drunkenness and drunkenness with aggravations, not merely out of consideration for the trade&apos;s opinion, but principally to mark the fact that drunkenness may be something worse than a venial lapse..
