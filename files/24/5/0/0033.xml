G-233.WAR  CABINET.COMMITTEE OF HOME AFFAIRS.Continuance of Emergency Legislation after the Termination of the War.Report^, the Committee of Home Affairs of the War Cabinet by the Continuance of Emergency Legislation Committee, consisting of: &apos;  The Right Hon. Viscount Cave (Chairman). Sir William Ryland Adkins, M.P. . Mr. A. Andrewes Uthwatt. Sir Reginald H. Brade, K.C.B. Sir William Graham Greene, K.C.B. Mr. Francis Jones, C.B. Sir F. F. Liddell,&quot; K.C.B. Mr. Ronald McNeill, M.P. Sir Claud Schuster, C.V.O. *Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, K.C.B. Sir Edward Troup, K.C.B., K.C.V.O.Mr. J. Kemp (Secretary).THIS Committee, which was appointed by the Committee of Home Affairs of the War Cabinet on the 18th December, 1918 (18th meeting of the Committee of Home Affairs, Minute 1), to make detailed proposals showing what Acts, Regula-tions, and Orders of an emergency nature ought, in their opinion, to be continued after the termination of the war, and for how long, and to prepare a Bill giving effect to their recommendations, have agreed to the following Report, and to the draft Bill which accompanies it : 1. The Committee understand that their reference requires them to consider the enactments which temporarily alter the general law to meet the exceptional circumstances of war, and the powers conferred on Government Departments and others to enable them to ensure), the public safety and to organise the national resources for the defence of the &quot;realm; and to report which of those enactments must be continued for a time after the war to meet the scarcely less exceptional circumstances of demobilisation and reconstruction, and which of the powers of Government Departments and others, primarily conferred on them for the purposes of the war, are necessary to enable them to control in the public interest the gradual transition to the normal conditions of peace.2. The Committee therefore examined from this point of view the several emergency statutes and the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and they adopted the following general principles for their guidance in making detailed recommendations: 3. First, that all emergency legislation, and especially all exceptional administrative powers, ought to be dispensed with as .soon as it is possible to do so consistently with safeguarding the national security and public interests of a distinctively emergency character.4. Secondly, that with a very few exceptions it was unnecessary to include in their continuation Bill any Act or Regulation which would continue without legislation for six months after the termination of the war.* In the absence from England of Sir H. Llewellyn Smith his place was taken by Mr. S. J. Chapman, C.B.E.[1272] B
In fixing this period the Committee had regard to the fact that the cessation of hostilities due to the Armistice had already enabled steps to be taken, botli by legislation and otherwise, for attaining the end in view, so that definite progress towards peace conditions might be expected to be made before the actual termination of the war.5. Thirdly, that Acts, Regulations, and Orders which, in the opinion of the Committee, ought to be continued after the termination of the war should be con-tinued by their Bill for a uniform period of twelve months, with power to His Majesty in Council to determine any of them at an earlier date.* The Committee made an exception in the case of certain regulations more especially affecting the liberty or private rights of individuals, and recommend that they should be con-tinued for six months only.6. Upon considering the existing emergency statutes the Committee found that, in addition to those which in their opinion might be allowed to lapse, a considerable number of them should, for reasons of convenience or necessity, be dealt with other-wise than by inclusion in their Continuation Bill.7. First, there are some Acts which at present are continued from year to year by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, and it is convenient that this course should be adhered to so long as Parliament considers it necessary to keep them in force.These Acts are: (1.) &quot; The Fishery Harbours Act, 1915.&quot;(2.) &quot; The Fishery Harbours (Continuation of PoAvers) Act, 1917.&quot; (3.) &quot;The Land Drainage Act, 1914.&quot;8. Secondly, in accordance with the view expressed by Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Com-mittee, with which the Treasury concur, that &quot; financial conditions are continually changing, and opportunities for reconsidering provisions of a temporary nature occur at frequent intervals,&quot; the Committee decided to leave it to the Treasury to take any necessary steps with regard to the continuance of temporary provisions contained in the following Acts: (1.) &quot;The Finance Acts, 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918.&quot; (2.) &quot;The Government War Obligations Acts, 1914-1918.&quot; (3.) &quot; The Income Tax Act, 1918.&quot; (4.) &quot;The War Loan Acts, 1916-1918.&quot;&quot; The War Loan (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1915.&quot;&quot; The War Loan (Trustees) Act, 1915.&quot;9. Finally, there is a considerable number of important Acts dealing with matters which must be provided for after the war, but cannot be met by continuation of the existing legislation. In these cases the Committee agreed that special legislation is required, and indeed such legislation is in most cases already before Parliament, or under consideration by Committees.These Acts are: (1.) &quot; The Aliens Restriction Act, 1914.&quot;Aliens cannot be dealt with in peace time as in time of war, and yet it may well be that exceptional provisions are necessary for a time in the case of aliens who have recently been our enemies in a great war. A Committee has already reported on the position of aliens after the war, and prepared a Bill dealing with this question.(2.) &quot; The Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act, 1914.&quot; &quot; The Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1914.&quot; &quot; The Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1915.&quot; &quot; The Customs (War Powers) Act, 1915.&quot; &quot; The Customs (War Powers) (No. 2) Act, 1915.&quot; &quot; The Customs (War Powers) Act, 1916.&quot;In so far as the prohibition or restriction of imports and exports is necessary after the war proposals are already before Parliament in the Imports and Exports (Temporary Control) Bill. If this Bill passes It will take the place of the first three* In the case of some of the Acts it will not he a question of continuing- the Act for a particular period, but of amending it so as to make it apply to an additional class of cases, but where continuation is required the Committee think the period should, except for special reasons, be uniform.
177oActs above mentioned, and any necessary amendment of the Customs (War Powers) Acts will be consequential.       .(3.) &quot;The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act, 1915.&quot;&quot; The Increase of Rent, &amp;c. (Amendment) Act, 1918.&quot;A Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Hunter has considered the question of the continuation of these Acts, and has just presented a report.(4.) &quot; The Military Service Acts.&quot;&quot; The Roval Marines Acts, 1914 and 1916.&quot; &quot; The Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Act, 1917.&quot;The whole question of thei constitution of the Army, both for temporary pur-poses arising out of the present war and as a permanent Force, is under consideration, and measures will be laid before Parliament dealing with the matter.(5.) &quot; The Munitions of War Act, 1915.&quot;&quot; The Munitions of War (Amendment) Act, 1916.&quot; &quot; The Munitions of War Act, 1917.&quot;The two questions arising under these Acts which probably require legislation are wages awards and the restoration of pre-war practices. They have both been referred to special Committees, and in the case of pre-war practices a Bill has already been prepared.(6.) The National Registration Acts.The general question of establishing a permanent National Register is at present under consideration by a Committee appointed by the Local Government Board, and regard will no doubt be had to their Report when received.(7.) &quot; The Patents. Designs and Trade Marks (Temporary Rules) Acts. 1914 to 1917.&quot;&quot; The Patents and Designs (Partial Suspension) Act, 1915.&quot; &quot; The Trading with the Enemy (Copyright) Act, 1916.&quot;With regard to these matters the Foreign Office take the view, with which the Committee agree, that legislation may be necessary, but cannot be introduced at present, as the nature of it will depend upon the policy with regard to industrial property, such as patents, trade-marks, and copyright, which may be adopted as the basis of agreements with the Allied Powers, and dealt with in the Treaty of Peace.(8.) The Trading with the Enemy Acts.Legislation with regard to this matter must be postponed because, as the Foreign Office points out, the nature of it will depend upon the policy with regard to enemy - debts and pre-war contracts which may be adopted as the basis of agreements between the Allied Powers and dealt with in the Treaty of Peace.(9.) &quot; The Suspensory Act, 1914.&quot;It is clear that Parliament must deal specially, if at all, with &quot; The Government of Ireland Act, 1914,&quot; and &quot; The Welsh Church Act, 1914,&quot; which are suspended by this Act till such date (not later than the end of the war) as may be fixed by Order in Council.10. The Committee carefully considered the remaining Emergency Statutes, and decided which of them ought, in their opinion, to be continued temporarily after the termination of the war. These Acts are included in the Draft Bill, and are set out in Part I of the Appendix of this Report, with reasons for their continuation.11. The Committee then proceeded to consider the Defence of the Realm Acts, and the Regulations made under them.The power to issue Regulations under these Acts is conferred on His Majesty in Council for securing the public safety and the Defence of the Realm during the continuance of the present war, and therefore ceases with the termination of the war. The Committee decided that the power to issue Regulations should not be continued, and in accordance with this decision they have made no provision in their Continua -tion Bill for issuing new Regulations.
12. As to Regulations issued during the war, acording to the Report of Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee, with which the Committee agree, all such Regulations, and the Orders made under them, lapse at the termination of the war. An exception must, however, be made in the case of - Regulations issued in pursuance of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No.3) Act, 1915 (Liquor Control).The Committee have not considered these Regulations because, under the pro-visions of that Act, they may take effect in an area to which they are applied by Order in Council, not only during the war, but also during such period, not exceed-ing twelve months thereafter, as may be declared by the Order to be necessary in view of the conditions connected with the termination of the war.13. The Committee confined themselves to the Defence of the Realm Regulations as now consolidated and revised, and these they considered in detail, and decided which of them ought, in their opinion, to be continued temporarily after the termination of the war.In many cases the Committee do not recommend that a Regulation shall con-tinue in force for the purpose of enabling new Orders to be made, but only for the purpose jof existing Orders made under it. The Regulations and Orders which the Committee recommend shall be continXied are included in the Draft Bill, and are set out in Part II of the Appendix to this Report with reasons for their continuation.It is not considered necessary to give any reason for not recommending the continuance of a Regulation, but one oase ought, perhaps, to be referred to. The Committee were pressed to recommend the continuance of Regulation 2 aaa, which confers power to search for and get petroleum, and to enter on or take possession of land for that purpose. But their attention was drawn to the fact that, when&apos; the Petroleum (Production) Bill was in Committee in the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor stated that this Regulation would remain in force only during the war, and that, unless the Bill passed, there would then be no power to prevent indis-criminate boring. As this might be regarded as an undertaking that the Regulation would be allowed to lapse, the Committee did not recommend its continuance.14. With regard to the trial and punishment of offences, the Committee decided to recommend :  (a) That after the termination of the war all offences under Regulations continuing in force after the war should be tried by the Civil Courts only, except in cases of offenders who are subject to military law or the Naval Discipline Act at the time it is determined that proceedings shall be taken. (&amp;) That the maximum penalties for such offences should be reduced, so that an offender would be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding two years, and on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term: not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding 1007., or both, (c) That proceedings for summary offences in Ireland should be taken before the Resident Magistrates.It w7as also decided that the provisions of the Defence of the Realm. (Food Profits) Act, 1918, with regard to the forfeiture of double the amount of excess profits from overcharging for food, should be kept in force so as to apply to prices fixed by the Food Controller under Regulations continued after the termination of the war.15. With regard to ascertaining the price to be paid for articles requisitioned, and the compensation for acts done under the regulations continued, the Committee recommend that where the manner or principle to be followed is laid down by the regulation itself it shall continue to be followed, and that where no such manner or principle is specified, all claims shall be made to the Defence of the Realm Losses Commission.16. The Committee considered the question of a Statute of Limitations to bar claims against the Crown arising out of, or in connection with, the war, and decided that such an enactment was required.: It was represented to them, however, that provision for this purpose could conveniently be made in a General Act of Indemnity for acts purporting to be. done under the authority of emergency Statutes and Regulations. As the Committee agreed that such an Act was necessary, they decided to recommend that the course proposed should be taken, and that the Act should provide that all claims against the Crown arising out of, or in connection with, the present war should be barred, unless presented within twelve months after&apos; the termination of the war, or within twelve months after the date at which such claims mro5e, whichever should be the longer period.
Summary of Recommendations. The Committee recommend: (1) That the Acts set out ini Part. I of the Appendix to this Report shall be continued for a period of twelve months after the termination of the war, with power to His Majesty in Council to determine any of them at an earlier date.(2.) That, except where otherwise stated, the Regulations and Orders set out in Part II of the Appendix to this Report shall be continued for a period of twelve months after the termination of the war, with power to His Majesty in Council to determine any of them at an earlier date.(3.) That after the termination of the war all offences against Regulations or Orders continuing in force after the war shall be tried by the Civil Courts only, except in cases of offenders who are subject to military law or the Naval Discipline Act at the time it is determined that proceedings shall be taken.(4.) That the maximum penalties for offences under Regulations continuing after the termination of the war shall be reduced so that an offender will be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding two years, and on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding 100Z. or both.(5.) That proceedings for summary offences shall in Ireland be taken before the Resident Magistrates.(6.) That the provisions of the Defence of the Realm (Food Profits) Act, 1918, with regard to the forfeiture of double the amount of excess profits from overcharging for food, shall be made applicable to prices fixed by the Food Controller under Regulations or Orders continued after the termination of the war.(7.) That a general Act of Indemnity shall be passed for acts purporting to be done under the authority of Emergency Acts, Regulations, and Orders, and that this Act shall also provide that all claims against the Crown arising out of or in connection with the wTar shall be barred unless pre-sented within twelve months after the termination of the war, or within twelve months after the date at which such claims arose, whichever is the longer period.A Draft Bill has been prepared, and is submitted along with this report, for the purpose of giving effect to the first six of these recommendations. The Schedules to the Bill may require revision before the actual introduction of the Bill, as recom-mendations largely based on rapidly changing conditions cannot be more than pro-visional.The Committee are much indebted to Mr. Kemp, their Secretary, for the efficient assistance he has given them throughout their enquiry.February 5, 1919. Cave (Chairman).[1272]C
APPENDIX.Part I. Acts to be Continued.1. Army Courts of Inquiry Act, 1916. This Act deals with the Procedure of Courts of Inquiry, and provides for the compulsory attendance as witnesses of persons not subject to military law, and for the inclusion as members of the Court of persons who are not officers. The War Office explain that Courts of Inquiry will probably be resorted to as the most suitable and expeditious means of investigating many matters which will arise in the process of winding up affairs of the Army during demobilisation. Many of the officers and soldiers whose presence as witnesses will be required at such inquiries may have been demobilised before the Court is assembled and be no longer subject to military law, so that it will not be possible to compel their attendance. They therefore recommend that the power to summon civilian witnesses should be continued during demobilisation, but should only apply to such persons as have been subject to military law, or have been in the employment of the War Department during the war.   The Committee accept this view7.2. Clubs (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1915. This Act empowers a Secretary of State to order clubs to be closed during specified hours, and prohibits the use of clubs by prostitutes and gamesters. It enables illegal clubs to be closed, and provides for the registration of new clubs. The Act has been found to be of great use during the war, and on the strong representations of the Home Office the Committee recommend its continuance.3. Courts Emergency Powers Acts, 1914 to 1917. The main object of the principal Act (1914) is to prevent the enforcement of the payment of money due under contracts made before tjie wrar until the leave of the Court has been obtained upon an application made by the creditor. Upon such an application the Court has power to refuse to allow payment to be enforced if satisfied that the debtor cannot pay immediately owing to causes attributable to the war.The first Act of 1916 relates only to officers and men of His Majesty&apos;s Forces. It extends in their case the relief given by the principal Act to contracts made before the 11th April, 1916 (afterwards extended by the Act of-1917 to contracts made before the officer or man has joined the Forces); it enables the Court to exercise its discretionary power,, although the inability to pay is not due to causes attributable to the war; and it also confers power on the Court to determine tenancies.The second Act of 1916 provides, inter alia, that a right to light shall not be acquired by prescription over a site on which the owner is unable to build on account of the war.The Act of 1917 gives the Court power to suspend or annul, or stay proceedings for enforcing contracts for building, or the supply of materials for building, made before the war, and also any contract whatsoever if satisfied that it cannot be per formed without hardship owing to restrictions, &amp;c, imposed for the defence of the realm, or to interference with property by the Crown.The Committee had not sufficient evidence to enable them to judge how far the continuance of protection of this kind was necessary after the war, but it was clear that the sudden expiry of such provisions might cause great hardship. Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee expressed the opinion that the conditions which made these Acts necessary may continue for a much longer period than six months after the war, when the Acts will expire, and that the power to give protection must be prolonged for a substantial period. Having regard to this opinion, and to the fact that the powers are purely discretionary and are exercised by those who have had the widest experi-ence of the working of the Acts, the Committee decided to recommend continuance of the main protective provisions of the Acts.4. Ecclesiastical Services (Omission on Account of War) Act, 1917. This Act-provides that there shall be no liability or penalty on account of omission of ecclesi-astical services if the omission is authorised by the Bishop of the diocese. The power to give an authority expires three months after the war. Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Com-mittee considered this period too short, as a chaplain might be detained longer during demobilisation.   The Committee agree, and recommend continuance.5. The Evidence Amendment Act, 1915. Section 1 of this Act provides for the reading of the depositions of witnesses who cannot attend, because engaged in naval qr military services, at the trial during the war of a person accused of an indictable offence.   Section 2 enables statements of witnesses at preliminary investigations to be
given in evidence at the trial of a person for an offence against any regulation made under the Defence of the Realm Acts. Section 3 substitutes imprisonment for sentence of death in any case where a person has been convicted upon evidence solely contained in depositions admitted under the powers conferred by section 1. Section 4 provides that a certificate of a Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Admiralty or Army Council shall for the purposes of section 1 be conclusive evidence that a witness cannot attend because engaged on naval or military service. Section 5 is a permanent amendment of the law of evidence. The Committee&quot; agreeing with Mr. Justice Atkims Committee, recommend that section 1 be continued. Sections 3 and 4 will apply to section 1 as continued. Section 2 will not apply.6. Execution of Trusts (War Facilities) Act, 1914, and Amendment Act, 1915.  These Acts empower trustees engaged on war service in the present war to delegate the execution of trusts by power of attorney. The power to delegate is limited to the period for which the trustee is engaged on war service and a period of one month thereafter. A period1 of war service includes any period during which a trustee being abroad is, for any reason connected with the present war, unable to return home. The Committee were of opinion that there were cases in which the period allowed might be too short, and they recommend that it be extended, but as regards existing powers of attorney only.7. Friendly Societies Act, 1916. This Act empowers the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies to defer valuations under the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and confers other powers upon him. The power to defer valuations is limited to valua-tions due during the present war or within six months thereafter. The Chief Registrar points out that the date at which, valuations are due is the 31st December, and it would be convenient to have power to defer valuations which fall due on the 31st December after the termination of the war on whatever day in the year the w.w terminates. Under, the present Act the Chief Registrar would not have this power if the war terminated between the 1st January and the 30th June. As it is not improbable that this contingency may occur, the Committee recommend that section 1 of the Act be continued.8. Injuries in War (Compensation) Acts, 1914 and 1915. These Acts make provision for pensions and other allowances to civilians and dependents of civilians killed or injured in connection with warlike operations while employed afloat; or employed on shore outside the United Kingdom in military warlike operations; or in connection with the laying and repairing of submarine cables, &amp;c, during the present war. The Admiralty and the Minister of Pensions ask that these Acts should be extended to the cases of persons injured while employed afloat after the war under conditions rendered hazardous by acts done during the war, e.g., clearing the sea of mines, and the Committee agree. It appears unnecessary to continue the provisions which refer to persons employed on shore, and the Act of 1915 does not.require to be continued &quot;because it already applies to injuries and disablement &quot; attributable to causes arising out of the operations of the present war.&quot; The continuation is there-fore limited to the first Act of 1914, as amended by section 2 of the second Act of that year.9. Isle of Man (War Legislation) Act, 1914. This Act enables Orders in Council to be made extending to the Isle of Man emergency Acts passed during the present war. So long as emergency powers remain in force the power&apos; of extending them to the Isle of Man ought to continue. The continuance is effected by clause 5 of the Bill.10. Local Authorities (Disqualifications Relief) Act, 1914. This Act extends the relief granted by the members of Local Authorities Relief Act, 1900, to all members of His Majesty&apos;s naval and militairy forces, and prevents any disqualifica-tions for membership of a local authority by reason of absence on naval or military service or through being employed in connection with naval or military operations during the present war. Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee recommend that the relief should be extended so as to apply to absence, not only during the war, but thereafter until final discharge. The Committee agree, and recommend the continuance of the Act.11. Local Government (Allotments and Land Cultivation) (Ireland) Act, 1917.  This Act empowers the Local Government Board for Ireland to make Orders authorising district councils to provide allotments and supply agricultural requisites. As Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee say, it is doubtful whether the powers given by Orders made under this Act do not cease with the termination of the war, and the Committee is of opinion that they should continue, they recommend that the doubt should be removed.
12. Naval Discipline Act, 1866, Sections 57a and 90. Section 57a provides for the constitution of disciplinary Courts for the trial of officers for disciplinary offences in time of war, and section 90 provides for the enforcement of discipline in auxiliary vessels in time of war. It is clear that the enforcement of discipline on auxiliary vessels must be provided for so long as such vessels are retained by the Admiralty; and as to section 57a, the Admiralty regard the disciplinary Courts provided for by the section as necessary in peace time. The Committee therefore recommend that both sections should be continued for twelve months, which will probably be long enough in the case of section 90, and will give the Admiralty time to obtain permanent amendment of section 57a, if Parliament approves of their proposal.13. Naval Discipline (Delegation of Powers) Acts, 1916 and 1917.-These Acts enable the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, when authorised by the Admiralty, to delegate his powers in relation to courts-martial and disciplinary courts, and the carrying-out of sentences passed thereat, to flag officers in command of squadrons forming part of the  eet. The Committee are of opinion that this delegation of powers is necessary amd proper in the case of a very large fleet con-taining many officers of high rank.14. Navy and Marines (Wills) Act, 1914. This Act relaxes temporarily the provisions of the Navy and Marines (Wills) Acts, 1865 and 1897, in the case of seamen or marines dying during or in consequence of the present war, and enables the Admiralty to hand over money and effects to persons claiming under wills not made in conformity with these Acts. The Committee decided that the reasons which led Parliament to pass this Act for the time of the war^ apply equally to the period of demobilisation.15. Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, Section 16. Under this section it is lawful for a Secretary of State, when His Majesty by Order in Council declares that an emergency has arisen in which it is expedient for the public service that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have control over the railroads of the United Kingdom, or any of them, by warrant under his hand to take possession in the name or on behalf of His Majesty of any railroad in the United Kingdom and of the plant belonging to it. The railways of the United Kingdom have been taken possession of by warrants under this section which are continued from week to week. As it is necessary that the railways should continue under State control during demobilisation at any rate, the Committee recommend that the emergency shall be deemed to continue for twelve months after the war.16. Special Acts (Extension of Time) Act, 1915. This Act gives power to Government Departments to extend the time limited for the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under Special Acts. Applications may only be made during the war and six months thereafter. It is not suggested that so far as the purchase of land is concerned an extension of time should be granted, but the Local Government Board represented that further extensions might be needed in cases in which the period is fixed for other purposes, such as the completion of works, because the execution of works may, in view of financial and other considerations, be very difficult immediately after the war. Although the time within which applications may be made already extends to six months after the war, the Committee thought it would be convenient in this case to make an exception to their general rule, and recommend the extension of the period to twelve months.17. Special Constables Act, 1914. This Act enables His Majesty, by Order in Council, to make regulations with respect to the appointment and position of special constables appointed during the present war under the Special Constables Act, 1831, or section 196 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. Without this Act special constables cannot be appointed except when a tumult, riot, or felony has taken place or is immediately apprehended. The powers of the Act have been found useful, and the Home Office say the Act and the Orders made under it have effected&apos; improvements in the law which should be made permanent. As the Act expires at the termination of the war, the Committee recommend continuance to give an opportunity for legislation.18. Summer Time Act, 1916. This Act provides for the alteration of time in the summer months of 1916, and gives power to His Majesty in any subsequent year, by Order in Council made during the present war, to declare the Act to be in force for that year and to fix the period for alteration of time. The Committee are of ooinion that this power should be continued so as to give Parliament time to consider the question of permanent legislation.
Part II. Regulations and Orders to be Continued.Regulation 2 o.-Enables the Commissioners of Works to take possession of any land, including buildings thereon, which may be required by the Minister 01 Pensions&apos;for accommodation of staff and for carrying into effect the Naval and Military War Pensions Act, 1915; and which may be required by the Minister of Labour for accommodation of staff and for employment exchanges. The Com-mittee recommend continuance so far as relates to the Ministry of Pensions.Regulation 2 b.-Power to take possession of war materials, food, forage, and stores. The powers of this regulation are necessary if control over materials is to be continued during demobilisation. The Committee were satisfied that some measure of control must be continued, but they decided that in the case of the Admiralty, the Army Council, the Air Ministry, and the Ministry of Munitions, the powers of this regulation should be subject to the observance of the following principles : 1. That only the industries or materials subject at the passing of the Act to special measures of control should be affected.2. That the administration of such control should be directed towards the object of bringing it to an end at the earliest possible moment.3. That as the main purposes of continuing the control will be to tide over the difficult period of transition, the departments should administer the necessary measures of control of those trades and industries in as close co-operation as possible with the trade interests concerned.In the case of the Food Controller the first of these principles, limiting the control to industries or materials subject to control at the passing of the Act, should not apply.Regulation 2 bb. Power to vary sub-contracts for the supply of goods or ser-vices. The Committee do not recommend that this power should be continued, but where a certificate has already been issued that the profit under a sub-contract is unreasonable or excessive, the Committee see no reason to interfere, and they recommend that the regulation should continue to apply in such cases.Regulation 2 e -Power to regulate, restrict, or prohibit manufacture and dealings in war material, food, forage, or stores, and to require sale, repair, and delivery to be made upon fixed conditions. This regulation is an essential part of the machinery of control, and the Committee recommend that it should be con-tinued subject to the observance of the principles stated under regulation 2b. In the case of the Food Controller alone there will be no limitation to articles under control at the passing of the Act.Regulation 2 ee. Power to regulate the collection, disposal, treatment, destruction, sale, purchase, delivery or storage of waste, and to define the articles to be regarded as waste. This regulation has only been in existence for a few months. It is intended to prevent waste which was taking place on a large scale. The Committee recommend, continuance.Regulations 2 f to 2 j. For the purpose of encouraging or maintaining the food supply of the country, these regulations give power to regulate the production and sale, and to fix the maximum and minimum prices for food supply purposes, and to take over stocks (2 f) ; to require returns (2 g) ; to take possession of premises with plant in which food is adapted for use (2 gg (2) ) ; to regulate or restrict the; work in such factories (2 gg(3) ); to hold enquiries (2 h); to arrange with any other Government Department for the exercise by them of the Food Con-trolleys powers under 2 b, 2 f, 2 g, 2 h, and 7, with respect to any particular article, and to confer and impose powers and duties upon local authorities in con-nection with the enforcement of regulations (2 j).As it is necessary that food supplies should be controlled until the period of food shortage is past, and as the existing regulations practically constitute a code gradually evolved to meet the requirements.of the case, the Committee recommend the continuance of them all.Regulation 2 jj. The like powers as are conferred by regulations 2 b, 2 f to 2 j, and 7, upon the Food Controller are conferred by this regulation upon the Board of Trade as respects any article of commerce, not being an article of food, where necessary for the purpose of encouraging, maintaining, or regulating the supply of any such article required by the public, or otherwise required for the public safety or the defence of the realm.[1272] d
fBy paragraph (3) the Board of Trade is given the like powers with regard to timber as the Army Council has under Regulation 2 e and 15 c. Under 2 j as applied by 2 jj the&quot; Board of Trade has the same powers as the Food Controller of making arrangements with any other Government Department, including that of the Food Controller, for the exercise by that Department of its powers with respect to any particular article, and it has in fact made arrangements with the Food Controller with regard to a number of articles of commerce other than food.The Committee decided that Regulation 2 jj should be continued,, but limited in the case of commodities controlled by the Board of Trade to the following list: Wool and hides and articles produced therefrom,Egyptian cotton,Timber,Paper and paper-making material,Matches,Petrol,Coal,Hay&apos; and straw,and limited in the case of commodities controlled by the Food Controller by arrangement, to spirits only.Regulation 2 jjj. Power to ensure the provision and maintenance of an efficient system of road transport by regulating the use of road transport, taking possession of horses and vehicles, regulating the priority in which goods are carried, &amp;c. Owing to the pressure likely to be exerted upon transport facilities generally during demobilisation the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 2 l. Powers of entry on and cultivation of land for the main-tenance of. food supply. As regards England and Scotland the powers under this regulation cease when Part IV of the Corn Production Act, 1917, comes into operation at the termination of the war. But in Ireland there is no permanent allotments legislation. The power to provide allotments there is derived solely from the Local Government (Allotments and Land Cultivation) (Ireland) Act. and this regulation. The Committee have already recommended the continuance of that Act, and, at the request of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, they recommend that the regulation shall also continue, so far as relates to Ireland.Regulation 2 m. Powers with regard to land not cultivated so as to increase the food supply. The Committee recommend that this regulation shall continue except clause (2), aud the powers conferred by clause (1) which are terminated by the coming into operation of Part IV of the Corn Production Act, 1917, that is to say, (a), (d), (e), (ee), (eee), (/), (g), and (o), and the powers conferred by (j) and (n), which are covered by the Land Drainage Act, 1918.Regulation 2 n. Makes it a summary offence to damage growing crops and hedges and fences on any agricultural land, or to trespass on land provided for use as allotments or field gardens in which there are growing crops. In the latter case the Committee recommend continuance for six months.Regulation 2 o. Confers powers with a view to maintaining the stock of pigs in the, country. In the interest of food supply the Committee recommend the continuance of this regulation, but only so as to authorise what is at present being done under it.Regulation 2 q. Power to prevent damage to crops by deer in Scotland. Pending the report of a Committee, the Scottish Office ask for continuance of this power, and the Committee recommend it provisionally.Regulations 2 u, 2 uu, and 2 uuu. Powers for the development of eel fisheries and the maintenance of other fisheries in England and Wales. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries attach great importance to these powers, which they hope will be made permanent, and the Committee recommend their continuance.Regulations 5 a, 5 b, and 5 c. Power to the Admiralty, Army Council, and Ministry of Munitions to take over and control the maintenance of highways, and to facilitate the use of road stone quarries near the roads to be maintained, and to prevent congestion of traffic or excessive damage by regulating the haulage of timber and other heavy materials. In view of the importance of maintaining high-ways during demobilisation, and especially before labour is easily obtainable by local authorities, the Committee recommend the continuance of these regulations!
*   181Regulation 6 a. Power to the Home Secretary to exempt factories from the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, when satisfied that from circumstances arising out of the war exemption is necessary to secure the carrying on of work, and can be granted without detriment to the national interests. This power is carefully exercised by a Secretary of State, and the Committee recommend its continuance.Regulation 6 b. Power to a Secretary of State to grant licences for factories and magazines for gunpowder and explosives without the consent of local authori-ties required by the Explosives Act, 1875. The Committee do not recommend that the regulation should- be continued, except to the extent of giving power to keep existing licences in force.Regulation 7. Under this regulation the Admiralty, Army Council, Air Council, Minister of Munitions, the Food Controller (as regards factories and workshops dealing with food), the Board of Trade (as regards articles of commerce -other than food), and the Stationery Office, have power to requisition the output of factories and workshops manufacturing arms, ammunition, food, forage, cloth-ing, equipment, or stores of any description, or any articles required for the production thereof.The powers conferred by this regulation are an essential and important part of the system of control of materials, and so long as control is necessary these powers must be to some extent continued. The Committee recommend continu-ance, but subject to the observance of the principles stated above under Regulation 2 b.Regulation 7 b. Confers power on the Board of Trade to take possession of private owners&apos; waggons on the railways, to enforce prompt loading and unloading, to curtail statutory regulations as-to the running of trains and fares, and to prescribe conditions under wljich tickets are to be issued.These powers appear to be necessary so long as the railways are under State control, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 7 bb. Confers power on the Board of Trade to permit the increase of the statutory charges of carriers between Great Britain and Ireland. These: powers are necessary until it can be ascertained what the normal level of prices will be. The Board of&quot; Trade say this may not be for three or four years after the war. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulations 7 c, 7 d, 7 e, together with 27 (d), 30 e, 30 ee, 30 eee, 41 b, 41 d, and 41 dd. -These regulations enable the Treasury to exercise control over exchange and currency. The Treasury say it will certainly be necessary to retain the powers given by regulations 27 (d), 30 e, 30 ee, and 41 d. It will probably be necessary to retain 7 c, 7 d, 7 e, and 30 eee. It may be possible to dispense with 41 b and 41 dd, but a final decision must be postponed for a little time longer. In these circumstances the Committee recommend the continuance of all these regulations except 41 b and 41 dd.Regulation 8. Empowers the Admiralty, the Army Council, and the Minister of Munitions.to take possession of any factory or workshop or the plant belonging thereto, without taking over the factory or workshop itself, and to use the same as may be considered necessary. The Committee do not recommend the continuance of the powers given by this regulation, but it is impossible to allow existing orders under it to lapse without interfering unduly with the regular diversion to peace conditions of industries utilised during the war for, the production of war material, and the Committee, therefore, recommend continuance for the purposes of existing orders made under the regulation.Regulation 8 a. Confers power upon the same departments to require work in any factory or workshop to be done in accordance with directions, so as to make it as useful as possible for the production of war material; to regulate the work in any factory, or the engagement of workmen therein, so as to maintain or increase.the production of munitions in other factories. The Committee do not recommend the continuance of the regulation generally, but as the Ministry of Munitions sa\ it is practically necessary as a basis for priority directions, they recommend continuance only for the purposes of the Priority of Work Order or any modinca-tions thereof, they feel bound to recommend continuance for the purposes of existing orders under it.Regulation 8 aa. Confers power on the Director-General of National Service after consultation with the Government Departments concerned, to prohibit or restrict persons from establishing any new retail trade or business without a licence. The original object of this regulation was to make the best use of all persons able to work in any industry, occupation, or service, but the main object of continuing it at
present is to ensure that soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; dependents who have businesses should not be unfairly prejudiced by the opening of new premises of a competitive nature. The Committee recommend continuance for six months.Regulations 8 c and 8 cc. These regulations confer power upon Government Departments to authorise and require the use of registered designs, and to require particulars of inventions or secret processes to be communicated. The power of giving or issuing new authorities, requirements, or orders under these regulations has already beenl revoked, but the Committee think it is necessary to recommend continuance for the purposes of existing authorities, requirements, and orders under them.Regulation 8 n.-Under this regulation Government Departments have power to &apos; require a supply of water, light, heat, or power to any factory, building, camp, or other premises used by them. Section 7 of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1916, will provide for most cases after the war, but the Committee were advised that same cases where such a supply is required would not come within the section, and to meet these cases they recommend the continuance where necessary of existing requisitions made under this regulation.Regulation 8 d.d. Confers power on the.Local Government Board to grant a licence to drive a motor car, other than a heavy motor or a public service vehicle, to a male person between 16 and 17 years of age. The Committee recommend the continu-ance of existing licences only. It would be a hardship to cancel them, and the holders will soon be of an age to come under the general law.Regulation 8 ee. This is the regulation under which the Stationery Office obtains its existing powers. It authorises the Treasury to apply by order to the Stationery Office the provisions of (among others) regulations 2 b, 2 bb, 7, 8, 8 a, and 15 c. The Committee recommend that, so far as these regulations are continued for other Departments, the power of the Treasury under this regulation to apply them to the Stationery Office should continue.Regulation 9 a. Confers power on a Secretary of State and also upon mayors, magistrates, and chief officers of police to prohibit the holding of meetings or pro-cessions. The Committee recommend the continuance of this regulation for sir months, mainly on the grounds that the demands on the police will be heavy during demobilisation, and that, under the exceptional conditions which will continue to prevail, disturbances may often be prevented by the exercise of the powers it confers.Regulation 9 aa, Confers power to prohibit meetings, processions, fairs, and markets, the wearing of uniforms, the carrying of arms, &amp;c., in areas in which section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) Act, 1915, is suspended. The Com-mittee recommend continuance in Ireland.Regulation 9 e. Confers power to prohibit drilling in specified areas by persons other than members of His Majesty&apos;s forces or constables. On the strong repre-sentation of the Irish Office the Committee recommend continuance in Ireland.Regulation 9 g. Confers power to take possession of coal mines and direct their management and user. The Board of Trade are in possession of the coal mines under this regulation, and they ask for continuance during the coal shortage. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 9 gg. Confers power to take possession of metalliferous and other mines, not being coal mines, and to direct their management and user. Under this regulation the Ministry of Munitions is in possession of all the iron ore mines in Cumberland and Lancaster, and has control over materials which can only be gradually given up. The Committee recommend continuance -for the purpose of existing orders.Regulation 9 ggg. Under this regulation the Board of Trade have power to authorise the working of seams of coal, umvorked, wdiich are adjacent to open mines. The Committee recommend continuance so far as relates to any seams with respect to which existing authorities have been given.Regulation 9 h. Confers-power upon the Board of Trade to take possession of any canal and give directions as to its management and user.During the period of pressure upon transport facilities generally, the powers of this regulation appear to be necessary, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 10. Confers power to require licensed premises within a specified area to be closed, either altogether or subject to exceptions as to hours and purposes for which they may be open, and to prevent treating. The Committee are satisfied that for the. maintenance of public order and discipline during demobilisation the liquor traffic must be controlled, and they recommend that this regulation, together -
with regulations 10 a and 10 c, should be continued for six months, in addition to the regulations made in pursuance of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1915, which will apply to most parts of the country. This wdll enable control to be exercised by naval and military authorities over licensed premises, intoxicants, and places of public entertainment.Regulation 10 a. Confers power to prohibit the introduction of intoxicants into dock premises.   The Committee recommend continuance for six months.Regulation 10 b. Confers .power on a Secretary of State to restrict, either generality or in particular areas, the hours in the evening during which any class of trade or business may be carried on. The Committee recommend continuance for six months. The two members oif the Committee who are Members of the House of Commons dissented.Regulation 10 c. Confers power to close places of public entertainment. The Committee recommend continuance for six months. .Regulation 11. Confers power on a Secretary of State and the Secretary for Scotland to require the extinguishment of lights, and to require lamps to be carried by vehicles in specified areas and during specified hours.This latter power appears to be required in the interests of safety so long as there is a. shortage of coal for making gas and electric light. The Committee recom-mend continuance.r Regulation 11 a. Confers power on the Minister of Munitions to restrict the hours of lighting and the supply of electricity in certain areas. The Committee recommend continuance in the interests of economy in the use of coal.Regulation 12 n. Confers power on&apos; a Secretary of State to prohibit or restrict in any area whistling or the making of other noises calculated to disturb patients in the hospitals.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 13 a. Confers power to exclude from places where bodies of His Majesty&apos;s Forces or the Forces of any of His Majesty&apos;s Allies are assembled persons who have been convicted of offences of an immoral nature. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 14. Confers power to control the residence and movements of per-sons suspected of acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety, and to remove them from specified areas. For the prevention of espionage and the control of aliens, the Committee regard it as necessary that existing orders under this regulation, together with orders under regulation 14 b, which imposes restrictions on and authorises the internment of persons of hostile origin or associations, as necessary during demobi-lisation, in addition to the powers which will be conferred by the Official Secrets -Bill, at present before Parliament, if it should become law. They recommend continuance for six months.Regulation 14 a. Confers power to control traffic to outlying islands. The Admiralty say they require this power so long as German ships are interned at Scapa.   The Committee recommend continuance..Regulation 14 b. Confers power to intern or control the residence of persons of hostile origin or associations. It has already been referred to under regulation 14. The Committee recommend continuance for six months for the purposes of existing orders, which will enable persons already interned to be kept in internment.Regulation 14 c. Prohibition of landing or embarking at any port in the United Kingdom without a passport.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 14 g. Imposes restrictions on embarkation at any port in the United Kingdom for a place outside the United Kingdom without permission.The regulation has been revoked so far as regards persons going to the British Dominions. For the rest it is regarded as necessary for the supervision of aliens, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 14 h. Prohibits any person who is not a natural-born British subject from assuming or using any name other than that by which he was ordinarily known at the commencement of the war. The Committee see no reason for relaxing the provisions of this regulation, and recommend continuance.Regulation 15 c. Confers power to require particulars as to businesses con-nected with war material, food, forage, and stores. It is under this regulation that the costs of manufacturing are at present investigated, and it appe rs necessary that this power should continue so long as the control of materials exists. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 17. Suspends the restriction on the powrer to make bye-laws imposed by the Military Lands Acts, and extends the power to land taken possession of under the regulations. It is necessary so &quot;long as land is in the possession of Departments under the regulations.   The Committee recommend continuance.[1279] E
Regulation 27. Prohibits the spreading of false reports and making false state-re ents, or spreading reports or making statements intended or likely to cause dis-affection to His Majesty or likely to prejudice recruiting, or intended or likely to undermine public confidence in any bank or currency notes which are legal tender, or to prejudice the success of any financial measures taken by the Government with a view to the prosecution of the war, and also prohibits the production of any rjerforiu-ance on any stage or the exhibition of any picture or cinematograph film intended or likely to cause such disaffection, interference, or prejudice as aforesaid. The Com-mittee recommend continuance for six months, with the exception of paragraph (a).Regulation 27 b. Confers power to prohibit the importation of publications contravening the provisions of regulation 27. The Committee recommend continu-ance for six months.Regulation 28 a. The Admiralty attach great importance to the continuance of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this regulation, which confers power to prohibit persons from being, without permission, in or on land or premises in the occupation of His Majesty or any Government Department, or any quay, wharf, dock, &amp;c, or any ship lying, in or alongside the same.   The Committee agree, and recommend continuance.Regulation 29 b. Deals with the protection of special military areas, and the Committee recommend continuance, as far as relates to Ireland.Regulation 30. Enables orders to be made prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transfer, or disposal of firearms, ammunition, or explosives within an area specified in the order. The question of the control of the traffic in arms is under consideration, and permanent legislation may be required, but during demobilisation, when such large quantities of arms and ammunition will be in the hands of so many persons, it is necessary to retain powers of control. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 30 a. Confers power to prohibit dealings in war materials, including any right in any invention, design, or process of manufacture relating to any war material. This regulation also appears to be necessary during demobilisation, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 30 bb.-Prohibits the transfer to aliens without the consent of the Board of Trade of any interest in any property or undertaking to which the regula-tion applies.The regulation applies to (i.) Copper, lead, tin, tungsten, and zinc mines, or mines of any other metal which may be added by order of the Board of Trade.(ii.) Oil fields. &apos;(iii.) Certain businesses and factories situate in Norway, Sweden, and other countries mentioned, and engaged in the manufacture of contraband articles.On the strong representation of the Admiralty, the Committee recommend the continuance of this regulation, with the exception of provision (iii) referring to undertakings for the manufacture of contraband articles in certain European countries.Regulations 30 e, 30 ee, and 30 eee. Deal with the melting of gold coins, the hoarding of silver coins, and the maximum price of silver. They have already been referred to under Regulation 7 c.Regulation 31. This regulation prohibits the importation into the United Kingdom and the removal from or to Great Britain, to or from Ireland, of firearms, ammunition, &amp;c.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 33. Prohibits the possession or control without permission of explo sive substances, inflammable liquids, firearms, and military equipment, in or in the vicinity of any railway, dock, or harbour, or any area specified in the order.   These powers appear to the Committee to be necessary during demobilisation, and they recommend continuance.Regulation 33 a. Prohibits the carrying of firearms, ammunition. &amp;c., without a permit in any area specified in the order. The Committee regard this regulation also as necessary during demobilisation, and they recommend continuance.
. Regulation 34. Provides for the protection of places used for the storage of petroleum, turpentine, and other inflammable liquids. It is necessary for the preven-tion of fires while large quantities of these substances are stored in places adjacent to valuable buildings.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 35 a. Confers power to make rules for the safety of factories where explosives are manufacturer! or stored.   The Committee recommend continuance.The following regulations are regarded as necessary for the control of shipping traffic in the interests of safety during the period when, owing to the presence of mines, it will be impracticable to allow unrestricted movement of shipping in homewaters: Regulation 36. Conferring power to control the navigation or mooring of ships in harbours or the approaches thereto.Regulation 36 a. Conferring power to control the use or mooring of boats in harbours or the approaches thereto.Regulation 37. Conferring power to compel vessels to observe regulations as to navigation.Regulation 37a.

Conferring power to prohibit vessels from entering dangerous areas.Regulation 39. Conferring power to make orders as to the pilotage of vessels in territorial waters or adjacent thereto.Regulation 39 a. Giving control over the crew in requisitioned ships.The Committee recommend the continuance of these regulations.Regulation 39 bb. Confers power on the Board of Trade to increase the statutory charges of dock and harbour undertakings. It is of public importance that such undertakings should continue to be carried on efficiently, and it is likely to be some time before the normal level of prices is reached, and it becomes possible to ascertain whether a permanent increase in the statutory charges of such under-takings will be necessary.  Meanwhile the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 bbb. This is the principal regulation under which the Shipping Controller obtains his power to make Orders as to trade, ports, freight, hire, pas-senger rates, &amp;c, building, equipping, and requisitioning of ships, and docks, and shipyards. As the control of shipping is necessary for some time after the war the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 c. Confers power on the Port and Transit Committee for the purpose of preventing congestion of traffic at ports and harbours of the United Kingdom. The control of a single authority for this purpose is considered necessary throughout the whole period of demobilisation. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 cc. Prohibits the purchase of any ship or vessel without the permission of the Shipping Controller.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 dd. Prohibits a British ship from proceeding to sea without a licence from the Shipping Controller.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 ff.

This regulation appears necessary while the shipping control lasts, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 39 g. Prohibits applications without the consent of the Board of Trade for the transfer of the registry of British ships from ports of register ini the United Kingdom to ports outside, so long as there is a shortage of shipping. This restriction appears to be desirable, and the Committee recommend continuance.[1272] F
. Regulation 39 gg. Provides that after a British ship, registered in the United Kingdom, is constructively lost, its&apos;registry shall not be closed unless the Board of Trade so direct. This is really supplementary to Regulation 39 g, and prevents ships which have been constructively lost from being salved and sold to- foreigners. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 40 a. Prohibits the supply of intoxicants to members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces undergoing hospital treatment. It has already been referred to under&apos; regulation 10, and is regarded as necessary for the maintenance of order and discipline during demobilisation.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 40 b. Prohibition upon unauthorised persons supplying or being in the possession of cocaine or opium. The Home Office report that this (regulation has proved of great value in stopping the abuse of these drugs by soldiers and others. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 40 bb. Enables the Local Government Board, during the con-tinuance of the war, to authorise local authorities and others to purchase and distribute drugs for the cure of venereal diseases. The Committee does not recom-mend the continuance of this regulation further than is necessary to enable local authorities to dispose of existing stores.Regulation 40 c. For the prevention of malingering by members of the reserve forces or holders of certificates of exemption from military service. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 41. Prohibits the unauthorised wearing of uniforms, badges, decorations, medals, &amp;c.

Impose restrictions on banking and exchange transactions. See above under regulation 7 c.Regulation 42. Makes it an offence for any person to attempt or do any act calculated or likely to cause mutiny, sedition, or disaffection among any of His Majesty&apos;s Forces or any of the Forces of His Majesty&apos;s Allies. The Committee recommend continuance for six months.Regulation 42 aa. Imposes penalties on persons who persuade soldiers to desert, or who purchase arms and equipments, &amp;c, in any area where 5 Geo. V., c. 34, sec. 1, is suspended.This regulation is not required for England or Scotland, but the Committee recommend continuance as far as relates to Ireland.Regulation 42 c. Provides for the discipline of enrolled civilians. So long as numbers of persons, principally women, not subject to military law, are in the employment of the War Department or the Admiralty this regulation appears to be necessary.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 43. Imposes penalties on persons who obstruct, mislead, interfere with or impede officers or other persons in the exercise of duties under the regula-tions.  The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 43 a. Makes it an offence to obstruct any member of His Majesty&apos;s Forces in the execution of his duties.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 43 b. Procuring or aiding absence without leave of a soldier, or concealing an absentee.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 44. Imposes penalties on the falsification of reports, &amp;c. The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 45. Deals with forgery and personation, misleading statements, unlawful possession of documents and the application of marks to premises, war material, paper, &amp;c, calculated to deceive. The Committee recommend the con-tinuanceof this regulation except clauses (ecc) and (d).Regulation 45 f. Makes provision for facilitating the enforcement of discipline by His Majesty&apos;s Allies amongst their naval and military Forces in the United Kingdom. * It is obvious that provision for these purposes must be made so long as Allied Forces are in the country.Regulation 46 a.-Imposes penalties on persons assisting the escape of prisoners of war or interned persons. As these provisions will be required until prisoners and interned persons are liberated or repatriated, the Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 47. Failure to comply with any order issued in pursuance of the regulations declared an offence.   The Committee recommend continuance.
oRegulation 48.-Attempting to commit, or soliciting, inciting, or persuading another to commit, or procuring, aiding, abetting, or doing any act preparatory to the commission of an offence, or harbouring an offender, declared an offence or-a summary offence as the case may be.   The Committee recommend continuance.Regulation 48 a. Directors and officers of a corporation or company declared responsible for an offence of the corporation or company unless they prove that it was committed without their knowledge or consent. The Committee recommend continuanceRegulation 51. Confers power to search premises, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, &amp;e, on suspicion that they are being used in any way prejudicial to public safety or the defence of the realm, or for the purpose of the commission of an offence against the regulations. The Committee recommend continuance, but that the con-sent of a Secretary of State, the Secretary for Scotland, or the Chief Secretary for Ireland, should be required in all cases.Regulation 51 c. Confers power upon a justice of the peace, if satisfied, by information in writing upon oath laid before him, that any premises are being or are about to be used for any purpose prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm by persons of hostile origin or associations, or by persons suspected of attempt-ing to cause mutiny, sedition, or disaffection among His Majesty&apos;s forces or the civil population, to order the premises to be closed, or not to used for the purposes mentioned in the order, or not to be used except on conditions imposed by the order.

The Home Office reports that this regulation has been of great value in the areas to which it has been applied, and the Committee recommend continuance.Regulations 56 and 58 d. The Committee directed that new clauses should be included in the draft Bill to give effect to their recommendations that after the war all offences under continued regulations should be tried bv the Civil Courts only, except in the case of offenders who were subject to military law or the Naval Discipline Act at the time it is determined that proceedings shall be taken; that penalties should be reduced in the manner stated in their report; and that summary proceedings in Ireland should&apos; be taken before the Resident Magistrates.General clauses and definitions to be continued as far as required.Regulation 59.
