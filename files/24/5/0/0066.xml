Introduction ; Situation at the time of the Armistice ;German Intentions.At the time of the conclusion of the Armistice, the Germans, by virtue of the Terms of the Treaty of Brest- Litovsk, were holding a general line covering the Baltic States on the east. Article XII. of the Armistice Terms laid down that the Germans were to withdraw from the territory which formerly formed part of the Russian Empire &quot; as soon as the Allies shall think the moment suitable, having regard to the internal situation in those territories,&quot; and Article XIV. of those terms laid down that &quot; German, troops were to cease at once all requisitioning and seizures and all other coercive measures with a view to obtaining supplies intended for Germany . . . in Russia.&quot; (Frontiers as defined on 1st August, :914.)The Germans in no way complied with these terms; they did not wait, in accordance with Article XII., for permission from the Allies to withdraw&apos; their troops, and they violate 1 in every possible way Article XIV. The Germans commenced their withdrawal towards the end of November, 1918. This withdrawal was carried out systematically, and by agreement with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks were assisted in every way by the Germans, and -nothing was left undone to hinder the defensive organization of the newly formed national Governments. The action of the Germans is described in greater detail hereafter.The German High Command attributed the premature withdrawal of the German troops, and the action accompanying that withdrawal, to the fact that the German troops were demoralized and could not be controlled. The systematic way, however, in which the German withdrawal and its accompanying acts were carried out disposes of this argument, and shows that the Germans were carrying out a carefully prepared scheme. It is evident that the objects of the Germans in playing into the hands of the Bolsheviks were: 1. To encourage a state of anarchy with a view to justifying future intervention ; 2. To put an end to any wish on the part of the inhabitants to be incorporated in a future reconstituted Russia.The intentions of the Germans have been made clear by their actions throughout the period under review, and are further demonstrated by documentary evidence which is attached to this Memorandum in the form of Appendices.These actions, and this evidence, make it clear that the intention of the Germans has been to make their power and influence predominant in the Baltic States by the placing in power of Governments composed of elements favourable to themselves and by obtaining, through the agency of these Governments, grants of land and special concessions to German settlers. These Governments were to be based on the authority of the German Baits, or former land-owning class, who are, at the same time, strong-supporters of the extreme reactionary Monarchist party, which favours a close alliance between a future reconstituted Russia and Germany.The Germans would no doubt have preferred an independent Baltic Confederation governed exclusively by their supporters, which would have been equivalent to the Baltic States being an actual German dependency; but, failing this, if the Baltic States were to form part of a Russian federation, the Germans, if their scheme had succeeded, would have been in a position to obtain exceptional advantages in those States and(B19/386)   300 &apos; 9/19  h&amp;s  7432wo
would have been able to use them as a base for furthering their plans for restoring a pro-German Monarchist Government in Russia; and it is notorious that the Germans hope to regain in Russia all that they have lost during the war.II. Events Leading up to the Capture of Riga.November, Simultaneously with the commencement of the Bolshevik advance into Esthonia 1918. and Latvia at the end of November, 1918, the Germans commenced the withdrawal of Ger^an their forces from the Baltic States. This withdrawal was carried out systematically, wi^ ra-s\a evacuation of towns being made to coincide with entry of the Bolshevik troops, Bolshevik and, as has been proved, by direct agreement with the latter. At the same time, advance.    arms, supplies and rolling stock were left by the Germans for use by the Bolsheviks.In addition to assisting the Bolsheviks in this manner, everything was done by the Germans to hinder the organization and execution of measures for the defence on the part of the newly-formed loc-al governments. Stocks and arms were removed or destroved; supplies of food and clothing were confiscated; rolling stock was seized and conveyed to Germany; Esthonian merchant vessels were seized; telegraphic communication was interrupted, and. Winnig, the German Commissioner in the Baltic States, committed a number of arbitrary acts, which were designed to delay tin; mobilization and organization of the local forces. Owing to this action on the part of the Germans, the local forces in Esthonia and Latvia were in no way prepared for the Bolshevik invasion, which was initiated on a wide front from Narva to Lieshitza.10.1.19. In Esthonia the Bolsheviks advanced at a rapid pace until about the 10th January.On that date, in the north,&apos;the Bolsheviks had reached a line running from Koikull onthe coast, west of Taps, to St. Annen, thus bringing them to within 45 miles of Reval.Further south the Bolsheviks had captured Walk, and had reached a point 34 milessouth-east of Pernau. -     -&apos; ^ .  * .   - - * *3.1.19.

About the middle of January the situation in Esthonia underwent a remarkablea* man change. Assisted by some detachments of volunteers from Finland, together with some small consignments of arms and a loan from that country, and, also, owing to the arrival of some military supplies from Great Britain and assistance given by the British Naval forces in the Baltic, the Esthonians assumed a very successful offensive.18-20.1.19. By dint of outflanking movements along the coast and an energetic offensive, o^Dorpat ass*ste(i by an armoured train, along the Pteval Wesenberg Narva railway line, the and NaT- a Esthonians advanced at such a rapid rate that, on the 20th January, they recaptured by p I Narva from the Bolsheviks. At the same time the Esthonian advance was pursued in s- a south-easterly direction and, on the 18th January, the Esthonians recaptured In Dorpat. The Esthonian advance was continued from this point and, at the end of : January, the Esthonian forces had reached the western shores of Lake Peipus. A simultaneous advance -was carried out by the Esthonian forces in the south, and the 1919.    &apos;   Bolsheviks were driven back to within a short distance of Valk.JaiiuCo-opera- In these operations the Esthonian forces also derived a certain amount of assistancetion of the fr0m the elements of-the North Russian Volunteer Annv, which had been formed byRussian     - e Germans in the Pskov area and which was intended to advance on Petrograd.Volunteer   When the Bolshevik advance commenced the Germans abandoned this force and aArmy with portion of it retired into Esthonia and co-operated under the direction of the Esthonianp1&apos;^, . command, whilst a small portion retired into Latvia and eventually co-operated with Lsthonians.      .T       i  n 1 j        ithe Lettish forces.

The Lettish Government, in the meanwhile, had retired from Riga and Bolshevikshad established itself at Libau.   This Government had, moreover, by this time ^f^6succeeded in mobilizing a small force which kept the Bolsheviks at bay on the line Establish-stated above. ment of thoLettish Govern-ment at Libau.In Lithuania, by the 10th January, the Bolsheviks had reached the line Vilkomir Situation in -K^chedari Olita. 0 wing, however, to the difference between the gauges of the Russian Lithuania, and German railways in that country, the Bolsheviks were compelled to arrest their 10,1 advance on this line.To return to Esthonia, by the middle of February the Bolsheviks had been almost Situation in completely driven out of the territory ethnologically claimed by the Esthonians.   The ^hr^y latter had maintained their positions on the Narva front, in the direction of Pskov, 1919. they had captured Isborsk, and, in the south, they had advanced to south of Valk.The Esthonians had hitherto avoided cooperation with the Letts owing to fears that Lettish-Bolshevism  was  prevalent  amongst  the  latter.    About the middle of February, Esthonian however, conferences took place between Lettish and Estbonian representatives at ^l^^&apos; Copenhagen, as a result of which a considerable measure of agreement was attained. It was agreed that the Esthonians and Letts should co-operate in accordance with a common plan, wdiereby the Esthonians were to move south from Valk with the object of cutting the Bolshevik communications on the Pskov Riga road, whilst the Lettish force was to advance east in the direction of Dvinsk.Towards the end of February the Germans apparently considered that the time German was ripe for them to return in the role of liberators.   It will be seen that by this time J?^rve^&quot; the Bolsheviks had overrun the whole of Latvia with the exception of a small strip of^-elop-territory surrounding Libau; they had also occupied a large portion of Lithuania and ment of the had only been prevented from overrunning Esthonia by timely assistance which had German been received by the Esthonian Government from Finland and Great Britain, and by p^uar^ of the extraordinary powers displayed by the Esthonian forces in re-assuming  the 1919,d &apos; offensive.About this time the Germans began to arrive at Libau, and by the end of February, j^jj^ in a German force about 20,000 strong, was concentrated in the Libau Windau area, qLJ^^ under the command of General von der Goltz. forcesThe German motives have been apparent in the actions of General von der Goltz underever since his arrival. General vonder Goltz.Immediately  after his  arrival at Libau, General von der Goltz commenced Activities intriguing with the German Baits, and he brought pressure to bear on the Lettish yan^er^ Government to remodel their composition so as to include representatives of this section Goltz. of the population.   At the end of February an abortive coup d&apos;etat took place at 26.2.19. Libau, the object of which was to replace the Lettish Government entirely by German Afte&quot;P^ Baits.   The plans for this coup d&apos;e&apos;tat were disclosed, however, before they had matured, at Libau.&quot; and the scheme was abandoned as being, apparently, too ambitious.General von der Goltz assumed complete control of the administration, civil as well as military, in the area controlled by the Lettish Government, with the object of depriving that Government of&quot; all authority and discrediting it in the eyes of the population.   One of the arbitary acts of the Germans in this connection was the seizure of local stocks of timber, without the permission of the Government, for the settlement of requisitioning debts.   General von der Goltz, moreover, designated his force an Army German of Occupation, and, apparently with the enforced concurrence of the Lettish Govern-forces ment, promised the German troops grants of land in Latvia as a reward for their !^A&amp;rm^of services.   In this latter connection, the German intentions are very clearly indicated. Occupation. Announcements  appeared  in  the  German  Press under the title of Baltenschviz Offer of Siedlungsmoeglichkeit, offering 50 morgen of land per man to volunteers in the German 8&apos;rant* of forces in the Baltic States. k ^In this connection, documents issued at this time in Germany, and among the&quot;1&apos;1&quot; &apos;00ps&quot; German troops in the Baltic Provinces, are attached as Appendices I. and II.(7432) .

1.3.19. Major Keenan&apos;s Mission.3.3.10.AdvanceAt the beginning of March, Major Keenan was sent to Li ban for the purpose of reporting on the situation, advising the War Office as to the requirements of the local forces and the measures necessary to resist the Bolshevik advance, and, at the same time, with a view to giving such advice and assistance to the local authorities as was in his power.In the latter respect, Major Keenan was at the outset confronted with great difficulties arising from the opposition and obstruction on the part of the Germans, and his principal task henceforth was to support the local authorities in their efforts to maintain their position in the face of General von der Goltz&apos;s arbitrary actions.On the 3rd March an advance, under German direction, commenced against Bolsheviks.   German forces held the front from south of Telshi to west of Frauenburg. Bolsheviks&quot;&apos; ^&quot;or^n of the latter place Baltic Landwehr held the front to approximately Goldingen.A Lettish force about 1,000 strong held the sector in the vicinity of the latter place, and German troops continued the line to the coast.Military situation in Latvia end of March. 1919.March,1919.Germanactivitiesand Alliedpolicy.16.4.19.German coup Wetat in Latvia.Major Keenan&apos;s influence with the Letts.Iii the face of weak Bolshevik opposition, the advance, was carried forward at a rapid rate beyond Tukkumand Mitau, and, at the end of March, the line of the River Au, from Schlok to Bausk, thence to Birji and east of Shavli, was reached.It &quot;was realized, at this time, that the Germans were obtaining a very strong bold on the Baltic Provinces, from which it would be very difficult to dislodge them unless immediate action was taken. This action demanded, in the first place, the withdrawal of the German forces. The German position, however, was strengthened by the fact that the local forces only comprised some 3,000 troops, who were not in a position alone to defend the countrv against Bolshevik invasion. The Allies, therefore, were faced with the alternative of allowing the German troops to remain, or ordering the with-drawal of the latter and opening the country to a further Bolshevik invasion.Beyond providing for 1,000 Lettish troops who had been mobilized, General von der Goltz however, had refused, to provide arms and equipment for any additional Lettish troops, and had restricted further Lettish mobilization to three districts, in which only 300 recruits were permitted to be raised. Certain arms had been landed at. Libau by the British naval forces. The Germans, however, had thrown a largo portion of these arms into the sea and had arranged matters so that the Letts were almost entirely dependent on them for all military material.In order to initiate a plan for a future German withdrawal, Major Keenan was asked for his views as to the possibility of replacing the German troops by local forces, if the Lettish authorities were given the necessarv facilities for mobilization.Major Keenan reported that,if the necessary facilities were given and Lettish prisoners of war were repatriated from Germany, a sufficient force could be raised within four months to replace the German forces. He put this proposal before the German authorities; but the latter refused to allow any further mobilization of Letts to take place on the ground that this would be conducive to the spread of Bolshevism. In Major Keenans opinion, however, the German contention was without any foundation, and was put forward for the sole purpose of ensuring that the defence of the Baltic States remained entirely in the hands of the Germans.On the 16th April, a coup dJetat was carried out at Libau, which demonstrated the German intentions in a very clear manner. For three days previous to that date, the Germans had been disarming the Lettish force at the naval harbour at Libau. The plot culminated in the arrest of members of the Lettish Government, the disarming of Lettish troops in Libau and on the lines of communication, and the seizure of Lettish supplies and military material.According to General von der Goltz, this coup oVetat bad been entirely engineered by the German Baits. Major Keenan and the other Allied representatives, however, reported that there was irrefutable proof that the whole plot had been carefully prepared and brought to a head by the Germans with the object of replacing the Lettish Government by one composed of German Baits, and completely establish]&apos; the supremacy of the latter.ngThe Germans no doubt wished to provoke an attack on the part of the Letts with the^ object of giving Bolshevik tendencies on the part of the latter as an excuse for their being disarmed. Owing, however, to the influence exercised by Major Keenan, the Letts behaved in a most admirable manner and in no way provoked the Germans.
The Lettish troops at the front remained at their positions and continued to hold the line against the Bolsheviks. The Baltic Landwehr, on the other hand, were withdrawn from the front for the purpose of assisting the Germans at Libau.As a result of representations made by the Allied Missions at Libau, on 23rd April, a 23 A. ly. Note was handed to the Germans through the Armistice Commission at Spa, demanding Allied the immediate restoration of the situation at Libau as it was prior to the coup aetat, and the re-establishment of the Lettish Government with full authority to carry out its duties and absolute freedom to enlist Lettish troops. The Germans replied in an evasive manner to these demands. A German Commission of Enquiry, headed by Noske, was sent to Libau, but the arrival of this Commission did not lead to any material results. Owing, however, to strong representations made by the Allied representatives on. the spot, and owing, moreover, to the realization that the attempt to establish a German Bait administration was bound to fail through opposition, both on tiie part of the Allies and of the inhabitants, the situation bad been to a certain extent re-established. The Germans were induced to restore a certain proportion of the arms which had been confisca-oed, and, under the auspices of their own officers, the Lettish forces in Libau and on the lines of communication resumed their organization to a certain extent.The situation, however, was still extremely unsatisfactory; the Lettish Govern-ment had not been reinstated, and General von der Goltz was continuing his policy of oppression.Some restraint was exercised on the action of the Germans at this juncture by the Blockade imposition of a blockade of Latvian ports bv the British Naval forces under the   ^awian command of Rear-Admiral Sir Walter H. Cowan, K.C.B., M.V.O., D.S.O.    ThisfiXtfayai blockade prevented the arrival of reinforcements and supplies for the Germans by sea.   forces.The German forces during this period had remained on the line above quoted, and &apos;i&apos;^e .bad not made any attempt to advance on Riga. General von der Goltz stated that the (l&apos;ies1&apos;10&quot; 0* n j? ill i in- i. . au advancetrerman lorces would only carry out this advance on the following conditions :  ull Kjg;u1. That the question of the division of the civil and military power in Riga wasclearly understood hy the Letts; 2. That the Letts aciopted a more friendly attitude towards the Germans ; 3. That food supplies were provided for the town of Riga.In the latter connection, the Germans made an impudent demand that the Allies should provide rolling stock and supplies. The Germans also, by insidious propaganda, drew the attention of the Allies and neutrals to the terrible condition of the inhabitants of Riga and to the danger of the Bolsheviks on this front being reinforced, and ascribed, the delay in the capture of Riga to the refusal of the Allies to meet their demands. They also stated that the co-operation of British naval forces was essential to the capture of Riga.It is noteworthy that, in this latter connection, Major Keenan reported that the Germans were in a position to recapture Riga at any time.The object of the Germans in demanding Allied co-operation was obviously to strengthen their position in the Baltic States ; to show the inhabitants that it was of a permanent nature, and that the Germans were remaining in the Baltic States at the request of the Allies, and not on sufferance.Fresh &quot;demands were made by the Allies at this period that the Germans should May, 1919. cease from interfering with local organization ; that the German forces should cease to ^   ^ be designated as an Army of Occupation; and that General von der Goltz shouldto y,e be recalled.

That the maintenance of order was a necessary condition for the distribution offoodstuffs in the Baltic States. (b.) That the present maintenance of order in Lithuania and Latvia was entirely inthe hands of the Germans, (c.) That the despatch of Allied troops to the Baltic States was out of the question.In view of these considerations, the Baltic Commission recommended to the Council of Foreign Ministers that a competent military mission, under British command, should proceed to the Baltic States, for the purpose of advising the local governments on questions relating to the training and equipping of local forces with which to replace the German Army of Occupation, and for the purpose of arranging for the withdrawal of the German forces.On the 23rd May, these recommendations by the Baltic Commission were adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers, and instructions were issued to the War Office by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in Paris, to proceed at once with, the organization of the Mission as recommended, with General Goujrh as Chief. General Gouffh in the meanwhile had arrived at Helsingfors as Chief of the British Military Mission to Finland, which had previously been organized. In accordance with the orders which had been received from Paris, the attached instructions (Appendix X.) were drawn up, officially appointing General Gough Chief of the British Military Mission to Finland and the Baltic States. These instructions were approved by Mr. Balfour in Paris and were circulated to the various Allied delegations. It will be seen from paragraph 3 of these instructions that the Governments of the other principal Allied and Associated Powers had agreed that the execution of Allied military policy in the Baltic States should be under British control, and that Allied officers were to be attached to General Goughs Mission.It should be noted that, hitherto, Major Keeuan, assisted in political matters by Mr. Grant Watson, Foreign Office Commissioner, was the sole British Military Representative in the Baltic States. Major Keenan discharged in a highly creditable manner the very difficult task of assisting the provisional Latvian Government in. maintaining its authority in the face of the overwhelming material and moral ascendency of the so-called German Army of Occupation under General von der Goltz. Major Keenan&apos;s actions throughout were based on the principle of fostering the Lettish, national aspirations and defeating the German desires to render their occupation permanent. Major Keenans actions, moreover, and the advice which he gave to the War Office, paved the way for the elimination of German influence and undoubtedly facilitated General Gough&apos;s task.Major Keenan was materially assisted in the execution of his duties by Eear-Admiral Sir Walter Cowan, K.C.B., Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic.24.5.19.

Events Subsequent to the Capture of Riga.On the 24th May, Riga was captured by the Letts (Ballods force) and tin; Bait Landwehr, with the co-operation of the German Iron Division south of the town.At this period a further exchange of notes between the Allies and the Germans took place. An Allied Note of the 25th May ordered the Germans to maintain their troops in their positions in Latvia, but to evacuate the Augustovo district. To this the Germans answered on the 30th May with an evasive argument as to the interpretation of the Armistice Terms.On the 3l)th May the Allies presented a stronger and more precise Note, which, in addition to repeating the former demand, stated that General von der Goltz would be permitted to stay in Latvia only if he abstained from hindering mobilization and from interfering in the affairs of the Lettish Government, and returned to the Lettish troops the arms taken from them.On the 8th June the German Government replied that i. Evacuation was taking place ;2. Geiieral von der Goltz had not kept back arms from the Letts; 3. Mobilization   would  endanger   the lines of communication of the German troops;4. It was impossible for General von der Goltz to interfere in Latvian affairs, as he had been ordered to abstain from doins&apos; so.

Events Subsequent to the Capture of Riga.On the 24th May, Riga was captured by the Letts (Ballod&apos;s force) and the Bait Landwehr, with the co-operation of the German Iron Division south of the town.At this period a further exchange of notes between the Allies and the Germans took place. An Allied Note of the 25th May ordered the Germans to maintain their troops in their positions in Latvia, but to evacuate the Augustovo district. To this the Germans answered on the 30th May with an evasive argument as to the interpretation of the Armistice Terms.On the 3uth May the Allies presented a stronger and more precise Note, which, in addition to repeating the former demand, stated that General von der Goltz would be permitted to stay in Latvia only if he abstained from hindering mobilization and from interfering in the affairs of the Lettish Government, and returned to the Lettish troops the arms taken from them.On the 8th June the German Government replied that 1. Evacuation was taking place ;2. General von der Goltz hud not kept&apos; back arms from the Letts ; 3. Mobilization   would  endanger   the lines of communication of the German troops:4. It was impossible for General von der Goltz to interfere in Latvian affairs, as he had been ordered to abstain from doing so.
The actions of General von der Goltz in Latvia during the period covered by this General -exchange of notes was completely at variance with the statements made by the German J?^^&apos;&apos; Government; for, immediately after the capture of Riga, German reinforcements were acti0ns. brought to Latvia and preparations were made for an advance into Esthonia.   Inter-fererice in Latvian affairs was continuous.   ^Mobilization was prevented and a policy aiming at the extermination of the Letts was instituted.   Several hundred Letts, men, women and children, were executed by Fletcher, the German Commander of the Bait Landwehr and Commandant of Riga, on the charge of being Bolsheviks, and these executions were only stopped after strong protests on the part- of Colonel Tallents. General von der Goltz&apos;s order of 24th April (Appendix IV.) and Von Tiede&apos;s order of 23rd April (Appendix III.) were apparently still in force.During this period also the German and Bait attack on the Esthonians had begun, the course of which was as follows : On the 3rd June the Bait Landwehr, supported by the German Iron Division, 3.6.19 toattacked the Esthonians south of Wendeu, and, on the oth June, General von der Goltz, 5.7.19.on the pretext that the Esthonians had attacked his troops, sent an ultimatum to the ^k^-&quot; t-i i-i    -      i        i-      i 111-11       i  - i&apos;      t     - Jj/stbomanEsthonians demanding that they should withdraw their troops trom Latvian territory, conflict.It is noteworthy in this connection that a delegation of the Landwehr later admitted to General Gough that General von der Goltz had ordered the Landwehr to attack in order to prevent Lettish mobilization in Northern Latvia.After some fighting, a temporary armistice was arranged on the 13th June, which was to continue until the 20th June, on which day there was to be a further 20. G, 19. meeting of both sides to arrange a more permanent armistice. No representative from the Bait or German side appeared on the 20th, and in spite of a warning issued by General Gough to the German Command, the Baits and Germans recommenced hostilities on the 21st June, announcing that the Esthonians, and the Lettish detachment co-operating with them, were 14 Bolsheviks.&quot; A confidential order signed by Fletcher, the commander of the Landwehr, dated the 16th June, has since been found, [vide Appendix V.) in which he informed his troops that a victory over the Bolshevik Esthonians and &quot; Ulmanis &quot; Letts was necessary to ensure the security of German life and settlement in Latvia.In spite of a definite statement by General von der Goltz in a telegram to General Gough on the 19th June that German troops were not aiding the Landwehr, it was clearly established that the German Iron Division participated in this fighting. An order to the Iron Division [vide Appendix VI.) is proof of this.When the Baits and Germans violated the Armistice the Esthonians brought up all 30.6.19. the troops they could spare from their front against the Bolsheviks, drove their opponents back, and, on the 30th June, were within 3 miles of Riga and held the town waterworks. At this point the Baits and Germans asked for an armistice. On the advice of General Gough the Esthonians agreed to negotiate and on the 3rd July an 3.7.19. armistice was signed. Under the terms of this armistice the Germans evacuated Riga by the 5th July.The :chief result of this blow to German hopes and prestige was the fall of the Needra Cabinet. M. Ulmanis, the Lettish Premier, who was deposed by the Germany on the 16th April, thereupon resumed office with a reorganized Cabinet in which the Baits were represented.; M. Ulmanis&apos; Cabinet was reinstated entirely through the instrumentality of General Gough&apos;s Mission, and was secured against subsequent German interference by that Mission.In the meantime, General Gough had taken up the wider question of the general evacuation of the Baltic States by the Germans.A very serious situation had arisen from the manifest intention of the Germans to continue their advance in a northerly direction into Esthonia with a view to establishing their predominance in that country.   Further, the British Fleet at Libau was in. imminent danger of being driven frorn its moorings by German shore guns.    In view of 10.6.19. the gravity of the situation, and of the necessity of immediate, action being taken to ^er?^7 prevent the German advance, General Gough. on the 10th June, on his own responsi- Q0Uo-h to bility, issued certain orders to General von der Goltz.    General Gough, however, (Jeneral reported the action wdiich he had taken to Paris, and requested that his orders might Y,011 der be confirmed through the usual channel. Goltz.General Gough&apos;s orders were rejected by General von der Goltz ; but, it having 12.6.19. been foreseen that this would be the case,&quot; the Supreme Council on the 12th June ^emand by instructed Marshal Foch to forward a fresh demand through the Armistice Commission Council relative to the withdrawal of the German forces in the Baltic States. Paris.
9.7,19. On the 9th July, on the instructions of the Supreme Council, Marshal Foch notifiedGeneral Qermail authorities through the medium of the Armistice Commission that, in ordervested with *0 expedite and facilitate the execution of the dispositions contemplated in the demand executive referred to nbove, the Allied and Associated Governments authorized General Gough. to powers.     enter into direct communications with the local German Command with a view to thesettlement of all questions which might arise with reference to the application of thedispositions referred to.General von der Goltz for some time denied having received any instructions to thiseffect from his Government, though a reminder was handed to the Germans by theArmistice Commission on the 16th July. 19.7.19. On the 19th July, General von der Goltz still denied the receipt of instructions,reTusTtf stateQl tnat &amp; .would take him 74 days to evacuate his troops; that he would not General evacuate by sea and that his men would make difficulties about leaving as they had von der     been promised land in Latvia.Goltz to German troops continued to arrive in the Mitau district on the pretext that it waswitl^-lllied necessary-to guard the German lines of communication, and General von der Goltz demands,   continued to temporize regarding the principle of evacuation.   His troops had certainly evacuated Libau on the 24th June, but only, he said, from military considerations. Windau had also been evacuated on the 2Sth July, but no further signs of compliance with the demands of the Allied and Associated Governments were apparent.1.8.19. On the 1st August, therefore, the Germans were ordered by Marshal Foch.Allies       through the Armistice Commission, to recall General von der Goltz ; to begin the evacuation of Latvia by land and sea at once under the supervision of General Gough, and to complete the evacuation by the 30th August.   The entry of fresh German troops into the Baltic States was forbidden. Situation According to the latest information General von der Goltz has begun evacuatingas regards Latvia by land according to his own plan.   He has received Marshal Fochs orders of evacuation ^he      August accompanied, however, by instructions from the German Government not to co-operate with General Gough.Practically the whole of Northern Courland has been evacuated and the Germans have invited the Lettish Government to take over the Tukkuni -Windau railway. In South-Eastern Courland the Bausk area is being evacuated.The German Government, in spite of-angry protests, is officially not supporting the demands of the German soldiers for land in Latvia. German soldiers have been prohibited from entering foreign military formations and any officers who support such proceedings are to be court-martialled. As regards the Landwehr, which is now under the command of a British officer, the Germans in it have been returned to Germany, while the Baits are being formed into a unit of the Latvian Army.There is evidence&apos; to show, however, that unofficially considerable numbers of German troops are being equipped and transported from Germany for service in the Baltic States (vide Appendix VII.).In addition the German authorities are recruiting and equipping Russian ex-prisoners of war in Germany for despatch to a pro-German Russian force under a certain Colonel Bermont at Mitau.Foi&apos;nla*!on        On the 14th August, the Russian North-West Government for the provinces of North-West -Ps^on?&apos; Novgorod and Petrograd was formed.   M. Leonozoff, a cadet, is Premier and Govern-     Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs, and General Yudenitch is War Minister and meat.        Commander-in-Chief in this Government.    The tendencies of the members of the Government are generally pro-Entente.    There was a possibility at first of certain individuals of decided pro-German leanings being included in the Government, but owing to Allied pressure, these were finally excluded.   The Government cannot be called a strong one.Immediately on its formation the North-West Russian Government issued a declaration recognizing the independence of Esthonia and urging the Governments of Great Britain, France and the United States to do likewise.The declaration also states that the Cabinet relies on the military assistance of the Esthonian Government for a campaign against Petrograd, and that negotiations are to be commenced with Esthonia for an outlet to the sea for the new State of North-West Russia.The declaration expresses a hope that the Allies will continue the supply of military material and will give financial assistance to the new Government.
The North-West Russian Government has decided to call a congress of representatives of the people at Dorpat in the Esthonia.The formation of this Government was effected at General Gough&apos;s instigation in view of the following reasons : (a.) The critical condition of the Russian North-Western Army ;(b.) The seriousness of a threat by the Esthoniau Army to refuse to participatefurther against the Bolsheviks unless Esthonian independence was granted ; (c.) The need of fusion of democratic and reactionary parties into a whole-heartedattack on the Bolsheviks.All action, however, of an executive and political nature in connection with the formation of the Russian North-West Government was carried out with the approval and through the medium of the British and Allied Political representatives.IV. Conclusion : The Results Achieved by General Gocjgh&apos;s Mission.At the beginning of June, 1919, when General Gough was appointed to take charge of the Allied Mission to the Baltic States, the situation which he was called, upon, to face was one presenting considerable difficulties. German influence was in process of becoming firmly established in these States, and the Germans had just increased General von der Goltzs forces with the intention of consolidating their position in Latvia and carrying their advance into Esthonia. General Gough was invested with no executive powers, with the result that he was handicapped, in. dealing with General von der Goltz, who, knowing the former&apos;s position, ignored all his instructions.It is right to point out, moreover,v that General Gough has also been greatly handicapped in dealing with the Governments of these States by the fact that he lias been unable to promise any financial support from the Allies.Since direct action was from the outset impossible (the Allied note authorizing General Gough to deal direct with General von der Goltz was despatched on 11th July), General Goughs policy was : 1. To assist in every way the formation  of local military forces to  replaceeventually the German troops in those countries. 2. To raise the moral of the countries and to prevent, by bis advice, theoccurrence of any incidents which the Germans might use as a pretextfor continued occupation or for further aggression.In pursuance Of the first part of this policy, General Gough first attempted to improve relations between the Esthonian Army ancl the Russian North-West Army, at the same time improving the moral of the latter force.To this end, on the 11th June, he issued instructions to the Commander of the North-West Army urging the abandonment of politics in this force, and the adoption of a less aggressive policy towards the Esthonians. General Gough; moreover, persuaded the leaders of this Army to adopt a more lenient attitude towards the inhabitants of the territory it occupied.As regards the Esthonian Army, which had already showed considerable military proficienc)&apos;, General Gough succeeded in raising its discipline to such an extent that, at the height of its victorious defence against the Germans and Baits, it consented to the conclusion of an armistice and to the abandonment of its project for entering the town of Riga.The Latvian Army was, on the arrival of General Gough, almost non-existent. The Germans prevented mobilization, and the only local armed force was that of Colonel Ballod, whose freedom of action was curtailed to a minimum by the Germans. At the present moment, the Latvian Army is being reconstructed under the supervision of General Gough, and he has been so successful in eliminating friction between thev Letts and the Baits, that the Bait Landwehr, now purged of all Germans, forms a unit of the Latvian Army.In Esthonia and Latvia, therefore, local military forces of considerable value have been formed sufficient at least to defend the frontiers of their countries against Bolshevik aggression.The Russian North-West Army and the Esthonian Army have been supplied with military material by His Majest/s Government (see Appendices VIII. and IX.).(7432) b
As regards the second part of General Gough&apos;s policy, the restraint - which he has been able to exercise upon the Esthonian Army has reacted upon the moral of the whole country, and the very violent propaganda of the Bolsheviks and the more insidious work in this repect of the Germans has had little effect. It has, however, been necessary for General Gough, in conjunction with the other Missions in that country, to protest against the excessively radical measure of land reform which the Esthonian Parliament was disposed to adopt; and it appears that this protest has been successful in delaying the execution of this measure of reform pending its eonsidaration bv the Allied Governments.As regards Latvia, the Cabinet, deposed by the Germans in the coup oVciat of April, was reinstated in July entirely through the instrumentality of General Gougb.&apos;s Mission, and it has since been preserved from external and internal interference by this Mission. General Gough, moreover, in conjunction with the Allied political representatives, prevailed upon M. Ulmanis to form his new Cabinet on a democratic representative basis by the inclusion of members of the German. Bait party.What would appear to be the most important result achieved by General Gough and his Mission is that the German forces have been compelled to withdraw from the whole of the territory claimed by the Latvian Government north of the River Diina, and also from the whole of North Courland. They have also evacuated the whole of Western Lithuania.It will be seen from the results which he has achieved, that the efforts made by General Gough, in the face of great difficulties and opposition, to ensure the execution of the demands made to the Germans by the Allies, have met with a, very considerable measure of success.General Goii jh\s actions have resulted in the removal, to a large extent, of German influence in these States, and he has undoubtedly, in so far as he has been able, carried out the task with which he has been entrusted in a most satisfactory and praiseworthy manner in the interests both of the Baltic States and of the Allies.General Staff, War Office,20th August, 1919

581APPENDIX V.&quot;Translation.Confidential. To be destroyed when read.Headquarter Staff, Riga,Baltic Landeswehr. Wth June, 1919.INFORMATION FOR THE LEADERS SO THAT THEY MAY INSTRUCT THEIR MEN.As it is probable that it will come to an armed conflict with the &quot; Ulmanis &quot; Letts and the Esthonians, a few notes on the situation are given herewith : After the fall here in Lettland (in April last) of Ulmanis&apos;Government, which was hostile to the Germans, it was replaced by a Government under Xeedra. Needra too is an enthusiastic patriot, but he will not dispute the right of those Germans resident in the country to live, to work and to progress.&apos; Ulmanis, on the other hand as has been proved by his own words and by countless examples desires to exterminate and drive o:it, not only the so-called &quot; Barons &quot; but every German here. From news that has just arrived from England, it is plainly evident, that the, English are aiming at the same result in order to prevent any access of strength for Germany and to prevent the coming alliance of Germany and Russia by any and every means. With the help of the Esthonians and the &quot; Ulmanis&apos;&quot; Letts, a Lettland is to be created here, which is to be a vassal State of England, and is to be thrust as a wedge between Germany and Russia. The Armistice agreed to by the Allies in Wenden as far back as 10th June, gave Northern Lettland to Lettland that is to say to Needra&apos;s Government, who demanded the evacuation of this territory by the Esthonians and Ulmanis&apos; Lettish troops. -England, for the reasons stated above, has disregarded the armistice and now insists upon conditions which must result in the ruin of all Germans resident here : 1. The return to power of Ulmanis&apos; Ministry..2. Return of half the German troops to Germany and other further conditions.In other words, England believes she has found in the Esthonian troops and the two regiments of &quot; Ulmanis&apos;&quot; Letts the Power which will enable her to deal a death blow to the Germans here, to render any future development and expansion impossible for Germany and which will help her to rob Germany of a great and powerful ally Russia.Ulmanis and the present Esthoniau Government are half Bolshevik, as is proved by the fact that they have welcomed whole Bolshevik regiments and have called up the armed Red Guards hiding in the woods to fight against the German &quot; Iron &quot; Division and against the Landeswehr.England has obtained the cession from Esthonia of the island of Osel &quot; The reward of Judas &quot; with aneye to business, as usual. &apos;If it is not possible to ensure that the terms of the Esthonian Armistice Agreement, of 10th June are carried into effect, and if Needra&apos;s Government does not remain in power, then German influence here and every individual German also is doomed. The negotiations have shown that France and America are opposed to England. The most pressii;g need of the moment, therefore, is to retain Needra&apos;s Government, and to prevent the return of Ulmanis&apos; Government by every possible means. This can only be accomplished by a victory over the Esthonian troops and Ulmanis&apos; Letts, which the &quot; Iron&quot; Division will help to attain, with all the forces at their disposal.A new danger threatens from the east, in the shape of a reemdescence of Bolshevism; this can only be combatted if North Lettland is freed from Esthonians and rebellious Letts and if an Anti-Bolshevik Government is in power.Finally, it is not a question here of whether we will fight or not, we must fight if avo are not to go under. &quot;We shall most certainly be strangled by further diplomatic negotiations, Ave must now act.&apos; There is no doubt that England would in the end recognize a victorious Lettiand under Needra&apos;s Government, a Lettland Avhich would Avillingly grant land fcr settlers to her liberators. This Avould be the only tolerable solution of the German question here from the German point of view, and there is then some prospect of finding a home and a possible existence in this lovely country, after troublous days.It is now the all-important duty of the leaders to explain the situation to their men on these lines in the most convincing manner.(Signed)   Flktchkk,Commander-in-Chief.
The Iron. Division, Ia/2033.Translation. --Confidential.Riga,26th June,ORDER OF THE DIVISION.. Owing- to the rapid development of the situation last week, it was impossible to duly inform the troops about the motives and conclusions accepted here and obligatory for all. Therefore, I request all officers to acquaint their men in an appropriate way with what follows : The entrance of the Division into Lettish services was due to the fact of the German Government, for political reasons, being bound by obligations to the Allies not to employ German troops on the north side of the Dwina. The Iron Division would have to leave Eiga in a moment when the Baltic Landwehr, as already expressed in the Order of the Division on the 18th of June, was put into a critical position by the united Esthonian--Bolshevist troops and the Letts of Ubnanis. The result of abandoning the Landwehr at this moment would have been not only the loss of Kiga but probably also the clearing of the whole of Courland, and thus the crushing nf all prospects of colonization, a new Bolshevist invasion of the country, and the Germans and German-Baits being compelled to leave the country.The German Government is endeavouring to p:event, with all means at its disposal, such a flight, en masse of the German-Baits.   Therefore, it has left to the Head Command to take appropriate steps.The entrance of the Iron Division into Lettish service was regarded by the Head Command as a necessary means to satisfy the wishes of the German Government concerning the non-employment of German troops on the northern side of the Dwina, as well as to keep what has already been attained.No member of the Iron Division will lose his German citizenship by entering ihe service of the Lettish Government. All claims for provision remain as before. Tho remuneration of troops will undergo no change. The treaty concluded with the Lettish Government is valid up to the 1st of July, and must then be renewed.   Its tenor is as follows : 1. The Iron Division enters with all its formations the service of the Provisional Lettish Government.2. The Iron Division is to be employed as an independent unit side by side with lhe Landeswehr.3 The resolution of the Provisional Lettish Government of 11th June, 1919, as well as the resolutionrecorded in a letter of the Provisional Lettish Government dated 10th June, 1919, sub. No. 1205,maintain their full force also as regards the Iron Division. 4. This temporary treaty comes into force at once.   It is intended to renew it before the 1st of July,1919. in a form which is to be sanctioned by the representatives of ihe people.The supplies of the Division as well as its reserves of man-power and munitions will bo further ensured by the North Head Command.The Head Command has thus expressly approved of the Iron Division remaining in Lettlaiid.The employment of the division at the Polish front does not come for the moment into consideration, a sufficient number of troops being there.In case the Head Command would need the division at the latter front it will call them, and I am certain that they will instantly follow the call of the &quot; vaterland.&quot; -Meanwhile every man must be conscious that he is equally lighting here for the cause of his &quot; Vaterland &quot; as his brothers at the Polish front and that nothing but solidarity and discipline can help us lo get out of the difficult position Germany and everyone of us have been put into.The German troops in Lithuania and Courland form, in their present positions, the left wing of the troops fighting in Prussia against the Poles, so tiiat it is impossible for the Head Command to take them away. The enterprise against the Esthonians and the Letts of Ulmanis has not led to the results desired.The troops have fought excellently; I express my sincere gratitude to them for their behaviour both when on march and when fighting.I recommend to the leaders of all degrees to proceed with full energy to tho re-establishment of the full fighting capacity of the troops, to put in order both clothing and equipment and before; everything to eliminate ruthlessly all unreliable elements.I have been informed the Letts of Ulmanis and the Spartacists are making energetic propaganda among our troops for the purpose of convincing them that the war waged against the Bolshevist Esthonians and the Letts of Ulmauis were but struggles for the interest of the Barons, and that the laud which now is to be sold by the latter to the German soldiers would be given free of charge by Ihe Government of Ulmanis.We must always keep in memory the fact of Ulmanis and his Government being just as anti-German as the Esthonians and the Entente, and that the main interest of all those people is the extermination of Germanism and that a German colonist can expect from Ulmanis Government no free land, but. on the contrary, extermination,I insist on the officers paying the closest attention to their men, opposing emphatically all idle talk and putting an end lo all propaganda capable of shaking their confidence in their leaders.I will endeavour to see personally as many troops as possible in order to enlighten them about our position, but I expect that those formations which cannot be visited by me for want of time will have full confidence that I will do all what 1 can for the best of their interests.True translation compared with the copy.(Signed)  Bischofk.Major.
