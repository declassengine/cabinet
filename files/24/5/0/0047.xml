This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the War Cabinet.  May 1919.     -       349SECRET.G-246.WAR CABINET.LIQUOR RESTRICTIONS COMMITTEE.Report to the War Cabinet.THE Committee appointed under the authority of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 544, Minute 3) to formulate a policy of relaxation and to consider the future poliby of the drink traffic report as follows : Essential Conditions of Future Control.1. The Committee unanimously reject the policy of allowing the powers of the Control Board to expire, without taking any steps to secure the continuance in some degree of the large improvement in sobriety, public order, and public well-being which has been effected during the war, or making any announcement of future action. Such a policy would be applauded by certain sections of the trade (whose avowed principle is uncompromising opposition to regulation in any form) ; but even in the trade large and important sections recognise that many of the war restrictions are beneficial from all points of view; and there is hardly anyone outside the trade who would support a proposal to return to the conditions of 1914. All over the country, moderate opinion expressly demands the continuance^ with suitable modifications and safeguards, of the essential principles of the regulations which have governed, during the war, the conditions under which intoxicants may be sold and consumed ; and if this opinion is flouted by a proposal to abandon the position in which the State now stands, criticism will arise on all sides that the Government are sacrificing national to sectional interests, and evading their plain responsibility.2. If the future policy is to be not merely negative, but is to secure the continuance of the essential principles of regulation now in force, it is a practical necessity that there should be no break between the abrogation of the essence of the existing restrictions and the inception of a scheme of control for the future, for which legislation, sooner or later, is necessary. Pending the Coming into operation of the proposed statute, which may take a few weeks or months, some existing authority must be instructed by the War Cabinet to maintain a proper form of interim regulation ; and the only existing authority possessing the necessary powers appears in fact to be the Control Board.3. We recommend, therefore, that the War Cabinet should issue instructions forth-with to the Control Board to continue to exercise their powers, pending legislatioh, which should be introduced as soon as possible ; and that Parliamentary publicity should be given to such instructions, without delay, and in any case before the Whitsuntide recess, the declaration being abcompanied by an undertaking that such interim exercise of powers shall be subject to ministerial, and consequentially to Parliamentary, control.4. The Committee further think that, whatever form the future control is to take, certain principles of regulation are in any event desirable, namely 1. &quot; Broken hours.&quot;2. Precautions against the sale of intoxicants at excessive strengths. 3. Constructive, as well as merely restrictive, measures, e.g., industrial canteens, reduction of unnecessary licences,* and the improvement of public-houses. 4. Removal of certain incitements to excessive drinking.5. All these principles are embodied in the work of the Control Board, particularly in the Carlisle and other direct control areas. Of the measures with regard to intoxicating liquor which have been taken by other departments* It should be recognised that objection will be taken in some quarters to the reduction of redundant liceuces, on the ground that the elimination of weak breweries and public-houses will materially strengthen the position of the trade, more particularly if assisted out of Parliamentary funds.
I during the war, we believe that the most important, from &quot;the point of view of future policy, is the maintenance of a proper price-level for drink in relation to the price-level of food and other necessary commodities. The maintenance of price-level depends in the last resort upon taxation, so that legislative measures under this head would form the subject-matter of a Finance Bill, rather than of any Bill dealing specifically with the regulation and control of the liquor traffic ; and we do not think it necessary to refer again to the price question.Alternative forms of future control. 6. The legislation necessary to secure control might take one of three forms.(a.) Regulation without purchase.7. The Government might set up Licensing Commissions in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland, which should exercise, subject to ministerial and Parliamentary responsibility, such powers as it might be thought desirable to continue, and should also have transferred to them the duties under the licensing laws now devolved upon the Home Secretary, the Secretary for Scotland, and the Chief Secretary for Ireland.8. Such an authority should be able to secure for the country most of the important gains which have been won by the action of the Control Board. It would, of course, be opposed by sections of the trade ; it would also have some opposition to face from the general public, and the Bill establishing it would be hotly contested. But it would be acceptable to the temperance party and the general mass of moderate opinion, and would probably go through the House of Commons with less opposition than would confront a more radical measure, especially if it were understood that it was not intended to prejudice future action. In the opinion of some members of the Committee, however, such a Bill is an alternative to, and would postpone, a State Purchase Bill.9. The Bill, which the alternative of regulation without purchase would involve, would be upon the lines of the Sale of Intoxicants Bill (Appendix A).(b.) Regulation combined with State Purchase by local option.10. As a second alternative, the Government might introduce a Bill which would not only establish Licensing Commissions, such as are contemplated in the Sale of Intoxicants Bill, but would also provide for a scheme of State Purchase in areas which elected for that course under a local option. The Commission set up under the Act might be empowered to prescribe areas within which decisions might be taken at stated intervals of, say, three years, as to whether the liquor trade in the areas should be purchased and carried on by the State or not. It would be necessary that the areas should be very large, often much larger than a single county, and probably on the scale of not more than about ten areas for all England and Wales: on no other conditions could the areas be made adequately self-contained, or extravagant compensation on account of severance avoided. The terms of purchase would have to be defined in the Bill; and though, in the first instance, the terms might be those recommended in the report of the Summer Committee, it is clear that those terms woukLnot continue to be applicable for an indefinite period, but would need to be revised later by Parliament; nor would they be applicable without somewhat elaborate supplementary provisions even on the first option.11. The legislation involved in such a course would resemble the Sale of Intoxicants Bill, with the insertion of a new part similar to the &quot; Clauses for State Purchase by-local option.&quot;   (Appendix B).12. It might be argued in favour of such a Bill that it would contain a clearer indication of constructive policy than the Sale of Intoxicants Bill (though the constructive measures embraced by the Sale of Intoxicants Bill, namely, canteens, reduction of redundant licences, and facilities for the improvement of public-houses, are substantial). It might further be claimed for a scheme of State Purchase by local option that it would provide machinery by which a system of State Purchase might be gradually extended over the country aB public opinion might demand, and from the point of view of the Treasury it might have some advantages over a comprehensive scheme of State Purchase embracing the whole country ab initio, inasmuch as : (a) there would be less likelihood of a general depreciation of Government stock, owing to the diffusion of the opinion that State Purchase was bad business ; (b) prices and profits in the State controlled areas would be kept up by the fact that over other parts of England the trade would continue to be in private hands, and conducted upon a basis
C admitting of considerable profits to private enterprise ; (c) it might be easier to carry through Parliament than a measure of State Purchase uno ictu. On the other hand, there is considerable weight in the argument that, if the Government is realty determined upon State Purchase, it would be better to carry out the transaction once and for all over England and Wales than to allow it to be carried out piecemeal upon the uncertain initiative of separate localities. From the Treasury point of view, it would undoubtedly be simpler to carry through the measure at one blow than to allow one locality after another to contract itself out of contributing to the revenue, even if the lost revenue were made good from the profits of the trade under State management; and, again, it is possible that . the City might be more prejudiced against a scheme of partial purchase by local option (which would place the State, as a manager of liquor businesses, upon a competitive instead of a monopoly basis) than against a scheme of universal purchase, in which case the adverse effect on Government credit of the capital commitments of the State would become more, instead of less, pronounced. It may also be urged that if the Government is convinced of the social and economic advantages of eliminating private interest from the liquor trade, it should have the courage of its convictions and carry the reform through boldly with as little delay as possible, and that there are a great many administrative difficulties in any scheme of purchase by local option which can be avoided under a more general scheme. There is, for instance, the difficulty of estimating compensation for severance, an element of very considerable net costliness which does not arise in the case of a national scheme. There is also the difficulty of delimiting areas, and the fact that the large areas contemplated have not yet been been considered by the professed advocates of local option as a principle.13. Finally, as regards the Parliamentary reception of such a Bill, it may be apprehended that a measure containing State Purchase by local option would meet with all the opposition of those who are against the principle of State Purchase, while at the same time it would secure less support from those who regard State Purchase as the sine qua non of effective temperance reform ; Avhile those who advocate the principle of local option would hardly be inclined to support local option for State Purchase unless it were combined with local option for prohibition. It is clear, however, that a local option for prohibition could not be conceded unless it wrere accompanied by compensation, since otherwise the anomaly would arise that in one area the trade would be bought out by the State at a price, while in another it would be extinguished by popular vote without a price. This is a proposal which Parliament and the country would never accept. But if compensation in prohibition areas is to be conceded, the corresponding anomaly arises that in a purchase area the State buys out the trade and recovers its purchase money from the profits, while in a prohibition area it buys out the trade at a heavy initial loss. Though it is true that revenue considerations should be subordinate to broader social and economic considerations, this objection certainly would be urged, and, in view of the present position of the national finances, with considerable force.(c.) National Purchase for England and Wales.14. The third alternative appears to be a Bill for National State Purchase for England and Wales, which would resemble the Licensed Premises (State Acquisition) Bill (Appendix C). The arguments for and against such a course have been so frequently canvassed by the War Cabinet&quot;, and are so familiar, that it appears unneces-sary to recapitulate them. The policy of national purchase, combined with local option for prohibition, was formally adopted by the War Cabinet after long discussions on the 31st May, 1917 ; this decision has never been reversed, and it is Lord Milner&apos;s opinion that the time has now come to implement it.15. Mr. Munro, speaking as Secretary for Scotland, strongly represents that, in view of the pending exercise next year of the local option provided by the Temperance (Scotland) Act 1913, and in view also of the present state of Scottish opinion, an attempt to apply a policy of State purchase in any form to Scotland at the present time is undesirable and impracticable.16. As between the three alternative policies of (a) continued regulation, with no provision for purchase ; (6) continued regulation, combined with purchase by local option; and (c) national purchase for one or more parts of the&apos; United Kingdom, the Committee are unable to come to any unanimous preference. Most of the members hold that, as a matter of broad principle, the policy of national purchase should be
regarded as the ultimate objective ; and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Thomas agree in stating that such a policy would be supported as a matter of principle by the Labour Party, whenever introduced. On the other hand, some believe that the present moment is inopportune for the introduction of such a policy, and that it would be impolitic to endeavour to force it. Others feel that legislation on the lines of the Sale of Intoxicants Bill would prejudice the passage at any early date of a Purchase Bill. The choice between the three alternatives turns partly upon the broadest considerations of general policy and finance, and partly upon an estimate of the present state of public opinion ; and in these circumstances the Committee feel that the most useful service that they can render is to present, as they have done, a statement which they believe to be impartial of the arguments for and against each alternative.17. Should the War Cabinet, consider that it is not possible to introduce this Session a Bill for national State Purchase, and that a policy of partial State Purchase by local option also presents practical difficulties too serious to be faced for the present, the Committee are of opinion that they should at the earliest possible dates announce an intention of introducing, and introduce, a Bill based on the present Sale of Intoxicants Bill. It would be a profound mistake to regard such a Bill as a weak or petty measure ; its adoption by Parliament would carry the promise of most substantial results, and would amount to a great reform in permanent licensing legislation.In view of the differences in the existing law, separate Bills for England and Wales, for Scotland, and for Ireland, would probably be required.It is necessary to add that the appended Bills have been prepared under great pressure, and must be regarded only as rough specimens; they require much careful revision by many Departments.H.
