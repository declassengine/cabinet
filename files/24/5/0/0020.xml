THE PEIME MINISTER informed the - Conference that the reason for the meeting was that he was anxious as to the position with regard to Tanks, and wished to be assured that we should be able to achieve the Tank Programme which was approved on the 9th March, 1918. He understood that Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt had certain criticisms to offer with regard to the organisation for the construction of Tanks, more particularly with regard to the personal aspect, and he invited him to state frankly and freely such criticisms as he had to offer, so that the Tank position might be thoroughly sifted and put on a sound footing so as to achieve the desired output.SIR TENNYSON d&apos;EYNCOURT read the following statement :-&quot; In view of the failure of Tanks as far as production is concerned, it has for some time been quite clear that it is absolutely necessary to have a strong Board of competent men with the necessary authority to deal with all questions both of design and supply.&quot;A reorganisation took place about a year ago, but, instead of making an improvement, things have grown steadily worse. Mr. Churchill spoke to me then, and I told him it was a mistake to upset the former organisation, which had been built up with care and forethought.&quot; I pointed out that Tanks were an entirely new development, and to discard the men who had successfully designed and produced them was a mistake. There was no field of choice of men who knew about Tanks. The intricacies of their manufacture are very great (there are over 2,000 standardised parts in each Tank, not counting the engines and guns), and all this requires quite a long training and most careful study.&quot; Therefore to bring in a new untried man as head and upset things was not wise. The event has proved this. A year ago I could only give an opinion of what would happen; now we merely have to look at the facts.&quot; Admiral Moore, who knew nothing of Tanks, was made Controller, the organisation was upset, the designs were pulled about, standardisation was disturbed, and the output declined.This is clearly shown by the curve of actual production of Tanks, which began to decline soon after the last reorganisation and has never regained its former level. I may, perhaps, say that Mr. Churchill told me he would be very glad of my assistance on any committee that was formed, and I have given freely all the help I could, and I think to some extent prevented worse things happening. But I confess to being rather tired of sitting on committees and listening to all sorts of proposals, none of which the committee had authority to carry out.&quot; About three months ago I told Lord Milner my views, and said it was necessary to have a Tank Board or Council with authority somewhat similar to the Air Board, and he generally agreed, and asked me to co-operate.&quot; After seeing him I also spoke to General Seely, and submitted, together with Colonel Stern and Admiral Moore, a scheme of reorganisation which is on the paper you have.&quot; If such a Board is formed with the necessary authority, I am sure the output can be steadily and continuously increased.&quot; I should propose to make use of practically all the Tank talent available, including Admiral Moore, who now knows a lot about it.- &quot; As we are to deal with munitions and supplies, I am convinced that the committee should be under the Munitions Ministry, with War Office represen-tatives (one or two), whose duty it will be to state clearly the Army requirements.&quot; I have been proposed as Vice-Chairinan under General Seely, and shall be VHI7 giad to serve, if it is so desired, and, having this possibility in view, I have obtained the permission.of the Third Sea Lord, who is my chief at the Admiralty, to devote more time to Tanks.&quot;Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt added that to the production of any war machine in considerable numbers all improvements were an enemy, and that if such improvements were not kept within reasonable bounds the production must be very seriously reduced. He urged that the people who should adjudicate as to the best compromise between alterations of design and output should be the people who thoroughly understood the business^ He therefore handed in to the Conference a paper with regard to a proposed constitution and organisation of a Tank Board : 
136&quot; The demand for mechanical warfare shows that the prospective supply of these weapons is far below the present needs of the High Command of the Allied Armies.&quot; The Minister of Munitfons has determined that a Tank Board shall be formed to formulate and cany out the Tank programme.&quot;The first duty of this Board is to determine the standard types and the number of Tanks required.&quot;The Board will be composed so as to constitute a reliable and efficient authority with full powers to deal with and settle all matters connected with the British programme and its co-ordination with the International programme.&quot; The Minister accordingly authorises the Board to arrange manufacture of these machines, placing orders with contractors as necessary, and corresponding direct with any Government Department concerned, also to incur any necessary expenditure in connection with accommodation, engagement and remuneration of inspection or other staff, experimental work, travelling and other incidental expenses. The Board shall have the final decision in all matters connected with the manufacture and inspection of these machines, and.shall have full power to depute to anyone of their number any specific duties connected with the above, and also to add to their number, if necessary. The Minister of Munitions will grant all facilities required by the Board for supply of labour and materials necessary for the Tanks. All payments for this work shall be made solely on the certificate of the Board, which shall be accepted as full and sufficient authority by ail Departments concerned.&quot; A Tank Board shall therefore be constituted as follows :  .&quot; President: General Seely.&quot; Yice-President: Sir E. d&apos;Eyncourt.&quot; Controller-General of Tank Design : Sir E. d&apos;Eyncourt (Chairman). &quot; Controller-General of Tank Construction : Colonel Sir A. Stern (Vice-Chairman). &quot; Military Representative : Colonel Fuller. &quot; Controller of Supply : Sir Percival Perry.&quot; Controller of Experimental   Design, as   opposed  to   Construction:Admiral Sir A. G. H. W. Moore^RN. &quot; Controller of Finance :&quot; Secretary (not a member) : Captain (to be promoted Major) A. Earl.&quot; Controller-General of Tank Design will be generally repousible under the President for all Tank business, including Design.&quot; Controller-General of Tank Construction, responsible for supply and co-ordinating British and Overseas Production as Commissioner.&quot; Director of Supply will deal with Supply, and Supply Drawing Office.&quot; Military Representative will keep Board fully informed of military require-ments, and will confer with Controller-General as to design.&quot; Director of Experimental Design will carry out Experimental Design and conduct all experiments.&quot;Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt remarked that he attached the greatest importance to the selection of the personnel of such a Board as he proposed, and he felt that, unless he generally concurred as regards the personnel selected, he was not desirous of acting as Vice-President of the Board in question.The Conference then proceeded to examine the actual production of Tanks ascompared with the estimate as set out in a paper by the Ministry of Munitions, datedthe 7th March, 1918, and approved by the War Cabinet on the 9th March, 1918. Fromthis it appeared that the estimate from April onwards was as follows :-April ... ... ... ... ... 160May ... ... ... ... ... 220.   ; June ... ... ... ... 362July ... ... ... ... ... 323August ... ... ... ... ... 401As against these figures the actual production was : April     ... ... ... ... ...   208. May     ... ... ... ... ...   127June     ... ...  .      ... ... ...   137July     ... ... ... ... ...   12!)August ... ... ... ... ...   ]31
ADMIRAL MOORE stated that he disagreed with the deductions of Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt, and explained that the drop in output in the early months after the change of organisation referred to by the latter was due in part to a large number of machines of a certain pattern being cancelled, and no new design being available to take their place, and that, as regards July, the production was affected by the influenza epidemic and the strike.MR. CHURCHILL added that production was also affected at the present moment by the decision of the War Cabinet to take away men from Tank production.ADMIRAL MOORE agreed that a change of policy would be a mistake, and that design and supply must go together, and that either a Tank Board or one person in supreme control was necessary for the maximum output. He considered that a Tank Board was perhaps too cumbersome, but that it was. imperative that the.organisation of supply and design should not be separated. He added that new sources of supply took a long time to build up, but, with the existing organisation behind us. he was of opinion that the Tank programme, as originally approved, would be achieved.MR, CHURCHILL stated that the present organisation was only arrived at after the most careful consideration on his part, in conjunction with Sir Arthur Duckham, and he had decided, in consequence, that Colonel Stern should be relieved owing to the serious deadlock which had arisen. The Military authorities had endorsed his action in this respect. The existing Tank Committee maintained relationship between the Tank Corps on the one hand and the Ministry of Munitions on the other. He now considered, however, that the time had arrived when the administration as regards Tanks should be reorganised, and he handed in a paper in which the reorganisation, as approved by him, was set out (see Appendix). Mr. Churchill pointed out to the Conference that until quite recently no demand for Tanks had been made by the War Office, but that they had worked to supply as made to them by the Ministry of Munitions. He was of opinion, after careful examination of the situation, that the full figure as set out until the end of April 1919 would be obtained provided that they had the support of the Government and received the proper quotas of men necessary for production. Mr. Churchill mentioned that since the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and General Harington had come to the War Office a reorganisation of the Tank Corps by the War Office had taken place, and that his reorganisation of the Ministry of Munitions in this respect, as set out in the Appendix, was designed to secure the full co-operation of the two Departments. He understood that this reorganisation had been gone into by Lord Milner, and, except as regards minor differences of opinion in connection with personnel, had been approved by him. The Tank Board was really a continuation of the old Tank Committee. It was not in any way analogous to the Air Board, but was a sub-department under the Ministry of Munitions. Mr. Churchill stated that the War Office were getting at the present moment all the Tanks that they could handle, and one of the reasons for their preference for Mark V Tanks was that they only took one-fourth of the men to man as compared with the Mark IV, and con-sequently, owing to shortage of men, the Mark IV was not now popular with the Army. He admitted that it was quite true that there had been changes in design, but changes in design had not taken place until a block of 500 Tanks or more had been made, and the open warfare which was now prevalent rendered many of the old designs obsolete. He had done his best to protect the production as far as possible, but it was quite impossible to cut oneself off entirely from alterations in design there must be a compromise between the two.COLONEL STERJST stated that, to get the maximum production, we must stick to one or two designs of Tanks, and that standardisation generally was necessary. He pointed out that: At the War Cabinet meeting on Tanks, 8th March, 1918, the Mechanical Warfare Department put forward a programme giving the number of Tanks which would be produced monthly for the four months, April, May, June, and July, of this year. They estimated a production of 160220 362 3231,065.
They have actually produced 134 150 167 104000,a shortage of 50 per cent.At a time when all other munitions of war show continuous increases, this Depart-ment has not reached the record of 200 per month made last year under the control of himself and his officers.He had been informed that a reorganisation of the Department is contemplated. It is again suggested that men totally new to mechanical warfare shall be put in charge of production in this Department.In his opinion the Tank programme has failed 1. Because at, a critical period the management was changed ; 2. Because the first law of quantity, production, has been broken by continual changes of design from Mark V to Mark V one star, Mark V two star, Mark VIII, Infantry supply, Medium B, Medium C;3. Namely, lack of a deciding authority from a production point of view.He was of opinion, in common with Sir Eustace d&apos;Eyncourt, Admiral Sir A. G. H. W. Moore, and Sir Percival Perry, that there must be a responsible body or Board under the Ministry of Munitions, with power to determine the standard types and the number of Tanks required, based on military requirements, and to settle all production matters connected with the British programme and its co-ordination with the inter-national programme.To this end we have put before General Seely a proposed Board.This, we consider, will ensure the highest possible production for the future requirements of the Armies by co-ordinating existing Departments, and utilising those most experienced in mechanical warfare supply.Colonel Stern added that naturally the Army asked for the best article, and it would then be for the Board to say how the Army demands could best be met. He stated that the United States and the French authorities were anxious to help, and we could only achieve the biggest production if we all worked together.SIR PERCIVAL PERRY, on being asked by the Prime Minister to express his views on the matter, stated that anything he had to say depended on the efficiency and the co-ordination ot the personnel of the administration. In his opinion, it was impossible to separate demand from supply, and he considered it highly undesirable to attempt to &quot; swap horses &quot; in the middle of the Tank programme. He pointed out that the Tank programme originally contained no less than eleven types, but this number had since been reduced, and he believed that the programme of the Ministry of Munitions, dated the 7th March, would be realised by April 1919. From his own experience, however, of the&apos; length of time taken to get into the methods of a Govern-ment Department, he could not contemplate any change being made without results disadvantageous to output, and therefore if these changes were made he could not guarantee that the programme would be met. As regards the output of Tanks, Sir Percival Perry stated that small firms were not adapted for rapid production, and that it was necessary to concentrate our efforts on big sources of supply. In the past we had had to rely for our deliveries on the Metropolitan Company, but now the North British Locomotive Company were fully. developed, and would be twice as efficient as the Metropolitan Company. He added that it took six months to create a Tank-producing company; consequently he assumed that our prospects were good, unless a change of policy affected the same in the manner set out above.(At this stage General Furse, Vice-Admiral Moore, Sir Percival Perry, Sir Arthur Duckham, Sir E. H. T. oVExjncourt, and Colonel Stern left the Conference.) [692] C
MR. CHURCHILL stated that, as regards personnel, he considered that a change was necessary, and consequently he proposed changes in the appointment of Vice-Admiral Moore, Mr. J. B. Maclean, and Sir Percival Perry, the latter of whom he wished to send to the United States on special service.A certain amount of discussion took place as to the suitability of Mr. Maclean for the appointment, and whether Colonel Stern should be reappointed to the Tank organisation.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that it must be admitted that the results of the Tank output were disappointing. As regards personnel, he was very anxious not to discuss the same as if it were a suit between two parties, but to consider what was the best method of getting the Tanks. He drew the attention of the members to the opinion of Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt that Colonel Stern should be reappointed, and pointed out the great services that Sir Tennyson had rendered the country with regard to Tanks, and that it would be a disaster if his services were lost owing to a difference of opinion as to the non-appointment of Colonel Stern. He pointed out that Sir Percival Perry had agreed that it was highly undesirable to change the personnel, and had urged the contention of Colonel Stern that there must be simplifica-tion of design. He thought that there was much in what these two latter gentlemen had said, and that a new man w^ould not be likely to pick up the threads of the work quickly. The Prime Minister understood that, apart from the question of personnel, there was little difference between the schemes as set out by the Minister of Munitions and Sir Tennyson cfEyncourt. As regards the reduction of output between April and August as compared with the estimate, the Prime Minister stated that the taking away of men from Tank production did not explain the falling-ofF in the numbers during May and June, and that it was imperative that we should tind some means of ensuring the required production by next year, with a view to enabling a decision to be obtained on the Western Front mainly with the aid of Tanks.GENERAL HARINGTON agreed that it would be possible to hope for big things on the Western Front if the War Office demand for Tanks was met.LORD MILNER stated that he concurred in the Tank organisation as approved by the Minister of Munitions.(At this stage of the Meeting the Dominion Prime Ministers entered.)MR. LLOYD GEORGE explained the reasons that had led up to the assembling of the Conference, and briefly narrated what had already taken place.SIR ROBERT BORDEN stated that he realised that it w^as necessary to strike a medium between production and design.MR. MASSEY agreed that it was necessary to change design occasionally.GENERAL SEELY stated that he thought it was possible to increase the output by reorganisation, and that he was responsible for the present scheme (Appendix) as approved by the Minister of Munitions. He considered that it was necessary, in the interests of output, to change the appointment of Vice-Admiral Moore, as he did not believe the present sj^stem under which that officer was working was a good one. General Seely mentioned that the Tank Board was now set up to solve the problem of the relative importance of design and production, and the only point at issue between the Ministry of Munitions and Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt was as to whether or not Colonel Stern was to be again employed. In reply to Lord Milner, who pointed out that in Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt&apos;s scheme no-one was appointed to his Board who had -actually used Tanks, General Seely remarked that that was an omission which he under-stood Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt was prepared to fill. General Seely added that it had been arranged that a Committee of Manufacturers should be formed. This Committee would meet4 weekly, and bring up any grievances they might have before the Tank Board, so that the closest co-ordination with the manufacturers might prevail. General Seely handed in to the Conference a return showing the fighting and auxiliary Tanks which we now had and which might be expected on the 1st January, 1919, and 1st Ma)r, 1919, which indicated the possibility of the Tank programme of the 7th March, 1918, being considerably augmented. He pointed out, at the same time, that the figures as shown in the return did not allow for wastage in the field, which must largely depend upon their use in action.   As regards the Mark IV Tanks, which were not now
In the favour of the army, he stated that he had been in action with them and con-sidered them a very valuable type. In connection with the proposed visit of Sir Percival Perry to the United States of America, General Seely explained the reason, which was connected with the practical development of a recently-invented engine of war.(Mr. Churchill undertook to give the Prime Minister further details ofthis invention.)ME,. LLOYD GEORGE stated that he was of opinion that we could not interfere with the Minister of Munitions as to the choice of the instruments he selected to carry out the programmes approved by the Government, but they would like him, in view of the discussion in regard to personnel that had taken place, to reconsider the question of the several appointments. Mr. Lloyd George was also of opinion that the 325 men (approximately) who had been taken away from the manufacture of Tanks should be returned by the Army, and with this view the whole of the Prime Ministers agreed.The conference of Prime Ministers approved in principle the creation of a Tank Board, as recommended by Mr. Churchill (see Appendix), and decided that The Army should release the 325 men (approximately) who had recently been taken under a decision of the War Cabinet, and return them to the Ministryof Munitions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., August 8, 1918.APPENDIX.Tank Organisation.The following reorganisation for the production of Tanks and their administration, up to the time when they are handed over to the Army, has been approved by the Minister of Munitions : 1. A Tank Board is to be created as under : The Deputy Minister of Munitions, President. Sir Tennyson d&apos;Eyncourt, Yice-President.General Sir W. T. Furse (M.G.O.) 1 -p .- Wo , , )ffinoColonel Fuller (G.S.) J ^presenting the Vv ar Office.General Elles or his Deputy, representing the Tank Corps in France. Controller of Tank Production, representing the Ministry of Munitions. Controller of Experimental Design, Testing, and Despatch, Chief Super-intendent Newbury. The Representative of the Anglo-American Commission.This Board will be responsible to the Minister of Munitions for administering the design, production, and delivery of Tanks to the Armies.It will meet not less than once a week, and will have in attendance representatives of Design, and of the Tank Production Committee.2. Thera will be two Controllers of Mechanical Warfare : (i.) Mr. J. B. Maclean, Controller of Tank Production, and Chairman ofthe Tank Production Committee, (ii.) Vice-Admiral Sir A. G.  PL W. Moore, Chief Superintendent  atNewbury and  Controller of Experimental Design, Testing, andDespatch.(iii.) A Tank Production Committee has been formed, consisting of the Chairman and General Managers of all the Companies producing Tanks. This Committee will be presided over by Mr. Maclean,-and will meet not less than once a week, either in London or in a convenient Provincial Centre.(iv.) The erection of the Tank Assembly Factory at Chateauroux, which has been delayed for various causes, has been entrusted to Messrs. Pearson and Son, with a director Mr. Hopkinson resident on the spot.
M. Loucheur will place an officer at the disposal of Messrs. Pearson, in order to avoid the difficulties and delays which have been caused in the past by imperfect appreciation of French methods, customs, and laws.If possible, the assembling of the Tanks will be commenced before the completion of buildings, so that the building and the assembling of Tanks may proceed simultaneously during the autumn months.This cannot be finally settled until Colonel Drain, the American Commissioner, has returned to this country, but in the meantime every eifort will be made to speed up the construction at Chateauroux.The labour difficulty for the erection of this factory can be met either by the provision of English military labour, from France (for which sanction would be asked from the War Cabinet), or by French or American labour, for which sanction would be necessary from the Versailles Council.(v.) The-provision of 10,000 Agricultural Tractors will be arranged for by Sir Percival Perry, who believes that 3,000 can be obtained from this country and the balance from the United States; the whole to be delivered by the 30th April next year. Sir Percival Perry will remain on the staff of the Mechanical Warfare Department of the Ministry of Munitions, and it will probably be considered best that the provision of these Agricultural Tractors should be placed under direction of the Tank Board.o
