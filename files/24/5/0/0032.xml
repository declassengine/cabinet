Worthington-Evans, Bart., M.P., Ministry of Pensions (Chairman).Mr. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., Financial Secretary to the Treasury. The Right Hon. Sir Robert Chalmers, G.C.B., Secretary to the Treasury.

Cox, K.C;B., K.C.M.G., C.S.I., India Office.Mr. G. M. Evans, Assistant Secretary, War Cabinet (Secretary).Report of the Committee.1. We have considered a report dated the 20th January, submitted by the War Office (Paper G.T.-6683) and a memorandum received from Dr. Macnamara (Paper G.T.-6704), together with a note entitled &quot; The Soldier&apos;s Wages,&quot; prepared by the War Office (Appendix).Permanent Increase or Bonus.2. With regard to Navy pay, an enquiry is being made by Admiral Jerram, who, we understand, has heard some forty witnesses at Portsmouth, and is now proceeding to take evidence at Plymouth. The Admiralty, however, is desirous that an announce-ment of an increase of pay should be made before Admiral Jerram&apos;s enquiry can have been completed, and the necessary consideration can have been given to his report. Moreover, the Admiralty state that in the course of three or four months, at the latest, it will be necessary to make a revision of pay and allowances and to settle the scales on a permanent basis. They urge that an interim increase of permanent pay should be announced forthwith.3. The War Office will be content with the announcement of a bonus without any statement with regard to any permanent increase of pay.4. On this part of the question referred to us we have come to the conclusion that it will be wise to make the increase of pay in both Services by way of bonus, in each case stating that a complete reconsideration of the scales of pay, separation, and other allowances, and of the terms of service generaUy will be proceeded with as soon as it is possible to settle the size and nature of the forces likely to be required in the future.Amount of Increase.5. Under ordinary conditions, it would he proper to compare the amount of earnings of similar skilled and unskilled men in civil occupations with the earnings and benefits of the non-commissioned officers and men, petty officers and seamen in the Services, and endeavour to arrive at the fair rate of increase founded upon such comparison.Mote. Mr. W.A. Bland. C.B., Financial Secretary to the Air Ministry, attended the meetings of the Committee. Major-General Seely was unable to attend either meeting of the Committee; but was representedai the first meeting by Brigadier-General F. 0. Festing.[1000] B
6. The^comparison is extremely difficult to. make, and still more difficult to explain in a convincing fashion, as many of the emoluments of the serving men are difficult to assess in money value, and elude comparison with civil expenditure, and though average cases can be taken, the majority of the individuals whom it is desired to convince will find reasons which differentiate themselves from the average.7. Moreover, the increases are frankly required as a means of pacification of unrest.8. The Admiralty and the War Office representatives state definitely that nothing less than the scale they propose would pacify.9. The increases, both for the Navy and the Army, must, we think, be announced at the same time, and be capable of comparison, and we think if Is. (id. for the private, with relative increases for superior ranks, is adopted for the Army, the nearest equivalent rates must also be adopted for the Navy.For whom are the Increases to be made 110. The Admiralty contend that it is impossible to differentiate between the permanent Navy and the hostilities men, and we accept their argument upon this point, so that whatever increase is given to the permanent Navy, must also be given to the hostilities men.11. The Army desire to differentiate between those who are retained for the Armies of Occupation (including the Regular Armies) and those others who will be demobilised. It is their belief that the difference in pay will tend to allay unrest among the soldiers retained for lengthened service.12. By the Armies of Occupation are meant non-commissioned officers and men now serving, who joined at a later date than a date in the year 1916, to be settled and publicly announced, and who are not over 41 years of age, and have not more than two wound stripes, and are not&quot; men selected as pivotal men or demobilisers, including the Pay and Record offices. All other men now serving will be deemed to be demobilisable men, and will&apos;not form part of the Armies of Occupation.The Armies of Occupation will include the Home Army, the Army of the Rhine, the Army of the Middle East, the detachment of the Far North of Siberia, and garrisons of the Crown colonies and India.13. It will be seen that until complete demobilisation there may be men serving in each of the armies, some of whom belong to the Armies of Occupation, and some of whom are waiting demobilisation. .Upon the original proposal of the War Office, the bonus would be payable only to those belonging to the Armies of Occupation, so that men serving side by side may be drawing different rates of pay.Date from which the Increase is to be made.14. The Admiralty urge that the increase should be dated back to the 1st October, as it was before that date they ascertained the claim for an increase of pay in the Navy.Admiral Jerram&apos;s interim report of his enquiry at Portsmouth confirmed the claim made by the witnesses that the increase should be antedated to the 1st October.The Admiralty in paragraph 7 of their memorandum call special attention to this fact, as they fear that pressure will be brought upon them to date back any increase given to sailors. The Admiralty, however, recognise the difficulty of a variation of dates in the increases of pay between the Navy and the Army. A note on this question signed by Dr. Macnamara and Admiral Tothill is attached. The Army claim that the bonus should be given to the Armies of Occupation from the 1st February.Conclusions.Navy.15. We recommend that a bonus should be given upon the scales proposed by the Admiralty (see Paper G.T.-6704), and that it should be payable as from the 1st February to the officers and ratings as proposed by the Admiralty, and that it should be accompanied by an announcement as suggested in paragraph 4 hereof.Army.16. .We recommend that a bonus should be given upon the scales proposed by the War Office (see Paper G.T.-6683) to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men retained for the Armies of Occupation, and that it should be payable as from the 1st February, and that it should be accompanied by an announcement similar to that suggested in paragraph 4.
17. In order to avoid unrest amongst the men not intended to be retained in the Armies of Occupation who are therefore demobilisable, we recommend that a bonus on half the scale granted to those retained in the Armies of Occupation should be paid to such of those officers and men as are not discharged from the Army by the 30th April. The bonus should be payable as from the 1st May, and should be paid with the war gratuity. An announcement to this effect should be made simultaneously with the previous announcement.Air Force.18. We recommend that the bonus should be given upon the scale proposed by the Royal Air Force in the report of Lord Londonderry&apos;s Committee, dated the 25th January, 1919 (Paper G.T.-6705), and that it should be payable as from the 1st February to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and men serving with the Armies of Occupation ; and, similarly, that a bonus based upon half the scale should be payable to demobilisable officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, who have not been discharged by the 30th April.Indian Troops in the Armies of Occupation.19. We recommend that the Secretary of State for India should consider whether the extension of the present six-monthly war gratuity given to the Indian troops in the Armies of Occupation will meet their case.Financial Effect of Recommendations.20. The Admiralty has submitted an estimate that the cost of the bonus to the officers, petty officers, and seamen in the Navy will amount to 6,000,000Z.The War Office have submitted an estimate that the cost of the bonus for officers in the Armies of Occupation will be 3,750,000Z.For other ranks the estimate is 34,000,0001. for twelve months.The Air Force have submitted an estimate for officers of 500,000Z. a year, and for other ranks 2,500,000Z. a year.The estimated cost to the British Treasury of the granC in respect of Indian troops is 260,000Z. a year.To these estimates must be added the cost of the half bonus to those not demobilised by the 30th April. If expectations are fulfilled, and all men not retained are demobilised within three months, no charge will accrue, and it is impossible to estimate what amount, if any, will actually become payable.General.21. The announcement of the Cabinet&apos;s decision should be accompanied by statements prepared by the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry respectively, emphasising the fact that a statement of pay alone is misleading.For the Committee: (Signed)      L. WORTHINGTON-EVANS, Chairman.January 25, 1919.Note by the Representatives of the Admiralty.THERE is a comment which we, representing the Board of Admiralty, feel compelled to make. We recognise the necessity from the War Office point of view to make the increase from, a prospective date ; and, realising the absolute impossibility of publishing at one and the same time two schemes, one for the Army and one for the Navy, coming into operation at different dates, we have acquiesced in the common date of the 1st February. But we have from Admiral Jerram that it is of the greatest possible importance that so far as the Navy is concerned, any increase now given should be antedated to the 1st October, 1918. The ad interim report of Admiral Jerram&apos;s Committee adds that his Committee &quot; are quite sure that, no matter how much labour or expense be involved, this retrospective effect is imperative.&quot; While, therefore, we have felt ourselves to have no alternative but to fall in with the 1st February for the time being, we feel bound to warn the War Cabinet that the petition that the increases now made and hereafter to be made should be antedated to the 1st October, F918, will be very seriously pressed upon us indeed.(Signed)     T. J. MACNAMARA.HUGH TOTHILL.
APPENDIX.The Soldiers Wages. (Note by the War Office.)AN impression prevails in many quarters that the services of the soldier, regarded not as a fighter but as a workman, are a form of cheap, or even of &quot; sweated &quot; labour. This arises from the fact that the soldier&apos;s &quot; pay,&quot; which in fact forms a comparatively small part of what he and his family receive from the State, is unthinkingly compared with the Workman&apos;s wages, which represent the whole return for his services. The fact that the workman gets the same wages whether he is married or single, while the soldier&apos;s family is given special &quot; separation allowances,&quot; makes an exact comparison difficult ; but the following figures will help to show the true position.The single workman pays out of his Wages for board and lodging, including house room, food, fire and light, cooking and attendance. If he lives in lodgings he pays his landlady a sum to cover all these services. If he lives in his parents&apos; home he pays enough, as a general rule, to cover not only his board, but to leave something over towards the support of the household generally, and when he leaves home on becoming a soldier, the State pays for him a separation allowance, to cover this benefit to the household, amounting to from 5s. to 12s. (id. a week.The soldier is put to no expense for board or lodging, or for contribution to the support of the home, and at the present time the sum which he saves under these heads, as compared with the single workman, may be fairly put at 25s. a week.Taking a married man, with an average family of three children, his wife receives from the State a minimum weekly payment of separation allowance of from 36s. M. to 41s., according to his rank. In London she receives 3s. (id. more for rent, and else-where, if her rent exceeds 4s., she- receives a special alloAvance from the Local War Pensions Committee. The husband&apos;s absence from home does not as a rule save anything in such items as rent or firing, but the cost of his food is saved. If he is sent back to live at his own home as a soldier, he is allowed 2s. Id. a day for this, and this sum (say 14s. (id. a week) may fairly be taken as the saving to the home when he is away.Thus, the married soldier with an average family saves, under these heads, on his own food and the maintenance of the home and family, from 51s. to 55s. (id. according to his rank (without counting any rent above 4s.), which as a workman he wrould have to find out of his wages.There are other items, such as clothing and boots, insurance and sick-clubs, free travelling for holidays, expenses in connection with games, &amp;c, of which the soldier, whether single or married, is relieved. These are equivalent to at least 4s. a week. Thus in order to compare the soldier&apos;s pay with the workmen&apos;s wages, 29s. a week for the single man, and 55s. to 59s. (id. (according to rank) for the married man, must be deducted from wages.The present range of fair industrial wages may be taken as from 45s. for unskilled labour to 75s. for fully skilled labour.   Agricultural wages are a good deal lower.Under the new scheme for the Armies of Occupation, the worst-paid man in the army will get a clear 21s. a week in cash. A soldier with over a year&apos;s service, or with a high standard of skill at his duties as a soldier, will get more. Thus, an infantry private of three years&apos; service and first-class proficiency pay will get 24s. (id. in cash. A soldier who is a skilled tradesman, and has the good fortune to be employed at his own trade in the army, will get considerably more. Thus, a highly skilled mechanic in the Royal Army Service Corps (Mechanical Transport Section), if ranking only as a private, will get in his first year of service 30s. Ad.; if a corporal, 41s. 5d. ; if a sergeant, 4Ss. 5d. A highly skilled fitter, or other man of the engineering trades employed as an armament artificer, ranks as a staff sergeant, and will get 49s. or 56s. a week clear cash.   In all cases Id. a day extra is given for each year of war service.The comparison, therefore, stands as follows : For the single men, adding 29s (as explained above) to the soldier&apos;s pay in order to make it compare with civilian wages, the soldier&apos;s wage is at the very least 50s. a week for the infantry private in his first year. For a skilled artificer private (R.A.S.C.), 59s, 4d. ; divto, corporal, 70s. 5d. ; ditto, sergeant, 77s. 5d. Armament artificer (Army Ordnance Department), 78s. or 85s.For the married man with an average family of three children the amount to be added is, for a private or corporal, 55s. ; sergeant, 57s. 6d. ; quartermaster-sergeant,
-59s. 6d.; making the soldier&apos;s wage at the very least 76s. ; (infantry private in his first year), artificer private, R.A.S.C, 85s. 4d ; ditto, corporal, 96s. 5d.; sergeant, 105s. lid. ; armament artificer (staff sergeant), 137s. 6d. or 144s. %d.These rates compare with those given above for industrial wages, viz., 45s. unskilled to 75s. fully skilled.It will be seen that the real wage of the married soldier with an average family is throughout over the standard ; that of the single soldier in the unskilled grades far over the standard ; and only in the case of some single men in the skilled grades is there any question of falling short.o
