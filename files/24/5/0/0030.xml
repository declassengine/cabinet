.fThia Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government]Printed for the War Cabinet.   January, 1919.SECRET. G.-230.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON THE TERMINATION OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE BRITISHWAR MISSION.(Previous Papers G.-2 2 9 and War Cabinet 501, Minute 11.)Sir,   * 27th December, 1918.I HAVE the honour to report that, in conformity with the instructions given to me by the War Cabinet, I have terminated the activities of the British War Mission as on the 31st December, 1918, in the following manner :  .1. The staff have been informed that their services will not be required after the above date, and instructions have been issued accordingly.2. The work hitherto performed by the, Department of Propaganda in Enemy Countries will be carried on in a modified form by Mr. S. A. Guest, who, I am informed, has been appointed to take charge of the Central European Section of the Propaganda Department of the Foreign Office. A detailed report of the work of the Department of Propaganda in Enemy Countries will be submitted separately in the course of a few days.3. (a.) The activities of the Italian Committee have come to a close. Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Alexander, the Chief Commissioner, will return to England, and, I am informed, will be in charge of the Italian Section of the, Propaganda Department of the Foreign Office.(6.) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Italy has consented to take over the direction of the Institutes at Rome, Naples, and Milan, which should now be developed along commercial lines, and the upkeep of which will entail an expenditure of approximately 100L per month per Institute.. (c.) The Institute at Florence deserves special mention and consideration, and, in my judgment, special treatment. It is an educational establishment with the following activities: (l.) To teach the English language in a scientific^way, in order to prepare Italian teachers of English for the Italian Middle Schools. It has already 160 students and four teachers in this connection. It also has two evening: schools, with separate teachers, one for workmen and the other for clerks and shop-people of both sexes. The first of these schools is attended by 40 workmen, the second by 50 students. - (2.) A reading room, supplied with a large number of English newspapers and reviews for the use of both Italian and English readers; and a club room for the use of Italian professors.(3.) The &quot; Vita Britannica Review,&quot; the object of which is to inform the most intel-lectual part of the Italian reading public with regard to everything that is English. The Review is published entirely in Italian, and the articles are by English writers, which are translated.   It is a bi-monthly publication.One of its most important objects is to introduce text-books descriptive of England and English statistics into the Italian schools. This institute has been extremely successful in Florence, having had as a close competitor the French Institute, which is a branch of the University of Grenoble, operating on the same lines and receiving 18,0001. per annum subsidy from the French Government. It se,ems to me advisable that our institute should, if possible, be constituted a branch of the University of Oxford, in order to raise its standing in Italy, and that it should receive a subsidy from our Government of 4,000Z. per annum, which would cover the entire expenses for the present, including the services of its resident director.

(4.) Instructions were given to dispose of all office accommodation rendered unnecessary by the above reconstruction, including office accommodation in Italy, Paris, No. 1(1, Curzon Street (which has already been handed over to the Office of Works), and Crewe House.(5.) I have directed the Accounting Officer to the Mission to settle all its financial liabilities, and to submit financial accounts to the Treasury at as early a date as possible. It is inevitable that claims must continue to be received for a few months, and in these circumstances I have asked the Treasury to sanction the appointment of Mr. P. W. Needham to deal with these after the 31st January, 1919.I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to place on record our appreciation of the service rendered to this mission by Mr. S. A. Guest and Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander, both of whom have been unremitting in the discharge of their duties, which they have performed with entire satisfaction during the occupancy of their respective offices under this mission.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) CAMPBELL STUABT, Chairman.The Secretary, War Cabinet.&quot;
