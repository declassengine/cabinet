[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government,]    552Reprinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1919.SECRET.G.-259. * ?    70(Revise.)v WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAYThird Interim Report.Pay, Allowances, Half-Pay and Retired Pay of Officers of the Army, and the Pay ofMedical Officers of the Royal Air Force.(Previous Papers-G.-252,*G.-l;52a, G.-254.)1. IN their First Report the Committee were able in the case of Army officers to put forward proposals onlyffor the basic rates of pay and allowances. They have now examined further proposals made by the War Office, and submit herewith in a detailed form their recommendations for the future conditions of service for officers in the Army generally, including proposals^ for pay, retired pay, half-pay, and such allowances as were not dealt with in their First Report.Pay.2. The new rates of pay proposed for the Army are shown in Appendix I.It will be remembered that, in their First Report, the Committee expressed the view that the rates of pay should be uniform throughout the Service, except where the duties of a particular arm are essentially those of a special profession, such as medicine or civil or mechanical engineering; and the normal rates shown in Table 1 of Appendix I will apply without any additions to all the purely Combatant Services, the Labour Corps, and the Stationery Corps.3. Technical Corps. With regard to corps such as the Royal Engineers, the Royal Army Service Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and the Army Pay Corps, it is considered that the technical nature of their duties should entitle such officers as have technical qualifications, according to the standards set up in civil life, to draw emolu-ments additional to the normal rates.In the case of the Royal Engineers, such additional pay will be granted only to officers who have qualified as A.M.I.C.E., A.M.I.M.E., or A.MJ.E.E., or who hold other equivalent qualifications.In the case of the Royal Army Service Corps, the additional pay will be granted only to officers who have qualified as A.M.I.C.E., or who hold other equivalent qualifi-cations. It has been considered whether, it would not be possible to confine the additional pay in the Royal Army Service Corps to officers of the Mechanical Transport Branch who hold the necessary qualifications, but as this course would undoubtedly tend to prevent transfers from one branch to another within the Corps, it is not thought desirable to draw this distinction.4. Staff Pay. Consolidated rates of pay for the staff have been abolished, and officers holding staff appointments will in future draw pay and allowances; but it is considered that, in view of the heavier nature of the duties they hare to perform, and of their special qualifications, these officers should still receive higher pay than regimental officers. The rates proposed are shown in Table 3 (War Office Staff) and Table 4 (Staff in Commands) of Appendix I.General Officers Commanding-in-Chief (First and Second Class Commands).These officers were formerly on consolidated rates, but the new rates of pay and allowances together with the fact that they will be subject to the civilian rate of income tax will have the effect of reducing their total income. The War Office have therefore proposed special rates of pay as follows : General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (second-class command), 71. lOs. per day. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (first-class command), 10L per day. [922] ^   B *
The Treasury would prefer that the special responsibilities of these officers, especially as regards entertaining, should be recognised by increased table money rather than by increases in the normal rates of pay of general officers of the same rank. The War Office would agree to this course only if it were understood that the total emoluments (pay, allowances, and&apos; table money) were the same for a particular command whatever the rank of the officer holding the command.In these circumstances, and after full consideration, the Committee have agreed to the original proposal of the War Office that the pay of an officer holding a first-class command shall be 10L a day, and of an officer holding a second-class command 71. 10s. a day.5. Cost Accounting Department. These officers are at present graded for pay in classes laid down for quasi-staff appointments, and it is proposed by the War Office that they should receive the new rates for those classes as shown in Table 4 of Appendix I. It is urged in support of this proposal that it will not be possible to pay these officers less than other officers of similar grading, nor will it be possible to de-grade them. The Chairman and the representatives of the Treasury, on the other hand, desire to point out that the pay of these officers was settled as recently as the beginning of this year. It was then fixed in accordance with the salaries men of similar qualifications would be entitled to in civil lift?, and the quasi-staff gradings of the officers were fixed according to the pay drawn. It is urged, therefore, that it would be both illogical and unnecessary that, their pay,having first of all determined their grading, that grading should now be used as an argument in favour of increasing their pay.The Committee, after full consideration, recommend that these officers shall each be reduced in grade by one class, and shall then draw the new rates of pay appropriate to the classes in which they are placed.6. Schoolmasters. Schoolmasters (other than Inspectors of Army Schools, who will be paid as quartermasters) are sergeants or warrant officers, and will be paid as such. The Committee, while they see great difficulty in denying to schoolmasters the pay of the rank they hold, yet feel they must point out that such pay is in excess of civilian rates for men of analogous qualifications. It is understood, however, that the reorganisation of this Department is under consideration.7. Royal Army Chaplains Department. The rates of pay which the War Office originally proposed for this Department were 11. a day on appointment, rising by 5s. a day ever3r five years to a maximum of 21. 10s. a day. The organisation of the Department has not yet, however, been finally approved by the Army Council, and it has therefore been suggested by the War Office that approval should be given for the assignment to this Service of the amount of money involved in the original proposals and that the Army Council should be authorised to settle the details within that limit.   ,To this suggestion the Committee are prepared to agree, on the distinct understanding that in settling the details of the scheme the Treasury should be consulted.8. The Royal Air Force Medical Service. The Committee in their First Report recommended that the rates of pay for medical officers of the Royal Air Force should be the same as for officers of similar ranks in the Army. It appears, however, that officers of the former Service will be called upon to do a certain amount of flying for the following reasons : (a.) In order to keep in constant touch with the flying personnel and to obtain apersonal realisation of their experiences and risks in the air. (b.) On account of the exigencies of the Service, both because it may be necessaryto visit neighbouring aerodromes by this means and in view of the almost,certain use of aeroplane-ambulances in future, (c.) The general knowledge of the physiological and pathological effects of flyingis very incomplete, and researches can only be carried out under actualflying conditions.The Committee therefore agree to certain modifications suggested by the Air Ministry in applying the scale of pay for the Royal Army Medical Corps to the Royal Air Force Medical Service.The proposed scale is shown in Appendix II.
Allowances.9. Most of the allowances for officers in the Army have already been dealt with in the First Report of the Committee, and it is only necessary to mention here the following : (a.) Furniture Allowance. It has already been agreed that unfurnished quarters and a furniture allowance shall be granted to married officers who have attained the rank of captain or the age of 30. It is now recommended that this allowance should be at the rate of 2s. a day, and that it should be granted, in addition to those officers above mentioned, to officers already married at the time of the announcement of this allowance, even although they have not attained the rank of captain or the age of 30. This will not apply to officers who under the existing regulations are entitled to furniture allowance in excess of this amount.(b.) Outfit Grant. The War Office propose that an amount should be allowed on first appointment equal to the cost of the provision of the necessary outfit. The Committee, while they are in agreement with the principle that some allowance should be made towards the cost of the initial outfit, feel that the Exchequer should not be committed to the whole of the cost until an estimate of this cost can be given and, as this is not yet available, they recommend that the question of the amount of the allowance shall be settled between the War Office and the Treasury.Retired Pay.10. The new scheme of retired pay for officers of the Army is shown in Appendix III. It will not apply to the Royal Army Chaplains Department, the scale for which will be settled between the Treasury and the War Office.The new rates will apply to all future pensioners and to officers who have served in the present war.Half-Pay.11. The new scheme of half-pay for officers of the Army is shown in Appendix IV.General.12. Future Revision of Rates. It is understood that all the rates of pay, retired pay, and half-pay shown in the Appendices will be subject to revision in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet respecting the rates for the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force and the normal rates of pay for Army officers, namely : &quot; 20 per cent, of the new rates of pay, half-pay, and retired pay shall be considered as due to the present high cost of living, and shall be subject after five years to change, either upwards or downwards, according as the cost of living rises or falls ; the revision thereafter to take place, every three years up or down on the basis of the Board of Trade Food Prices Index Number.&quot;13. Dates of Increases. It has already been decided by the War Cabinet that the new rates of pay, allowances and half-pay for the Army should take effect from the 1st July, 1919, and the new rates of retired pay from the 1st April, 1919.14. War Gratuities and Income Tax. With regard to the effect of the new rates of pay upon war gratuities and the liability of officers for civilian rates of income tax, the Committee recommend that the rates should be subject to the conditions set out in their First Report, namely (a.) War gratuities shall be assessed on existing, rates of pay. (6.) Officers shall pay civilian rates of income tax as from the end of the present financial year.15. Cost of Proposals for the Army. It is estimated that the cost of the new proposals for the Army is as follows : Additional Annual Cost.  Increased pay and allowances        ... ...   3,200,000Children&apos;s allowance to the 31st December,1919 (non-recurring) ... ...   1,000,000Retired pay inormal)       ... ... ...   1,250,000These figures, except for children&apos;s allowance, are based on pre-war (1914-15) establishments and rates-that is, on an establishment of about 10,600 officers.
16. Comparison of Increases in Navy and Army. As stated in the last paragraph, the estimated cost of the proposed increases in pay and allowances for the Army is in round figures 3,100,0001, with an additional sum estimated at 110,0001. representing the cost of the increases as regards Territorial Force officers during training, &amp;c. The figure of 3,100,000Z. is based on an establishment of about 10,600 officers, and represents an average increase over pre-war rates of emoluments of 292/. per officer.The estimated cost of the corresponding increases in pay and allowances for the Navy is, based on a number of 11,000 officers, approximately 2,484,0001., an average of 2261. per officer.It is found on further examination that if pay alone is taken the average increase per officer in the Army, including Staff and Commands, is 2221., and in the Navy 209Z., and this latter figure is almost identical with the average increase in the Army if it were calculated on the regimental rates only and excluding Staff and Commands.The explanation of the disparity between the average increases in the Navy and the Army lies principally, therefore, in the large additions given by way of allowances to Army officers.The increases in Allowances in the Army are chiefly accounted for by the following two items : Increase.(a.) Lodging, fuel and light, and ration allowances ... 482,0001.* (6.) Outfit allowance       ...............     75,0001.*With regard to (a) the grant of rations or allowance in lieu is entirely new, since it did not exist before the war. Further, the.amounts of all these allowances in (a) depend upon the cost of living, and are subject to revision annually when the Army Estimates are gone into. It is clear also that allowances under these heads will naturally cost more in the case of the Army, whose officers live always on shore, than in the case of the Navy, whose officers generally live on board ship. It should further be pointed out that the figure of 482,000L for these allowances may be subject to reduction, as it is understood that the War Office have now agreed that the new rates for lodging, fuel and light shall apply to married officers only.With regard to (b) this also is a new charge, as no outfit grant was made before the war.Summary of Recommendations. The Committee recommend 1. The rates of pay, retired pay, and half-pay for the Army set out in Appendices I, III, and IV respectively.2. That approval should be given for the assignment to the Royal Army Chaplains Department of the amount of money involved in the proposals for the pay of this Department originally made by the War Office (paragraph 7 above) and that the Army Council should be authorised to settle the details with the Treasury within that limit.3. That furniture allowance should be at the rate of 2s. a day, and should be granted to married officers who have attained the rank of captain or the age of 30, and also to officers who were married before the announce-ment of this allowance, even though they do not fulfil either of the above conditions. This will not apply to officers who under existing regulations are entitled to furniture allowance in excess of this rate.4. That approval should be given to a grant being made to officers on first appointment towards the initial cost of outfit, the amount of the grant to be decided upon by the Treasury and the War Office in consultation.5. The rates of pay for the Royal Air Force Medical Service set out in Appendix II.6. That the rates of pay, retired pay, and half-pay should be subject to revision in accordance with the War Cabinet decision (paragraph 12 above).7. That as regards war gratuities and income tax the new rates should be subject to the conditions set out in the Committee&apos;s First Report (paragraph 14 above).H. A. L. FISHER (Chairman).G. Myrddin Evans (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., August 14, 1919.* These two together show a total of 557,000^., out of a total increase for allowances estimated at 744.000Z.

In the case of the Navy the War Cabinet have approved of these officers being treated as re-employed retired officers as from the date they were due for compulsory retirement. It is understood that the War Cabinet were under the impression that no similar cases arose in the Army. This is not so. There are large numbers of officers similarly situated, and if they were treated as called-up officers they would have drawn pay and pension. Their position will be further considered.(d.) Staff College Graduates. An officer who (1) has graduated in the Staff College &quot;(p.s.c.)&quot; or (2) passed the final examination of the Advanced Class Ordnance College &quot; (p.s.c. 2)&quot; will, after holding a Staff appointment and on relinquishing the pay of that appointment, be entitled to ls.

Stafi Pay in Commands.In fixing staff rates, the following general principles have been observed : 1. A normal rank has been assigned to each staff appointment, and the pay of the appointment has been based thereon.2. For junior staff appointments the regimental pay of the grading of the appoint-ment has been increased by an amount of staff pay equal to about SOL a year for appointment not below General Staff Officer 3rd Grade, and 3s. a day for lower grades.3. For staff appointments with grading of 1 &apos;olonel or higher rank special rates are fixed, based on pay of rank, but varying therefrom if the duties or responsibilities are not equivalent to those of the normal rank. The rates proposed are as follows : (a.) Posts above Major-General.General Officers Commanding-in-chief (special rates) 1st Class Commands, 10L per diem. 2nd Class Commands, 71. 10s. per diem.General (not in command), 71. per diem.

Inspectors of Works.These officers are graded for pay as Civil Servants and receive Civil Service rates, together with war bonus. It is proposed that the existing scales with war bonus shall be made permanent. &apos; For example, the grade which is at present on the scale 2001. to 500Z., with Civil Service war bonus, receives 300Z. to 660Z.; and the scale for this grade will be made permanent at these rates. So for the other grades. In addition, officers will receive rations or allowance in lieu.Note. The War Office proposed that these officers should cease to draw war bonus that has been authorised, and should receive in lieu an addition of 50 per cent, to their existing rates of pay, with rations or the allowance in lieu.11a. Cost Accounting Department.These officers are at present graded for pay in classes laid down for quasi-staff appointments. uIt is proposed that they shall now be reduced in grade by one class, and shall draw the new rate of pay appropriate to the classes in which they are placed.

PROPOSALS AS TO RETIRED PAY OF ARMY OFFICERS.1. It is proposed that, in assessing an officers retired pay, regard shall be had both to his rank and to the length of his service. The extent to which these elements shall count in arriving at the officers retired pay is as follows : Service Element. 150Z. after fifteen years&apos; service ; 15Z. for each year over fifteen. Rank. Element. 121. for each year as Major up to 1201.Lieutenant-Colonel, 1201., rising by 30Z. a year to 240Z. Colonel, 2401., by 50Z. to 390Z. Major-General, 390L, by 501 to 540Z. Lieutenant-General, 540Z., by 50Z. to 690Z. General, 690Z., by 50Z. to 840Z.The retired pay of officers under these proposals would be subject to maximum rates as follows : Per annum.Captains and Subalterns, maximum retired pay Majors ,, ,,Lieutenant-Colonels ,, ,,Colonels ,,Major-Generals Lieutenant-Generals ...

Temporary rank held in the war, followed by substantive promotion, shall count as service towards retired pay of that substantive rank; and, subject to this, service in the temporary rank of Brigadier-General or higher rank during the war, will count as service in the rank of substantive Colonel, or lower rank.4. An officer will not be granted the retired pay of his rank until he has completed one year&apos;s service in it. If he retires earlier, the rank element of his retired pay will be the rank element already earned.5. An officer with ten and less than fifteen years&apos; service may retire with a gratuity of 100Z for each year of service.6. The scale of retired pay shall apply to Quartermasters up to and including the rank of Major, service in the ranks reckoning under the existing rules : i.e., Non-Commissioned Officer or Warrant Officer Class 2 counts as half officers service, Warrant Officer Class 1 counts as officers service.7. The present conditions as to age for voluntary and compulsory retirement will continue to apply. .8. The new rates shall apply to retired officers who have rendered satisfactory service during the war and to any officers who have retired since the 11th November, 1918. &apos;9. Retired Pay (and Gratuities in lieu) of Warrant Officers and Non-commissioned Officers commissioned from the Ranks. Under this head are included also non-commissioned officers and men who were serving on normal peace attestations, and who were granted-permanewt commissions or temporary commissions under the special conditions of Army Order 159 of May 1918.The following proposals are made :-(a.) Gratuities. Gratuities granted to these officers shall be increased by 50 per cent, and an additional gratuity of 200Z. for Major and 500Z. for Lieutenant-Colonel shall be granted, provided in either case that the rank has been held in the aggregate for 182 days, any period of less than 182 days in the higher rank counting towards the qualifying period of service in the lower rank.(6.) Retired Pay-The minimum retired pay shall be increased from 80Z. to 150Z. per annum.

The rates proposed are as follows : General Officers (the same as for the Navy) Ma j or- GeneralLieutenant-GeneralGeneralField-Marshal...    s.2   5 per diem. 2 15 3   5 1,800 a year.Other Officers Colonel, Major, and lower ranks (including Quarter-masters)Lieutenant-ColonelRate of Half-Pay.
