.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government^Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1918SECRET.G.-210.War Cabinet.Northern Neutrals Committee.Holland Despatch of Convoy to Dutch East Indies. (Previous Papers G.-153, 184, 186, and 206, and G.T.-4710 and 4744).WITH reference to War Cabinet 425, Minute 16, relative to the despatch of a convoy from Holland to the Dutch East Indies, the Northern Neutrals Committee have had under consideration a further report from the Foreign Office, Paper G.T.-4744.With regard to the alternative proposals therein set forth, the Committee decided that iu the first instance it would be desirable that the Foreign Office should address to the Dutch Government an unambiguous statement that we cannot possibly agree to abandon the right of search which this country has consistently upheld and enforced, and which, having regard to our present blockade policy, has grown in importance.At the same time, however, the Foreign Office should communicate&apos; with the British Minister at The Hague, and authorise him, in view of the importance of keeping on friendly terms with Holland at the present time, to be prepared, if necessary, to offer a compromise to the Dutch by which we undertake not to search those particular vessels on this particular outward journey, in return for specific guarantees to the following effect: (a.) Full particulars of the cargo and passengers on board any merchant ship sailing in the convoy to be furnished to us in the same way as is now done by the Netherlands Oversea Trust in respect of ships under their control,, the ships not being allowed to sail until our authorities have been satisfied that all is in order.(6.) The vessels under the Dutch naval flag (including the converted auxiliary cruiser) not to carry any merchandise or passengers (other than Dutch Government officials); the term &quot; merchandise,&quot; however, not to include stores certified to be for the exclusive use of the Dutch colonial authorities, provided always that such stores contain nothing wholly or partly of enemy origin, this in accordance with the official undertaking contained in M. Loudon&apos;s note to Sir A. Johnstone of the 15th November, 1916, that &quot;le Gouvernement de la Reine ne fera transporter des Pays-Bas aux colonies pour les besoins publics que les articles de provenance neerlandaise ou neutre.&quot; Full particulars of all goods or passengers on board any of the warships to be furnished in good time for consideration by the British authorities.(c.) The Dutch undertaking not to carry mails to cover every kind of corre-spondence, printed matter, and parcels, except official despatches.I This, in effect, means that we treat the vessels under the rules now in force withI regard to ships under the control of the Netherlands Overseas Trust, with the exception1 that we shall not enforce our right of search, which, as a matter of fact, has not beenS done in practice with regard to such vessels in the past.Hitherto, the Dutch have been mainly actuated by a desire to maintain theirneutrality in this war, and it is therefore probable that they may accept the aboveI compromise, but, as important issues are at stake, it is necessary to bear in mind thatI the possibility exists that they may refuse to accept the compromise.   In this case,.owing to the imperative necessity of maintaining the right of visit and search, so as toI [421-1]Ii I
ensure the efficiency of the Blockade, it may become necessary for the British Govern-ment to order the seizure of the Dutch merchant ships. This may lead to a very serious situation, and may even result in a state of war between the two countries, which it is in our highest interests, both on military and naval grounds, to avoid. Such an order should therefore not be given before the matter has again been most carefully considered in all its bearings.J. C. SMUTS.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., June 5, 1918.
