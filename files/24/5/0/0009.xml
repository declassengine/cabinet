Regular consultation, under the chairmanship of a member of the War Cabinet,on questions of economic policy and administration ; 2. The settlement, without reference to the Cabinet, of minor details of policywhich are now often brought before the Cabinet for want of any othermachinery of co-ordination ; 3. The presentation to the Cabinet in matters of first-class importance of proposalswhich have received the joint consideration and, if possible, the assent ofall the Ministers concerned ; 4. The prevention of overlapping ; and5. The establishment of a body which could follow up decisions.We anticipate that the results of the establishment of the Committee would be 1. The presentation by degrees of a complete and consistent policy within theeconomic sphere ; 2. The prevention of friction between the Departments ; 3. The saving of the time of the Cabinet;4. Security for the due execution of any policy which had been agreed upon.We believe that the Departments most concerned would welcome the establish-ment of such a Committee and find their work greatly facilitated by it. It would afford to the Ministers that opportunity of consultation which in ordinary times takes place in Cabinet, but for which no adequate provision is made under our present system.We accordingly recommend 1. That a Committee of Economic Defence and Development be appointed;2. That this Committee should be a Cabinet Committee, consisting of a member of the War Cabinet as chairman, together with the Minister of Reconstruc-tion, the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Blockade (who would also represent the Foreign Office), the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and India, the Minister for Labour, and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury;3. That the Committee should meet regularly once a week at a fixed hour; 4. That the Committee should have wide powers to deal within their discretion with any economic questions, and should refer to the War Cabinet only such large questions of policy as require Cabinet sanction or questions . upon which they have been unable to agree ; [510]
5. That the Committee should have authority to call for reports as to the execution of the measures decided upon ;6. That the Secretary of the War Cabinet should be instructed to refer to the Committee economic questions before they are brought to the Cabinet, unless there are special reasons to the contrary, and the Secretary of the Committee should be a member of the War Cabinet Secretariat, so that the work of the Committee may be properly co-ordinated with the general work of the Cabinet.(Initialled) Gr. N. B. (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., June 4, 1918.
