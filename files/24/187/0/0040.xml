S0A0Colonial Office, S.W.1. July 5th,  19270
ADEN:    Proposed reply to tho jCmarncAs the Imam has been assured on several occasions, His Majesty1s Government do not desire to interfere in any way with his independence in his own territory in the Yemeni     His Kajesty?s Government are quite unable to acquiesce in his occupation of parts of the territory of tribes with whom they are in treaty relations, and such warnings as were contained in my last communication to him plainly applied only to reprisals for acts of aggression committed or to be committed by him. His Majesty&apos;s Government are,  as heretofore, fully prepared to recognise the Imamls independence in his own territory, but they must insist, no loss firmly, on their own rights within the boundary of the Aden Protectorate.      Provided this is clearly understood from the outset,  the ImamTs plenipotentiary will be -welcomed and a friendly agreement In general terms will be easy to arrange.     Once such an agreement Is signed and ratified, all other outstanding questions can be discussed In a friendly spirit.      In making this explanation His Majesty&apos;s Government are animated by the desire that negotiations, if opened again, shall not fall for a third time.
