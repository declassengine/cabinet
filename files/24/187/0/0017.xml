PEKTNG AND TIENTSIN.1.    The Committee met to consider -(i) The effect of recent developments on the Gov srnr: er.t&apos; s policy in regard to Peking and Tientsin:(ii) The possible withdrawal of theIndian Mixed Brigade from China.The Committee took into consideration -(a) Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No3 . 10 and 20 of May 25th, in which he pointed out that the question of evacuation had ceased&quot;to be academic and had become practical, and in which he once again reviewed the whole situation, recommending, with the concurrente of the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding Shanghai Defence Force, the immediate transfer to Tientsin of a Erigade from the Shanghai Defence Force;(b) Sir mile La2xpson&apos;3 telegram No.28 of May 26th and a telegram from General Duncan of the same date reporting that the Japanese Government were at once despatch-ing cme Mixed Erigade to tsinan-fu-fu*,(c) The record of a conversation between Mr Mounsey and the First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy from which it appeared that while the Japanese Government would not commit them-selves to any definite assurances beforehand they would probably, when it came to the point, do everything possible to avoid an evacuation of Tientsin, provided that they con-sidered the defence of Tientsin practicable.ft-7Sir Laming worthington.cn-Evans said that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegrams Nos. IS and 20 contained all the political arguments on the subject, and that from the military point of view the Chiefs of Staff would probably adhere to their previously-expressed opinion that two Divisions were the minimum force necessary for holding mientsin and keeping open the lines of communication..   But the question of the immediate evacuation of Peking had now arisen in a concrete form. . If we were not to defend Tientsin-1-
it wouid perhaps he right tc begin the evacuation 0* Peking, though it migh^ perhaps be premature.   We could not defend Peking in any event, tut if v-e could defend Tientsin then it might be possible to delay the evacuation of Peking,    The question was, What steps can we take to defend Tientsin?   Fven if we could spare a Brigade frocr. Fongkeng and a Brigade from Shanghai, this force would not in itself be sufficient.   The only thing to do, therefore, waa to e-ontinue to press the Japanese, through the diplomatic channel, to undertake the responsibility for Tientsin.Mr Churchill said that he disagreed profc\indly both with the proposal to evacuate Peking and with the suggestion that we should send a large body of troops to Tientsin.    To evacuate Peking when the enemy were five to seven hundred -riles away was mere panic. He was against starting an echelon of flight before danger was in sight.    Since the evacuation plan was drawn up the situation had altered.    Chiang Kai-shek was perhaps not friendly, but he was different from the Chen-Borodin clique.    Ever, though the Nationa-list forces occupied North China it did not fellow that, if you had reasonable forces in Peking, British subjects and the Legation could not remain there in peace.    He was therefore for promptly forbidding the flight fror: Peking.    We should imitate the Japanese, who had no intention of evacuating Peking and were not afraid of putting a srrall force in the middlfi of China.    They knew xaovs about China than we did;    as much, for example, as wa did about India. He was equally opposed to establishing a new Shanghai commitment at Tientsin.    Japan should bear the brunt, and if the burden were left to her she would act when the time came.    Wa ought,  therefore, to remain :it-2-
Pekinrc and 3&amp;&amp;&quot;Wfte.t the other Powers did,    &apos;re ought to send to Tientsin not a large force hnt e. moderate quota, proportionate to the contingents of other Powers.    We ought not to make ourselves too prominent either &quot;by evactiatinp; prematurely or by rushins? large forces to Tientsin.Sir Austen Chamberlain said that the idea that the British Legation should withdraw from Peking independently of other Legations filled him with horror.    It would point to a state of panic which would react lamentably upon our prestige and would also be a matter of reproach by other Powers.    T-&apos;0 intensely disliked the prospect of the Legation leaving Peking at all, even for Tientsin;    he still more disliked the prospect of its going if other Legations stayed;    and he disliked even more the proposal that the Legation should be transferred to Wei Rai-wei.    The conclusion which, as Foreign Secretary, he desired to reach was that it was not necessary for either British subjects or the British Legation to evacuate Peking;    that if it became necessary for them to move they should move when others moved;   and that when they moved they should move to Tientsin.    He did not think we could look farther ahead than that for the moment.    The problem was, however, a military one.    We did not want a new siege and a new relief of the Legations.    To his mind, what was indicated at this stage was not a large move of British troops northward but moderate reintforc errant of our troops &quot;both at Tientsin and in the Legation quarter.    The decision must, of course,be governed by military considerations, but he could-not help feeling that it was premature for us to run away from Peking when the Japanese were placing small-s-
forces between Peking and th-- advancing Soxitherners . He agreed that the Japanese knar a- great dsal about China and had never been so alarmist as we had.    They had perhaps been too secure about Shanghai, but if they felt it safe to place limited forces at tsinan-fu and Tsingtao was it reasonable of us to be afraid of the situation in North China wher there were already 6,000 men at Tientsin?Mr Bridgeroan said that he agreed with Mr Churchill Lord Balfour said that if there were a r:is fortune at Peking .in which all the Legations were involved we should be sharing in an international misfortune and not bearing the brunt alone.    It was right for us to take the greatest possible defensive precautions at Shanghai, where our national interests were pre-dominant, tut he was opposed to our leaving Peking unless other Legations did the same.Sir Laming Worthington-Evans said the whole point was whether or not His Majesty&apos;s Government were to acquiesce in Sir Miles Lampson1s now advising non-official British subjects living outside the Legation quarter to leave Peking in the manner already provided for in the evacuation plan;    or were they to take the responsibility of instructing him not to gi^e such advics.    They could not possibly issue th?se instructions unless they wer^ prepared to t^-ke measures for the defence of Tientsin.    If they were prepared fo take such measures it would be possible to defer the evacuation of Peking, but not otherwise.Sir Austen Charbarlain said the question they had to put to their military advisers was the following:-   Are the British comaunity at Peking and the British Legation at Peking or either in such
danger at the present moment from either fa) organised military attack, or fh) mob violence, gunmen, etc, that tiie plan of evacuation already drawn up ought now to he put in operation, having regard to the JHpcnese decision to send troops to Shantung?Sir George Milne said that, so far as the danger of organised military attack was concerned, he saw no reason for starting the evacuation.     The situation had been much eased by the Japanese decision to send troops to Shantung.    From the military point of view danger was not likely to arise until the middle of August at the earliest.Sir Austen Chamberlain said he took this to mean that there was no reason to advise any British subject to leave Peking at the moment.Sir George Ililne agreed.As regards mob violence and gunmen, etc-, he said, the Question was more difficult to answer.   Peking was a large city and anything might happen, hut even so he thought it rather early to start evacuating at this moment * If His MajestyTs Minister recommended a larger guard he could get reinforcements from the Officer Commanding North China, and it would he possible to reinforce the latter with one Battalion &quot;from Shanghai or from Hongkong -Sir Austen Chamberlain suggested, therefore, that a reply should he sent to Sir Miles lampson in the following sense:- As regards military danger from Chinese armies, the view of His Majesty&quot;s Government was that it was wholly premature to evacuate anybody from Peking or Tientsin. As regards danger from mob violence, it was impossible to appreciate the situation from here, but if, after consultation with General Duncan, he considered that the Legation guard,
1** necessary reinforced from Tientsin, could dea3 with po3sible disturbances, General Duncan should be authorised to despatch one Battalion from Shanghai for use by the General Officer Commanding Worth China -at Tientsin or a^ Peking as might be required.Sir George Milne suggested that General Duncan might be instructed himself to proceed to Worth China to examine the whole question.Mr Bridgeman read a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief strongly deprecating the evacuation of Peking and Tientsin, and strongly advocating the despatch of a Brigade to Tientsin and th ? reinforcement of the Legation guard by 150 men.    Admiral Tyr.vh.itt also considered the evacuation of Tientsin practically impossible   in fact, e^-en more difficult than that of Shanghai.Sir Laming Worthir.gt.on-Evans pointed out that if we were to put one or two Battalions in Tientsin we should have to be prepared, if trouble arose, to reinforce them in order to secure their evacuation.Mr Churchill said this was preferable to epmro.it-ting ourselves by sending large bodies of troops now and bearing the whole burden.Lord Beatty said that the decision reached bythe Committee was in owrpleto conformity with thedecision reached by the Chiefs of Staff en April 11th,which was as follows:-&quot;(a) We can make no contribution to thedefence of Tientsin until the end of May, when, if the situation in other parts of China permits, we may be able to provide a maximum of one Brigade.(b) The use of this 3rdgad - for the defence of Tientsin is dependent, upon the pro-vision by the other Powers of the &apos;balance of the two Divisions which we consider the minimum fores necessary for holding Tientsin and keeping open the lines of communica-tion te Tangku.&quot;
The Committee decided  (i)  That Sir Miles Lampson should te informed that, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, there was, on present inforrration, no necessity to evacuate British subjects or His Majesty&apos;s Legation fro&quot;- Peking:(ii)  That C-eneral Duncan should be author-isad to despatch, on demand by the Colonel Commandant,  Worth China, one Battalion *rom Shanghai to Tientsin for use at Tientsin or at Peking as might be required:(iii) That General Duncan should be instruct-ed to proceed to North China to examine the situation at Tientsin and Peking:Civ) That the Foreign Office and War Office should concert together in sending the necessary instructions to Sir Miles Lampson and General Duncan.
2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.V.1, May 26, 1927 .TH3 PROPOSED 2.   Mr Churchill suggested the withdrawal of withdrawl OPINDIAN TROOPS.       the two Indian Battalions included in the IndianMixed Brigade of the Shanghai Defence Force, owing to the heavy Incidence of their cost on the British taxpayer.   Rather than maintain these two Indian Battalions he would prefer to send two additional British Battalions to the Far East.Sir Austen Chamberlain said he was not prepared to agree to a reduction In the total strength of our military forces in the Far East in present circumstances, but he had no objection, from the point of view of foreign policy, to the substitution of British for Indian Battalions. &quot;.-    He realised that in China Indian troops weresubjected to bad influences.   He insisted that, before a decision was taken to withdraw the Indian Battalions, the consent of the Secretary of State for India must be obtained.The Secretary of State for War undertook to consider the whole question in the light of the discussion, and to make a proposal within the next 24 hours.
