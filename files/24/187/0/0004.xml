SKIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROggETY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 OOVERISgflT) .SECRET. 5 ^CP.  154(27). COPY HO.     LJ L/C A B I II E T.THE NECESSITY FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THB JUDICIAL OOMMITTEiiTOF TEE PRIVY COUNCIL.KSrORANDUM 3Y VISCOUNT HALDANS OF CLOAK.(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister) .The Summary of the Proceedings at the recent Imperial Conference shows (see p.19, C.M.D. 2768) that the status and functions of this body are, for the present, left as they were, But the circumstance does not   touch the question raised in the present paper which Is whether the Judicial Committee are any longer in a position to discharge their functions adequatel:/-. They are a body concerned only with appeals from the various Courts of the Empire, other than those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.     As the result, the British public has been unaware of the question of their condition.     Few inhabitants of Great Britain ever stray Into the Court in Downing Street, and it is without what would be the help of home criticism of &quot; &quot; its condition.     But it Is otherwise with the numerous visitors from overseas.     By these its proceedings are subject3^ to ;-;r--n and growing scrutiny, particularly in the case of Indian observers.     There is also home criticism from those members of the English Bar who practise before it and report its proceedingsIt Is a mistake to imagine that the work of the Court is otherwise than very heavy.      Like the House of Lords, it sits only c-n four days a week, from 10.30 a..m. to 4 p,ra.     But Its-judgments are of supreme authority.     Thsy have to be closely considered and put into writing; and on an average at least two-1-
more days of the weak have to be dovoted to this task by its members, o task which is made the heavier by the amount of research among the decided esses which have to be sought but and examined closely.    Up to about twenty years ago the member of the Court managed to get through their work without very heavy strain.    But this has ceased to be so.    3?or the work has increased,  is increasing, and appears likely to increase still further.    This is due, not only to the growth of the wealth and business ramifications of the Empire, but to the growth of judicial duties throughout the Kingrs Dominions in developing regions, like thoso in vVest Africa and Palestine which are now sending up crops of fresh appeals^The strength of the Supreme Tribunals (the House of Lords and&apos;the Privy Council) which,  in order to get through their work,  have to sit at the same time, is as follows; There are normally required for the House of Lords five judges, and five judges for each of the two divisions of the Judicial Committee, the Colonial and the Indian.    To provide the fifteen judges thus required the following are all that can be reokoned on:      The Lord Chancellor and possibly two ex-Lord Chancellors;    six paid Lav/ Lords (there used to be only four, but in 1913 two more were added);    two retired Indian judges for Indian oases cnly^    These last&quot;are only paid  400 a year apiece, and they have to work full time through the judicial year.    It may be observed in passing that the judicial year of the Privy Council is nearly %h&amp; same as that of the ordinary Courts.    Moreover it could not be lengthened because Counsel cannot come from overseas outside certain periods.    It is highly desirable that overseas Counsel should be available, because the systems cf law to be administered are of the utmost variety and often highly technical.
To provide the fifteen jukes thus required for the three divisions there are thus only eleven judges vshcse duty it is to attend.     Tne ex-Lord Chancellors .:o most regularly 3erve but they are under no legal obligation to do so.     Pour more have thus, apart from this uncertainty, to be found somehcv-, an;-, it is at present only by volunteer woric that the ^ap is iilled up.     The situation is worse thin it vvasj because of the increase of business. In the live years, from 1906 to 1910 inclusive the average number of appeals entered was 101.      There were also other questions heard and disposed of. not by way of appeal, but under the power of the Crown to refer them to the Judicial Committee under the Act of 3 and 4- William IV.      In the five years between 1911 End 1915 the aversge number of Appeals entered rose from 101 to 132;      in the five years between 1916 and 19 0 it had risen tc 156.;      while  in the five years 1921-1925 the average number of Appeals was rather less, 145, but the number of additional matters specially referred was on the average in this last period more than double that in the eanier five-year periods..      These special references often take , .uch time.     The recent reference, for instance, as to the boundary oi Labrador took over a fortnight, and several references made by the Crown pursuant to Canadian Special Statutes have occupied several days apiece.     As to Indict taken by itseli the average number of appeals has nearly doubled in the last twenty years.It is thus plain that the work is not only growing in vo lume but loo.es as though it would grow still further. When the Lord Chancellor sits to constitute with four Law Lords the House of Lords on its appellate side,  there are left only one or two- e:--Lord Chancellors,  two Law Lords and the two Indian judges to man the two divisions of five each.
of the Judicial Committee.,     At the present time Lord 5uckmaster,  one of the ex-Lor&apos; Chancellors, has been absent bemuse oi serious il&quot;Jnes3.      Lord Pinlay, another, has been able during the past term to sit regularly on the Judicial Committee.    Tnis h*s been an act oi&quot; both courage and energy on his part, for he is a msn of 8 4 ano he is generally at work on the permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, Vvhf^e he is the ofiicial judicial representative of this country.      The remaining ex-Lor-1 Chancellor has, however, had the ungrudging help of Lord --/renbury, Lord Phillimore, Lord vVarringtcn of Clyffe and Lord Darling, All of these are v.ell oeer seventy and some of them over eighty, but their courage and tenacity are beyond praise,, Sir John Wallis,  Sir Launcelot Sanderson and Lord Sinha from India, have given valuable help in the Indian division.It must, however, be borne in mind that this sort of volunteer assistance is precarious.     The judges who render it, with the exception of Sir John Wallis, are under no sorf; of obligation to Co so.     When they are absent from ill-health,  or from sense of strain,  there are not any other qualified Privy Counsellors to whom an appeal can be made to serve on the Com, it tee *      It looks indeed as though in the coming term there would be a shortage c    Lord Bucicmaster will not be physically fit to return before May;    Lord Sinha has gone to India;    Lord ffinlay has to return to the Hasrue,,      There are others whose health is uncertain.In this condition of things, and not least in view of the steady growth of the number of cases, the situation has become a very oerio.ua one.     On any day the Judicial Committee may fin.  itself so crippled that it cannot decently discharge its functions.      Already, too, there are complaints that its members are on the average too old.&apos;
uIndian criticism is at times very open on this point, and similar oritioism comes from the Bar here 9nd from overseas. It would he a real misfortune if this great and irreplaceable tribunal were to perish from neglect, and yet of this there is real danger.    The public known nothing at present of the -condition of affairs, and in Great Britain is not touched by it.    Consequently it does not caro.It comes in the end to this that it is only the Government that can take the initiative in the wo*&quot;&quot;k ef rescue.    How is thi: to be practicable?   As is well known, the House of Commons is jealous of any increase in the number of judges,    That is partly because it known little of the subject, and partly as the result of a tradition.But to-day the s^ate of %he judicial  0IBnifttee presents an urgent problem-    tfhat is required is to prevent this body from deteiiorating into a Committee of elderly judges, precarioi even as regards, their number.    It will not do to let the Lomi-nions and India realise that this body as it is constituted to-day, and as it must remain constituted in the., absence of reform, is inadequate to the task which devolves r*n it as&quot; the /, Supremo Sourt of Appeal of the Empire.    The Bill that would be required to put- matters right is of course a *seriouo one% For. it will probably involve the addition of two new paid law^ Lords to the judicial strength, in addition to the two Indian appointments which it is already proposed to make.    That means an addition annual charge of nearly  16^000.    But there does not seem to be any other way outof a grave situation which promises to become shortly worse, and which-is largely due to the increase of business which now necessitates not one but two divisions of the Committee.HALL AN E OP CLOAx^March, 1 27.
