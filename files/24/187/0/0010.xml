THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS ERITAHtllC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECiSET Copy Ko.    3 0CP.160(27). CABINET.AUDIT (LOCAL AUTHORITIES) BILL. Memorandum by the Minister of Bloalth.In my Memorandum to the Cabinet of the 21st February, 1927, (CP. 65(27)), I explained that legislation had become necessary owing to the breakdown of the machinery of audit control in face of illegalities embarked upon by certain local authorities from political motives;    and I pointed out that, in view of the position created by certain surcharges, such legislation demanded immediate consideration unless we were prepared to contemplate a repetition of the futile and undignified farce, experienced in 1921, of the imprisonment and martyrdom of East End Councillors.The Audit (Local Authorities) Bill which results from a very careful examination of the question by a Cabinet Committee wipes out the surcharges referred to, but, in addition to other improvements of the Ziuciit law, provides that surcharges made in respect of expenditure incurred after 1st April of this year shall in serious cases (subject of course to proper appeals) involve disqualification from membership of any local authority for a period of five years.Unless the Bill Is passed this Session a year will be lost before this new penalty can be imposed and I regard It as of great importance that this new protection shall be available to the ratepayers at the earliest possible date.As regards the past surcharges referred to, the position is that It is the duty of the Auditor (which he can be compelled by mandamus to darry out)   to enforce them. In
one case (3ethnal Green) proceedings before the Courts have only been postponed In view of the Government&apos;s present consideration of the question, while in the case of Poplar I understand that the aggrieved ratepayers, who succeeded in their application to the Courts against me when I remitted the Poplar surcharge, have served a formal notice on the Auditor calling upon him to perform his duty of enforcing his surcharge.On both grounds, therefore, I oonsider it to be essential that the Bill should be passed this Session.    The Bill is a short one, but naturally it will not commend itself to the opposition and unless progress is made in the near future I fear that it will not be possible to ensure its passing by the end of July.I hope, therefore, that the Cabinet will agree that time may be found to take the Second Reading before Whitsuntide.U.C. 1st May. 1927.2.
