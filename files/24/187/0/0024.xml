THIS D0CUM3NT 13 TH-S property  OF HIS BRITAITNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.SECRET.CP. 174(27).COPY NO.30CABINET.TRADE OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report of the last meeting of my Advisory Council.It is difficult to form an accurate appreciation of trade prospects at the present time, as the views expressed are very conflicting.The coal situation,  as I expected, remains unsatisfactory. Since the meeting of my Council, the French Government announced their intention of imposing a drastic restriction on imports. The French decree prohibits all importation except under license. I understand that the intention of the French Government is to reduce imports by 250,000 tons a month. Imports of coal into France from all sources total about if- million tons a month, of which this country sends something like 800,000 tons.    If the decree is maintained and no allowance is made for existing contracts, the effect on the British Coal Trade will be more serious than at first appears. I gather that the French may desire to maintain their imports of reparation coal in full.    Further,  the refusal of licenses to large importers like the railway companies would break long term contracts made at prices favourable to British exporters, and new contracts for smaller amounts would then be made at lower prices. Strong representations have been made both by the Foreign Secretary and by our Ambassador in Paris.    I gather that the French Cabinet are by no means unanimous on the proposal. The view expressed in Paris to an officer of my Department was that it-1-
was necessary to register the decree in order to avoid a strike in the French coal mines, hut that if the decree had to be revoked owing to pressure in Prance and from outside, the Prench Coal Industry v/ould see that the French Government had done what it could and would accept the position. In these circumstances, I hope that if   our representations are strongly pressed, the decree will either be revoked or so modified as to occasion a comparatively small injury to our trade.     Its operation has been postponed till June 10th.In Iron and 3teel a large output is being maintained; but new orders are not coming forward in satisfactory quantities.Shipping is better and the improved position has encouragement-aged the placing of considerable orders for new ships. It is satisfactory to note that not only is a considerably larger amount of tonnage being built at present in this country than six months ago, but our proportion of total world tonnage under construction is also greater.Business in non-ferrous metals is slack. This    is un-satisfactory, as the non-ferrous metal trade is a good index to the position of the metal using industries.In cotton the Egyptian section of the trade remains satisfactory. The American section remains depressed, but prospects are,  I think, slightly better,  in spite of the fact that a large number of firms have had to make schemes of arrangement.   Great relief will, I know, be felt in Lancashire at the decision of the Government of India to reject the majority report of the Tariff Board, which recommended an increased duty on cotton piece goods and a bounty on higher counts spun in India,The increased purchasing power in India is proving a great help to other trades besides cotton piece goods and is
doing something to set off the calamitous position in China. One satisfactory feature is recorded from   China, namely, that trade in Canton has considerably improved as a result of the moderates getting the upper hand there.Rubber and artificial silk are good. As regards the other trades of what I may call the consumers goods class, the reports are conflicting. The bankers are gloomy, but the general impression collected by the Chambers of Commerce is reasonably hopeful. Moreover, the Co-operative Wholesale Society, which is a good index of working class purchasing power, reports increased sales and satisfactory prospects.On the whole, In this maze of conflicting reports, the best forecast I can make is -1. Coal is bad and will,  I think, be worse during the summer until buying for the winter begins. 2. Iron and steel will be fairly busy for two or threemonths, but prospects in the Autumn are very uncertain, 3. Other industries are on the whole likely to remain steady or to show some slight improvement during the next few months.P.C-L.10th June,  1927,

.COAL.SIR ADAM NIMMO feared that it had to be recognised that there was a very deep depression in the coal trade practically all over the country.   He was advised that, taking the average weekly figure of output in March 1926 as the Index, the output of coal for the week ending 14th May last v/as 96.7 per cent, of the average weelcly output in March 1926.   During the week ending May 14th, 1927, the output in Scotland had been 95.8 per cent of the average of March, 1926, in Northumberland It vias 112.1 per cent., in Durham it v/as 100.4 per cent., in South Wales 106.4 per cent., in Yorkshire 93.1 per cent., in Lancashire, Cheshire and North Wales 95.7 per cent., in South Staffordshire&apos;, Worcestershire and Warwickshire 87.8   per cent., in other districts 101.8 per cent.   Taking the country as a whole it was 96,7 per cent,THE PRESIDENT doubted whether March   1926, was a very satisfactory date to take as a basis for comparison, because the possibility of a coal stoppage was widely realized then, and both production and&apos;purchases were heavy,SIR ADAM NIMMO agreed that that might be so.   He con-tinued that in March   1926, from the North East Coast the average  weekly shipments of coal had been 495,000 tons.   For the week ending 14th aay last the corresponding figures were stated to be 469,000 tons.    Taking the number of persons employed in the same two periods we found that for the same week in May the percentage for Great Britain was 92.9 of the average weekly figure for March 1926.   Taking the total weekly shipments of coal from the various ports, the figures were 1,354,000 tons for the week in May 1927 as compared with 1,344,000 tons for the basic period in 1926.    On the other hand, the coal exported from the country amounted to 4,117,000 tons last April as compared with 4,819,000 tons last March, and 4,702,000 tons in March&apos; 1926.   The percentage of persons unemployed last April v/as 17.8 as compared with 16.8 last March, and 9.3 in March, 1926.   But the number of days per week on.which the pits wound coal last April was 5.04 as compared with 4.89 in March last.Turning to the output in the Ruhr, and using the same periods for comparison, we found that the average weekly output in the Ruhr in March 1926 was 1,888,000 metric tons. That had risen in the week ending 14th May last to 2,284,000 metric tons.   The outputs of all the countries which v/ere more or less our competitors, showed an increase as against the decline here.   The output of America in March   1926, was 49,000,000 tons; in March, 1927   it was 59,000,000 tons.    In Germany the output in March   1926, was 11,240,000 tons.   That had risen to 15,821,000 tons in March 1927.   Prance&apos;s output had risen from 4,400,000 tons to 4,649,000 tons.   There was a small increase in the Saar district from 1,247,000 tons to 1,268,000 tons,, and in 3elgitim from 2,099,000 tons to 2,438,000 tons.   Exports of coal from the United States had-1-
CONFIDENTIAL. COAL (CONTD. ).risen from 1,021,000 tons in March   1926, to 1,532,000 tons in March   1927; in Germany, although the figures were a little affected by a change in reparation arrangements, the exports had risen from 1,160,000 tons to 2,042,000 tons.    In Poland - which was a very difficult competitor for us - there v/as an increase from 590,000 tons in March   1926, to 807,000 tons in April   1927.    In March   1927, the figure for Poland had been 800^000 tons, so that there was even a slight increase between March and April this year.All these figures v/ent to show that the position in the British coal trade v/as an exceedingly difficult one.    In all the districts the values of coal had been very rapidly falling, and were now, in a great many of the districts, at quite an unprofitable level.   The tendency of wages seemed to be to come down to the minimum in order to support as far as possible the very low values which had to be taken for such trade as was available.    In Sir Adam!s district in Scotland the position could only be described as deplorable.   They were now down on the minimum under the agreement and during the last two months the district had shown a deficiency on the ascertainment under the agreement of over  300,000.   That represented a very serious state of affairs which was causing great anxiety.IRON AND STEEL.THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IRON AND STEEL MANUFACTURERS sent the following statement:-&quot;The production of pig iron in April amounted to 680,000 tons compared with 671,800 tons in March and 539,100 tons in April 1926.   The daily rate v/as thus 22,667 tons compared with 21,671 tons in March.    There was- a net increase of 11 in the number of furnaces in operation during the month, 13 being blown in and 2 ceasing operations during the month. The number of furnaces in blast at the end of April was therefore 139 compared with 147 at the end of April 1926. The high rate of production of steel ingots and castings attained in March, namely 949,600 tons,  was continued in April, for although the output declined to 850,100 tons, the decline is not greater than can be accounted for by the Easter Holidays, Imports of iron and steel continued high and amounted to 404,700 tons compared with 478,100 tons in March and 261,800 tons in April 1926.   Exports on the other hand are again practically at pre-strike levels, amounting in April to 334,500 tons compared with 313,000 tons in April 1926, but they are still far below the 1913 average which was at a rate of 414,000 tons per month.   Although the current rate of output is fairly satisfactory iron and steel makers are very much concerned with the slowness with which new business is coming forward, and some departments will shortly have to close down unless new business is forthcoming in greater volume. Some improvement^is noted in the demand for galvanised sheets but tinplates remain very quiet.
IRON AND STEEL (OONTD.).&quot;The results of the working of the International Steel Agreement for the Becond quarter of its existence recently became available.    Since the total associated quota was reduced by 1^- million tons per annum in the second quarter the fine for over-production payable by Germany increases from $2,290,000  ( 471,000) in the first quarter to $3,750,000 ( 772,000) in the second which resulted in an increase of the burden per ton of steel produced from l/7d. per ton to 2/7d. per ton.   On the other hand France and Luxemburg continue to benefit both from their under-production and the fine paid by Germany,  the compensation per ton of steel produced in the first half-year amounting to 3/5d. in the case of France and 2/7d. in the case of Luxemburg.&quot;While, owing to the big internal demand in Germany, competition from that quarter is not serious, prices having risen substantially in the last few weeks, competition from Belgium and France, both in the home and export markets, is severe.    The main factor is the uncertainty with regard to the French exchange   which has forced French prices down to an uneconomic level, but a level which Belgium seeks to follow and a level with which it 1b quite impossible for British makers to compete.    While it is possible that these considerations may not be reflected   to a serious extent in the May production figures, when they become available,  since most works have been busy on past orders, it is expected that figures for June and subsequent months will show a substantial decline,  and considerable anxiety prevails as to the position in the immediate future.&quot;NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD had not much to say about the metal trades, but what he had to report was somewhat depressing.    Ke did not think there was a single branch of these trades which waB not worse off for work than it   had been even last year.   He was at a less to account for this, except on the ground of general industrial depression.    Prices had been dwindling, which generally meant that orders were not forthcoming.    He could not say that he saw any trend towards improvement, although he hoped for it.   Orders in the shipbuilding yards and in the engineering trade were rather slow in reaching the non-ferrous metals trade.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR PHILIP NASH   wrote:-&quot;I have nothing particular to report, other than that the state of the electrical trade remains about the same as a month ago.    There is no improvement, but if anything, there is rather a slackening.&quot;
SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE.SIB JOHN THORNYCROFT stated.that reports from the shipbuilding centres seemed to indicate that prices were hardening a little and the employment figures showed considerable improvement.   Some of the more fortunate firms that had managed to fill up their yards with work were probably about covering their oharges, but the majority were not doing so and had little prospeot of working at a profit. If they could not make a profit it was almost impossible for them to improve their plant in order to oheapen production.   During the war, to facilitate output, which was the same thing as cheapening production, only about nine different sections of material were allowed to be used.   Now, it was understood that fifty were being used again.   The shipbuilders themselves might be partly to blame for this, but it was the shipowner who really decided what he would have.    The shipbuilders needed, Sir John thought, to give further consideration to the possible ways of getting costs down.   The difficulty of getting material which had occurred for some months after the Coal Stoppage no longer existed and it was believed that material was readily available.Since the last meeting of the Council, when he reported that the Argentine Government had placed an order for cruisers in Italy, they had arranged to purchase three destroyers building in Spain, and it was stated that the Spanish Government were giving special facilities as regards payment.With reference to motor vehicles, the effect of the mission which had been sent to Australia seemed to have been to oause the American firms to make special efforts to counter any good effects and, in New Zealand, the agents dealing in American oars were organising petitions to the Government to reduce the British preference,    in Australia it seemed that the firms who had arranged to import large numbers of British cars were unable to dispose of all they had ordered, and had found it necessary to come to England with a view to making arrangements to oanoel a proportion of their orders.   It was reported that the organisation to which Mr. Bruce had referred, as possibly building vehicles in Australia, was still aiming at doing so.   The Department of Overseas Trade had recently reported the establishment of a new General Motors assembly plant in Japan at Osaka,  and the very elaborate preparations that were being made to hold the market there. It seemed to be true that Mr. Ford was about to put a new model on the market, and the Press in this country seemed to suggest that this was the result of competition from the smaller models of British cars.     While there was no doubt that these smaller models had affected the sales of Ford cars in this country, Fordfs real competitor had been one of the General Motors productions, the Chevrolet, of which there had been an output of over 3,000 a   day for some time.
COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROUN thought that in the Egyptian seotion of the spinning trade conditions were fairly normal.   All spindles were running full time and on a fairly satisfactory basis.     The American or coarse section was still In a very alarming position, although there was some slight improvement, even in that.    The figures for the week ending the 21st May showed that the spindles in the coarse trade were running to 75% of capacity.   Unfortunately, whilst so running, the sales 7/ere only 96% of the actual production; so that in the coarse industry less than two-thirds of the normal production v/as being sold.   It would have been seen from the Press that several mills per day were now making arrangements with their creditors or proposing schemes of reconstruction; and this was causing a great amount of distress and trouble in Lancashire.    In the weaving section of the trade rather more looms were running. There had been a very big advance in the price of both American and the Egyptian cotton, which had rather hindered trade getting on to the books, although inquiries had been quite good; and most orders or offers had had to go back by cable to make an attempt to meet the increased cost of cotton, and that also had had some effect on the trade of late.Lancashire was feeling more and more competition from abroad. Last month Colonel Seddon Brown had mentioned the fact that casement curtains - curtains of cotton cloth, as distinct from lace curtains - were now largely sent to this country from Holland. Another case was that of ladies&apos; cotton-cloth underclothing which was now being made up largely on the Continent and brought into this country. One large store recently took up a large portion of a newspaper with advertisements of their ladies1 underwear. It appeared on investigation that there was hardly a British-made garment in the whole stock.    There were instances in which the actaal cost of garments to the British makers was 32/2d. a dozen,-and these could be made in Switzerland and delivered in this country at 29/6d.The cotton trade had experienced some help from the Customs protection which tyres had got; it had brought employ-ment back into some of the mills manufacturing the yarn for the tyres, and they believed that the time was coming when, if they were to find employment, for their people, they would nave to have some system of Customs protection against these foreigr Imports of manufactured gc;cr.s. Unfortunately these matters were not easily brought to an issue in the cotton industry., because it was so split up. The spinner in Lancashire had as a rule very little know-ledge of what became of his ya*n. He spun yarn, as yarn, which he delivered to a manufacturer or a weaver. The weaver only turned it into cloth, and then it went to the bleacher or finisher. From there it went to the maker-up, who did nothing else fcut sew garments. If the process were all in one hand the trend of affairs could be analysed very muoh more easily.    The trade as a whole did not, however, yet seem to realise what was happening.    One day in the previous week six cases had been referred to In one column in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;.   Yesterday morning there had been three.     They were not all exactly liquidations,
COTTON (CONTD.)they were schemers of arrangement.    It amounted, however, to much the same thing; they were moratcriums of some character or other.    It was largely due to the claims of people who had money at call.    The shareholders in one mill In Oldham, for instance, which might be called mill A., got a call on their shares, and the only way they could meet that call was by withdrawing a loan from mill B.   Mill B. before that time was quite strong, and it now became even 7/eaker than mill A.    It was difficult to give precise figures, but there certainly must have been 4 0 or 50 mills which had made some scheme during the last few weeks.Reverting to the question of the imports of underclothing, figures from the Monthly Trade Accounts were &quot;cited by Mr. Macrosty of the Board of Trade Statistical Department, but as these covered a wider- class of goods than Lhose to which Colonel Seddon Brown referred, more exact figures have since been obtained and are given in the table below.Imports into United Kingdom.Apparel: Under Garments (not Hosiery) (excluding &quot;Shirts,  Collars,  and Cuffs&quot; and &quot;Corsets, Stays,&amp;c&quot;)Countries.	1925	1926	...... -- Jan.

COTTON (CONTD).SIR VI. CLARi LEES wrote&quot;I am enclosing a Statistical Statement on the lines of one which I presented a few months ago /see minutes of meeting on 2nd Marchybringing the figures fof the exports of Cotton Piece Goods up to the end of April.&quot;The percentage for the four months ending April, as represented in column 9, which indicates the proportion of the trade as compared with full time working on the prwsent basis of a 48-hour week, you will observe Is 67.9. .     The figure for the whole of the year 1925, arrived at on a similar basis, was 77.13, and that for 1926 66.6*, so that there is a little improvement indicated comparing this year with last year, but we are still a good deal behind 1925.&quot;You will observe that the main shortage still remains in Eastern Markets, and emphasises once again the fact that Lancashirels difficulties lie more in the East then in Europe.,, from the point of view of foreign competition.     During the whole of the present year the fine end of the trade has been working to approximately full time, so that it will be realised that the American Section is in a worse position than these figures indicate.&quot;There has been a good deal of hesitancy on the part of Overseas buyers during the past month, and although orders are continually coming forward day by day, I d* not think they are of sufficient volume to entirely replace production.     Order books are, therefore, somewhat lighter than they were a month ago.    China remains almost a &apos;dead letter&apos;.      India is -the best market.     Egypt is improving, slowly.     The stocks of Lancashire goods, now lying awaiting clearance,  are not heavy.&quot;In presenting statistics based cn monthly returns , it 5e inevitable that a number of the smaller outlets are included in the catergory &quot;other countries&quot;, the complete statement of these smaller markets only being made possible when the annual figures are issued&quot;./Sir Yi.

ARTIFICIAL SILK-&apos;MR. ADDISON reported that in the artificial silk industry conditions were very satisfactory.    There was a good steady demand for the home market in every section of the trade, and Lancashire at the present time could not even get as much as it demanded.   The export trade was still subjected to very keen competition, and it was difficult to bring about any big sales except in specialities which the users could not obtain in the country in which they were working.     The Indian market showed signs of improvement, and during the last few weeks business in South America had been distinctly better.    The most encouraging feature of the home trade v/as the almost complete absence of stocks everywhere;    so that the outlook, at any rate for the next few months, was distinotly favourable.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY wrote:-&quot;The past month has been one of slow but steady improvement in trade, the inorease in our exports being about 8fc in excess of April 1926.    I regret, however, to report a decrease in our exportation of Dyestuffs. Much interest has been taken in the Economic Conference at Geneva and it is generally felt that although there can be no immediate results, yet the work of the Conference is a move in the direction most likely to improve International Trade with particular value and importance to Chemical Industry.&quot;I wish to call attention to the difficulties which are arising from the delay in issuing the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Ethyl-Alcohol and its substitutes.   The substances which have been under consideration by the Committee are of the first importance to Fine Chemical Manufacturers, especially at the present time when their use is expanding rapidly in comparatively recently inaugurated industries.&quot;A declaration of the final intentions of the Customs Authorities is therefore a matter of considerable urgency.&quot;The Superphosphate trade continues to be in a depressed condition and it is a matter for regret that agriculturalists are not more strongly urged to use this, or other Fertilisers upon their permanent grass lands&quot;.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS observed that the position in the Pottery trade was somewhat similar to that of last month.   The unemployment figure 3howed a very slight deorease, but did not materially improve.

CONFIDENTIAL.POTTERY    (CONTD.).unemployment in the trade was seen in the general tendency to work three or four days a week, with the exception of individual factories here and there;    and it was understood that occasionally factories, with a view of keeping down overhead charges, had actually increased the number of workpeople in one or two of their departments so as to keep going for three days a week, instead of keeping their ordinary employees on, say, for three and a half or four days.   Nevertheless on the whole, as compared with several past years, the industry was in a fair condition, with the exception of the Scotch spun section, where work was believed to be very slack.RUBBER.MR.. JOHNSTON reported that the rubber manufacturing industry showed a Bteadily improving situation.   The first three months of the year had been anything but satisfactory; if anything, they were worse than the strike period;    but the last two months had been much more hopeful, and the trade had been regularly improving within the last few weeks.   The tyre branch was active and had been assisted by the very fine weather we had had recently.   Notwith-standing the presence of large foreign stocks, all the home factories were increasing their production.   General engineering rubber goods were in greater demand, and this was generally somewhat of an indication that the smaller trades of the country were getting busier.    Rubber foot-wear had been greatly assisted by the very suitable seasonal weather in the last few weeks.The export trade, especially to Empire countries, had improved.    Exports to Continental countries were,of oourse, still difficult owing to the high.tariffs and the very keen competition.     But the greater stability of the currencies made cut business possible without the too great risk which obtained a year or so ago.Unemployment and under-employment seemed to be decreasing in the trade.    .On the whole the outlook was fairly satisfactory.FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR S. MACHIN reported that traders were still feeling the loss of the Continental trade very severely;    that appeared to have gone, and at present little or no chance of recovery oould be seen in Holland and Belgium, and particularly in France.       So far as Germany was concerned, however, there were evidences that
FOOD INDUSTRIES  (OONTD.).they were in a better position to buy; in fact the Food industry in this country were having enquiries and orders from Germany whioh they had not had since the war.Turning   to the British Dominions, the most cheerful outlook appeared from India, where purchasing power certainly seemed to have improved.     Indents from India were better than the Industry had had for a great many years past.    Canada promised great things, but it was rather too early yet for the orders to ooiae along. . It waj hoped that   we should get them in a month or two.GENERAL TRADE.SIR S. MACHIN stated that, although there was a good deal of complaint, yet the reports whioh had been received from various parts of the country were certainly hopeful.   With regard to Nottingham - the hosiery   trade - a slight but definite improvement could be reported as compared with a month ago.    The lace trade,  although not booming, was certainly looking for better things.    The same kind of report came from the Widnes area, namely, of a slight improvement in output, but no great change.    At Hull the tone was very similar.    The timber trade showed a slight improvement, but was still quiet,  and the fishing trade was slightly better. Coventry reported in almost   identical terms, - but aichough trade was not booming, there was a general &apos;impression that things were going to be better.   From Leicester the note was the same - although trade was not brisk, the number of unemployed was less, which, of course, was the best oriterion of progress we could have.As regards London, Sir S. Maohin could report from his personal knowledge a similar state of affairs.   Of course this time last year was not a comparable period, for we were just emerging from the General Strike and coal prospects were very unsettled.    Trade was hopeful now, but not really brisk. The improvement which we had looked for in the earlier months of the year had not yet developed.    At the same time the situa-tion might have   been worse,  and signs were not wanting that confidence was perhaps greater than it had been a month or so ago.Co-operative wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST wrote:-&quot;In submitting my observations for the past month, it is again gratifying to be in the position of reporting steadily
GENERAL TRADE  (OONTD. ).Co-operative Wholesale Society (Contd.).increasing trade in practically every section, and whilst the corresponding month of last year includes the period of the unfortunate strike, which must, of course, make the present period&apos;s trade compare perhaps somewhat unfairly, our present business week by week is very satisfactory.&quot;Grocery and Provisions.    Butter production in Denmark is now reaching its highest point,  and whilst values are at a most reasonable level, shipments are clearing readily in consequence of a good enquiry ruling.    Colonial butters are a little on the short side,  and are commanding slightly higher prices than Scandinavian at the moment.    British sugar refiners, within the past day or so, have reduced prices, but at the moment foreign refined is quiet and practically unchanged.    There has been a steady demand for this article throughout the month.    The wheat market during the week has remained firm.   Reports are now being circulated a3 to the prospects of the new season&apos;s crop,  and whilst these are of the usual varying and probably erratic character, I think it may be taken for granted that in the main there is nothing which need cause alarm.   Flour prices have remained practically unchanged of late,  and satisfactory sales are recorded.    The mills have been well employed with substantial orders. The production of foodstuffs in our various factories calls for no special comment, everything being of a satisfactory character.&quot;Drapery and Woollens..   -The-position at the moment is very satisfactory from our standpoint,  substantial increases having been recorded.

These are,  in the main, of the usual quantity, with no untoward feature in any particular section.    In my previous reports I   have commented that one particular part of the country, owing to the continued trade depression having affected very seriously the trade peculiar to that section, had been looked upon as being rather a black spot so far as our own sales were concerned.    The latest reports to hand indioate an improvement practically all round,  and it is to be hoped that the optimistic tone now prevailing amongst our sellers will be maintained.

CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW believed that there was a feeling of somewhat greater confidence throughout the industry, although no doubt certain branches of it were in a very bad condition. Perhaps the best index as to a feeling of confidence was the increase in the amount of new tonnage laid down in the quarter ending 31st March, though that, feeling of confidence might lay mainly in the hope of better things to come.A great deal had been said within the industry of late about the increased cost of lighthouse administration.   It was not suggested that   on the present basis of administra-tion the cost, which was now nearly 100 per cent, above the pre-war level, could be materially reduced.   There was a feeling, however, that perhaps the time might soon arrive when His Majesty&apos;s Government would think it advisable that the whole question of lighthouses, and perhaps also beacons of various kinds along the coast, should be the subject of a fresh and impartial inquiry.THE PRESIDENT pointed out that the shipowners had rejected the offer which Trinity House had made to them, of attending all meetings of the main committee at Trinity House, and of the sub-committee which prepared the estimates, and so on.    They had said they wanted control in the Trinity House administration,.which, of course, Trinity House would not give.MR. SHAW thought that the question might have to be reviewed, for instance, vis-a-vis the Irish Free State and the Scottish Commissioners.   There were three separate lighthouse authorities, and in not one of them had users of lights or payers of lights any effective voice.   While it was considered inadvisable that shipowners should have a representative who would be continuously out-voted, on the Trinity House authority, yet, if the vhole subject came up for a general review, it might be possible to give some more effective voice - though perhaps not a controlling voice - to the actual users of lights.The  shipping industry was extremely keen that the law respecting arbitration in commercial matters should receive attention.    Mr.Justice kacklnnon&apos;s Committee on Arbitration had made a Report, and it was hoped that that Report might be remitted to a committee of business men for their observa-tions.    What the shipping industry - and perhaps other industries - would like to see was something more on the lines of the Scottish system.    In Scotland the arbitrator, unless he went entirely off the lines, decided points of law as well as points of fact.   He had full power himself,without recourse to the Courts, to order discovery of documents, administer interrogatories, and use all those powers which in England were exercised by the Courts alone.   It was an extra-ordinarily difficult question, but in England the costs of arbitration were inflated by constant reference to the Courts.THE PRESIDENT observed that the Mackinnon Committee was appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and that if the shipping industry had strong views about this subject, they would do well to make representations to the Lord Chancellor direct.
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR   HERBERT WALKER Baid that the position as regards railways was very much the same now as it had been a month ago. Passenger traffic was still in a bad condition,  and judging from the railway tonnage receipts, the coal trade seemed also to be unfavourably situated.   Otherwise, trade appeared generally to be tending slightly upwards..     It should be remembered, however, in considering current figures of railway receipts, and particularly in comparing them with figure8 for earlier periods, that an increase in railway rates had taken plaoe in February.MR. HUECOMB pointed out that,  as Sir Herbert Walker had said, the receipts of the railway companies were affected by increases in rates as well as by increases in traffic, but it might be interesting to compare the situation for the 20 weeks up to the 22nd May with the corresponding period of 1925.   In the aggregate,  the receipts, of the four Groups for that period were about  1,225,000 higher this year than in 1925, but the increase was unevenly distributed between the various classes of traffic and alBO between the different railway groups.    The passenger traffic showed a uniform decline as compared with 1925.    The Southern passenger receipts were  81,000 less; the Great Western  117,000; the Midland and Scottish  704,000,  and the North Eastern  349,000.    Comparing the total traffic receipts the Southern Railway was  50,000 worse off than in the corresponding period of 1925.    The Great Western on the other hand, was  532,000 better off than in 1925.    The Midland was about the same and the North Eastern was nearly  750,000 better off.    Too much importance, however, should not be attached to these figures as an index of recovery in trade, because it was impossible to discriminate between the effects of the increased rates and the alterations in traffic.    The least satisfactory feature was the unfiorm decline in passenger traffic, which showed no signs of recovery.The latest detailed figures of traffic as distinct from receipts were for March, so that they were still comparable with the corresponding figures for last year. Generally, the railways in March 1927,  as compared with March 1926, carried about 5-g- million fewer people and took about  500,000 less in receipts, and ran a slightly greater mileage to do it.At the last meeting Mr. Hurcomb had commented on the decline in moat traffic&apos;, and said that that would appear to be due to road competition; but on looking into it further he found that the embargo on foreign meat had probably had some effect in reducing the figures.The tonnage of iron and steel conveyed by rail in March 1927, had been the highest recorded for any month sinoe these statistics were started in January 1920.   There was an increase of 275,000 tons compared with March 1926, but the inorease in the importation of Iron and steel and iron and steel manufactures in that month,  according to the Board of Trade returns, had been about 220,000 tone, so the high traffic figure might be one more satisfactory to the railway companies than to the manufacturing industry in this country.

EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS stated that the unemployment figures had oontinued to fall, and on the 9th May they were below a million for the first time this year.    They went up again over the million in the   following week, but for the 23rd May there was a   decrease of nearly 29,000, bringing the total to 978,200, or just under the lowest figure of last year, and actually the lowest figure since 1920.    As the figure for coal mining was over 100,000   more than it had been before last year&apos;s dispute, the fact that there was a net reduction over-all showed that other Industries must havo improved still more than appeared from the general figures.CONDITIONS    ABROAD.MR. BRALfD observed that in America there existed still the peculiar situation of falling prices, great industrial activity, and rising prices on the Stock Exchange.   Loans to brokers on the New York Stock Exchange had increased, but it did not look as if money was going to be dearer there.  ,s The Federal Reserve Banks were quite in a position to control the credit market,  and the flow of money from the United States all over the world for capital purposes still continued. The City of San Paulo, for instance, recently proposed to raise a loan,  and It was understood that from fifteen to eighteen different groups of banking firms in New York competed for It.    In Europe and all over the world, thore was everywhere extremely active competition among the New York banks to place money abroad.In Germany,  as would have been seen, there had been a very heavy fall on the Stock Exchange due to a panic caused by the 25per cent, reduotion in loans against Stock Exchange securities, and a great deal of recrimination had passed between the   banks and the President of the Reichsbank as to who had been responsible for the panic     But in Germany, while money rateB had not been any harder, long term capital seemed to be scarce, and that country was now suffering from lack of foreign 1 endings such as she had had during the last year or two, as well as from her heavier Reparation payments and adverse trade balances.    It looked, therefore, as if there might be a considerable 3train on her exchange for the next few months when the very big payments under the Dawes Scheme had to be made.      The gold in the Reichsbank had been considerably reduced in the last few months.In Franoe, money rates were very cheap.    There still appeared to be an inflow of capital.   An appreciation of the franc was more generally expected than a depredation.    The Bank of France, however, was supposed to have very large holdings of dollars and sterling in London and New York, obtained by selling francs with a view to prevent   . the exchange appreciating, and France had been taking gold from London and New York, which had had a considerable.
CONDITIONS ABROAD (CONTD).effect on money rates in London already;    and of course if she took a good deal more, and came to London for it, it might have a serious effect.In Italy the position seemed, so far as the exchange was concerned, more or less the same as in France.     The Italian exchange had appreciated very greatly.     Recently, of course, Pome, Milan, and other cities, had made very large loans in New York, and it was understood that the borrowers had not been able to turn their dollars into lire;    they could not get the lire, and they saw their dollars depreciating in terms of lire all the time.     Apparently the Bank of Italy was under an absolute restriction owing to legislation passed last year, not to issue any more currency, even against gold.   Therefore it wss no good exporting gold from the United Statee, end it seemed impossible at the moment to get the dollars turned Into Itelian currency. Accordingly it was probable that the Italian exchange would appreciate still more.     That appreciation was said to be having a very serious effect on Italian industry.australian  LI AM TRA BE .MR. SANDERSON said that the absence of rain was still causing a good deal of anxiety in Australia.    The coast had had useful rains,  but the inland portions of Queensland, New South Wales, SMAth Australia and Victoria had all. been affected, with the result that losses of stock were taking place.   The lambing had to some extent been a failure, and it would depend on the next few weeks as to whether it would be a serious failure.    New South Wales could be said to be suffering particularly, because there was a large amount of stock there.    Some   people thought it was over-stocked, and the consequence of Queensland suffering from the drought was that New South Wales had not been able to sell any of their surplus sheep to that State, and consequently were left with this extra stock at a very critical time.As regards the crops,  if in. the next few weeks good rains fell, farmers would be able to get on with their ploughing and sowing,    Last season&apos;s, 1926-7, wheat yield had been an extraordln-arily good one 160 million bushels, an increase of 47 million busheis on that of the previous season.Great efforts &quot;were being made to readjust the whole gold industry in Western Australia, and to endeavour to develop the prospecting and to improve the very depressed condition of the industry.     The Queensland gold production for the first four months of this year was of the value of  17,000, ss compared with  9,000 in the first four months of last year.
AUSTRALIAN trade (CONTD ) *Another point of interest was that the  ad-vances from the Banks throughout Australia were at a fairly high level, and the demand for money was continuing strong. Various development schemes were going on all through the Commonwealth.INDIAN trade.MR. LINDSAY regarded the position in India as &quot;being, on the whole, fairly satisfactory. The wheat crop totalled just under nine million tons,  and that total corresponded with India&apos;s estimated requirements of wheat, at the same time prices on the Liverpool market were very temoting to India and a certain amount of wheat had come over. Whether there would be anything further in the way of an exportable surplus de-pended a good deal on the monsoon. The cotton crop was distinctly short, but India had had rather good luck in the last few years with regard to cotton;   she had produced fairly full crops, as against short crops in America, so that she had had it both ways, - a large crop and a fairly high price;    she could hardly complain, therefore, if this year she had a small crop and a low price.   As regards oil seeds, output was normal, and as far as could be seen, there would be the normal surplus for export. It was thought that the jute sowings would also probably proceed normally, that is to say, that the area sown would be less than the large area sown last year but probably up to the normal area. The chief competitor with jute was rice, and current quotations for rice in India were not sufficiently high to encourage the cultivator to turn over from jute to rice. India   was rather on tenterhooks as to the monsoon, at this time of the year. There had been a report three weeks ago that the monsoon was going to break particularly early this year; but fortunately those Indications were falsified and it appeared likely that the monsoon would break at the normal time, about the second week of June, and, as far as one could see, would proceed normally.The new procedure with regard to the preferential tariffs on British iron and steel goods had been introduced in India and would govern arrivals at Indian ports from 1st July. It was hoped that there would be no loopholes for evasion by foreign firms. Particulars would be obtained from the Indian Customs as to all arrivals of goods at Indian ports for which the British preferential rates were claimed, and thus all claims for those rates would be scrutinised by the Trade Commissioners&apos; Office in London.  It was hoped that this would make it possible to maintain not only a check on individual consignments but on the working of the scheme as a whole.-IS-
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE wrote:-&quot;The general commercial situation in Chile appears to he improving slightly, although still influenced by the situation in the nitrate industry, but, in the event of a revival on any important scale in the industry, the shortage of merchandise would probably become pronounced, and a consequent increase of orders might be expected to ensue.    Caution is still being exercised in the placing of orders for goods from abroad, which are limited chiefly to those required to cover replace-ment requirements..   Sales of nitrate for delivery in 1926-27 through the official Producers&apos; Association under the system of export quotas have new virtually terminated.    The new system of free selling came into operation on 15th April, and quite a large business has been transacted, although on the basis of prices some 13 per cent, below those fixed by the Association a year ago.    The total free sales in the period 14th April to 15th May, 1927, for delivery in June, 1927, -May, 1926, was 281,630 metric tons, while, in addition, some 85,100 metric tons have been disposed of during the past week at prices averaging about 16s.8d. per metric quintal.    The task of studying the situation in the nitrate industry is In the hands of several Commissions appointed by the Government. The Producers&apos; Association has made various further suggestions for lowering production costs, including the cancellation of the import duties on nitrate bags, a reduction of the railway tariff rates, cancellation of the duties on imported fuel, etc.&quot;Shipments of grain from Argentina continue on a scale above those of last year, the remaining supplies of old crop maize are rapidly diminishing, and the exchange value of the peso has been well maintained at a small fraction under parity. In this connection, it is interesting to note that it is authoritatively reported that shipments of gold from Cape Town to Argentina have recently been arranged.    In view of the fact that exchange has not been quite up to parity, these gold shipments have been of a somewhat exceptional nature, the explanation being that imports of the precious rretal at a small loss were apparently considered justified in order to relieve the credit stringency, the gold being deposited in the Caja de Conversion against corresponding issues of paper currency.   A further report states that a Royal Decree has been signed in Spain authorising a loan of Ptas. 100,000,000 to the Argentine Government.&quot;The official estimate of the yield of the 192 6-27 Argentine maize crop is placed at 7,500,000 tons, which compares with the initial estimate of 7,067,000 tons, and with a crop of 7,100,000 tons in 1925-26.    Ploughing operations for the next wheat, linseed, and oats crops are b6ing continued somewhat slowly, owing to the lack of sufficient rain, but sowing is proceeding generally.    Statistics recently issued by the Argentine Government Statistical Department give the final figures relating to the foreign trade of the Republic during 1926.    These returns show that imports amounted in value
i o oSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTP).to $822,496,497 (gold),  as compared with $876, 847,666 (gold) in 1925, and exports to $792,178,522 (gold), against $867,929,882 (gold), there having been thus an adverse visible trade balance last year of $30,317,975 (gold), following upon an import surplus of $8,917,784 in 1925.   For the first six months of 1926, there was an excess of exports amounting to some $19,166,000 (gold), and the reversion to an unfavourable balance for the whole year was due to the fact that, while exports were lower in the   second half than in the first half of the year by $100,751,908 (gold), imports diminished by only $32,101,971, this result being due partly to a falling off in the quantity of merchandise shipped and partly to a decline in prices.&quot;Conditions in the chief Brazilian markets show little alteration, although a slight tendency tovrards improvement has been observable at Rio do Janeiro and Sao Paulo.    Stocks of &quot;imported goods remain sufficient to meet local requirements, but it appears possible that a demand for goods from abroad may develop in the near future.   The exchange value of the milreis remains very steady at around the parity rate to be established under the new Monetary Law, of 5.89d.&quot;General trade conditions in Peru remain unchanged, importers being disposed to cover their immediate requirements only.    Advices received from Peru by mail state that the sugar market has continued steady in tone.   The demand from Chile, although limited this year,  is expected to have the effect of maintaining the level of prices above the Liverpool equivalent. The cane is of poorer quality than last year, and, while ,It Is as yet somewhat too early to gauge the prospective reduction, the opinion prevails that it will be considerably less than that cf last year.    Reports from all parts of Peru regarding the cotton crop are most favourable.    Picking became general throughout the country towards the end of April and shipments should have commenced in the early part of Hay.    It is estimated that the crop will be far above the average, and, on the basis of current prices, the aggregate value; should be well over  P4, 000, 000.    The loan wf $15,000,000 recently floated in New York and carrying the guarantee of the tobacco revenue has not had the anticipated favourable effect on the course of exchange. Part of the proceeds of the loan has been used in the cancella9 tion of internal bonds secured on the tobacco revenue, but it is believed that the balance has not yet found its way on the market &quot;.TRADii IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE stated that on the Yangtsze British shipping was being very much interfered with, but a bi-weekly service to Hankow under convoy was being oarried on.     Owing to the lack of police protection in Hankow, pilferage, particularly of edible cargoes, was now a common practice.
TRADE IN CHINA (CONTD.).On the coast shipping was in demand, and a considerable amount of cargo was moving between Tientsin and Canton.   The un-settled state of affairs on the Yangtsze River was curtailing business generally in Shanghai, and it was of the greatest importance that steps should be taken to protect property in Hankow, and to restore conditions there in such a way that the banks might re-open and business be resumed.Business was better in the South.   The following was an (extract from a letter from Hongkong recently received;    &quot;The Moderates have steadily gained in power in the south since the boycott was called off and the leaders went to the Yangtsze Valley.   Trade conditions likewise have improved enormously. &quot;The impossible cannot be expected.   The  sea does not &quot;immediately become calm after a storm, it takes time and &quot;gradually settles down.    In my opinion, what difficulties &quot;there may be in trade arise from lack of confidence and &quot;uncertainty regarding the future, instead of direct influence &quot;from the left Wing or Reds, which v/as the position up till &quot;a few months ago&quot;.The position on the railways was still very Unsatisfactory. The Peking-Mukden Railway was at present working efficiently and well, but the whole of the gross revenues on the outer wall section - the Eastern half of the line - had been confiscated by the Chang Tso Lin party, leaving the revenues on the inner wall section ta bear the working expenses of the whole line. The railway1s own loan service had been met, but all other obligations secured on the revenues were in default.   The Tientsin-Pukow Railway, being in the area of present hostilities-ties, was in a complete state of chaos and ruin.   The loan service on the British portion had been in default since November, 1925, and amounted to date to  419,600.On the Shanghai-Nanking Railway the local Chinese military were detaining 75 per cent of the rolling stock for their own purposes, with the result that for the first time in its history the net revenues were not sufficient to cover the half yearly service payable 1st June.   The few trains available for public use were very much overcrowded, shewing that there would be plenty of traffic if the railway were protected from military interference.   As to the Shanghai-Hankchow-Ningpow Railway, the s ame remarks applied.   The interest coupon due 1st June would be paid from ftinds on deposit in London, but the amortization amounting to  75,000   would go into default.With regard to the Canton-Kowloon Railway, through traffic arrangements between Canton and Hongkong had been made by the British section allowing their rolling stock to be used on the Chinese section.    It was hoped that this would lead to further co-operation between the Governments of Canton and Hongkong in the working of the two sections as a whole.   The Chinese sec-tion, however, was intended to connect--with a trunk line from Canton to Hankow, and until this development took place it would never in the best circumstances do much more than cover Its working expenses.   The default on the loan service amounted to  273,600.    It v/as surely very important that strong representation should be made to the Chinese with regard to the state of the railways, Lthe defaults amounting to very largo sums ,
