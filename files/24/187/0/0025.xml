REPORT.In April, 1927,, the Prime Minister appointed aCommittee composed as followsThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (Chairman) IThe Home Secretary The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Colonies0Mrc G0AC Mounsey, CoM0Go,  (Representing theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs)-,(1)    To discuss certain outstanding questions affecting the Opium Policy of His majesty&apos;s government in Great Britain; and (2)    To define the position of each of theDepartments concerned in regard to thesettlement of that policya20     As regards the first part of their Terms of Reference, the Committee have examined the present position respecting the consumption of prepared opium in British Malayae     Speaking generally the figures indicate a pro-gressive decline of consumption for several years to 1925c In 1926, however, consumption increased substantially. Valid reasons for this increase can be pleaded, but the fact that an increase has taken place, in conjunction with certain other considerations and particularly with the slow progress in implementing the recommendations of the Malayan Opium Committee&apos; of 1924, will, It is   apprehended be the subject of embarrassing criticism on the next occasion-1-
when the question of Opium Policy is discussed at the League of UationsB     In present conditions, however, variations in total consumption in accordance with changing local conditions must bo expected, and it is impossible to guarantee that there will not be an occasional increase in some one year, although the effect of the measures now in force and. contemplated should be in the direction of a reduction over a longer period even before the pledge mentioned in the ne;:t paragraph becomes operative.30     The British Government have entered into solemn international obligations eventually to suppress opium smoking throughout British territories,,      Under the Geneva Agreement of 1925 the pledge is for the abolition of opium smoking in the British Par Eastern territories within a period of not more than 15 years from the date on which the effective execution of the measures taken by China to suppress the growth of the opium poppy has -reached such a stage as to remove the danger of opium smuggling from China into those territories.      This conditional pledge is in addition to and not in substitution for the general -obligation under the Hague Convention of 1912 &quot;to take measures for the gradual and effective suppression of the use of prepared opium with due regard to the varying circumstances of each country concerned,,&quot;40      The Committee fully realise the peculiar difficulties with which the local Governments of I alaya are faced in dealing with this problem, and they appreciate the extent to which those Governments have in the past taken steps to carry out the general policy laid down in 1925.&apos;
But the Committee feel it is importr-nt that no doubtshould be allowed to rest on the datermination of theBritish Government to discharge completely its inter-national obligations.They have accordingly invited theSecretary of State for the Colonies to arrange for a despatch to be sent to Ilalaya. reviewing the position since 1925 drawing attention to the extent to which there has been delay In implementing the recommendations of the Malayan Opium Committee, and to the recent increase in the consumption of prepared opium, and emphatically re-affirming the determination of the British Government to carry out its undertairings under the Hague Convention of 1912 and the Geneva Agreement of 1925 to the fullest practicable extent c50     It is proposed that the despatch should be drafted in such a form as to enable its terms to be communicated to the League of Nations as evidence of the present attitude of the British Government in this particular matter  60     As regards the second part of their terms of reference the Committee have considered the question of min? sterial responsibility as regards the position of the British Representative on the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations.      Under a decision of the Government taken in February, 1921, the nomination of the British Representative rests with the Home Secretary.7n      The Committee have been assured that as regards questions concerning Opium administration in the Far Eastern Colonies the Home Office do not claim to be the governing department nor would the British Representative contemplate taking instructions in -regard to such questions from any source
other than the Secretary of State for the Colonies or the Cabinet,     In taking note of this assurance the Committee also accept the view that substantial administrative and other advantages will be secured by the continuance of the present arrangements tinder which the responsibility for the general co-ordination of qtiest-;ons of Opium policy rests with the Home Office in close consultation with the other interested departments,8.     The normal practice is for the Foreign Office to be the channel for all communications between a British Representative at an international conference and the Government except that if he is a Cabinet Minister he may prefer to communicate with the Prime Minister or the Cabinet directc     The Committee suggest that the Cabinet should give formal approval to this procedure being adopted in all future cases on the understanding that the arrangement will in no ^ay preclude a British Representative who is a departmental official from consulting semi-officially with his own department as he may think fit.      If the Committee^ suggestion is accepted the arrangements would, of course, apply to the British Representative on the Opium Advisory Committee, who accordingly, while the Committee is in Session will conduct any necessary official correspondence through the Foreign Officen     Then the Committee is not in Session he roverts to his position as a Departmental officer and the normal channels of communication will be employed as heretofore^     The Committee desire to add that there is not the slightest intention of criticising adversely the conduct of c&apos;-ir Malcolm Delevingne who, on the contrary, by his devotion and ability has deserved well of his countrye
9.     The Committee also think it desirable that t3iemachinery for the co-ordination of departmental vi^wson Opium policy should be improved and they suggestthat following the precedent of the establishment ofthe Inter-departmental Committee on International labour questions, a standing Interdepartmental Committee shouldbe constituted (on which all the interested departments would be represented) for the purpose of facilitatingsuch co-ordinal ion of views both as regards Opium policy generally and also as regards the adminlstration ofthat policy in the Far Eastorn Colonies,10,      The Committee submit to the Cabinet the followingrscommendations on the second part of their terms ofreference:-(1)    That in future the Foreign office should be the normal channel of all communications between a British Representative at an International Conference and the Government, except that if he is a Cabinet Minister he may prefer to communicate with the&apos; Prime Minister or the Cabinet directs(2)    That the above rule should in no way preclude a British Representative from consulting semi-officially with his own Department as may be necessary or desirable,(3)    That a Standing Inter-departmental Advisory Committee composed of representatives of the interested Departments should be appointed for the purpose of facilitating co-ordination of Opium policy both generally and particularly as regards administration in the Far Eastern Colonies,,Signed on behalf of the ComnittCECIL.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, 10th June, 1927.Chairman,
