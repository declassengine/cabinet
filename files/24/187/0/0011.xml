[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*3 GOVERNMENTiCRET. p. 161(27).COPY NO.CABINET. SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES PROCEDURE. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. I desire to direct the attention of my colleagues to the position which has arisen in respect of two important industries which have made applications under the White Paper relating to the Safeguarding of Industries (Frocedure and Enquiries).2&quot; The Worsted Industry.   A Committee was appointed in October, 1925, to enquire into an application for the imposition of a duty upon certain classes of tissues or fabrics made wholly or partly from wool or hair - these classes being known generally as &quot;worsteds&quot;.The Committee found in February, 1926, that the industry concerned Is of &quot;substantial importance&quot;;    that foreign goods of the class to which the application relates are being sold here at prices below those at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom;    that the foreign competition was unfair in so far as it arose from the depreciation of the French currency;    that the British industry is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy;    and that the imposition of a duty would not exert a seriously adverse effect on eraploy-ment in any other industry.    Two members of the Committee found that the foreign goods in question were being imported into this country In &quot;abnormal&quot; quantities: the third member (Mr. Ernest Bevin) thought that this was not yet the case, but that &quot;if imports continue to increase to the same extent as in the past few years they soon will become abnormal&quot;.   As regards employment the Committee found that it was not at the time seriously affected by the importations of foreign goods.-1-
The Committee consequently did not propose a duty, hut recommended that close observation should be directed to the operation of three factors - (a) depreciation of foreign currencies, (b) volume of retained imports, and (c) employment, and that if seriously increased unemployment arising from a substantial Increase in retained imports should be accompanied by an increase in the bounty arising from further currency depreciation, a duty should be imposed. Mr. .Bevin qualified this by the suggestion that the duty should not be imposed until an enquiry had been held into costs in the industry as a whole (including combing, spinning and dyeing),3,   The Hosiery Industry.   A Committee was appointed in February, 1926, to enquire into an application by the National Joint Industrial Council of the Hosiery Trade for the imposition, of a duty on hosiery and knitwear of cotton or wool.The Committee reported (July 1926) that the industry con-cerned is of substantial importance;    that only in the case of cotton stockings and hose and cotton underwear were the imports abnormal; that in these lines the foreign goods are being sold here at prices below those at which they can be profitably manufactured in the United Kingdom;    that such competition comes from countries where the wages paid are at such a level and of such a nature as to constitute &apos;&apos;unfair competition&quot;; that the industry here Is being carried on in all the circumstances with reasonable efficiency and economy, though they thought British makers might give more attention to mass production and standardisation;    and that the imposition of a duty would not adversely affect any other industry.    But the Committee also found that at the time employment in the industry, taken as a whol9, was not being seriously affected, though the importation of cotton hosiery and underwear was rapidly   reaching such proportions as might seriously affect employment in those branches of the industry.The Committee were therefore unable to propose a duty, but-2-
they suggested that if the importation of cotton hosiery and underwear continued to increase, and there should be an increase in unemployment,  applicants should be given a further opportunity of putting forward evidence as to costs of production and the possible effects thereon of mass production and standardisation,4,    ?ince the Worsted report was published I have received constant complaints from the industry to the effect that the situation has become materially worse, and requests that the Government should now give effect to the recommendation of the Committee as to the imposition of a duty. So far I have not seen my way to making such a proposal to my colleagues, partly because the competition from Prance declined in 1926 as compared with 1925, whilst that from Germany (which cannot now be ascribed to depreciated currency)  increased very rapidly;    and the statistics of both employment for the woollen and worsted industries as a whole and the retained imports of raw wool have shown a marked improvement. But. these latter facts are not necessarily incompatible with severe and increasing depression in the complaining section of the industry, and though that section has not,  I think, succeeded in making out a statistical case there is no doubt that there is real ground for anxiety.5.    The Joint Industrial Council of th9 Hosiery Trade have now made a formal application for the re-appointment of the Hosiery Committee to review the situation in the light of the changes that have taken place since that Committee reported, and I am bound to say that in my judgment they have made out at least a prima facie case for re-consideration.6.    My colleagues will have observed that the Worsted Committee recommended the imposition of a duty in certain circumstances without a fresh reference to a Committee, but that if the condition of the trade has become worse it is owing to competition of a kind which the Committee did not envisage.-3- k
The Hosiery Committee were more indefinite: they suggested that if importation of cotton hosiery and unemployment increased, the applicants should be given the opportunity of putting forward further evidence as to possible economies In production. In view of their finding that the industry here is being carried on with reasonable efficiency and economy I am not clear as to the precise relevancy of such additional evidence: and the Committee did not indicate if they contemplated a review of the case by themselves, or by a new committee, or by the Board of Trade.7. Some decision must be taken on the formal application from the Hosiery industry for a re-hearing, and whatever is done in that case will determine the course to be taken in respect of a similar application from the Worsted industry, which is I think certain to come before long.There appear to me to be two alternative courses:(a) Reference to a committee (whether the old onereconstituted, or a new one) set up under the Safeguarding Procedure:(b) Reference of the Hosiery application forthwith to theCommittee of Civil Research or some other Cabinet committee, which might subsequently consider the case of the Worsted Industry. 8. As regards the first of these alternatives I am bound to say that the jid hoc Committee system has not worked very well and is greatly disliked.    The proceedings in some cases have been very protracted and expensive: importers of foreign goods have had ample time to bring in large stocks: the committees have not adopted a uniform interpretation of their instructions: and the reports have varied greatly in clarity*    And in view of the continued agitation it would I think be Impossible to eel up a Hosiery committee again without also constituting a Worsted committee.
9. I do not think that in deciding upon renewed applications without re-appointing committees we could be charged with any breach of our pledges in respect of the Safeguarding of Industries procedure.     In each of the two cases set out above an enquiry by committee has been held in each case the committee has suggested action in certain eventualities, which may on enquiry be shown to have arisen.I am therefore in favour of reference to a Cabinet Committee, though as it would obviously be undesirable for such Committee to take evidence from the various interests concerned, the collection of the necessary information would be undertaken by my Department, with the assistance of the Customs and the Ministry of Labour.   That Is to say, the course to be taken would be similar to that adopted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when considering the possibility of a new customs duty for revenue purposes.10. I accordingly recommend to my colleagues the appointment of a Committee of the Cabinet to consider the Hosiery application and any other renewal of a safeguarding application which has already formed the subject of a reference to a Committee under the v.&apos;hite Paper procedure.11* If the Cabinet agree with my suggestion I should inform the Hosiery Trade that the Government do not propose to reappoint the Committee, which has already made a full report, and that any decision which may be necessary will be taken by the Government without further reference to a Committee,P.C-L.Board of Trade,33rd May, 1927.
