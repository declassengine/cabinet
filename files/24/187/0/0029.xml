The Cotrcrittee had before then1 a Report bythe Committee of Chiefs of Staff (CaPu-171 (27)) on the subject of the Defence of Wei-hai-Wei, covering, a memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee f0sDo0. 523 M) , the conclusions of which are summed up in paragraph 12 of the ivlemorandum as follows:-(a) The defence of the northern portion of the Wei^hai-wei peninsula and of the Island of Liu-Kung-tao is practicable.(b) For maintenance of order in this portion and defsme against local bandits one battalion should suffice.(c) for maintenance of order in this portion and defence against a general anti-fereign rising, supported by a small force of Nationalist troops, a minirmim of 3 battalions and 1 pack battery, assisted by Naval gun-fire, and a detaeliment of aircraft wouldbe needed.    The possibility of ships bein;7 immobilised by ice must, however, be borne in mind.(d) Whether the above troops can be found from forces now in the Par East will depend on the general situation pie-valling at the time,(e) The presence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in the Colony would seriously compli-cate the accommodation problem, since all the existing accommodation and more would be requir3d fer the troops mentioned in (b)  and (c) above.    His presence would also involve an additional military commitment,  and would thus prnve an embarrassment.(f) The evacuation of the remainder of the Leased Territory outside the defensive sane would be advisable inthe event of the situation deteriorating.In expressing entire agreement with the Conclusions reached, the Chiefs of Staff emphasized that these must be regarded as an acadercic appreciation of the situation, and that the actual plan of def-nce and the size of the force required to rive effect, to it must be left to the discretion of the Naval Comroander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding in China.
The Committee also had under consideration the f o 11 ov/ i ng t le gr am s : -Prom the Sacrabary of State for the Colonies (Mo. 0.0c183 (27)) to the Commissioner of Wei-hai-wei, dated June 4, 1027,, summarising the above Report;    directing the Cbnmissioner to communicate with the Commander-in-Chief with a view to preliminary preparation; and stating that a Eat ballon from the Shanghai Defence Force was now under orders for Wei-hai-wei to act as an escort for the Convalescent Depot, on the arrival of which the detachment now at Wei-hai-wei would he withdrawn to Tientsin:From the Commissioner of Wei-hai-wei (No. CO. 134 (27)), to the Secretary ef State for the Colonies, dated June 8, reporting the preparations and progress at Wei-hai-wei;   welcoming the presence of the Battalion;    stating that he had conferred with General Duncan; and suggesting, inter allat that with aircraft the whole territory could he protested by a smaller force than experts at home, without knowledge of China, consider necessary:From the Naval Commander-in-Chief in China (No.1164), dated June 14, stating that he was assured hy the Consul-General at Shanghai and Col. Carpenter, RCM.5 hoth o&quot;f whom are intimately acquainted with Wei-hai-wei, that two additional Battalions and Batteries were entirely unnecessary and that one Battalion and a few seaplanes, which Admiral Tyrwhitt proposed to send in the &quot;Argus&quot;, could hold the whole of the Leased Territory against any force which was likely to attempt to break, through.Lord Beatty stated that he saw no. probability ff 3 Battalions and one Pack Battery being required so far as sould at present be judged.CONCLUSION.The Committee agreed that in present circumstances it was unnecessary to maintain more than one Battalion at Wei-hai-wei for defensive purposes.Pitop^spnADDITION Sir I.

Sir L- VJorthinpton-Evans referred to a proposal by the Naval Commander-in-Chief for the appointment of a General Oflicer Commanding-in-Chief all the British forces in China.     He thought it unnecessary to send out a Lieutenant-General ana a new Staff, and proposed to make General Duncan, who v/as at present in command of the Shanghai Defence Force only, responsible for all the British military forces in China, including the North China Command.    Admiral Tyrwhitt was senior to him and would remain so.Lord Bcatty said that this would meet Admiral Tyrwhitfs views, and explained that the lattGr*s proposal was dictated solely by a desire to intimate that if His Majesty!s Government thought of sending out a military officer senior to him he woulri. gladly serve under him.Mro ,-Apery suggested that General Duncan&apos;s Command should not include the forces at Hongkong? and Sir L* Worthington-Evans agreed.2, Whitehall Gardens,  So\;v.l.
