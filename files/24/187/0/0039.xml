The proposals of the Secretary of State for the Colonies raise constitutional questions of &apos;far-reachir.g importance&quot;.     We are in general agreement that the tiao has come to make a preliminary step towards closer co-operation between the different Governments in Central and Eastern Africa;    we consider that it would be of advantage for the proposed Commission to be given as much freedom as possible in framing their recommendations, provided that their terms of Reference indicate sufficiently clearly that His Majesty&apos;s Government as at present advised look for a solution of the problem on the lines of federation or ether

We recommend, therefore, that the terms of the Draft Announcement proposed by the Secretary of St*-.te for the Colonies in CP. 179 (27) should ho approved subject to certain slight modifications as shown in the Appendix to this Report.3.     As regards the composition of the Commission we agree that it is desirable th^t it should contain a member to watch the interests of Indians in East Africa;    and we hope that it will be possible to select for this purpose someone who has also had personal experience in India of the practical working- of a Federal system.Signed on behalf of the Committee.L.

Draft Arm^nremont y^^^Qndecl^b^ CJograittee .His Majesty^ Government consider (kavo-desi-fied) as a result of discussions between &apos;vhe Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Representative.-3 of the territories in British Central and East Africa who attended the recent Colonial Conference, that sonse form of closer union between the territories of Central and Eastern Africa appears (ie-nsw) desirable, more, particularly in regard&quot; to the development of transport and communications, customs tariffs and customs administration, scientific resonroh and defence.     They have therefore authorised the Secreta2*y of State to send to Africa a special commission with the following terms of reference :-1. To make recommendations as to (hew) whether,-either by federatioil0^/other form of closer u.nibvrp,&quot;* more effective - co-operation between the different Governments in Central and Eastern Africa may be secured, more particularly in regard to the development of transport and communications, customs tariffs and customs administration, scientific research and defence.2. To consider which territories could either now or at some future time be brought within any cuch closer union, and, in particular, how best to give effect to Article 10 of the mandate for Tanganyika Territory, which provides that the mandatory may constitute the territory into a customs, fiscal and administrative union or federation with the adjacent territories under its own sovereignty or control, provided aD-ways that the me a cures adopted to that end do not infringe the provisions of the mandate.3. To make recommendations in regard to possible changes In the powers and composition of the various Legislative Councils of the several territories (a) as tho result of the establishment of any Federal Council or other common authority; (b) so as to associate more closely In the responsibilities and trusteeship of Government the immigrant communities domiciled In the country; and (c) so as ultimately to secure more direct representation of native Interests in accordance with (4) below.4. To suggest how the Dual Policy recommended by the Conference of East African Governors (i.e*, the complementar;/- development of native and non-native communities) can best be progressively applied in the political as well as the economic sphere.5. To make recommendations as to what improvements may be required in internal communi cat ions between the various territories so as to facilitate the working of fedoration or closer union,. ,6. To report moro particularly on the financial aspects of any proposals? whioh they may make under any of the above headings.
In making the declaration of policy involved in setting up a Commission with these terms of reference, His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear that they adhere to the underlying principles of the ^&quot;hite Paper of 1923 entitled &quot;Indians in Kenya&quot;  (Cmd. Paper, 1922), both In regard to the political status and other rights of British Indians resident in East Africa, and also as regards the Imperial duty of safeguarding the Interests and progress of the native population as trustees for their welfare until such time as they can take part more fully in their own Government and in the common affairs of all races Inhabiting the territories.     At the same time they wish to place on record their viow that, while these responsibilities of trusteeship must for some considerable time rest mainly on the agents of the Imperial Government, they desire to associate more closely in this high and honourable task those who, as colonists or residents, have identified their interests with the prosperity of the country.- Cj -
