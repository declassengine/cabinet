CP.177 (27). CABINET.STEEL HOUSES - MODIFI.CA.TL01J- .0P PROGRAMME.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a letter from Lord Weir on the subject of the contract between the Cardonald Housing Corporation and the Second Scottish National Housing Company in regard to the programme of Steel Houses.X -5C- -XMy dear Sir John,As I indicated to you last week, a full investigation has now been conducted into the situation of the Csrdonald Housing Corporation and the provisional contract covering 1000 houses, The results of this investigation disclose quil^ clearly -chat the very small margin on the finally quoted prices has been more than dissipated by the delay in receiving site pla.ns and obtaining access to sites.    The provisional contract letter from the Second Scottish National housing Co.,is dated 3l3t March, and to-day. 6th June, we have no sites nor any access to sites to enable us to start work,.Further, this delay means that the major part of the work must be carried out in the worst season of the year with the probability of additional cost.   Also we cannot shut our eyes tv  vhs fact that, in spite of every effort having been made.  -Tic support has been forthcoming from Scottish local authorities to provide the flow of contracts essential for the economic operrtion of our scheme.Under these conditions, and after the most careful consideration by my colleagues, we do not feel justified in incurring further heavy loss by holding our facilities available for -the individual contracts involved in the provisional acceptance letter for 1000 houses of 31st March,     Our Mr. 3-ce-vcn has been in communication with Mr. Jack and Mr.Deas yesterday in Edinburgh, and in view of the whole oircumstances connected with the contracts and the sites, we are prepared to proceed with an individual contract for approximately 500 houses to be built on what is called the Greenfield Sprlngboig site, provided that .&apos;,he siting plan is supplied within fourteen days and access to the site is made available immediately thereafter;    the price of the houses to remain as quoted.It must also be understood that no obligations other than those contained in the previous contracts are incorporated in the single new contract.To avoid delay I have asked Mr. Steven to deliver this letter/
letter personally to you, while I have also arranged for its contents to he telephoned to Mr. Jack.I am, Yours sincerely,&apos;WEIR&apos;Right hon. Sir John Oilmour,  art,, M.P., Montrave, Leven,FIFE.* * *I have seen Lord Weir, and while I regret having to abandon the erection of the 1000 houses, it is clear from Lord Weir&apos;s figures that to complete the 1000 would mean a loss to the Company of about  8000.   I do not feel prepared to suggest that any increase in the price of the houses to cover this should be made.Under the circumstances, therefore, I recommend that I should he authorised to inform the Cardonald Housing Company that we accept the terms of their letter for the completion of 500 houses.&apos;J0R1J GILMQUR&apos;Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,13th June, 1927.
