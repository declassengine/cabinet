Iiemorandum by the Home Secretary.I desire to obtain the authority of the Cabinet for the introduction of a Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Transfer of Funds) Bill,  as in the draft attached.       The Bill is necessary to enable effect to be given,  so far as this country is concerned,  to the Resolution unanimously adopted by the Imperial Conference last year in regard to the transfer of compensation moneys from one part of the Empire to another, as set out in the preamble to the Draft Bill.The Bill has been drafted in consultation with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department and with the Dominions Office and Colonial Office.      It is entirely non-controversial, and should give rise to very little,  if any, discussion. I suggest that the Bill should be introduced at once in the House of Lords with a view to its being passed into law this Session.W . J .
