g G R S T. P.  199 (27) o^0C A 3 I H 3 TISE5 OP HAH (CUSTOMS) BILL, 1927.Memorandum by the Financial Secretary of the Treasury,,This is an annual Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the ITanx legislature and requires very little explanation,,     The Isle of Han has a separate financial existence, levying its own taxes and defraying its ovm expenditure, and in particular, it is completely free as to Customs and Excise duties, subject to confirmation by the Imperial Parliament 0      It would be unprecedented for Parliament to alter them,The effect of the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill is substantially to impose the same Customs tariff as in this country.     The duties on Beer and Spirits remain, as at present, slightly below Imperial rates;    there are no Island duties on sugar, table waters, dried fruits, and wrapping paper:    the duties on all other articles are&apos; at Imperial rates as modified by our own Finance Bill of this year.The Bill, which occupies very little Parliamentary time, and is practically formal,, must be passed before the adjournment, because the Resolutions of the Ilanx Legislature, which were passed in May, are only operative for six months,, Authority is accordingly requested to introduce the Bill and proceed with it at onceRuMcWeTre a sury Chamberlain er s, 15th July, 1927.COPY 1TO:
