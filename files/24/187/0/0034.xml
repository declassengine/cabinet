*j 155(this DOCUKSKT IS THE FROFERTY OP HIS BRITAlMC MAJESTY1 S GOVERilMSKT).T. 185(27) Copy No.CABINET.Albany Street Estate. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Commissioners of Crown Lands have received an offer for the purchase of the crown Estate east of Albany Street, subject to contract, for  800,000.The Estate extends from the Euston Road (Great Portland Street Station) on the south to Regent1a Park Barracks on the north, is bounded on the west by Albany Street, and on the east mainly by Stanhope Street. It comprises some 50 acres,    A comparatively small part at the southern end consists of substantial leaseholds, which are easy to administer and which the Commissioners therefore have no special reason to sell0     At the northern end is Cumberland Basin, surrounded by wharves let on short tenancies;    very little business Is now done at these wharves and the property awaits redevelopment.    The inter-mediate section, the greater part of the vhole, consists of small old houses, practically all of which have recently fallen out of lease and are now let on short tenancies, weekly, monthly or quarterly, at rack rents.    The gross rents amount approximately to  75,000 per annum, and the outgoings, principally repairs and rates, average about  20,000. &apos; The resident population is something over 7,000, mostly of the lowest working class.    Many of the houses are in a deplorable state of dilapidation,  and the expendi-ture on repairs is very heavy in order to keep them in s a,tate fit for habitation.    There is no doubt that within the next 10 or 15 years most if not all of the houses
will be beyond repair and will have to be demolished. The Commissioners are advised that economic re-development will not be practicable, if provision is to be made for re-housing the present population.    On the other hand the property has potentialli- a considerable, if somerrtiet speculative, value for Industrip.1 and commercial purposes, combined with blocks of flats for middle-class occupation. The Commissioners feel that they, as a Government Department, strictly (and necessarily) controlled by the Treasury and subject to Parliamentary criticism, would be seriously handicapped in attempting to develop the estate on sound economic principles, and looking at it from that point of view they would be disposed to accept the offer which thev have received.There are, however, grave political considerations bearing on the Question.    In the first place, there is no precedent for the sale of Crown Land on this scale, and In view of the attitude adopted by the Opposition on the Crown Lands (ilo. 2) Bill, it is more than probable thatthe sale of this estate would provoke a storm of hostile criticism.    The objection to the magnitude of the transaction would also be aggravated in this case by the fact that the property is m3inly occupied by a population of the poorest class;    it would be said that the Crown, which ought to set an example to other landlords, was shirking its responsibilities and abandoning its own tenants to the mercies of speculators.     To some extent, but perhaps not entirely, this  argument might be rebutted by pointing out that the Commissioners of Crown Lands are trustees for the economic administration of the estates in their charge, that they are not a housing authority, and that after the sale, as nov;, the
tenants would have the protection of the Rent Restriction Acts.Secondly, if the principle of sale is approved, there Is the Question whether o sale by private treaty Is advisable.    If the property were cut up Into lots and offered at auction, it is practically certain that the best lots would be sold, and the Commissioners 7/ould have the rest left on their hands.    As a business proposition this cannot be seriously recommended. Alternatively the whole might be put .up to auction in one lot, with a reserve of  800,000.      In that case  -the Commissioners are advised that there Is a great risk of the property not being sold at all, and of the present offer being withdrawn, thereby entailing considerable expense without any result.The decision of the Cabinet is therefore desired on two questions, viz..(1) Should this property be sold at all? (2) If sold, should it be sold by private treaty or first offered by auction. Although a sale for  800,000 would be a profitable transaction, with some hesitation I am Inclined to recommend that in view of the political and other aspects of the case, the offer should be declined and the Commissioners should seek other means of dealing with the Estate, within the next few years.T&quot;.
