[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)f) (i SECRET CABINET. Copy No._O[f2 r\CP.170(27).  * RENT RESTRICTION.    -Memorandum by the Minister of Health. 1. When the question of the continuance of the Rent Restric^-tion Acts was considered by the Cabinet in 1925,;it,was /decided that &quot;the Bill for their extension, (whioh became the Rent and Mortgage interest&apos;(Restriction Continuation) Act, 1925) should be so drafted as to permit of a further oontlrtctance under the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts if this should. prove to be necessary [Cabinet. 14(25) j       .    . .     \j, .12, * The Act of 1925 provided for.the/prolongation of rent restriction until   the 25th December, 1927 In England and Wales and&quot;until the 28th May, 1928 in -Scotland, v &apos; -Although there are no doubt some who consider that rent restriction should be got.rid of at the.end of this &quot;period of prolongation, T am satisfied that the time ha3 not yet arrived when this course can safely be taken, and that the general body of opinion is in favour of and expects a further extension.I have for some time been considering the question whether there 3hould be a simple prolongation of the- present provisions or whether at the same time some amendments should be made in the existing law*      On the merits, I have littleibubt   &quot;&apos; that amendments are called for, especially with the^hjrect&apos; of  : -relieving the small single-house owner.     TJie difficulty is that &apos; ; a Bill to give effect to such anendments could hardly fail to be: contentious and onoe the door was.opened there might be difficulty in limiting the extent of the aperture^      -Accordingly I have coh-resulted&quot;the Chief Whip as to the possibility of finding time during the autumn for a Bill of this kind.  . He assures me that in view:&apos; of the programme already before us any new measure is quiie ! impracticable and I propose, therefore.,. tb;*p.rovIde for the continuance of the existing provisions in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.N.C.50th May, 1927.   -
