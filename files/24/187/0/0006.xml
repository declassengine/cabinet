[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1927.SECRET. Copy No.    Ou\CP. 156 (27).WE have had some discussion as to the supply of arms to this or that Chinese general without any very clear result. The subject is now raised again by the Governor of Hong Kong, and I think it necessary to ask for a definite Cabinet decision.I circulate a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign Office by my instructions in order that Ministers may have before them all the necessary information.Personally, I hold that our policy of neutrality among the factions has been and continues to be right. Nothing else has prevented us at one. time or another from backing the wrong horse, and it is still too soon to pick the winner.Open support of a particular leader or party would embroil us with all others, and quite possibly unite them all against him or it.Finally, I, at any rate, could give no guarantee, that any arms supplied would not sooner or later be turned against us by the party to whom they were supplied or taken from that party and used against us by others.A. foreign Office, May 16, 1927.ARMS EMBARGO AND SUPPLY OF ARMS TO CANTON.MEMORANnUM.THE provision of arms for the Cantonese General, Li Chai-sum, to use against the &quot; Reds &quot; has been strongly recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong and our Acting Consul-General at Canton. Further, the Portuguese Government, who are concerned for the safety of their colony of Macao and have also been approached by General Li, have enquired both here and at Hong Kong regarding our attitude. It is understood that the. French Government have also been approached.This question raises the particular issue of the China Arms Embargo and the general principle of neutrality towards the various contending factions in China.As regards the Arms Embargo, this was an agreement entered into in 1919 by certain Powers &quot; effectively to restrain their subjects and citizens from exporting to, or importing into, China arms and munitions of war and material destined exclusively for their manufacture, until the establishment of a Government whose authority was recognised throughout the whole country.&quot; The Powers concerned were Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, United States, Russia (non-Soviet), Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. Some of these Powers interpreted their obligations very loosely; other Powers notably Soviet Russia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Norway were under no obligation and have exported arms freely to China, while the embargo Powers have had their hands tied. The Foreign Office, feeling that the embargo acted unfairly towards British merchants, and in some ways prejudicially to Great Britain&apos;s wider political interests in China, have from time to time examined the position in order to see whether it could be made more satisfactory. The fundamental difficulty has been the divided state of China, and the fact that arms sold or given to any one Chinese faction would be a departure from our policy of neutrality and an intervention in Chinese domestic affairs. The latest instructions on the subject were those sent to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking on the 13th April, 1926. They were to the effect that when it was quite clear that the psychological moment had arrived, and that a fairly stable Government was in power, we would proceed to replace the Arms Embargo by a policy of applying to British subjects the Chinese law prohibiting the import of 3984   [16169] b
arms and ammunition, i.e., we would supply arms only to the Central Government of China and their nominees. At the same time, in view of the fact that other embargo Powers were supplying aeroplanes to the Chinese in spite of our attempts to tighten up the embargo under this heading, we decided not to regard aeroplanes for commercial purposes as coming within the scope of the embargo. It is in view of this last decision that we have recently declined to intervene in order to prevent Messrs Vickers from carrying out an order for aeroplanes for Marshal Chang Tso-lin.The supply of arms and munitions to General Li is on quite a different footing. The question of including aeroplanes in the embargo was a point on which the embargo Powers were not agreed; but the supply of arms and munitions would be in flat contradiction to the Embargo Agreement, and we could scarcely be so cynical as to remain parties to the Agreement, while at the same time supplying General Li with arms. We would therefore have to withdraw from the Agreement. No doubt other Powers would follow our example, but upon us would rest the odium of breaking down an arrangement which, although partially ineffective, has certainly, to some extent, prevented a general scramble to supply the Chinese with arms, and has stood as a visible sign of tlie Powers&apos; refusal to take sides in the Chinese civil war.This brings us to the wider question of neutrality. Marshal Chang Tso-lin has repeatedly approached His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking for British support in his anti-Bolshevik campaign. His latest appeal is attached hereto (A), together with the reply (B) which it is proposed to send to Sir M. Lampson. This reply reaffirms the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to refrain from any action which might be interpreted as interference in China&apos;s internal affairs, arid to observe complete neutrality between all the contesting factions. If we refuse a loan for Chang Tso-lin to pursue his anti-&quot; Red&quot; activities, it is clear that we must also refuse to assist General Li with arms. If we supply the arms to General Li, Chang will at once accuse us of giving help to his enemies (for General Li is a Southerner) and refusing it to himself. It would be very difficult to defend our position in such a case, and Chang would be fully justified in accusing us of action unfriendly to him.Further reasons for refusing to supply arms to General Li will be found in the draft reply to the Colonial Office, which is attached hereto (C). They are as follows : (1.) We can have no special confidence in General Li; in China military leaders rise and fall; their professions of friendship are quite unreliable.(2.) There is no possible guarantee that the arms supplied will be used solely against the Communists at Canton. General Li&apos;s command is part of the Southern army; only a short time ago Sir M. Lampson was anxious as to the possibility of Southern troops arriving before Peking and Tien-tsin; so the arms might very well be used for an anti-Northern expedition.(3.) Or they might be used for an attack against British troops in the Shanghai area.The reasons in favour of the supply of arms have been put forward by the Governor of Hong Korig and are strongly supported by the Colonial Office. They rest on a belief that General Li is determined to maintain order and to suppress Communism, piracy and brigandage in Kwangtung Province; and that his proper use of them could be guaranteed by granting only small supplies of arms at intervals and by making each delivery contingent on our being satisfied that he was carrying out his undertakings. The Colonial Office contend that this would be merely supply of arms to the established authority in Canton for police purposes, and therefore outside the scope of the Embargo Agreement. Further, they do not consider it would be a breach of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy of neutrality, since General Li is understood to have been in control of Canton for some months, and&apos; appears now to. have succeeded in consolidating his position there. They point to the subsidising of the Governor of Yunnan by the French and to the material assistance &quot;lent by the Japanese to Chang Tso-lin in Manchuria&quot; as precedents for such action. But, for the reasons stated above, the Foreign Office cannot accept so wide an interpretation either of their arms embargo obligations or of their neutrality policy.A further suggestion is made by the Acting Consul-general  at Canton (and approved by the Government of Hong Kong) that if we ourselves cannot supply arms, we should aliow such arfns to be supplied through a German firm, and give the Cantonese an assurance that the consignment would not be seized en route under
the arms regulations of our Colonial Governments. Further, that he should authorise a British insurance company to cover the risk. This suggestion is approved by His Majesty&apos;s Admiralty, but strongly opposed by the Colonial Office, who advocate instead the secret supply of arms to the Canton Government by His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves. To the Foreign Office Mr. Brenan&apos;s proposal seems to be a half-measure with all the disadvantages that half-measures generally have. It would be no less un-neutral than a direct supply of arms, especially as we have held up and confiscated at Singapore recently a shipment of arms for the Northern leaders. Further, the Germans themselves are beginning to realise that the profits of the China arms trade are hardly worth the invidious position into which they have been getting themselves; and on the 9th May the German consul at Hong Kong handed to the Colonial Secretary the following translation of a communication issued by the German Legation at Peking on the 18th April: &quot; Association of German shipowners and German East Asiatic Society at Hamburg have decided not to undertake or execute any shipment of arms and ammunition of war which are destined to be used in China from German ports or on German ships.&quot;The Foreign Office therefore hold to their long-established policy of carrying out to the fullest extent their obligations under the Arms Embargo and of maintaining strict neutrality in China; they suggest that instructions should be issued as in the attached telegrams to Sir M. Lampson at Peking and to Mr. Brenan at Canton; that the enclosed letter on the subject should be addressed to the Colonial Office; and that the Portuguese Embassy should be informed of their views.Foreign Office, May 16, 1927.(A.)Sir M. Lampson to Sir Austen Chamberlain. -^Received May 6.) (No. 825.)(Telegraphic.) Peking, May 5, 1927.CHANG TSO-LIN called 4th May, and after enquiring what decisions had been reached by the Powers concerning action on Yang-tsze, developed at length, with usual arguments, reasons why His Majesty&apos;s Government should assist him in combating Bolshevism in China. He referred to further proof we had recently had, from raid on Russian propaganda headquarters here, of Bolshevik designs to destroy British interests in China. He discounted genuineness of so-called moderate movement of Chiang, which he described as [ ? omitted : prompted by] purely personal motives. We had already, to all intents and purposes, intervened with troops and ships without accomplishing much beyond incurring odium, and we should find it very much more effective and cheaper to secure our objects by supporting him. In any case, it was not a question of intervening in Chinese affairs, but of taking steps to combat world menace of Bolshevism, which, if allowed to take root in China, would spread all over Asia, including India. His troops had now reached the neighbourhood of Sinyang in Southern Honan, but he was now halting their further advance into Hupei until he had ascertained intentions of the Powers towards Bolshevik menace, which he was not prepared to deal with single-handed on the Yang-tsze. He threw out usual hints of his having even to abandon Peking and to withdraw to Manchuria if the Powers would not afford him the necessary support. Referring to Japanese and their double policy of supporting him in the North and Chiang in the South, he said they were still in close touch with Chiang, hoped to replace Russians in the latter&apos;s employment by Japanese, and to benefit by destruction of British commercial interests.I explained to him our policy of non-intervention, but promised, at his urgent request, to transmit his message to you.(Repeated to Tokyo, Shanghai, Mr. Newton, Hong Kong, Canton and Commander-in-chief.)[16169]
(B.)Draft Reply to Sir M. Lampson (Peking).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May    , 1927.YOUR telegram No. 825. Your attitude is fully approved.You should in any further conversations or communications with Chang Tso-lin explain to him clearly that his suggestion that His Majesty&apos;s Government should assist him in fighting Bolshevism in China and that his future movements depend upon the intentions of the Powers towards the Bolshevist menace in that country practically constitute an invitation to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other Powers to co-operate with him in action amounting, on their part, to direct inter-vention in the internal affairs of China.Such an invitation cannot possibly be accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, whose main object at the present time is to refrain from any action which might be interpreted as interference in China&apos;s internal affairs and to observe complete neutrality between all the contesting factions.His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot believe, moreover, that they would be in fact assisting Chang Tso-lin&apos;s cause or helping on the campaign upon which he is already successfully embarked for dealing with the extremist elements in territory under his control by adopting a new policy on the suggested lines, which would publicly associate his name with their action, and so probably serve to discredit him with other Chinese elements, and perhaps produce a general reaction from the tendency now becoming apparent all over China to deal with extremist and Bolshevist movements as they deserve.Repeat to Tokyo, Shanghai, Mr. Newton, Canton for Hong Kong.(C.)Draft Letter to Colonial Office.Sir, Foreign Office, May    , 1927.WITH reference to Colonial Office letter of the 4th instant, transmitting copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Governor of Hong Kong regarding the suggested relaxation of the Arms Embargo in favour of General Li Chai-sum, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to state that he has carefully examined this proposal.2. It appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain that it is at present premature to form any conclusions as to the value of any assurances given by General Li, of whom comparatively little is known. The past has seen many instances of the rise of military leaders who made amicable professions and whose prospects appeared promising, but who have speedily proved to be either unreliable or ineffectual, and it accordingly appears essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should observe the &quot;utmost caution in their relations with any new aspirant.3. Moreover, any assistance, however, restricted, and however well safe-guarded by conditions and assurances, would, in fact, be the first step in a new policy of rendering concrete help in the suppression of Bolshevism in China. Mr. Secretary Amery will remember that in his telegram No. 825 of the 5th instant, Sir M. Lampson reported that he had been approached by Chang Tso-lin with a request for assistance for thus purpose. Sir Austen Chamberlain proposes to send the enclosed reply to Sir M. Lampson,* explaining the grounds on which it is impossible to accede to his request. The reasons which necessitate this attitude in the case of such an old-established and well-known leader as Chang Tso-lin, would apply with much greater force to the case of a comparative new-comer like Li Chai-sum, and while he is refusing assistance to the former, Sir Austen Chamberlain cannot consider facilitating the supply of arms to the latter.4. A further reason for not agreeing to these latest proposals lies in the fact that only a short time ago Sir M. Lampson was anxious as to the possibility of Southern troops invading Peking and Tien-tsin. While the probability of this is more remote at the present moment, it is a possibility that must always be contem-plated, and it is obvious that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be placed in a most embarrassing position vis-a-vis the Peking Government if it could be shown that* See(B).
Enclosure in (C). Mr. Brenan to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received May 6.)(No. 32.)(Telegraphic.) Canton (via Hong Kong), May 6, 1927.COLONIAL. OFFICE telegram to Hong Kong of 3rd May.Although General Li Chai-sum is at present the outstanding person in Canton, he is by no means an all-powerful dictator. He is still nominally the subordinate of Chiang, and cannot ignore Kuo Min-tang. I fear, therefore, it is useless to expect from him the declaration suggested by Governor of Hong Kong.I do not suggest we should supply him with arms or encourage British firms to enter into credit transactions, but only that he be given facilities to buy for cash at reasonable rates in Hong Kong or through Hong Kong agents. I quite agree that we should regard Chiang&apos;s faction with caution. They are not friendly to us, and we may yet have to deal drastically with them, but in the meantime they are undoubtedly fighting our battle by attacking Communists and Soviet agents. They have just searched Soviet consul&apos;s mails in Canton and found incriminating documents. If they are forced to compromise with Communists because we prevent them from getting arms we may look for renewal of anti-British boycott in this province, whereas trade prospects are &quot;now improving.General Li Chai-sum is attempting to obtain a consignment of arms, ammunition and explosives through a German firm. German agent has given me particulars and stated that he can import these from Scandinavian countries by a Norwegian ship provided shipment will not be stopped by British, and he asked attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in view of anti-Communist movement. He also wished to insure with a British company. I could only reply that, provided that the ship did not enter British waters, consignment was not likely to be stopped. As it is difficult to avoid British ports, this is unsatisfactory, and risk of seizure makes transactions unattractive except at high price. In the present circumstances can I give assurance that consignment for Li Chai-sum will not be seized en route and authorise British insurance company to cover risk ?Canton naval authorities also wish to order from Arnhold and Co. eight motor-boats with Thornycroft engines and wireless for pirate prevention, and have offered attractive terms for payment. I have told agent that there is no objection provided that no armament is supplied, but if you do not approve please telegraph immediately, as the matter is urgent.Anti-foreign movement was not contemplated when Arms Agreement was concluded. Latter, like all co-operative schemes in China, has proved a sorry farce from British point of view and is now definitely dangerous to our interests. We cannot afford to discard any political weapon in present struggle, and should use our control of arms trade, especially in Hong Kong, to our own advantage.(Repeated to Peking, No. 45, &quot;and Hong Kong.)they had in any way contributed, however indirectly, towards the strength of the Southern forces.5. A further point to be considered in this connection is that Li Chai-sum is nominally a subordinate of Chiang Kai-shek; it is, therefore, by no means improbable that any arms which His Majesty&apos;s Government allowed to reach the former would eventually be used by the latter&apos;s troops in the Shanghai area. In view of the presence of British troops in that area, and the possibility that such arms might be used against them, Sir Austen Chamberlain considers that every precau-tion must be taken to guard against this contingency.6. A copy is enclosed of Mir. Brenan&apos;s telegram No. 32 of the 6th May, in which he supports the Governor of Hong Kong&apos;s suggestion. Sir Austen Chamberlain, however, remains unconvinced as to the desirability for embarking on this new Arms policy for reasons adduced above. His objections, of course, do not apply to the sale of unarmed motor-boats to the Canton authorities. As regards the proposed shipment of arms through a German firm, it is clear that no special treatment can be given at British ports such as has been and will be denied to other , shipments consigned to other Chinese traders. In fact, the foregoing arguments / ^a-lJ^ apply as in the case of a direct sale of arms. Mr. Brenan will be informed accordingly, and instructed that the assurance and authorisation suggested in the third paragraph of his telegram must not be given.
(D.)Draft Reply to Mr. Brenan (Canton).(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, May    , 1927.YOUR telegram No. 32 : Supply of arms for General Li Chai-sum.We cannot give assurance regarding special treatment at British ports for German consignment of arms for General Li. This would constitute a departure from our arms embargo policy and from our policy of strict neutrality in Chinese civil war. As recently as last March we confiscated at Singapore shipment of gunpowder for Tsinanfu arsenal; and we have just refused any material help to-Chang Tso-lin in his anti-Red campaign.To help General Li in way suggested would stultify our general policy; nor is there any guarantee that these arms would not eventually be used in anti-Northern campaign, or even against our own troops at Shanghai.There is no objection to sale of unarmed motor boats.Please repeat to Peking and Hong Kong.
