Papers Nos. 814-B, 815-B, 816-B, 818-B, and 819-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 227th Meeting.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the situation which had arisen at the Naval Conference at Geneva in regard to a limitation of cruisers. In this connection there had been circulated to the Committee (a) copies of two telegrams from the British Delegation at Geneva (C.I.D. Paper 814-B); (b) a Note by the Secretary on the proceedings of the Washington Conference regarding cruisers (C.I.D. Paper No. 815-B); and (c) a draft telegram to the British Delegation at Geneva, drawn up by Lord balfour (C.I.D. Paper No. 816-B). In addition, three telegrams, which have since been circulated as C.I.D. Paper No. 819-B, were communicated to the Committee at the commencement of the meeting by Sir Austen Chamberlain.Mr. CHURCHILL stated that he did not understand how the tonnage of cruisers could be considered apart from the quality and life of the ships concerned.LORD BE ATT Y agreed and said that, if a limitation of tonnage for cruisers was accepted, the Admiralty would have to work out a programme whereby this limited tonnage could be put to the best use. The Admiralty had always resisted proposals for tonnage limitation in regard to cruisers. At the present time, the British Fleet contained some 30 cruisers each of 4,000 to 5,000 tons, which had been specially designed for operations in the North Sea. These cruisers were not comparable to those which were now being built by the United States of America and Japan. In fact, if a tonnage limitation was accepted, Great Britain would have to sacrifice a number of her small cruisers in order to build bigger and better ships, so as to ensure a measure of equality with the Fleets of the other two principal Naval Powers. In this way, the needs of economy would not only be disserved, but considerable additional expenditure would be incurred.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN drew attention to the point raised by Mr. Bridgeman to the effect that the latest Japanese proposals placed the British Empire in a more impossible position than had previously existed, and that in consequence the American Delegation, by way of extending an &quot;olive branch,&quot; had &quot; intimated their willingness to explore further a plan, tentatively examined some days ago, but subsequently abandoned, namely, that limitation be effected by actually incorporating in the Treaty cruiser building programmes of the three Powers up to 1936.&quot;   (See telegram No. 157, L.N., C.I.D. Paper No. 819-B.)LORD BEATTY observed that, while this proposal might be regarded as a possible solution of the immediate difficulty, when the ten-year period had expired the same problem would arise in possibly a more acute form, because Great Britain would then have to put forward proposals for an increase in her number of cruisers, which would probably be regarded as provocative.
LORD SALISBURY remarked that an agreement in regard to building programmes up to 1936 would involve our programme being altered in accordance with that of America and bargaining would begin all over again.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that the American proposals were to the effect that, having at the present time eight 10,000-ton cruisers built and projected, they now proposed to build twenty-five 10,000-ton cruisers and eleven 7,500-ton cruisers.LORD BEATTY explained that the American proposal was to have a fleet of twenty-five 10,000-cruisers, which would involve laying down seventeen new 10,000-ton cruisers in addition to eight building and projected to complete this total, while, in addition, they propose to build eleven 7,500-ton cruisers. Great Britain had at the present time fourteen 10,000-ton cruisers, and would have to build an additional eleven cruisers of this type to secure equality with the United States of America, and consequently, in order not to exceed the total tonnage limitation, would have to scrap a large number of her existing small cruisers.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN suggested that the point which should be brought out was that the American proposals amounted in effect to trebling the existing number of cruisers of the most powerful and most expensive type.LORD BIRKENHEAD observed that nowhere in the telegrams from Geneva did it appear that the British Delegation had pointed out that the discussions as to a limitation of tonnage were quite useless unless coupled with stipulations regarding the quality and life of the individual ships concerned.Mr. CHURCHILL considered that Great Britain should not be over anxious in regard to a possible breakdown of the Conference at Geneva. To become entangled in an undesirable set of conditions and limitations would be much worse in effect than a breakdown of the Conference. The steps which should be. taken to ensure that a breakdown was not attributed to Great Britain was another question, with which he did not intend to deal at the moment. Should the Conference break down, pre-sumably the Republican party in America would advocate the laying down immediately of the 10 cruisers which had already been approved, but for which the President had withheld the requisite funds. The immediate laying-down of these 10 cruisers would not endanger the situation so far as Great Britain was concerned. The cost of these 10 cruisers would be approximately  30,000,000. Attention in America would be focussed oh the expenditure of this large sum of money. A reaction of opinion would probably take place in America, which the Democratic party would seize as an occasion to launch an attack against the &quot;big navy &quot; party and steel magnates, on the grounds that America, far from following the righteous course of limiting armaments and discouraging war, was leading the world in the building of large fleets. Though this was an important consideration, of far greater importance would be the effect upon Japan of a considerable increase in America&apos;s building programme. Always in the past, when Great Britain had been faced with burdens which were difficult to bear, she had had recourse to combinations with other countries. An additional 10 cruisers in the American Fleet would not imperil our relations with that country, but the effect of such an addition upon Japan would be to cause great alarm and suspicion. She would see in this addition a direct threat to. her life and to her home security. The result might be to cause Japan to increase her building programme and perhaps to bring Japan and Great Britain closer together. While actually no definite alliance might result, the fact that relations between Japan and Great Britain were becoming closer would cause America to reflect. In these circumstances, he w*as in favour of permitting a large addition to America^ building programme to pass without comment on our part. The alternative to building ourselves would be to renew the Japanese Alliance. At the time when this Alliance was cancelled we undoubtedly acted rightly, but we had secured no advantage from this change of policy. He suggested, therefore, that we ought not to fear an additional building programme on the part of America, but should view that programme with outward equanimity. As regards the smaller type of cruisers, we should resolutely refuse to accept any binding limitations. We should publicly announce our intention of building as few of these cruisers as possible, having regard to our commitments for the protection of our trade, and that we would never consent to any conditions which fettered our freedom in this direction.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he was unable to agree with the appreciation of the situation drawn up by Mr. Churchill.   If America built 17
Ziillarge cruisers in addition to those which she already had in existence, then we would be faced with the alternative of either abandoning the one-Power standard or else of building 10 or 11 additional cruisers ourselves. Either alternative Would be deplorable. He was anxious that the present Conference at Geneva should be brought to a success. If no agreement was reached and the result was an increase rather than a decrease m naval armaments by the three great naval Powers, there would be no prospect of any successful issue to the larger Disarmament Conference, affecting land and air armaments, which was to take place under the auspices of the League of Nations. He, therefore, strongly advocated that everything, compatible with national security, should be done to ensure a successful result from the present discussions at Geneva. Mr. churchill&apos;s prognosis of the course which events would take in America might prove to be correct, but he would deplore the existence of a situation in which we found ourselves&apos; building in competition with the U.S.A. It had not always been easy in the past to secure public support for the building of a fleet against France and Russia, nor, indeed, against Germany, but to persuade our people of the necessity to build against the U.S.A. would be very difficult indeed, and would make our relations with that country very delicate. Though a breakdown in the Conference might secure for the Republican Party the support of the &quot; big navy &quot; protagonists and serve the purposes of the steel&apos;and shipbuilding magnates in America, he wras doubtful whether a reaction of public opinion in America would thereby be aroused. If the American public could be persuaded, and, unfortunately, this would not be a difficult matter, that the refusal on the part of Great Britain to accept a tonnage limitation for cruisers had rendered an additional building programme necessary, he thought that the policy would be far too popular generally to result in any effective reaction of public opinion. He concluded, therefore, that everything should be done, compatible with safety, to secure the success of the present negotiations.Mr. CHURCHILL remarked that even supposing America adopted a building programme of 17 cruisers they could not put all these cruisers on the slips at once, and in the same period we should be able to lay down an additional 11 or 12.LORD SALISBURY suggested that to meet the present crisis it would suffice to urge the policy which was contained in Lord Balfour&apos;s draft which was before the Committee (C.I.D. Paper !sTo. 816-B).THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that Lord Balfour&apos;s draft should be sent to Mr. Bridgeman with instructions that he should make use of it when he considered the appropriate moment had arrived.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN agreed with this suggestion, but considered that two points were not sufficiently brought out in the draft, viz., that raised by Lord Birkenhead to the effect that a limitation of tonnage was useless unless combined with stipulations regarding the quality and life of individual ships; and, secondly,-that the American proposals were monstrous in that they involved an increase rather than a decrease of armaments. The Americans were alleging that the total of 600,000 tons for cruisers involved by the British proposals meant not a limitation but an extension of armaments. In point of fact it was the American proposals which involved an increase of armaments in that the British proposals affected only the smaller types of cruisers, which had no aggressive role, while the American proposals were likely to increase the larger and aggressive type, and to eliminate the smaller and purely defensive type. These points, he thought, were important in view of possible publication at a later date.LORD BEATTY stated that after reading Lord Balfour&apos;s draft telegram lie had drawn up a memorandum in which he had set out his views on the situation which had arisen at Geneva. This memorandum was not intended as an alternative to Lord Balfour &apos;s draft, but expressed the views which he considered it his duty, as First Sea Lord, to present to the Government through the Committee of Imperial Defence. The memorandum also put forward proposals as to the course of action which might now be taken, and as such might perhaps be utilised to supplement Lord Balfours draft.At the request of the Committee Lord Beatty read this memorandum, which ^asbeen circulated as C.I.D. Paper No. 818-B.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, while agreeing with Lord Beatty&apos;s memorandum, pointed out that it did not cover the point raised by Lord Birkenhead[16376-1] B 2
in that it did not expose the hollowness of a total tonnage limitation, if stipulations in regard to quality were excluded.LORD SALISBURY considered that the memorandum was a most important one for the purposes of the Committee of Imperial Defence, but, having regard to the nature of the present crisis and to the necessity of educating public opinion on the matter, technicalities were not required. For the immediate purpose he suggested that Lord Balfour&apos;s draft was the most appropriate.Mr. AMERY expressed the view that, while agreeing with Lord Beatty&apos;s memorandum as setting out the facts of the situation, what was wanted at the present moment was Lord Balfour&apos;s skilful argument as expounded in his draft. He suggested, however, that an addition might be made to this draft, pointing out that the 10,000-ton cruiser possessed powers of offence, while the smaller cruiser was designed purely for defensive purposes. Further, in the telegrams which had been circulated at the beginning of the meeting, it appeared that the Japanese had demanded a higher ratio than 5 to 3 in regard to auxiliary ships; in fact, they had mentioned in this connection a ratio of 5 to 3-5 or 5 to 4. He suggested that, whereas America might be inclined to build against us out of considerations of prestige, they were, in point of fact, afraid of Japan. If therefore a breakdown of the Conference was inevitable it would be better that this breakdown should occur as the result of a conflict between America and Japan on the subject of the ratio rather than that the Conference should end on a note of competition between America and ourselves. He pointed out as an objection to any policy of co-operation with Japan directed against America that our dealings with America could not be confined to the sea, that the Empire&apos;s longest and weakest frontier was co-terminous with the United States of America, and that hostility between us and the United States of America placed Canada in an almost impossible position. The only solution of the problem lay in temporising with the United States while by a policy of economic development of Empire resources we built up populations and wealth which would make it possible for us- to sustain the cost of such co-operation with them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the sense of the Committee was in favour of forwarding Lord Balfours.draft to Mr. Bridgeman. He pointed out, however, that Mr. Bridgeman had been informed that further instructions would be sent to him.   Lord Balfours draft contained no specific instructions.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN suggested that an additional telegram should be sent to Mr. Bridgeman explaining that in view of his latest telegrams the Government did not wish to send him any fresh instructions at the present stage.LORD BALFOUR suggested that attention should be drawn to the fundamental difference between small and large cruisers, which was as distinctive as that between capital ships and, say, cruisers. We should point out that while we were willing to limit the larger type of cruisers we insisted on maintaining our liberty of action in regard to the smaller.LORD BIRKENHEAD read out a draft of a telegram, pointing out the uselessness of a limitation by tonnage unaccompanied b)&apos; any stipulations in regard to quality. He also drew attention to the apparent ineffectiveness of our propaganda at Geneva, as compared with that of America.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN explained that Mr. Steward was attached to the Delegation at Geneva for Press purposes. If Mr. Steward was supplied with sufficient material he would be able to put forward the British point of view adequately to the Press.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that three telegrams should be sent to Mr. Bridgeman at Geneva : (a) An introduction to Lord Balfour&apos;s draft; (b) Lord Balfour&apos;s draft; and (c) the draft proposed by Lord Birkenhead. He suggested that the actual wording of these draft telegrams should be agreed between Lord Balfour, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead.Mr. CHURCHILL, adverting to the memorandum read by Lord Beatty (C.I.D. Paper No. 818-B) said that he had never been convinced of the necessity for 70 cruisers as advocated by the Admiralty. A building programme for the first few years only had been agreed to, but the total of 70 as the minimum required to meet Imperial needs had never been accepted.   In this connection, it was of no value
to compare present needs with pre-war figures. The cruisers of that period were small compared with those of the present day. Nor was it necessary to protect and patrol every one of our trade routes in the event of war. Those which required protection would depend on the circumstances of the conflict. He did not wish to open an argument on this question at the present time, but he wished to place on record that he yet had to be convinced that a minimum of 70 cruisers was necessary.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : (a.) To approve Lord Balfour&apos;s draft as revised at this meeting (C.I.D. Paper No. 816-B, Revise) as a statement of the British case.(&amp;.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should forward this draft by telegram to Mr. Bridgeman at Geneva with the following explanatory telegram : &quot; In view of your telegrams Nos. 157, 158 and 159, we do not desire to send you any fresh instructions at this stage, but my immediately following telegram gives a statement of the British case which you may use at the time and in the manner which you consider desirable for the purpose of making clear to America ana the world the strength and reasonableness of our position and the sincerity of our effort to promote further limitation of armaments.&quot; At present it would appear that the gross misrepresentations spread by the American correspondents at Geneva hold the field and that the restrictive effect of our proposals and extensive result of American plan are understood neither here nor elsewhere.&quot; See also my further telegram, No. 103.&quot; Cannot you make fuller use of Steward for getting our case better and more fully stated in the British, American and foreign press? &quot;(c.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send to Mr. Bridgeman the following additional telegram in regard to the adoption of aggregate tonnage as a basis for the limitation of cruisers : &quot; We observe from your telegrams Nos. 157 L.N. and 158 L. of N. (R) that the discussion hitherto has proceeded upon a basis of aggregate tonnage, e.g., 400,000 or 600,000 tons. It appears to us that such a dis-cussion is not helpful. How can we usefully argue the matter in terms of tonnage divorced from quality ? If, for instance, we were limited to, e.g., 450,000 tons, it would become necessary so to employ the limited allotted tonnage as to secure the maximum protection which our peculiar situation requires. This would or might involve a large scrapping of our smaller cruisers and a large measure of construction in more powerful vessels. Such a development, so far from producing any economy would involve us and the other countries concerned in greatly increased expenditure.&quot; It would further appear to be very important to insist constantly upon the vital distinction between the larger type of fighting cruisers and the smaller type which we require for the purpose of imperial communica-tion. This distinction is as vital as that between battleships and cruisers. In relation to the former class, we are prepared to assent to a basis of equality with the United States. In relation to the second and less important class, we cannot for the reasons we have given surrender our freedom of action, and we do not question the right of other countries to decide at their discretion upon their own requirements.&quot;******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 7, 1927.

Americans, who have consistently refused to discuss cruisers on basis of our own proposals, produced in Technical Committee this morning a written document which they evidently intend us, unless it is bluff, to regard as their last word. [Group omitted] in my immediately following telegram.&quot; In view of importance of result already obtained in respect of other classes of vessels, we can hardly believe Americans will face onus of breaking conference over cruiser issue in the teeth of our case as it can be stated.&quot; In view of position now reached, there is to be a private meeting of principal delegates followed by a meeting of Executive Committee, or of plenary conference, or both. In any case, I assume you will not wish me to depart materially from instructions approved by Cabinet. Broad line I should take would be to attack American demand for large number of 10,000-ton class and retention of 8-inch guns, and draw comparison with our own proposals which are designed to reduce and limit offensive capacity.&quot;[16372]
Decode of Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva), No. 153 L.N. ofJuly 5, 1927.MY immediately preceding telegram. ..Position of United States delegation is that we cannot discuss cruiser tonnages in excess of 400,000 tons for period ending 31st December, 1936.That during that period we would require full liberty of action to build 10,000-ton cruisers up to a total of 250,000 tons, recognising at the same time full rights of other Powers to build cruisers of similar characteristics up to tonnages in accordance with principles of Washington Treaty.That we have no intention or desire to replace ten cruisers of &quot; Omaha &quot; class, carrying 6-inch guns, during that period except in the case of loss of one or more of those units.That, in an effort to meet British view-point regarding a limitation in number of large cruisers, we are willing for this period and without prejudice to future action to limit our further construction within a total tonnage limitation of 400,000 to vessels of a smaller tonnage to be agreed upon.We do not see any reason for limiting calibre of guns in smaller class of cruisers to anything different from that in larger class.We believe that each Power should have full liberty in design and armament of a smaller class of cruisers should such a class be adopted for the period in question.This statement of American policy should be construed as our maximum effort to meet British view point.We greatly prefer that within a total tonnage limitation and within characteristics of cruisers provided for in the Washington Treaty each Power enjoy full liberty of action.We invite attention to the fact that our original proposal was for a total tonnage limitation in cruiser class of between 250,000 and 300,000 tons. We still ardently desire that total tonnage limitation of cruisers to be agreed upon shall be very much lower than 400,000, as we believe that an agreement on such a figure would be an extremely useful service to the cause of limitation. If it is found possible to agree upon a figure materially lower than 400,000 tons, American requirements regarding cruisers of larger class could be revised downwards.Any limitation on basis of a cruiser tonnage in excess of 400,000 tons we regard as so ineffective a limitation as not to justify the conclusion of a treaty at this time.

Copy No.    59815-BCOMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 814-B.)CRUISERS.Note by the Secretary on the Proceedings at Washington.1. IN view of the discussions at Geneva on the subject of Cruisers, it has been thought worth while to examine the records of the Washington Conference on the matter. The discussions at the Conference itself throw little light on the question, but the proceedings of the British Empire Delegation and the telegrams sent by Lord Balfour on their behalf to the Government at home show how consistent our attitude was.2. The original instructions drawn up by the Committee of Imperial Defence and approved by the Cabinet for Mr. Balfour and his colleagues contain no specific reference to the question of Cruisers (C.I.D. Paper No. 280-B).3. Mr. Hughes&apos;s proposals at the Washington Conference were announced on the 12th November, 1921. Cruisers, Flotilla Leaders and Destroyers were dealt with in those proposals together, an allowance of 450,000 tons (i.e., a proportion of 5-5-3) being proposed both for the United States and for Great Britain, with 270,000 for Japan. On the following day, the 13th November, the Admiralty Section circulated to the British Empire Delegation a Memorandum, the following passages of which bear on the question of Cruisers : &quot; It is certain that the British Delegation will have the sympathy of the conference when they state that to no nation is the safety of its sea communica-tions to any extent comparable with the safety of its sea communications to the British Empire.One portion alone, viz., the United Kingdom, is so dependent on the free use of the seas that starvation would follow six weeks&apos; deprivation of the sea routes to its ports.It is difficult for a great self-contained country like the United States, independent for any of its vital necessities upon outside resources, to realise the absolute dependence of an island empire upon the safety of its sea communica-tions; living as we do by the sea and on the sea, the safety of the sea is an integral necessity of the common safety of all our scattered territories. The foregoing consideration must be borne in mind in regard to the few remarks I propose to make upon the less important portions of the United States proposals which refer to auxiliary combatant craft.&quot;$fe &quot;h* *x* *h* *x*&quot; In order, however, to afford reasonable safety to the extensive sea communications of the British Empire in all portions of the globe, a number of cruisers and auxiliary merchant cruisers are essential, over and above the proportion agreed upon for use with the fleet.The adequate protection of these sea routes necessitates a dispersion of force out of all proportion to the numbers which can be concentrated to attack these routes, and it must be realised that the provision of these ships is&apos; a purely [16371]
defensive requirement, involving no hint of offence such as is conveyed by the battle fleet and its satellites, but merely representing a national insurance of vital interests.These numbers are not considered to be essential to any international scheme for the reduction in armaments, which must be based mainly on the relative strength in capital ships, which by universal agreement form the basis of sea power at the present time, and therefore the measure of a nation&apos;s power of aggression.&quot;(B.E.D. 4&amp;th Conference, Appendix I.)4. This Memorandum was discussed at a meeting of the British Empire Delegation on the same day, as the result of which a telegram was approved for Lord Balfour to telegraph to the Prime Minister, which contained the following passage : &apos;&apos; As regards cruisers and other auxiliary vessels, Lord Beatty accepts proportion in paragraph 14, so far as concerns those classes of auxiliary vessel which are complementary to the battle fleet, but he insists that, over and above these, British Empire requires other cruisers for protection of communications.&quot;5. On the 15th November the Second Plenary Session of the Washington Conference was held. Lord Balfour did not allude directly to the question of cruisers, but the following remarks provided a warning as to what our attitude was likely to be on the subject: &apos;&apos; Now, 1 said I would explain, if I was allowed, why I venture to rise first to-day to deal with the subject which is in all our hearts. As I have hinted, it is because the British Empire and Great Britain, the two together, are more profoundly concerned with all that touches matters naval than it is possible for any other nation to be, and this not, believe me, for any reasons of ambition, not for any reasons drawn from history or tradition, but from the hard, brutal necessities of plain and obvious facts.There never has been in the history of the world a great Empire constituted as the British Empire is. It is a fact no doubt familiar to everybody whom I am addressing at the present moment, but has everybody whom I am addressing imaginatively conceived precisely what the situation of the British Empire is in this connection ?Most of my audience are citizens of the United States. The United States stands solid, impregnable, self-sufficient, all its lines of communication protected, doubly protected, completely protected, from any conceivable hostile attack.It is not merely that you are 110 million population; it is not merely that you are the wealthiest country in the world; it is that the whole configuration of your country, the geographical position of your country, is such that you are wholly immune from the particular perils to which, from the nature of the case, the British Empire is subject.Supposing, for example, that your western States, for whose safety you are responsible, were suddenly removed 10,000 miles across the sea. Supposing that you found that the very heart of your Empire, the very heart of this great State, was a small and crowded island depending upon oversea trade not merely, but chiefly, for its luxuries, but depending upon oversea communication for the raw material of those manufactures by which its superabundant population lives; depending upon the same oversea communication for the food upon which they subsist. Supposing it was a familiar thought in your minds that there never was at any moment of the year within the limits of your State more than seven weeks&apos; food for the population, and that that food had to be replenished by oversea communication. Then, if you will draw that picture, and if you will see all that it implies and all that it carries with it, you will understand why it is that every citizen of the British Empire, whether he be drawn from the far Dominions of the Pacific or whether he lives in the small island in the North Sea, never can forget that it is by sea communication that he lives, and that without sea communication he and the Empire to which he belongs would perish, i Now, ladies and gentlemen, do not suppose that I am uttering lamentsover the weakness of my country. Par from it. We are strong, I hope, in the vigorous life of its constituent parts.   We are strong, I hope, in the ardent
patriotism which, binds us all together. But this strategic weakness is obvious to everybody who reflects; it is present in the minds of our enemies, if we have enemies.  Do not let it be forgotten by our friends.These reflections, with your kindness, I have indulged in in order to explain why it is that I am addressing you at the present time.&quot;6. The same afternoon (the 15th November) the subject of the protection of Imperial communications again came up at the British Empire Delegation, and is recor ded in the Minutes in the following terms : &quot; Vessels for Protection of Imperial Communications.&apos;&apos; The first question raised was as to cruisers and auxiliary vessels over and above the ships required as complementary to the battle fleet.Senator Pearce raised in particular the bearing of this question on the position of the Australian fleet.Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty explained that the Naval Staff had carefully considered the essential need of stationing cruisers and auxiliary vessels abroad for protection of Imperial communications, and that these must be over and above the numbers required for the service of the main fleet. It was most important, therefore, to insist on a &apos; ration&apos; of auxiliary vessels over and above those required for the main fleets. Otherwise, if cruisers were confined to the numbers required for a battle fleet, we should be at a disadvantage with other navies. The United States fleet, for example, would be able to keep its fleet concentrated, all its auxiliaries being constantly with the battle fleet, which would be continuously trained as a single unit, whereas a large proportion of our auxiliaries would be scattered over the world.The above views met with general acceptance by the British Empire Delegation.&quot;(B.E.D. 49th Conference, page 2.)7. The last occasion on which the subject was mentioned was at the British Empire Delegation on the 28th November, when the discussion is summarised in the Minutes as follows : ;&apos;Lord Lee also pointed out that the question of cruisers could not be ignored, and proposed the limitation of size to 10,000 tons; also that the same ratio, 5-5-3, should apply to cruisers as for the Battle Fleet, with a full allowance over and above this for the British Empire trade routes.Mr. Balfour suggested that the cruiser question should be approached not as if they were based on the British Islands alone, but also on the Dominions, and that the additional allowance claimed should take into account the countries that make up. the British Empire, and the character of the fleets that each would have been likely to keep up separately.This was agreed to.&quot;(B.E.D. 55th Conference, page 2.)8. As the result of this meeting, a telegram was sent by Lord Balfour to Lord Curzon the same day, which&quot; contained the following passage : &quot; Cruisers. We intend, as regards cruisers, to suggest a maximum tonnage of 10,000 tons per ship, and we are ready to agree to Great Britain, the United States and Japan having a ratio of 5-5-3 as regards the cruisers required for fleet purposes, provided the British claim is accepted that we require a considerable number above this ratio for defending the commerce of the British Empire. The grand total of cruisers for fleet purposes and for other purposes was put by Earl Beatty tentatively at fifty, a number which is less than we have now, but it is not intended at the present stage to give this number.&apos;;&apos;.    (B.E.D. 55th Conference, Appendix I.)9. In the end, the subject of the numbers of Cruisers never became a matter of controversy at the Washington Conference; the discussion was confined to their size and armament, and each nation was left to build as many as it required.
10. From the above summary it will be seen that the attitude of the Admiralty on this question, which was always looming in the background of the discussions at Washington, was throughout consistent. As regards Fleet Cruisers, they were willing to agree to the 5-5-3 ratio, but they always insisted on the necessity for an additional number for the protection of our Imperial communications.;&quot; Their attitude was throughout endorsed, and, indeed, insisted on, by the British Empire Delegation.(Signed)        M.

(Revise.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper 815-B.)Further Limitation of Naval Armaments. Code Telegram to British Delegation at Geneva, No. 102, of July 7, 1927.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain has always sympathised with President Coolidge&apos;s desire to carry yet further the work of naval disarmament which was begun at Washington in 1921-22 with such happy results. The Geneva Confer-ence was therefore begun under fortunate auspices, and has, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are able to judge, been doing much valuable work. But they note with regret that in certain quarters their policy has been misunderstood, and in consequence somewhat misrepresented.The essential principle accepted at the Washington Conference referred only to Capital Ships and aircraft carriers; and with regard to these it was agreed between the three leading Naval Powers that they would accept for a period of at least ten years certain limitations as to numbers, armament, tonnage and replacement.If the Washington policy is now to be extended it can only be in one or both of two ways. The cost of Capital Ships may be still further reduced, and limitations may be devised in respect of vessels other than capital ships vessels about which the Treaty of Washington is silent. On both these possible lines of advance our delegation is prepared to lay suggestions before the Conference.In regard to the first of them, however, we desire to say nothing at the present moment. In deference to what we understand to be. the desire of the Conference, we reserve our proposals until a later stage. We do not think that they are likely to occasion any serious difficulty, but it is clear that it is under this head that the most important economies may be anticipated.The questions raised by any proposal to limit the number of Cruisers are of a more complex character. The suggestions of His Majesty&apos;s Government are, broadly, as follows. We propose to divide Cruisers into two classes the heavy and the light; and to adopt for the heavy class the same principles as those adopted at Washington in the case of Capital Ships. We think&apos;, in other words, that their size and armament might with advantage be limited, and that the numbers permitted to each of the Treaty Powers should be in the Washington ratio.This seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be a reasonable application of an accepted- principle to the case of heavy Cruisers. But when we turn from heavy Cruisers to light, wholly different conditions must be taken into account.It is, of course, true that a Fleet of a given size requires auxiliary vessels of a given number, whatever.be the position of the country to which the Fleet belongs, or the seas in which it is required to operate. On this point there need be no dispute. But in addition to these auxiliary vessels Cruisers are required by all maritime countries to perform duties quite unconnected with organised Fleets, and by no country so much as by the British Empire. This special position is, of course, due to a geographical sub-division which has no parallel in history. In times of peace small difficulties and disorders, wholly without international significance, which in States differently situated would be dealt with by the police or frontier guard, may often make it necessary to send a Cruiser. In times of war the insular position of [16381]
Great Britain and the seas which divide it from its Colonies and from the self-governing communities with which it is associated within the Empire present even greater difficulties difficulties not always present to the imagination of those who live and think in terms appropriate to great continents. During the Washington Conference this point was dealt with by Lord Balfour in words which it may be worth while to recall: &quot; Most of my audience (he said) are citizens of the United States. The United States stands solid, impregnable, self-sufficient, all its essential lines of communication completely protected from any conceivable hostile attack.&quot; It is not merely that you are 110 million population; it is not merely that you are the wealthiest country in the world; it is that the configuration of your country is such that you are wholly immune from the particular perils to which, from the nature of the case, the British Empire is subject.&quot;Suppose, for example, that your western States were suddenly removed 10,000 miles across the sea. Suppose that the very heart of your Empire was a small and crowded island depending upon oversea trade not merely for its luxuries but for the raw material of those manufactures by which its super-abundant population lives, and for the food upon which they subsist. Suppose it was a familiar thought that there was never a moment of the year when within the limits of your State there was more than seven weeks&apos; food for its popula-tion, and that that food could only be replenished by oversea communication. If you will draw this picture, and if you will realise all that it implies, you will understand why it is that no citizen of the British Empire, whether he be drawn from the far Dominions of the Pacific or lives in a small island in the North Sea, can ever forget that it is by sea communication that he lives, and that without sea communication he and the Empire to which he belongs would perish together.&quot;How can an Empire thus situated voluntarily surrender its right to live? How can it abandon by formal treaty the possibility of co-operation in mutual defence between communities which own a common allegiance, though divided from each other by all the oceans ?These are considerations which may surely appeal to all. Yet it has been stated that the objection felt to any surrender of the liberties willingly conceded to the British Empire by the Washington Conference is due not to the inevitable necessities of self-defence, but to an arrogant desire for maritime superiority. Great Britain, it has been said, refuses &quot; parity &quot; to the United States. The statement has already been formally contradicted. It is wholly without foundation. What are the facts ? The President of the United States has invited us to take part in a Conference, summoned to diminish the burden of naval armaments. We have gladly responded to the call. We accept the principle announced by Mr. Gibson (who presides over the Conference) the principle &quot;that Navies should be maintained at the lowest level compatible with national security.&quot; We do not dispute the right of the American Government to build Cruisers in numbers sufficient to secure this object. We cannot surrender a similar right for ourselves. It is our manifest interest to build no more than we must; it is no less our duty and our intention to promote the world&apos;s desire for a diminution of armaments. We do not for a moment suppose that the United States, which has summoned the Conference to further this great ideal, will ever be influenced in their naval policy by any motive but the desire for national security or that in their estimate of the naval requirements of different States geographical considerations will be ignored.

Copy No.    53818-B.COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 817-B.)CRUISERS.Memorandum by Lord Beatty, communicated verbally to the Committee of Imperial Defence at its 228th Meeting held on July 7, 1927.THE British proposals for limitation of armaments as&apos;regards cruisers consisted of proposals regarding the tonnage, armament and life of individual ships and a ratio for 10,000-ton cruisers, but made no mention of a total tonnage or total numbers.The proposals of the United States of America on the other hand, proposed a limitation of total tonnage on a 5-5-3 ratio for Great Britain, United States of America and Japan respectively. The Chief American Delegate in his opening speech laid down the principle that the respective navies should be maintained at the lowest level compatible with national security, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully in agreement with this.The British Delegation in conformity with the above have stated the minimum requirements of the British Empire.These requirements are based on the numbers of cruisers required for (a.) Work with the main Fleet.(b.) Protection of the vital communications of the Empire.The number of cruisers required for work with the main Fleet is governed by the number of capital ships.  For every 3 battleships, 5 cruisers are required.As the 10,000-ton cruisers now being built in accordance with the provisions of the Washington Agreement are considered especially suitable for work with the main Fleet, it has been proposed that these cruisers should be on the 5-5-3 ratio.In the matter of trade route protection, the British Empire stands in a situation which differs entirely from that of the other Powers. The fact that Great Britain itself can be reduced to starvation, and its industries brought to a standstill for lack of raw material, by the closing of the trade routes for a few weeks, renders it essential to make provision for their protection.The defence of the Empire itself and of its component parts depends upon the safety of these lines of communication. They are a matter of life and death to us, and, however many cruisers we possess, the task is prodigious.Immediately on conclusion of the Great War and with its experience fresh in our minds, an intensive study was made of the minimum requirements in cruisers for the security of the Empire.These investigations showed that the minimum number of cruisers required by the British Empire for its security, taking into account the estimated building programme of Foreign Powers, was 70.The need for economy caused this number to be challenged by the Government of the clay in 1925, but its need was fully substantiated by the Admiralty.It will thus be seen that the figure which has been placed before the Conference is not one which has been hastily arrived at for the purpose of the Conference, but is [16382]
one which has formed the approved policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the last two years.When it is remembered that, apart from the cruisers attached to the Grand Fleet during the Great War, the number of cruisers and old battleships functioning as cruisers employed on protecting the trade and communications of the Empire was never less than 62, and finally reached between 80 and 90 and was even then found to be inadequate, it will be apparent to all that in placing our requirements for protecting the trade routes at only 45, the margin of security has been reduced to vanishing point. It must also be remembered that in addition to the vessels just mentioned, there were a considerable number of Allied cruisers assisting in the protection of our communications.It has been suggested that no nation can expect to maintain in peace time the number of cruisers required in war time, and that the arming of merchantmen will make up for any lack of cruisers.  These are fallacies.Un) ess the British Empire has sufficient cruisers to maintain its vital communi-cations on the outbreak of war, Great Britain will be reduced to starvation and the communications with the outlying parts of the Empire will be severed almost before the building of new cruisers could commence. Armed merchant cruisers offering as they do a large target, with no protection to their vitals, are quite incapable of fighting cruisers successfully.The role of armed merchant cruisers is to protect trade against their own kind, not to engage even the smallest cruisers.What happened during the Great War when armed merchant cruisers found themselves opposed to cruisers fully bears out the above statement. At the Battle of Coronel, Admiral Craddock, before engaging the German Squadron, ordered the &quot; Otranto,&quot; the only armed merchant cruiser in company with him, to quit the. line and escape.When the &quot; Highflyer &quot; engaged the &quot; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse &quot; off the West Coast of Africa on the 26th August, 1914, the &quot; Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.&quot; was destroyed whilst &quot; Highflyer &quot; suffered no damage.The Governments of the British Empire subscribe whole-heartedly to the principle enunciated by the United States Government that navies should be maintained at the lowest level compatible with national security, and thus have been able to place before the Conference the detailed reasons and calculations on which our requirements of cruisers are based.The figure of 300,000 tons suggested by the United States as a maximum cruiser tonnage for the British Empire has no doubt, as regards the requirements of the United States, been worked out with equal care, and, it is presumed, covers the requirements of the United States as regards security.The total tonnages for cruisers put forward by the British and American Delegations may, therefore, be taken as accurately reflecting the needs of their respective countries for security.These figures are so divergent that there only appear two possible courses : (a.) For each country to be allowed the tonnage which it has put forward as necessary for its security; or (&amp;.) To drop any idea of a total tonnage limit and leave each nation free tobuild according1 to its requirements.The United States are unlikely to agree to (a), as it is quite obvious that, though their requirements, as put forward in the opening statement of their Chief Delegate, were presumably based on what the United States of America required for security, they have since based their proposals on political considerations and prestige.Alternative (b), therefore, appears the only possible one. Even if no maximum tonnage is agree to, there is no reason why the British proposals *(a) to limit the number of 8-inch cruisers on a 5-5-3 ratio;(b) to limit the size and guns of all other cruisersshould not be given effect to.The only way out of the present impasse appears to be: (a.) For Mr. Bridgeman to inform the American Delegation that their proposals are unacceptable, as they do not give us that security which is essential.(&amp;.) That we should not make any counter-proposals, as in the present temper of the United States there are obviously none which, whilst ensuring our security, would be acceptable to the United States of America.
Admiralty, July 7, 1927.(o.) To inform the United States of America that unless they have any further proposal to make, it is considered best that all idea of arriving at a limitation of total tonnage or total number of cruisers should be dropped, but that a further attempt at achieving economy should be made  ,(i) by pressing further the acceptance of a limitation of the 10,000-toncruisers to a 5-5-3 ratio; (ii) by limiting the size of individual ships and of their guns for cruisersother than 10,000-ton type; (iii) by increasing lives of ships.

Paper No. 81S-B.)Further Limitation of Naval Armaments.Copies of Telegrams from the British Delegation at Geneva.I.Decypher of Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul, Geneva, No. 157 L.N.,dated July 6, 1927.(Immediate.)FOLLOWING from First Lord of the Admiralty to Prime Minister and Cabinet: &quot;At informal meeting this evening of principal delegates of the three Powers, Viscount Ishii handed round a memorandum. Text in my immediately following telegram.&quot;Viscount Ishii explained that Japanese delegation were set on obtaining a substantial reduction in surface auxiliary craft. Although he did not wish to talk in ratios, the figure of 400,000 tons or thereabouts for British Empire and United States in respect to cruisers only would mean considerable increase in Japanese construction when translated into Japanese quota on the basis of a ratio of 5 to 3-5 or 5 to 4. The increase, indeed, would be such that Japanese would have to retire from the discussion rather than accept it. He had therefore proposed the plan outlined in the memorandum, namely, that minimum figures for cruisers and destroyers suggested in original American proposals should be combined to form one surface auxiliary class and adopted as basis of discussion. He wished to put this proposal formally at the meeting of Executive Committee on Friday. In reply to question from me, Viscount Ishii admitted that it would make all the difference if Americans would be content with ten or twelve cruisers of 10,000 tons type instead of twenty-five, which is the figure they are at present talking of.   Americans let this pass without voicing objection.&quot; While we were of course unable to resist the Japanese intention to discuss their plan in Executive Committee, my colleagues and I pointed out that its result would be to put British Empire in a still more impossible position. American delegates, evidently by way of extending the olive branch after what had passed at our private meeting with them this morning, intimated their willingness to explore further a plan tentatively examined some days ago but subsequently abandoned, namely, that limitation be effected by actually incor-porating in the treaty cruiser building programmes of the three Powers up to 1936, the earliest possible date of expiry of proposed treaty, if made co-determinable with Washington Treaty, which has always been American ideal. We supported American suggestion, and it was eventually agreed that, while Japanese would bring up their proposal on Friday, the intervening time should be spent by experts in endeavouring to find some adaptation of the above-mentioned plan which might result in bringing all three of us closer together.[16378] .........       ...........................-........Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1927. t----
Since examining Japanese memorandum, we have come to the conclusion that the figure of 400,000 which we understand them to have adopted as repre-senting what they had calculated to be our status quo, i.e., ships built [ ? omitted : and] building but not those projected, must have been based on miscalculation which we are taking steps to correct.&quot;(Addressed to Foreign Office No. 157, Gth July; repeated to Washington and Tokyo.)II.Decode of Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Consul, Geneva, No. 158 L.N.,dated July 6, 1927.(Immediate.)&quot;IT will be remembered that in statement made by Japanese delegation at the first plenary meeting emphasis was laid upon existing status which they proposed should form basis of any allocation of tonnage that might be decided upon at present conference.&quot;According to basis of calculation as submitted by Japanese delegation, surface auxiliaries strength of British Empire would be 472,000 tons.&quot; Tonnage allocation suggested by American delegation in regard to surface auxiliary vessels is from 450,000 to 550,000 tons for United States and British Empire, subject to intimation that United States would welcome any proposal for still lower tonnage levels.&quot;Limitation being our main object, it would seem to Japanese delegation that adoption in principle, of minimum figure proposed by United States delegation as a basis of our discussion would be a course most conducive to a speedy consummation of task before the conference.&quot;If, consequently, we may take figure of 450,000 tons for United States and British Empire as a basis, Japanese delegation would propose for tonnage of surface auxiliary vessels to be allotted to Japan a figure of something above 300,000 tons, it being understood that they are quite prepared at the same time to accept reduced figures in concert with other delegations.&quot; In addition to this, Japanese delegation desire now to propose a figure of a round 70,000 tons of [s^c] Japan in respect of submarines.&quot;(Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 158.   Repeated to Washington and Tokyo.)III.Decypher of Telegram from Mr. London, Geneva, No. 159 L.N.,dated July 7, 1927.&quot;(Immediate.)FOLLOWING from First Lord of the Admiralty for Prime Minister only :-&quot; Your telegram No. 99.&quot; Please rest assured that I should in no circumstances have taken any formal decision involving either rupture of negotiations or departure from existing instructions until Government had reviewed situation. Position, though inconvenient, has not yet fully developed, and is therefore not yet critical. In face of our straight talk this morning as a result of American action yesterday in Technical Committee, Gibsoifs whole attitude showed that he was still desirous of agreement. You will see from my telegrams that further expedients are to be explored, though it must be admitted that our position has been rendered rather more difficult by line taken by Japanese this afternoon (see my telegram No. 157), though it is not yet clear that they will adhere rigidly to their figures if Americans agree to a substantial reduction in numbers of 10,000-ton type.&quot; Please note that although we have been trying ever since we arrived to elicit an expression of Japanese opinion, we have always been put off until to-day with reply that they were not yet in a position to make any declaration.&quot;
