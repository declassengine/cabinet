[This Document is the Property of His, Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1927.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 163 (27).CABINET.RACECOURSE CONDITIONS AND THE BETTING DUTY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.MY colleagues may be interested to see the attached notes by the Customs and Excise in regard to racecourse conditions. It will be seen that, apart from the impoverishment due to the coal stoppage and the alleged effects of the Betting Duty, there are factors within the control of racecourse proprietors themselves which make for the reduction of attendances.W. S. treasury Chambers, May 23, 1927.Notes by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.A Visit to Hurst Park.A FINE afternoon and the attraction of the Victoria Cup drew a considerable London crowd to Hurst Park on Saturday, the 30th April. Two matters were self-evident, viz. (a) the lack of accommodation or reasonable comfort for spectators, (6) that there was no difficulty with the Betting Duty and very little mention of it.2. On the first point, the price paid for admission to Tattersalfs Ring was  1 2s. 6d. This in addition to railway fare from town (there were seventeen people in a first-class compartment), a vehicle to the course, return expenses and incidentals brought up the cost of the afternoon&apos;s entertainment to  2 or thereabouts. It is not unreasonable to suppose that for that sum, the average person could do very well at the opera, or go in comfort to several theatres or see a number of boxing, football, or cricket matches, or have two good days golf. But the arrangements in Tattersalfs Ring at Hurst Park were primitive to a degree and deplorable in their lack of consideration for spectators.3. . The payment of  1 2s. 6c?. for admission to TattersaiTs Ring enabled one to see the horses in the paddock before each race. But the Ring itself was made up of a Sahara of asphalt occupied by a howling mob of bookmakers and their clerks packed cheek by jowl with burly runners dashing here and there regardless of consequences to themselves and to others. There were far too many of these toughs pushing and jostling the unfortunate spectator, who was compelled to shove as in a rugby scrum in order to obtain breathing space in the narrow strip of grass between the asphalt and the rails which made an apology for a lawn. Behind the asphalt was a series of concrete steps from which one could view the start of some races, but not of others. There was not a seat in the place. Very few women were present and for obvious reasons there was not a child to be seen. The creature comforts were represented by two bars behind Tattersalls Ring at which there was drink and some venerable sandwiches. Two women in charge of one bar pushed out a Bass with no attempt either to decant it or to find a clean glass from which to drink it the rule seemed to be either to drink from the bottle or to seize another person&apos;s glass as soon as he had finished with it. The other bar was longer, but what it gained in length it lacked in staff, for only one over-worked woman was in charge of it. A glance into the Silver Ring showed worse conditions and more packed crowding. Contrariwise there appeared to be an approach to reasonable conditions in the members&apos; enclosure, but an admission fee of  1 2s. Qd. did not admit one there. It is indeed astonishing [16190]
that anybody attends a racecourse at all, except in the members&apos; enclosure, if Hurst Park is a fair specimen of horse-racing as an entertainment.4. There was no trouble with the Betting Duty. The general rule was for bookmakers to deduct Qd. in the   from winnings, and there was no complaint from backers they all paid up cheerfully when they were asked to do so. A backer drawing  5 in winnings would be asked for 2s. 6d. and would pay without demur. Some were not required to pay duty. A bookmaker and his clerk were betting on totalisator principles with the aid of a board and Betting Duty tickets and it was observed that they paid better odds than the bookmakers sometimes double the odds.5. The suggestion that the Betting Duty is keeping people away from race-courses is untenable the tax is so small that backers do not feel it. This opinion was confirmed by a conversation which took place between three members of the racing fraternity, including two bookmakers, in the train returning to London, to the effect that the opposition to the duty was confined to a few agitators, that the bookmakers had fouled their own nest by not dealing fairly with the tax and had only themselves to blame if numbers of them were crowded out by the totalisator which was pretty certain to come.6. The experience at Hurst Park may be contrasted with a French race-meeting. The charge for admission to the Pesage, which corresponds to Tattersalls Ring is 40 francs (say 6s. Qd. at 120 francs to the pound). There is a reduced fee of 30 francs (say 5s.) for ladies. For these very reasonable figures the visitor has access to all parts of the stands (save those which are specially reserved), to the lawns in front of the stands, to the saddling enclosure and to the extensive lawns behind the stands. Many people who go to the races as to a spectacle remain in their places in the stand during the whole afternoon; they can see the fashion parade on the lawns in front of them and can follow the incidents of every race more or less from start to finish. For those who can secure them there are chairs on the front lawn.7. The pari-mutuel booths are at the rear or side of the stands or in the enclosed snace under the stands built in the angle which the steps form with the ground. Incredible as it may seem to persons acquainted only with English race-courses, children are able to play on the front lawns even on days of large attendances, e.g., on Saturdays and Sundajrs.8. Behind the stands there are extensive lawns and grounds. There people go between races to see the horses in the paddock and to stroll or sit about. There is ample time between races for a backer to leave the stands, collect his winnings (if any), see the horses, note the progress of the betting, make his wager on the following race and get back in time to see the race. There is none of the disreputable element apparently inevitable in connection with bookmakers, and there is no raucous shouting.9. There are very large refreshment bars and tea rooms where drinks of all kinds, light meals or afternoon tea can be obtained during or after racing in conditions which approximate to ordinary first-class restaurant conditions. In such circumstances racing becomes an attractive entertainment and spectacle which there is some inducement for a man, his wife and children to attend quite independently of the betting question, but observation tends to show that most people make some bets. Bets of 10 francs may be made (say, Is. 6d.), whereas bookmakers in Tattersalls will accept 10s. bets but are apt to look askance at bets of 5s.10. Racing in France is regarded as a comparatively cheap and a most enjoyable recreation. A large proportion of the spectators are ladies, and there are many family parties. Similar conditions to those described above, but with less luxurious surroundings, prevail in the &quot;pavilion&quot; or 15-franc ring, not only at Longchamps and Auteuil, but also at the smaller courses like St. Cloud, Le Tremblay, Chantilly, &amp;c.
Attendances at Point-to-Point Meetings.1. Some idea of the increasing popularity of Point-to-Point Steeplechases may be gained by reference to the following descriptions of meetings given in the reports published in the issue of &quot; Horse and Hound,&quot; dated the 7th May, 1927 : A RecordNnme of Hunt.Cleveland       ......Craven ......East Devon    ......Essex Farmers...South Herefordshire and RossHertfordshire ......East Kent      ......North and South Shropshire...

Ashridge, Wokingham, Berks.Holderness     ...      ...      ...   Houghton, Yorks.Lunesdale       ......      ...   Bainsbank, Westmoreland.Mr. Spooner&apos;s Harriers      ...   Tavistock, Devon. Vine    ...      ...      ...      ...   Kingsclere, Hants.High Peak Harriers  (about   Flagg Moor, Buxton, Derbyshire. 15,000 people)Braes of Derwent (4,000 to   Grey Mare Hill, Shotley Bridge, Durham 5,000 spectators)2. It will be seen that the majority of these meetings are held in remote districts, almost inaccessible prior to the advent of the motor car, and for patronage they must rely to a great extent upon residents in the locality. Special railway facilities are seldom granted, and in some cases no charabancs are allowed on, or near, the course. There may be a refreshment tent, but otherwise accommodation is of the most primitive description, and the whole gathering partakes of the nature of a gigantic and enjoyable picnic. The spectators can witness the racing without having to endure the discomfort unfortunately inseparable from the ordinary race meeting, and as the attendance is mainly composed of the upper and middle classes, whereas the riff-raff who constitute a considerable proportion of the average racecourse crowd are seldom in evidence, it is possible - for a man to enjoy an afternoon&apos;s sport in the company of his womenkind and children.3. It is not so long ago since the average attendance at Point-to-Point meetings numbered a few hundreds, mainly hunting people and farmers, with a sprinkling of &quot;county&quot; society, but the growing interest in outdoor sport, notably amongst women, and the ever-increasing ease of transport have all helped to make the local Point-to-Point the event of the spring. In the old days one or two bookmakers would be present, offering ridiculously short odds and not above disappearing should occasion arise, but to-day there will frequently be as many as twenty licensed bookmakers in operation at a meeting, and while prices are undoubtedly better, welshing is practically unknown. Spectators are now numbered in their thousands instead of hundreds. Fifteen thousand were present on Easter Tuesday at the High Peak Harriers&apos; meeting to witness five races, figures that would read well if they referred to a meeting under National Hunt rules at Sandown Park. Four or five thousand at the Braes of Derwent meeting on the 14th April, which was revived after a lapse of many years, while at many other meetings, as has been shown above, the attendances constituted a record.
4. The sudden and remarkable increase this season of attendances at these meetings provokes a comparison with the falling off in the numbers of those present at other race meetings. The promoters of Point-to-Point meetings have managed successfully to cope with the alleged effects of the betting duty and the undoubted reduction in spending power due to last year&apos;s industrial dislocation. Certainly it cannot be claimed that the thousands who now attend these meetings up and down the country are drawn exclusively from the ranks of the few who are fortunate enough to have been left untouched by the wave of general industrial depression by which almost the entire population was engulfed during the past year. Why then the very different results? *5. The explanation appears to lie in the fact that any ordinary race-goer (in which category are not included those who are fortunate enough to be entitled to make use of the Members&apos; enclosure) must perforce leave his wife and family and other women folk at home whenever he goes off for an afternoon&apos;s racing. This he need not do when he goes to a Point-to-Point meeting, which seems to supply the real reason for the increasing popularity of these gatherings.6. Their success all goes to show that there is a very large public of the better class available in all parts of the country where racing is the attraction, and would seem to suggest that the executives behind the small one-day race meetings, for example, Bungay, Tarporley, Torquay, &amp;c, need have no fear that the possible advent of the totalisator will necessarily result in their abandonment as has been suggested in the sporting papers.7. All they need do to ensure a successful meeting (given fair weather) is to provide tolerable accommodation at a reasonable price, and cater for the patronage of the better class public by the strict elimination of the undesirable elements of which the average racecourse crowd is unfortunately largely composed at the present time. This may be difficult but should not be impossible. A race meeting will never be quite the same as a Sunday school picnic, but that is no reason why bad language should be tolerated in the enclosures nor why bookmakers and their runners and hangers-on should be allowed to monopolize the best positions, nor why refreshment, both liquid and solid, should not be obtainable in palatable form at a reasonable figure.8. Given decent conditions, a decent crowd will result. Make the racecourse attractive and larger attendances will be attracted.u
