. 21THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.Copy Ho cabinet.LONDON SQUARES. Memorandum by the Minister of Health.There is a strong demand for preserving the London Squares against building.     Some Squares have recently been appropriated for this purpose, despite efforts made to save them,      A Bill on the subject has been Introduced by a Labour Member, and Is backed by Conservative and Liberal London Members?    the Bill is at present blocked by the Government. The London County Council has recently- passed a resolution calling for an Inquiry into the subject.I think that it Is wise to accede to this request. If some action is not taken, the Government stand to be accused of neglecting the interests of London, and the danger of the appropriation of more of the Squares for building is a real one.- Some investigations which have been made for me by the Valuation Department indicate that many of the Squares - -could be Safeguarded   against building at small cost, but that for a number of them a very large outlay might have to be incurred if the owners insisted on their full property rights. To safeguard the Squares irrespective of the wishes of the. owners might obviously lead to the cry of the confiscation of private property.I had hoped that it would have been practicable to conduct the Inquiry by means of a Departmental Committee.     But the London County Council say that they have found serious difficulty in ascertaining the facts as to the rights of various persons In the Squares and press that the body making theCP. 156 (27) SECRET.
........     NInquiry should be empowered to compel the production of evidence.I propose, therefore, that a Royal Commission should be appointed; the subject is of sufficient importance to warrant this course.     To give the Commission powers to compel the production of evidence would require an Act of Parliament or a resolution of both Houses of Parliament under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921;   but it is probable that the prestige of a Royal Commission would secure what evidence is required, and I should not propose, therefore, to endow the Commission with these special powers unless it should become clear, in the course of their proceedings, that this measure is necessary, in which event I should propose to proceed by way of a resolution.I suggest that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission should be on the following lines:-&quot;To inquire and report on the Squares and similar open spaces existing in the area of the administrative county of London with special reference to the conditions on which they are held and used and the desirability of their preservation as open spaces and to recommend whether any or all of them should be permanently safeguarded against any use detrimental to their character as open spaces and if so, by what means and en what terms and conditions.&quot;I have in mind a Royal Commission of about twelve members with representatives of the London County Council, the Metropolitan Boroughs, the land owning interest and the London Society - a legal member would be required and probably the addition of a labour member also would be politic.     I should discuss the composition of the Royal Commission with the L.C.C. and the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee before finally settling it.N.C.19th May, 1927.
