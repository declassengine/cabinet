They therefore asked for the observance of strict secrecy.A discussion followed.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend 1. The adoption of the Admiralty&apos;s proposals as the basis of the British Delegation^ negotiations at the forthcoming Conference at Geneva, and that the British Delegates should be given a reasonable latitude in regard to details.2. That the Dominion Representatives should be invited to attend a preliminary Conference in London to be held during the week immediately preceding the date fixed for the Conference at Geneva.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 20, 1927.* Full details of the Naval proposals and fuller Minutes will be circulated as soon as the need for close secrecy has passed. ; .
