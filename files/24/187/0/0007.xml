[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May ]927.SECRET. Copy No.    aCP. 157 (27).0ARMS EMBARGO AND SUPPLY OF ARMS TO CANTON.THE following letter from the Colonial Office should be read in connection with Cabinet Paper 156 (27) of May 16, 1927.Foreign Office, May IS, 1927.Colonial Office to Foreign Office. (Received May 12.) (Immediate and Secret.)Sir, Boivning Street, May 11, 1927.I am directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to refer to the letter from this Department of the 4th May enclosing a copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Governor of Hong Kong regarding a request from General Li Chai-Sum, now in power at Canton, for assistance in obtaining arms and ammunition, and to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, the accompanying copy of a further telegram from Sir C. Clementi, dated the 6th May, reporting that similar overtures have been made to the Governor of Macao (Enclosure 1).2. General Li Chai-Sum has already given evidence of his desire to establish peaceful conditions in Kwangtung, first by his recent action in suppressing Communist agitators in Canton, and, secondly, by the campaign which he is now conducting against subversive elements in the country districts. The result of the improved conditions now obtaining in Canton is shown in the enclosed telegram (Enclosure 2), dated the 4th May, in which the Governor of Hong Kong reports that trade with Canton is now more or less normal. In these pfrcumstances it would be a serious misfortune to Hong Kong and to British trade in South China if General Li Chai-Sum were to be prevented by lack of munitions from maintaining his authority in the Province. Sir C. Clementi recommends, therefore, that, subject to a public declaration of his good intentions, he should be given the assistance for which he asks.3. It now appears from Mr. Brenan&apos;s telegram No. 32 of the 6th May, a copy of which was enclosed in your letter of the 9th May, that there is small prospect of obtaining from Li Chai-Sum a declaration in the sense recommended by the Governor. Mr. Brenan considers, however, that the General should none the less be given facilities to purchase arms and ammunition in Hong Kong or through Hong Kong agents, and he enquires whether he may give an assurance to a German agent who has approached him that arms destined for Li Chai-Sum will not be seized at British ports. A copy of a further telegram from Sir C. Clementi reporting the receipt of an application from the agent is enclosed (Enclosure 3).4. &quot;With regard to this application Mr. Amery is of opinion first that no assurance is necessary ^since it is well known that arms and ammunition consigned to Chinese destinations are safe from interference if carried on vessels which do not touch at British. ports, that there is no difficulty in chartering vessels to carry such consignments by a route which complies with this condition, and that the insurance of the consignments can be effected on the continent. The German agent can therefore, if he wishes to do so, arrange without difficulty for the supply of arms for Li .Chai-Sum without an assurance from the Hong Kong Government, and the request for such an assurance doubtless arises from 3984 a [16175]
2a desire to make the transaction at once less hazardous and more lucrative. To give an assurance in the sense recommended by Mr. Brenan would be tantamount to &quot;providing evidence for a charge that His Majesty&apos;s Government were conniving at the supply of arms to Li Chai-Sum and would, in Mr. Amery&apos;s Opinion, constitute a most dangerous precedent which might seriously embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government in the maintenance of the China Arms Embargo Agree-ment. While, therefore, Mr. Amery concurs with Mr. Brenan and Sir C. Clementi in considering that facilities for the supply of arms should be given to Li Chai-Sum, notwithstanding that no public declaration of good intentions is likely to be obtainable, he considers that it would be at once safer, more expeditious and more convenient if the supply of arms were secretly arranged through Government channels.5. It is, of course, clear that if any substantial quantity of arms were placed immediately at Li Chai-Sum&apos;s disposal, considerable risks would be run, since there would be no guarantee beyond the General&apos;s personal assurance that the arms would, in fact, be used in maintaining order in Kwangtung. This objection could, however, be overcome by granting only small supplies of arms at intervals and by making the delivery of each consignment contingent on His Majesty&apos;s consul-general being satisfied that Li Chai-Sum was, in fact, making serious efforts to maintain order and to suppi&apos;ess piracy and brigandage in the Province. It would, of course, be understood that these small consignments of arms would be delivered through a shipping company or other intermediary, and not direct from Government sources.6. It appears to Mr. Amery that the adoption of this procedure would not constitute a breach of the China Arms Embargo Agreement, since the transaction could legitimately be described as involving only the supply of arms to the established authority in Canton for police purposes, and not for use in the Civil War, and as such could be regarded as outside the scope of the Agreement. I am, moreover, to invite Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s attention to the fact that provision already exists for authorising supplies of arms in special cases, notwithstanding the terms of the China Arms Embargo Agreement, since the King&apos;s Regulations made in 1919 in pursuance of the Agreement contain the following reservation : &quot; Nothing in these Regulations shall be deemed to prohibit any transaction authorised by a written licence granted by His Majesty&apos;s Minister.&quot;7. Mr. Amery is, moreover, of the opinion that the supply of arms in this manner need not be considered to involve a departure from His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy of neutrality towards the contending factions. General Li Chai-Sum is understood to have been in control of Canton for some months, and appears now to have succeeded in consolidating his position there. There is ho question, therefore, of assisting him to effect a coup cVEtat in overthrowing an existing regime, or of encouraging him to extend the bounds of his authority at the expense of rival Administrations. On the contrary, it is only desired to render him such assistance as would enable him to maintain those peaceful conditions which he has already succeeded in establishing in Canton, and to police satisfactorily those outlying districts which he is now engaged in restoring to order.8. In the last resort, all Governments depend on force, and when, as in this case, an authority has at last succeeded in tranquillising a disturbed district in which a neighbouring British Colony has a vital,interest, it would appear illogical to handicap that authority by placing obstacles in. the way of the supply of the arms and ammunition necessary for the maintenance of peace and good order while the forces of disorder are liberally furnished with arms by the Soviet. This principle appears long since to have been recognised by the. Governments of Prance and Japan so far as their respective spheres of influence are concerned, since the French have until recently succeeded in avoiding trouble in.Yunnan ,by subsidising the Governor, while the Japanese are well known to have lent material assistance to Chang Tso-lin in Manchuria. Neither of these Powers ; has been, openly accused, so far as Mr. Amery is aware, of interfering in affairs in China. On the other hand, each has repeatedly asserted that it is following and will continue to follow a policy of neutrality towards the contending parties, and it seems clear that each regards its established polioy in its particular sphere of influence as in no way inconsistent with a general polioy of neutrality in China.   In view of the
Enclosure 1. ..Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated May 6, 1927. (Received Colonial Office, 8*30 a.m., May 6, 1927.) My telegram of 27th April: Arms embargo.Portuguese consul-general called to see me to-day at the request of the Governer of Macao, who had received request from General Li-Chai-Sum for arms and ammunition, accompanied by offer that, if request were granted, all Reds and strikers now causing anxiety to the Macao Government would be driven away from Lappa and Portuguese frontier. The Governor of Macao asked for my opinion and said that he would in this matter follow the policy of Hong Kong Government.I replied that Li-Chai-Sum had also asked the British authorities for arms and ammunition ; that in my opinion arms embargo was injurious to Hong Kong and Macao, but that I did not think that it should be relaxed in favour of Li-Chai-Sum unless he publicly declared his intention to suppress all anti-foreign manifestations to respect foreign treaty rights pending negotiation in proper form of revised treaties and to suppress piracy and brigandage; and that in any case decision would have to be taken in London and Lisbon and not by the Governor of Macao and myself locally.Portuguese consul-general said that the Governor of Macao would doubtless telegraph similar views to Lisbon and meanwhile postpone definite answer to Li-Chai-Sum.(Repeated to Peking, No. 34 ; Canton.)special significance of the relations between Canton and Hong Kong there would appear to be no reason why the considerations urged in respect of France and Japan should not be held to apply with equal force to His Majesty&apos;s Government iii respect of Kwangtung.9. Finally, 1 am to invite attention to recent correspondence with His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking in regard to the supply of Vickers&apos; aeroplanes to Chang Tso-Lin. It is understood that in response to Sir M. Lampson&apos;s repre-sentations the supply of these aeroplanes has now been sanctioned, but that while it is clear that they will, in fact, be used for military purposes; they have been described as commercial, in order that there may be no conflict with the terms of the China Arms Embargo Agreement. If the supply of aeroplanes to a Northern general under a specious disguise of this nature is not regarded as improper, Mr. Amery can see no reason why the despatch of arms to a Southern general for police purposes should not be regarded as equally legitimate.10. In short, it appears to Mr. Amery that the adoption of the Governor&apos;8 proposal in the form suggested above would not constitute a breach of the China Anns Embargo Agreement, would not involve a, reversal of the established policy of neutrality in China, and, even if known to them, would not be objected to by other Powers, at least two of which follow the same principle. Moreover, the proposal can scarcely be distinguished in principle from the concessions already granted to a Northern general. In view of these considerations and of the importance to Hong Kong of preserving harmonious relations with Canton, I am to commend the proposal to Sir Austen Chainberlain&apos;s favourable consideration.11. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Committee of Imperial Defence.I am, &amp;c.G. GRINDLE.
Enclosure 2.Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated May 4, 1927. (Received Colonial Office 515 a.m., May 5, 1927.)MY telegram unnumbered of 24th April: Trade situation.Trade with Canton is now more or less normal, but both there and at Swatow menace of communistic peasant rising gives cause for anxiety. Trade to Yang-tsze shows heavy falling off, but reverse traffic continues in fair volume.Enclosure 3.Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong to the Secretary of State for theColonies.Dated May 6, 1927.(Received Colonial Office 6.55 p.m. May 6, 1927.)My telegram of 6th May: Arms embargo.Feld, German merchant of Canton, saw Colonial Secretary on 6th May and stated that he had been approached on behalf of Li-Chai-Sum for supply of arms. He is prepared to supply, but cannot do business without insurance, which he cannot effect unless Hong Kong Government guarantees that no British action will be taken, provided that the vessel conveying the arms does not enter British waters.Feld further said he did not wish the arms to fall into the hands of the Communist faction. If therefore Communists are again in power in Canton when the arms arrive, he wishes to have place of safety for the arms, and would be prepared to bring them into Hong Kong for seizure provided I can give him assurance that the arms will not be forfeited, but will be allowed to be i-e-exported to a non-Chinese destination.German consul here saw the Colonial Secretary, and appears to have instructions to abide by Arms Embargo Convention, and seemed to have doubt as to how far his Government would countenance Feld&apos;s transaction, though the arms are said to be not coming from Germany.Feld professes a desire to do nothing which would be contrary to the wishes &quot;of the British Government, but presses the urgent need of Li-Chai-Sum for arms for anti-Red campaign.I recommend that I be authorised to give the desired assurance,, provided that Li-Chai-Sum will make public declaration suggested in my telegram of 27th April on this subject.(Repeated to Peking, No. 85, and Canton.)o
