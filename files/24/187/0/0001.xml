I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1927.SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 151 (27).HOUSE OF LORDS REFORM.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and for the Colonies. THE essential conditions of any reform are : (1.) That it should provide a Second Chamber of fixed numbers which cannot be swamped;(2.) That it should provide for its constitution and periodical modification on a basis which will secure a House, conservative in character, but reasonably evenly divided as between parties a House, in fact, in which the present Opposition will from the start have a &quot; fair show,&quot; and in which it might hope, as the result of clear and long-sustained public support, eventually to attain a majority;(3.) That it should, as far as possible, preserve a continuity not only of title, but of character with the existing House of Lords, and attract men of experience in politics or other forms of public service both by its dignity and by the opportunity of doing really useful work.The proposition which I should like to submit is that the House should consist half of Peers, including Life Peers, elected by themselves, and half of Lords of Parliament nominated for a period of years by the leaders of the great Parties in the House of Commons, a fraction retiring at stated intervals.The legalisation of life peerages is a reform long overdue. The prejudice against hereditary honours is very strong in large circles in this country as well as in the Dominions. The value of personal honours is far more widely recognised and appreciated. The hereditary obligation not only makes the acceptance of a peerage difficult for a man of limited means, or whose eldest son is not likely to be able financially, or in other ways, to support the peerage afterwards, but is a very real handicap to the son himself in many walks of life. There are many men not only in the Unionist and Liberal Parties and in the Public Service, but also in the ranks of the Labour Party or of Labour organisation, e.g., Mr. Barnes or Mr. Appleton, who could quite suitably be made Life Peers, but for whom a hereditary peerage would be inappropriate. The reform is one which goes back to the original basis of the House of Lords which was personal service and not heredity.If life peerages are instituted their value might be enhanced, and the danger of attempts to swamp the Peerage as an electoral body averted, by laying down a maximum total to the number of life peers that could ever be in existence at any one time. The only objection to this is that it might create a temptation to make life peers up to the limit too rapidly.The creation of life peerages, as a recognition of public service, not necessarily or even preferably connected with party, should be left to the Crown, i.e., the Govern-ment of the day. But there are considerable objections to leaving the nomination of the other Lords of Parliament to the Government. The experience of Canada,, with a nominated Upper House, has been that after a long spell of government by one party, just when public opinion has swung round most, the Upper House is most strongly manned by the opponents of the Government of the day and most inclined to be deliberately obstructive. This danger might easily be accentuated by the incidence of the period of replacement, which might fall in such a way as to give a wholly unfair advantage to one party. The whole conception of periodic replacement is to secure a House corresponding as far as possible with the average movement of public opinion, as contrasted with the oscillation of General Elections. From that point of view it would be much better that the periodic vacancies should be filled up by the party leaders in proportion either to their strength in the House [16145]
of Commons, or preferably to their voting strength as disclosed at the last general election.There is a further practical advantage in this from the point of view of securing an effective membership. There are many Members of Parliament who for reasons of health or business would be well disposed to leaving their seats in the Lower House for less strenuous but still useful work in the Upper, men who have, in fact, improved as legislators even if they have deteriorated as candidates. If the nominations are by the Government only, everything becomes dependent on the. hazard of the General Election. No supporter of either side could resign his candidature before the election with any reasonable certainty of being nominated to the Lords afterwards. These men would, therefore, naturally feel obliged to stand at the election, and after they had got in the objection to unnecessary by-elections would make, the Govern-ment unwilling to nominate them for the Lords. The tendency would thus be to recruit the Lords mainly from defeated candidates, in so far as it was recruited in any degree from men of parliamentary experience. If, on the other hand, the nomination were by the Party Leaders, men of the type referred to could -make much more sure of their plans beforehand. One might hope thus to establish a regular rotation of service in the House of Commons, followed by a twelve years&apos; period in the House of Lords, ending very probably in a life or hereditary peerage. Such a career would have great attraction for many men of the type one would most want to secure. Incidentally, such an arrangement would be especially attractive to the younger members of the existing Peerage, who, by successive service as members of the House of Commons and nominated Lords of Parliament, would be able to establish a secure claim to their subsequent election as representatives of their own order.The. kind of House of Lords that would result from such an arrangement would not differ so very widely from the present one as to disturb the sense of continuity or lose such prestige as the existing House still carries with it. The representative hereditary and life peers would be very much the same as the men who already take the leading part in the House of Lords, while the isolated elements which have been held up to ridicule or discredit in past campaigns against the House of Lords would be effectively excluded. The nominated Lords of Parliament would also be largely of a similar type as far as ability and general public service went. It would, of course, be a much less plutocratic assembly. But I doubt if it would be much less aristocratic. It would be, in the main, a House of hereditary nobles, of men who had made their mark in the service of the Empire as administrators or fighting men, and of men of proved experience in Parliament, local government or industrial organisation.As regards the balance of parties, a House of Lords reorganised on these lines would, from the outset, comprise, perhaps, 30 out of 150 hereditary peers, and 80 or 90 out of the nominated Lords of Parliament on the Opposition side. Labour or Liberal majorities in the country at the next two elections, and the creation of, say, 50 life peers in the interval, would give the present Oppositions a quite reasonable chance of a working majority for their ordinary legislation, though never, I think, a majority on which they could rely for extreme measures.An Upper House so constituted would be a really effective instrument for legis-lation. With the ever-increasing volume of financial and administrative work to which the House of Commons tends to devote its attention it is becoming more and more a Chamber of Administration and of Policy. The big highly contentious party Bills will always naturally have to be thrashed out by it. But there is an ever-growing scope for the introduction and pre-digestion of less controversial measures in an Upper House that was qualified by its composition to secure the reasonable representation of every point of view. On the other hand, even if the Parliament Act were drastically modified, it could never, without the power of the purse, set itself up as a real rival to the House of Commons.The real difficulty of seriously altering the Parliament Act to-day lies in the absence of any general confidence in the House of Lords as at present constituted or in a new and untried substitute. The best chance of its alteration will come when its powers have once been used, or attempted to be used, against a reformed House of Lords which has during the conflict enjoyed the support of public opinion, and been endorsed by the verdict of the next general election.There are one or two further points which deserve consideration. A twelve-year period of nomination, with periodic replacements of one-third every four years, as recommended by the Committee, involves the possibility of two replacements during the life of one Parliament.   The gravest objection to this would be removed by
giving the nomination to the party leaders as proposed above. But it also might be possible to consider as an alternative a fifteen-year period with replacements of one-third every five years, or a twelve-year period with one-half replaced every six years.The eligibility of women to become life peers and to serve as nominated Lords of Parliament would also have to be considered. If they are to be included, hereditary peeresses in their own right would presumably also be made eligible both as electors and as representatives of the Peerage.The composition of the Second Chamber, as well as its powers, should be placed outside the scope of the Parliament Act. This would, incidentally, commend the proposed reforms to the present House of Lords, and help them to realise that the whole character, if not the very existence of a Second Chamber are, under present conditions, absolutely at the mercy of the next swing of the pendulum at a general election.L. S. A.Colonial Office, May 12, 1927.
