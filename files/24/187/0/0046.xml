jThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1927. SECRET. Copy No.    30CP. 198 (27).CABINET.THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN CYPRUS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.A SERIOUS situation has arisen in Cyprus to which I must invite the attention of my colleagues. In November last, the elected representatives, who have a majority in the Legislature, rejected the budget by a unanimous vote. This drastic step was taken as a protest against the continued payment by the Island into the Imperial Treasury of an annual contribution of  42,800 per annum, which has been imposed upon it as its share of the Ottoman Public Debt charge. The contribution is specially secured on the local revenues by Order in Council, and is not subject to the vote of the Legislature. The position which the Elected Members took up, however, was that so long as this remained the case they would refuse normal supply.In order to keep the machinery of government running, it became necessary to invoke the over-riding power of the Crown and to pass the budget by an Imperial Order in Council. The Governor now reports that this is not likely to be the end of the matter. He advises me that as long as this contribution is exacted the Elected Members will adopt a policy of non-co-operation. This is bound to result in serious embarrassment to the administration, and is a prospect which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot regard with equanimity. We cannot go on governing Cyprus by the issue of Orders in Council. Such a course is not only administratively impossible, but is also unjustifiable and unwise politically.We must face the fact that in taking up their stand on this particular issue, the Elected Members are in a strong moral position. The payment against which they are protesting is. in my opinion, one which can no longer be justified by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In recent months I have urged strongly upon the Treasury that the payment should be remitted or at least considerably abated. Unfortunately they have been unable to agree to this course. In view of the advice which I am receiving from the Governor regarding the importance of removing this burning local issue, and from my own conviction that by exacting this payment Great Britain is not doing the fair thing by Cyprus, I feel compelled to submit the matter for the decision of the Cabinet. The salient facts regarding it are set out in the ensuing paragraphs.&quot; The Cyprus Tribute.&quot;We took over the administration of Cyprus from the Turks in 1878 in virtue of a Convention concluded with the Sultan in&apos;that year. One of the stipulations of this Convention was that we should in future pay over to the Porte the excess of the Island&apos;s revenue over expenditure on an average of the five preceding years. This amount was, after some negotiation, later fixed at  92,800 a year.In point of fact, the money was never actually paid to Turkey, but was diverted to the service of the Turkish Guaranteed Loan of 1855. This was a 4 per cent, loan, of which the British and French Governments jointly and severally guaranteed the interest, but not the sinking fund. In 1875-76, the Ottoman Empire defaulted on the loan and the guarantee began to operate. It was, however, a somewhat one-sided operation as the French did not, and, I understand, never have, met their obligation under it.The amount outstanding at the time of the default was  3,815,200, on which the annual interest amounts to  153,752.  As the loan had been secured not only on the [16399] b
general revenues of the Ottoman Empire, but specially also upon the balance of the Egyptian tribute available, i.e.,  72,000, this amount was diverted to meet the interest. This, however, left a sum of  81,752 for interest to be made up. The Government of the day bethought themselves of the Cyprus tribute of  92,800 a year, and obtained advice that as this sum formed part of the revenue of the Ottoman Empire, it could be withheld from the Porte and used for the service of the loan. The  92,800 was accordingly applied to make up the deficit of  81,752. This left an annual surplus of some  11,000, which was invested and accumulated in a special fund by the Treasury. &apos;    &apos; &quot;   &quot; &apos;Ever since our occupation, the payment of the tribute has been the cause of burning dissatisfaction among the Islanders. They have contended with, it must be admitted, some show of argument, that by the terms of the Convention, the money was due to Turkey from British and not Cypriot revenues, and that in any case the sum fixed was far too high. I will quote on this subject from a memorandum written by Mr. Churchill when Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies after a visit which he paid to the Island twenty years ago. As a statement of Cyprus&apos; case, the indict-ment cannot be improved upon.;I By the Convention of 1878 we bound Cyprus to pay a tribute to the Sultan of  92,800. This Convention was made for our own purposes, because it was then thought a matter of high military importance to have a place of arms and strategic base in the Levant, whence Egypt and Constantinople could be surveyed. The Cypriotes were not consulted by us in fixing the amount of the tribute. They never agreed to it, and it was fixed upon the basis of what Turkey declared she had been able to screw out of the island by regular Turkish methods. We were anxious, however, to have the island, and could not afford, or did not care, to boggle about the terms, particularly as they affected only other people&apos;s interests. Reviewing this original transaction, I cannot help thinking-it improper. I do not think that we ought ever to have consented to make ourselves the agents of collecting the hatefully oppressive taxes by which the Turk has crushed and ruined so many of his tributary provinces. But that is only half the transaction.&quot;It happened by chance that just about the same time as our occupation of the island began the Sultan repudiated the Turkish Debt of 1855, of which Great Britain and France were joint guarantors, and which was secured on the revenues of the Turkish Empire. Here in Cyprus at least was one portion of those revenues which we could seize. We therefore intercepted the whole tribute, and devoted the money to the service of the repudiated loan. No doubt, from our point of view, this was a convenient arrangement. But was it an honest or moral action ? Observe the consequences. Cyprus had no more to do with, and was no more consulted upon, the extension of the Anglo-French guarantee to the 1855 Loan than she was consulted about her tribute to Turkey. The 1855 Loan was&apos; guaranteed by the two Great Powers for reasons of high policy utterly unconnected:with Cyprus. It is to be presumed that Great Britain acted in British interest alone in according that guarantee. Certainly Great Britain, and no one else, was responsible for her share in the event of default. She had and has no more right to make Cyprus contribute towards the discharge of that purely British obligation than to make Ceylon or any small independent State which could be coerced by force of arms. But this is what she has done. The Turk has never received a penny of the tribute, and in that respect the Convention of 1878 is, in fact, utterly evaded. Yet Cyprus has been made to pay all the same, and the money has come to us, and has been used by us to defray an integral part of purely British expenditure.&quot;It soon became apparent that Cyprus could not pay the whole  92,800 a year from her own revenues. This1 may have been the sum which the Turks were able to extract, but under the Turkish Government the Island was taxed to the highest figure it could bear, while the cost of administration was kept at a trifling.figure. The payment of the officials was, of course, largely effected by the time-honoured oriental method. There was an almost complete absence of expenditure on the ordinary public services which a British administration would make it its first duty to provide. The main object of the Turks was, in fact, to extract as much revenue from Cyprus as possible; and to fix as a permanent charge upon the Island a sum based upon the amount which they were able to obtain was a proceeding which it is difficult to&apos;justify^&apos;
In order to enable the Island to carry the burden, it became necessary to give her grants-in-aid from the Imperial Treasury to meet the annual deficits caused by the excess of expenditure over revenue after the tribute had been paid. In the words of Mr. ChurchnTs memorandum : &quot;. . . . we proceeded to treat Cyprus as if she were a non-self-supporting Protectorate. She passed under the most rigid Treasury control. The fruit of all economies, however self-denying, every surplus, however pitifully small, was seized at the end of each financial year; the difference between the amount collected and the cost of the administration and the whole tribute together was then voted as a grant-in-aid, and the accounts were presented to Parliament in a form which would lead any person to suppose that we were actually keeping Cyprus going out of British money. This iniquitous and immoral arrangement lasted for twenty-seven years, during which time we succeeded in extracting from this wretched island about  60,000 a year on the average, or about  1,600,000 altogether.&quot;In 1907 the annual grant-in-aid was fixed at  50,000 a year, and Treasury control of the Island&apos;s finances brought to an end. At this figure the grant has remained ever since, except during the year 1910-11, when only  40,000 was paid. Mr. Churchill, in his memorandum, welcomed the relief afforded by the grant-in-aid, but continued : &quot; But the fact stares me none the less in the face that we have no right whatever, except by force majeure, to take a penny of the Cyprus tribute to relieve us from our own just obligations, however unfortunately contracted. There is scarcely any spectacle more detestable than the oppression of a small community by a great Power for the purpose of pecuniary profit; and that is, in fact, the spectacle which our financial treatment of Cyprus at this moment indisputably presents. It is, in my opinion, quite unworthy of Great Britain, and altogether out of accordance with the whole principles of our colonial policy in every part of the world, to exact tribute by force from any of the possessions or territories administered under the Crown. Let the figures be juggled by any sophistry or artifice within the wit of man, these two root-facts remain that Cyprus pays  42,800 a year, and that Great Britain receives  42,800 a year for her own benefit, namely, to pay a portion of her own debts. And that, I say, constitutes a blemish upon Imperial policy of a peculiarly discreditable kind.&quot;The Cyprus Share of the Turkish Debt Charge. &apos;In November 1914, Great Britain, being at war with Turkey, annexed Cyprus. The Convention of 1878 thereupon lapsed, and with it the British liability to pay Turkey  92,800 a year. Cyprus, however, went on paying this annual sum to the Imperial Treasury, and receiving as a set-off a grant-in-aid of  50,000. The money was applied, as before, to the service of the Guaranteed Loan of 1855.This continued payment, it has been argued by the Treasury, is justified on the ground that Cyprus, as a Succession State of the old Ottoman Empire, should bear her share of the pre-war Ottoman Public Debt. I cannot discuss here the doctrine that States detached from a country by war still retain some liability in respect of the public debt contracted by Governments to which they formerly owed allegiance. It is one of those doctrines of international law which are little more than doctrines, and are by no means universally applied. The following pages show that even where it is applied, concrete results in the shape of cash payments by the detached Territories do not necessarily follow.In the Treaty of Lausanne, however, recognition was given to the doctrine on paper. By its provisions, liability for some share of the pre-war Ottoman Public Debt was attributed to the Territories which it detached from Turkey. No such liability was, however, actually imposed upon Cyprus in the Treaty, since it was agreed at the time that the payment of  92,800 a year for the service of the Guaranteed Loan of 1855 should be treated as her contribution.It appears to be contended by the Treasury that this arrangement was one particularly favourable to Cyprus, as otherwise she would have had to have paid much more. According to a Treasury statement &quot;Cyprus (had the arrangement not been made) would undoubtedly have been required to take over a share of the Ottoman Debt on the same basis as the other Territories detached from Turkey as the[16399] b 2
result of the war, and on that basis her contribution would have been substantially more than the gross amount of the Tribute.&quot;This is a contention which demands examination. In the first place, it is based upon the assumption that Cyprus is in the same category as Palestine, Iraq and Syria, which were conquered during the war and formally detached from Turkey by the Treaty of Lausanne. Cyprus, however, was not detached from Turkey by the Treaty of Lausanne, and has never been so regarded. She was detached by the annexation in 1914, and the Treaty of Lausanne merely imposes upon Turkey the recognition of that fact. On this point I may quote from a letter from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office of the 3rd January, 1924, in which it was stated that the then Secretary of State was advised that the phrase &quot; territory detached from Turkey under the present treaty,&quot; &quot; is only applicable to a territory, the Sovereignty over which was transferred from Turkey to some other State by the Treaty of Lausanne, whereas, in the case of Cyprus, Turkey&apos;s sovereignty was terminated by the annexation of that Island in 1914 by Great Britain, and all that the Treaty of Lausanne does is to impose on Turkey, by Article 20, the recognition of that annexation.&quot;Assuming, however, that Cyprus had been brought into the Lausanne settle-riient, what would her liability have been assessed at and what in hard cash would she have paid up to date? The Treasury have stated that, had her contribution been computed on the same basis as that of the Territories detached from Turkey by the Treaty, it would have been considerably over  100,000 a year. The liability of those Territories is, broadly speaking, assessed in the Treaty upon the amount of their pre-war revenues. In suggesting the sum of over  100,000, the Treasury have com-puted Cyprus&apos; liability upon this basis. The adoption of such a mode of reckoning in the case of Cyprus is, however, clearly unfair and one which cannot be insisted upon on any equitable consideration of her position. She was far from being in the same position as Palestine or Syria, which remained under Turkish rule until they were conquered during the war. When the war broke out, Cyprus, although technically under Turkish sovereignty, had been virtually a British possession for thirty-six years. It is clearly absurd to compare the revenues which she was pro-ducing in 1914 to sustain an efficient and honest British administration with those which Palestine or Syria were producing at that time. It is further arguable that no liability should be placed upon Cyprus for the debt of the Ottoman Empire con-tracted after our occupation of the Island in 1878. Not a penny of the loan money raised by Turkey after that date was spent on Cyprus, and the Islanders had naturally no responsibility with regard to it. If Cyprus&apos; liability were based on the debt contracted only prior to 1878, it would stand at a very low figure, as the great bulk of the debt brought into the Lausanne settlement appears to have been incurred after that date.So miich for the theoretical aspect. When we. turn to the practical side and consider what has been forthcoming in hard cash from Territories which actually were detached from Turkey by the Lausanne Treaty, the injustice to Cyprus of the present arrangement becomes even more apparent.I will give the following figures showing the nominal amount of capital debt* attributed to Iraq and Palestine :  TIraq ... ... ... ...      8,435,166Palestine      ... ... ... ...      4,072,528These figures may look rather formidable. The reality, however, is not quite so impressive. According to my information, the position is that,.with the exception of Palestine, none of the other countries detached from Turkey by the Treaty have made a single annual payment. Palestine made two payments on account, but no more. Both Iraq arid Palestine are adopting a much simpler and cheaper method of liquidating their liability than by making heavy annual payments on account of interest and sinking fund. They are buying up bonds in the market to the nominal amount of their liability, with a view to handing them over to the Debt Council in settlement. This arrangement, for the present, is being kept strictly secret, but by-it these two Territories will obviously be able to discharge their liability on very favourable terms. The average market price at which the bonds have been bought up to the present is a trifle over 18 per cent, of their nominal value in Turkish* Including the unpaid annuities relating to the period 1st March, 1920, to 6th August, 1924, and the &quot; advances&quot; set out in Part B of Annex I to Section I, l&apos;art II, of the Lausanne Treaty.
pounds. It is estimated that the actual sterling cost of wiping out Iraq&apos;s liability will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of one and a quarter million pounds sterling, and that of Palestine some half a million. Italy has adopted a similar method in respect of the share attributed to the Dodecanese. This share is only  T. 243,200, and I understand that the Italian Government paid off practically the whole capital amount by requisitioning the bonds held in Italy, leaving a very small balance to be paid for in cash. As to what the operation has cost them, I have no information, but they have obviously freed themselves from the liability at a very cheap rate.With regard to the other Succession States, I am informed that the position is as follows : Greece has paid nothing; Syria has paid nothing; Nejd and the Hedjaz disclaim all liability; Asir and the Yemen have ignored the demand; Yugo-Slavia has denied liability, and, indeed, for that reason refused to sign the Treaty of Lausanne.   Albania has also ignored the demand made upon her.Consider the position of Cyprus in relation to the above facts. Since 1878 the unfortunate Island has paid  4,489,733 gross in sterling, and  2,642,648 net, i.e., after setting off the grant in aid of  50,000 a year. Since 1914 she has been paying steadily in hard cash the net sum of  42,800 a year as her contribution towards the Ottoman Public Debt charge. This makes a total since the war of some  500,000 sterling. Cyprus, therefore, up to the present, has actually paid over more than all the other Succession States put together. This, in spite of the fact that for 36 years prior to the outbreak of the war, she had been, to all intents and purposes, a British possession.Assuming that she must bear some liability as a Succession State of the Ottoman Empire, it is, therefore, clear that she. has more than amply discharged in cash payments since 1914 any obligation which can equitably be placed upon her. The Islanders could, with some justice, claim a substantial refund, and they have, in fact, raised the question. It is argued that His Majesty&apos;s Government have at their disposal a large fund accumulated by the investment of the  11,000 a year -which remains over after the interest charge on the 1855 Loan has been met, and that this surplus should be. recognised as the property of the Island and be returned to it.The facts regarding this fund are as follows: The  11,000 a year was placed by the Treasury to the credit of a special fund and invested. According to the state-ment furnished by the Treasury in November last, the face value of the fund was at that date  642.400. The sum would have been much larger had not Egypt defaulted on her contribution towards the interest of the loan in 1924. The default of Egypt supplies one of the many ironies with which this matter is invested from the point of view of Cyprus, as the Loan was specially secured not on the revenues of Cyprus but on those of Egypt. Since this default it has been necessary to draw upon the accumulated fund to meet the annual interest payments, and on this account there appears to be a debit to the fund of some  300,000.The surplus has been secretly employed by the Treasury in buying up the bonds of the loan. In this way they hope, eventually to be able to redeem the loan and so extinguish the liability of His Majesty&apos;s Government. This, however, has no interest to Cyprus, which has no connection with the loan except by reason of the force majeure exercised by the Treasury.I do not, however, propose to raise any question of the refund as I fully recognise the difficulties which that would present from the point of view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. My proposal is that the Treasury shall take over the large Cj^prus funds in hand, amounting to about  650,000, as well as the.  300,000 due from Egypt, but that as from the beginning of this year the gross payment from Cyprus of  92,800 a year should cease, together, of course, with the counter-payment of  50,000 a year from Imperial funds. As a further recognition of the difficulties of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am prepared, if my proposal is agreed to, to invite the local Legislature to vote an annual contribution of  10,000 a year towards the cost of defence. I can give no guarantee that the Elected Members will pass this annual vote, but the local Government will be prepared to propose it to them, and hopes that they will accept it when the tribute is abolished. Another condition of my offer is that any charges which may be laid upon the Cyprus Government in future in respect of local defence must be met from the  10,000 a year should it be voted. At present, the Island contributes nothing towards defence, either Imperial or local.I must press the Cabinet strongly to agree to this compromise. The economic result to the Island will be of great importance. The annual extraction of the tribute has left it in a state of undevelopment which is not creditable to British adminis-tvation. The Island presents many possibilities from the economic point of view which it would be worth our while to encourage.   It is crying out for expenditure
on roads, agriculture, forestry and harbours. We have never been able to provide it with technical officers of the best calibre as the cheese-paring policy which has had to be adopted has established the official salaries at a level which has long ceased to attract the best men. The stage has been reached when a development loan is badly required, but the Colony cannot raise it since after the tribute has been paid she has nothing left to meet the loan charges.The economic aspect, important as it is, is not, however, in my opinion, so important as the moral. The tribute question has provided the Islanders with a first-class political grievance. They envisage Great Britain as a far-off power which extracts from them large annual sums not to be spent upon the improvement of the Island, but upon meeting her own obligations. The resultant effect upon the everyday life and future development of the Island is in the words of the Governor &quot; so serious that it is imperative to find some means of adjusting the matter without delay.&quot;It is to my mind regrettable that Great Britain has had to wait for a political deadlock in the Island before recognising the justice of the Islanders&apos; case. It is contrary to all British colonial policy to exact contributions from the Colonies without consent. There is nothing like the Cyprus tribute elsewhere in the Empire. It is no more defensible than would be the passage of an Order in Council imposing a large contribution to the Imperial Exchequer from, say, Kenya or Jamaica. Mr. Churchill said in 1907 in words which I have already quoted that the matter &quot;constitutes a blemish upon Imperial policy of a peculiarly discreditable kind.&quot; Now the Island has definitely been brought within the circle of the Empire, these words of twenty years ago apply with added force.The time for action is, indeed, peculiarly appropriate. In 1907 Mr. Churchill wrote: &quot;I had not realized that w?e have drawn from this Island, exhausted as it was by 300 years of Turkish misgovernment, upwards of  1,800,000 since our occupation thirty years ago.&quot; Next year Cyprus &quot; celebrates &quot; the Jubilee year of her connection with the British Empire. Can we, however great our financial difficulties at home, afford to miss such an occasion for true reconciliation based on an act of elementary justice on our part?L. S.
