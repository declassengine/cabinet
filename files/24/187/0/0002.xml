(THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNtiENT QSECRET. Copy No. ^r*00^.152(27). CAB I N E T.Ouso Drainage Bill.-Mernorar^um by^ the^vlinister of^AgriGulture and Fisheries ^I learn from the Chief TJhlp that there is no early opportunity of taking the Second Reading of the Ouss Drainage Bill.     If the Second Reading is delayed beyond 7/hitsxxntide there may be too little time for the Joint Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament, to which I intend to ask the House to remit the Bill, to complete their labours and still leave sufficient time for the concluding stages of the Bill before the end of July.There is a fair eraocmt of opposition to the Bill, and I think the proceedings before the Select Committee may take some weeks.The condition of the Ouae area is already serious for-owing to the passive resistance from some parts of the present Ouse District the Ouse Board has been unable to . . undertake comprehensive works to obviate the risk of inundation.     Some 550,000 acres in this valuable food producing district are below the level of high water and we can never be sure that after a period of prolonged bad weather there might not be serious flooding in the area. We do not want to risk the sort of thing, on a smaller scale that has happened recently in the Mississippi Valley. If this Bill is not proceeded with, the affairs of the Ouse District will, after January 1st next, -revert to the state of passive resistance following the original Ouse Ordex1 of 1920, because on that date the Suspensory Provisional Order,
under which certain upland areas are* temporarily excluded from the district and therefore relieved of paying rates , expires.The Treasury have, pending the passing of the Bill, guaranteed an overdj^aft from the Bank to the Ouse Board up to 31st August, 1927, end .are averse to extend this guarantee.     Moreover any provisional Order for the continuance of the Suspensory Order cannot he introduced this Session in time to he confirmed by Parliament, owing to the legal formalities to be complied with,I therefore hops the Cabinet will agree that we should press on with the present Ouse Bill and that some time may be found before VThitsuntide to take the Second Reading.W. G.MINISTRY OF AGP.IOITLTURE AKD FISHERIES. 13th May, 1927.2.
