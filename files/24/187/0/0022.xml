[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1927.Copy No.  30CP. 172 (27).CABINET.RELATIONS WITH THE IMAM OF THE YEMEN.Memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN fulfilment of the decision of the Cabinet on the 1st of December, 1926 (Cabinet 61 (26), Conclusion 6), the Resident at Aden was instructed to issue a warning to the Imam of the Yemen in regard to his occupation of parts of the Aden Protectorate. A copy of the instructions issued to the Resident (Annexure 1) is attached. The warning was duly issued, after the increase of the Royal Air Force at Aden had been effected. The Imam&apos;s reply is summarised in a telegram from the Resident of the 24th of April (Annexure 2). As will be seen, the Imam has offered to send a plenipotentiary to Aden to negotiate an agreement. The Resident proposes to reply that this offer can be accepted only on condition that the Imam undertakes to evacuate the Protectorate.I have been in consultation on this point with the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry. The Admiralty and War Office endorse the Residenfs view. The Foreign Office favour a compromise by which the Imam would obtain qualified recognition of his claims in respect of the outlying portions of the Protectorate in return for the abandonment of any claim to Aden itself and its immediate neighbourhood. They suggest that the proposed reply to the Resident should be so worded as to leave the way open for an eventual reduction of our liabilities towards the Protectorate tribes. The Air Ministry point out that, if the Imam refuses the Residenfs condition, our present unfriendly relations with the Imam would continue and we might find ourselves committed to a permanent increase of the Aden garrison. They recommend that the reply to the Imam should be so worded as to leave room for compromise on the basis of a qualified recognition of the Inianfs claim in respect of the outlying portions of the Protectorate.My own view is in accord with that of the Resident. The suggestion of an agreement with the Imam on the basis of a qualified recognition of his position in outlying parts of the Protectorate was made by the Foreign Office last December. I consulted the Resident on the subject and attach a copy of his reply (Annexure 3). He took the view that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not honourably divest themselves of their obligations within the Protectorate; that if the outlying districts were surrendered to the Imam the means of safeguarding the coast would be lost and the confidence of the tribes in His Majesty&apos;s Government would be destroyed; and that, once the Imam were established on a frontier the defence of which was considered essential to the safety of Aden, the permanent garrison would have to be increased so as to put us in a position to oppose his troops on their first move. He further considered that concessions made to the Imam would only lead to further demands. I concur generally in these views. I am against any abandonment of our Protectorate rights, particularly at a time when the Imanfs position is none too secure and when circumstances may well arise that will make him more amenable to our wishes. I would authorise the Resident to reply in the terms proposed. This would be simply reaffirming the position taken up by General Clayton when the last negotiations broke down, and the only effect of our doing so will be to prevent new negotiations being initiated on what [16228] bSECRET.
would amount to an abandonment of our previous position and a victory for the Imam. It would not commit us in any way to any attempt to expel the Imam forcibly from the areas now occupied by him, unless and until fresh provocation on his part or a serious collapse of his power warranted such action with the means at our disposal. &apos;L. S. A.Colonial Office,1st Jane, 1927.Annexure No. 1.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident, Aden.   Se7it 5th March, 1927;FUTURE relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam reference to your despatch of 9th February * and your despatch of 19th January. *His Majesty&apos;s Government concur generally in views expressed in latter despatch and have decided that communication on the lines set out below should be addressed to Imam after No. S Royal Air Force Squadron has arrived at Aden and flown over the Protectorate in full force for at least a week. The Imam should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government have every wish to maintain friendly relations with him and would welcome the establishment of a formal understanding between the two Governments. They have already given ample indication of their desire to arrive at such an understanding by sending Sir G. Claytou to Sanaa but they are quite unable to agree to the territorial demands put forward by the Imam. They have no wish to extend their sphere outside the boundaries of the Aden Protectorate or to threaten the Tmam&apos;s absolute independence; on the contrary, it is to&apos; their interests that there should be a stable government in the Yemen and they are anxious to be on friendly terms with it. If at any time the Imam is prepared to come to an agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government recognising the treaty relations between themselves and the Protectorate tribes, His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, would be glad to discuss with him the terms of such an agreement. While reiterating their desire to come j to a friendly arrangement of this character His Majesty&apos;s Government feel it incumbent upon them to make it plain beyond all question that the Imam has no rights whatever within the Aden Protectorate, and they feel it necessary now to give him warning that continued occupation by him of a portion of that Protectorate renders him liable at any time to. such measures of retaliation by laird, air or sea, at such time and in such manner as may be deemed suitable, and that further encroachment in the Protectorate or any action on his part against any islands in the Red Sea is calculated to precipitate action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. But there is nothing that His Majesty&apos;s Government desire less than to be driven to any such action and the advantages of a peaceful agreement between the Imam and His Majesty&apos;s Government whereby tribes within the Protectorate were guaranteed against any outside interference would be of such advantage to the progress and commerce- of the Yemen that His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that the Imam will once more consider whether an agreement cannot be.reached.You will doubtless settle in consultation with the Officer Commanding the Air Force on a suitable opportunity for addressing the Imam on the above lines.AMERY.Not printed.   -    v&quot; . .&apos;.   , ...1
Paraphrase Telegram from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.   Dated 24th April, 1927.MESSAGE to Imam Yahya, reference my telegram of 10th April. The Imam has now replied to the following effect: He makes the usual protestations of friendship and of his desire to conclude a friendly agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government. He refers to &quot; threats&quot; contained in communication from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and states that no action which would impair the independence of the Yemen can be tolerated by him. He concludes by offering to send a plenipotentiary to Aden to discuss the making of a treaty, and asks me to communicate with His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject.Paragraph 2. Agreement with the Imam in my opinion should, if possible, be brief; on his side recognition of the Protectorate, on His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfrs an acknowledgment of the independence of the Yemen, with perhaps a third clause to the effect that more elaborate agreements will be discussed when the Imam has implemented the treaty by the evacuation of the Protectorate.Paragraph 3. Subject to your concurrence I therefore propose that a reply should be returned to the Imam acknowledging and reciprocating his hopes for a friendly agreement and continuing on the following lines: &quot; As he has been assured on several occasions His Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire to interfere in any way with his independence in his own territory of Yemen. His Majesty&apos;s Government are quite unable to acquiesce in his occupation of parts of territory of tribes with whom they are in treaty relations and such threats as were contained in my last communication plainly applied only to reprisals for acts of aggression committed or to be committed by him. His Majesty&apos;s Government are as heretofore prepared on his acknowledgment of the Protectorate boundaiy to recognise the Imam&apos;s independence in his own territoiw. If his plenipotentiary will be authorised to acknowledge on his behalf the independence of those tribes and undertake to withdraw from those areas within the Protectorate boundary which are now occupied by the Imam&apos;s troops he will be welcomed and a friendly agreement to the above effect will be easily arranged. It will be useless for his envoy to come to Aden if he will not acknowledge the Protectorate boundary as claimed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In this explanation His Majesty&apos;s Government are animated by the desire that negotiations if&quot; opened again shall not fail for a third time. When the above agreement is signed and ratified agreements on other matters can be discussed in a friendly spirit.&quot;Paragraph 4. Pending your reply I am sending a polite acknowledgment of his letter to the Imam. Despatch containing a translation of Imam&apos;s letter is being sent to you by the next mail.Annexure No. 3.From Major-General J. H. K. Steivart, G.B., D.S.O., Political Resident, Aden, to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London.Sir, , Aden Residency, l$th January, 1927.IN continuation of my telegram* sent in reply to your Confidential despatch of the 30th December, 1926,* I have the honour to state my views on the points raised in the Foreign Office letter No. E/7036/2260/91 of 24th December.* I have already expressed these as shortly as possible in my telegram, and the following observa-tions expand my comments on the paragraphs of the Foreign Office letter.2. Reference paragraph 2 of Foreign Office letter. I understand that the Royal Air Force make no claim to be able to recover by air action any country in which the Imam has already firmly established himself, but they do claim that, in case of further incursions, they would be able to make the invaders withdraw by means of direct action against them and of an attack on the moral of the Imam and his Commanders by aerial action against towns and troops within the Imam&apos;s borders. Hence it is aggression in the Protectorate whioh is most likely to bring about active measures by us. I consider therefore that the warning to the Imam should be that his oooupation of a portion of the Aden Protectorate renders him[16228]Not printed.Annexure No. 2.
Aliable at any time to such measures of retaliation by land, sea or air and in such manner as His Majesty&apos;s Government may deem suitable, and that any encroach-ment by him in the Protectorate, or action against the Islands in the Red Sea are calculated to precipitate such action. I will refer to the method in which this warning should be conveyed in a later part of this letter.3. Reference paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter. The Imam no doubt genuinely desires a settlement wiuh His Majesty&apos;s Government, but, as has often been pointed out, he wants it only on his own terms. The friendly sentiments expressed in paragraph 5 of his letter of 7th October, 1926,* are similar to many such declarations that he has repeatedly made during the last five or six years, often at times when he was actually engaged in seizing portions of our Protectorate. A better clue to his meaning is contained in paragraph 2 of the same letter in which he says: &quot; except for the consent of the British Government to grant in full our justified and rightful requirements, the legality of which is proved, there is not the slightest cause for the postponement of the establishment of a formal and general understanding between the two Governments.&quot; What the Imam regards as his rights in the Protectorate is shown in his own draft for clause 3 of the proposed treaty, which was sent to the Secretary of State with Major Barretfs despatch of 31st July, 1924.* Major Barrett commented on this draft in his memorandum which accompanied his despatch. I fully agree with his criticisms of it. The Imam affected to regard the illusory concessions made in his draft as a suitable quid pro quo for our turning the Idrisi out of Hodeidah and giving it to him. Since&apos; then he has obtained possession of Hodeidah without our help, and it has been quite clear throughout and down to the present time that he has no intention of recognising the existence of our Protectorate except under compulsion. He has consistently ignored any references to it in all his replies to our letters, however friendly his general language may have been. When Sir Gilbert Clayton permitted the opening of a discussion with the Imam on the possibility of the Zeidis retaining Dala, the Imam promptly advanced claims to other districts in the Protectorate, and Sir Gilbert Clayton thereupon abandoned the negotiations. If we wish really to satisfy the Imam, we must be prepared to surrender the whole Protectorate to him, and even then he will in his heart resent our continued presence in Aden itself.4. Reference paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter. I agree that a radical revision of the treaties with the Protectorate Chiefs may be desirable. But I submit it is not the right time to revise them while they are being violated by a third party, and at a moment when we are obviously finding it difficult to carry them out. A settlement with the Imam should precede a revision of our relations with the tribes inside the Protectorate. Sir Gilbert Clayton advocates a review of the Protectorate treaties, to be followed later by their limitation. But to make this revision a part of a bargain with the Imam would be tantamount to selling our friends to the Imam for a treaty; a step which Sir Gilbert Clayton did not propose, and which, I am convinced, neither he nor His Majesty&apos;s Government could regard as honourable. If the Imam puts no more value on his own words than we should by such action have shown for ours, the treaty gained would be of little value.5. Reference paragraph 5 of Foreign Office letter. I agree that the proposed warning might be combined with a bid for friendship. We should once more make it clear that we have no wish to threaten the Imam&apos;s absolute independence or to extend our sphere outside our Protectorate, but that on the contrary we are glad to see a stable Government in the Yemen and are anxious to be on friendly terms with it. If the Imam is convinced that we mean what we say both by our warning and by our renewed offer of friendship, it is possible that he may decide to- yield to hard facts, and to make the best of the situation by accepting our overtures and agreeing to our terms.6. Reference paragraph 6 of Foreign Office letter. If my understanding is correct as given in paragraph 2 above, then the warning in the terms stated in that paragraph should be conveyed to the Imam incorporated in a friendly letter, but if it is intended to depart from the passive attitude entirely, and to try to force the Imam to evacuate the portions of the Protectorate held by him, I am of opinion that the warning should specifically tell the Imam that his retention of those portions will lead to action. At the same time he should be told that the alternative is his withdrawal and the establishment of relations bh a friendly basis.   This warning should oertainly not be,given unless His Majesty&apos;s Govern-&quot; Not printed.
menfc are determined to carry it out to a decisive conclusion and to maintain the application of force until the Imam submits.7. Reference paragraph 7 of Foreign Office letter. It may be to the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government to reduce their obligations in the Protectorate to the minimum compatible with the safety of Aden itself, but we cannot honourably divest ourselves of our obligations at the present time. This contention is supported by the first three lines of paragraph 5 of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s memo-randum appended to his report on his mission to Sana&apos;a. The termination of these treaties by an understanding with the Imam would not merely lower our prestige, though our prestige would inevitably suffer seriously. It is a question whether our written treaties should or should not be honoured. If we are to carry out treaties only when it is convenient to ourselves to do so, it is rather waste of time to try to make one with the Imam, for he will not fail to draw the inference that such fair weather friends cannot be trusted, and that our readiness to sacrifice old friends in order to gain a new one who is more powerful is an indication of what he himself may expect if fortune ever turns against him.8. The Foreign Office letter says that there are no arguments in favour of the retention of the treaties with the northern Chiefs except such as are inspired by considerations of prestige. At the same time it says that certain of the treaties must presumably be retained in any event, i.e., those with the Sultans of the coast. If by the &quot; northern Chiefs &quot; the Foreign Office means Chiefs such as those of the Amiris, the Yafais, the Audalis, the Aulaqis and Behan, the following are my comments: The Amiri Chief is the Amir of Dala, who visited Aden in 1919 under a written promise from the Resident that he would be protected against aggression from beyond the borders of the Aden Protectorate both then and thereafter. He was subsequently told in writing that if the Imam did not abstain from interference in his territory the Resident would recommend that British troops should be sent to Dala to protect him. The failure to carry out these promises is not simply a matter of losing prestige; it is a clear breach of faith.9. With regard to the Yafais and the Aulaqis, they are the best fighting material in the Protectorate and their abandonment to the Imam would expose to Zeidi attack the Sultans of the coast whom the Foreign Office propose to retain in any event. A sketch map showing areas of these tribes is attached to illustrate the remarks following. The Yafais&apos; country at one time extended to the sea ; but, although they no longer claim the whole of their former territory, they maintain their demand for Khanfar and other districts in Abyau which have been taken from them by the Fadlis. Under pressure from Aden the Lower Yafai Sultan has recently made a truce with the Fadli Sultan (one of the Sultans of the Coast), but if the Yafais became subordinate to the Imam while the Fadlis remained independent, the old quarrel would certainly be resumed by the Zeidis, ostensibly acting on behalf of the Yafais, and the Imam would claim the fertile tract of Abyan which lies only about 30 miles from Aden, and his possession of which would cut off our land communication with the Fadli and the other Sultans of the Coast. Moreover with Yafa and Beda and the Audali country all in his possession the Imam could seize the Fadli territory whenever he pleased.10. The position of the Aulaqis is somewhat similar to that of the Yafais. They extend to the coast and if they are excluded from our Protectorate and left to the Imam the coast would be again laid open to the Zeidis, and, with the Aulaqi country gone, we could hardly hope to preserve the Wahidis of Balahaf or the other petty tribes (Irka, Iiaura and Bir Ali) lying along the coast up to the borders of Mokalla, nor could we prevent the extension of the Imam&apos;s influence over the Hadramaut and probably Mokalla itself.11. The advantages of preserving our Protectorate over the Sultans of the Coast are somewhat problematical, but they are entitled by treaty to our protection and the Foreign Office letter assumes that these treaties should be honoured in any event. In practice, however, we should not have the means of safeguarding the coast if the Zeidis were in control of the mountain districts which cover them. The coastal tribes cannot be relied upon to make a serious defence, and their confidence in the British would be destroyed by our abandonment of the other tribes of the Protectorate. In my opinion abandonment of the remaining, &quot;northern Chiefs &quot; means in practice (though it may not in theory)&quot;abandonment of all the Protectorate except the triangle of Abdali territory and possibly a few outlying districts in the immediate vicinity of Aden.   The Zeidis would then be
established within sight of Aden. Their ruler is in close relations with a European Power from which he receives munitions of war of all descriptions, and he is also doing his best to obtain further munitions, aeroplanes included, from other Powers. His negotiations on this matter with a representative of an American firm have come to our knowledge. It seems improbable that he needs all this armament to wage war against the Idrisi or even Ibn Saud or for the preservation of his authority in his own country, and the question of the defence of the fortress of Aden under these changed conditions would need reconsideration from a military point of view. &quot;With the Imam on a frontier the defence of which is considered essential to the safety of Aden, there must be troops sufficient and ready to oppose the Zeidis on their making their first move, and this would involve an increase in the permanent garrison.To my mind therefore the question of the retention of the treaties with the northern Chiefs involves far more than mere considerations of prestige. Far from neither party losing appreciably by their termination we should lose more than prestige and the tribes on their side would lose what they value more than anything else namely their tribal independence.12. Paragraph 8 of Foreign Office letter. The question of prestige no doubt enters largely into the Imam&apos;s attitude, but he also has more definite considerations at stake. At present he holds the most fertile portions of the Protectorate from which he can extract most revenue, and he is anxious to open the road to the comparatively rich districts of the Hadramaut. He is also impelled by his historical and religious traditions and by an Arab ruler&apos;s natural impulse towards expansion to extend his rule over the whole of South-Western Arabia. He regards the British at Aden as heretic interlopers from Europe, just as he regards the Idrisi as an interloper from Africa. He is an Arab &quot; Nationalist&quot; who can never look upon any foreigners established in this part of Arabia with feelings of real frendliness. Although amour-propre is certainly an important consideration, it is by no means the only factor in the situation either with the Imam or with us. If he ultimately gives way to our claims or if he accepts a compromise with us, he will do so only because he realises that he has not the strength to do otherwise.13. Reference paragraph 9 of Foreign Office letter. I see no possibility in practice of giving a qualified recognition of the Imam&apos;s claims to portions of the Protectorate. The tribes cannot by themselves preserve a state of semi-indepen-dence against him, and there can be no dual control. Promises by the Imam of conditional non-interference are, as Major Barrett pointed out, quite illusory. We either support the tribes or we leave them to the Imam. He may for some reason hold his hand against them temporarily, but we cannot in fact work on the assumption that there is any half-way house. As for the Imam assuming our obligations to the Chiefs, our obligation is to protect them, and at present the only Power against whom they desire and crave protection is the Imam himself. I consider that no reference whatever should be made to the Imam&apos;s theoretical claim to Aden which he admits he has no intention at present of advancing seriously, and it should not in any circumstances be given any consideration or be made the subject of any kind of bargain.14. Reference paragraphs 10 and 11 of Foreign Office letter. The Foreign Office wish to discover whether there is any practical basis for a conciliatory offer to the Imam which might bring about a friendly settlement with him combined with an honourable reduction of British obligations to the Chiefs. For the reasons that I have stated I do not think that any reduction can be honourable in the present situation, nor do I think that any settlement with the Imam which does not give him the whole Protectorate can be genuinely friendly, however much it might be made to appear to be so in words. But there is one course which is more dishonourable than open repudiation of our engagements, and that is professed adherence to them coupled with an intention to disregard them in practice. Experience during the last seven years has shown that only force or a genuine threat of force will check the Zeidi advance. With a squadron of the Royal Air Force at Aden I believe that further encroachments can be prevented, and in my opinion both our honour and our interests dictate that no further encroachments should be allowed.15. . The recovery of territory that has already been lost is another matter. A military inoccupation of Dala would, I think, free the Protectorate from Zeidi intrusion, but I understand that there is no possibility of this step being taken. It is open to question whether the Royal Air Force alone can bring about an
767evacuation of Dala and the other occupied districts. The Royal Air Force do not claim this even themselves. Determined action by air over the Imam&apos;s own territory (combined possibly with naval action against his coast) might induce him to give way if continued with great intensity over a prolonged period, which is probably impracticable. If there is no hope of ever recovering the lost portion of the Protectorate, the question should be considered of telling the Chiefs concerned openly, of giving them such compensation as we can, and of offering to treat with the Imam on the basis of the status quo. The Amir of Dala would have to be pensioned off. His case is such a bad one that he should be treated most generously. The bulk of the Radfan tribes which are appanages of Dala have already submitted to the Zeidis under force majeure, as has also the Alawi Sheikh. The Audalis present a more difficult problem, for the present line of Zeidi occupation cuts them in two, leaving the Zeidis in possession of the best part of the country. Some compromise might possibly be effected here. The Yafais would have to submit to the loss of their outlying districts, which have been in Zeidi occupation for several years. There would be a serious risk that these concessions would encourage the Imam to make further encroachments; but if he were certain that these would be firmly x-esisted by us he might possibly accept and respect a boundary based on the status quo.16. Personally I have not much confidence in the stability of such an arrangement and I do not advocate it. If the Imam&apos;s country breaks up on the present ruler&apos;s death, there would be risings among all Shafei tribes, and we should find ourselves in close contact with unruly tribes still hating us for our defection and creating anarchy in the country.17. An alternative would be to continue to wait upon&apos;events. The Imanfs death may be followed by a contested succession, and an opportunity may present itself of making a settlement with a new Zeidi ruler without sacrificing the friendly Shafei tribes which wish to remain under the protection of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and an opportunity would then arise for a complete review of all our protectorate treaties.18. I consider that a definite decision of our future policy towards the Imam, and if possible a settlement with him, should precede a revision of our treaties with the tribes inside our Protectorate boundary. Meanwhile in my opinion any further encroachments in the Protectorate (with the possible exception of Behan) can be and should be, after warning issued, met by intensive and sustained Air action against the raiders and against the Imanfs troops and towns across the border until the Zeidis withdraw from the area concerned. With regard to the parts of the Protectorate already in Zeidi occupation, there are three alternatives : (1.) To demand that the Imam shall withdraw from them, at the same time threatening him with the use of force if he does not comply. This course should be adopted only if His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that they have the&apos; means to enforce their demand, and are willing to use it if need be.(2.) To adopt a waiting attitude in the hope that the course of events may produce a more favourable situation. The Imam should be addressed and the warning conveyed to him that aggression means reprisals, but that when he is prepared to come to an agreement with us on reasonable terms we shall be glad to discuss them again with him.(3.) To reopen negotiations with him on the basis of stabilising the present status quo. This will involve a withdrawal from the position taken up very definitely by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the time of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s mission to Sana&apos;a, and although the Imam will no doubt welcome the change of attitude he may at the same time look upon it as a confession of weakness and be thereby encouraged to hold out for still better terms for himself. If the negotiations were consequently to fail His Majesty&apos;s Government would find themselves in the unpleasant position of having offered to break faith with their own dependants for - the sake of the Imaufs friendship, and of having been nevertheless rebuffed. In that case they would have forfeited the confidence of their friends without any compensating advantage.19. Of these three alternatives, the first is the one indioated&apos; by our treaty obligations and by our promise to the Amir of Dala. Its adoption would not gain the friendship of the Imam, but it might gain his respect, whioh I am afraid we
do not at present possess. He will at any rate realise that the British Govern-ment is one that is prepared to honour its obligations even when it is inconvenient and troublesome to do so, and this may make him more ready to trust us in the future when once a settlement has been effected. This alternative, however, would entail long continued and violent Air action which it is unlikely that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to undertake.20. Of the other two alternatives I prefer the second. If it is adopted I consider the allowance to the exiled Amir should be still further inoreased, and he should be told frankly that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not at present prepared to use force against the Imam in order to restore him ; that he must wait until the situation is more favourable ; and that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not recognise the legality of the Zeidi occupation of his country.To sum up, I recommend: (1.) A warning to the Imam against further aggression incorporated in a friendly letter.(2.) In case of further aggression immediate intensive and extended and sustained Air action against raiders and as a reprisal on his towns and troops.(3.) Otherwise a passive attitude until the Imam sees reason, or dies and makes way for a perhaps more reasonable successor.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient servant,J. H. K. STEWART, Major-General,Political Resident, Aden.o
