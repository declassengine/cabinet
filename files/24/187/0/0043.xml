July 1927.SECRET.Copy No.      50COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 228th Meeting, held on July 7, 1927.(3.) THE GARRISON OF THE SUDAN.(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 751-B, 781-B, 800-B, 802-B, 809-B and 812-B.) (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 220th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE, in accordance with the Conclusions taken at its 220th Meeting (C.I.D. Minutes, 220th Meeting, Conclusion 2 (g)), had under consideration the following papers : (a.) The Report of an ad hoc Sub-Committee on the subject of Mahdism in theSudan (C.I.D. Paper No. 751-B). (b.) A Memorandum by the Colonial Office on the subject of Mahdism in theNorthern Province of Nigeria (C.I.D. Paper No. 781-B). (c.) Letters from the War Office and the Air Ministry on the subject of thecost of maintenance of two British Infantry Battalions and of one squadron Royal Air Force respectively in Khartoum (C.I.D. PaperNo. 800-B).(d.) A letter from the High Commissioner, Egypt, on the subject of the garrison of the Sudan (C.I.D. Paper No. 802-B). (e.) A Note by the Air Staff on the subject of the Air strength to be maintained in the Sudan (C.I.D. Paper No. 809-B). (/.) The Second Report of the ad hoc Sub-Committee (see (a) above) on thesubject of Mahdism in the Sudan (C.I.D. Paper No. 812-B).LORD LLOYD said that, if convenient to the Committee, he would make some preliminary observations on the general situation in the Sudan; and Sir John Maffey would follow with a more detailed exposition. Broadly speaking, the position was as follows : They fully recognised that it Avas necessary for the various parts of the Empire to bear their share of defence responsibility and expenditure; but they felt that, if the Sudan were required prematurely to pay out large sums of money, there was the danger of her becoming a debtor on the Imperial Exchequer. As the Committee were well aware, the Sudan was almost entirely dependent on its production of cotton; and the future was not at all clear. Thanks largely to the skill of Sir George Schuster, the financial situation showed considerable improve-ment, but it was likely to be somewhat if not very precarious for the next two or three years.  It only needed one or two bad cotton years to cause serious difficulties.As regards the garrison, they felt that the two battalions of ground troops were the primary necessity for defence. A full squadron of air force would, of course, be very welcome, but relatively it was less necessary than the ground troops. It was to be borne in mind that the Sudan Defence Force was a new force, on which it was impossible to place full reliance; and therefore the responsibility for the security of the whole lines of communication from Port Sudan to Khartum-including Atbara, the nerve centre of the whole railway system falls to the British Infantry. One full battalion, plus one company of the other battalion, were employed solely on these duties; and this left only one battalion minus a company for duty.elsewhere. The margin of safety was none too much. When full reliance could be i placed on the Sudan Defence Force, they might well be able to dispense with the services of one battalion; but it was impossible to say when this would be. rri
They agreed in principle and readily admitted that, as soon as the financial situation permitted, the Sudan Government should pay the difference between the jCftst of the maintenance of the British garrison in England and the cost of its maintenance in the Sudan.SIR JOHN MAFFEY called attention to a sentence extracted from his despatch and printed in italics in the Air Stall&apos; note* :  .&quot;So far as the situation in the Sudan is concerned, an increase in the existing strength of the air force up to one squadron cannot be regarded as a necessity, and that such latent possibilities of trouble as may exist in the country to-day would not be appropriately countered, or in any way appreciably affected, by the spectacle of aeroplanes flying over them.&quot;He did not wish a greater meaning to be attached to that sentence than the actual words implied. For instance, in saying that an air squadron was not a necessity for the Sudan, it was not meant to imply that such a squadron would not be a powerful assistance and increase confidence in every way. Similarly, the reference to the spectacle of aeroplanes flying over the native population did not mean that the Sudan Government were blind to the concrete work which aeroplanes could do in reconnaissance, in moving units of troops and in punitive action. The fact was that, with two battalions of British infantry and a flight of aeroplanes, the Sudan felt satisfied and would be pleased to leave well alone, particularly as the locating of an air squadron was bound to bring up the question of the removal of one of the British battalions; and, as at present advised, he did not consider this to be safe.Sir John Maffey called attention to. the views of the General Staff on the necessity for retaining the two battalions, and he strongly concurred with those views.People had said &quot; The Sudan was all right in the old days with one battalion; why is one battalion not enough now? &quot; This question lost sight of the fact that, in the old days, the single British battalion was associated with very efficient Egyptian battalions in the garrison, who were a loyal and essential portion of the Government fabric. There were no Egyptian battalions now since the trouble of 1924.   Indeed, their presence would be far from helpful in the present atmosphere.LORD LLOYD observed that nowadays the Sudan had a hostile Egypt behind it, and had to contend with a determined campaign on the part of the Wafd to undermine the loyalty of the Sudan Defence Force.SIR JOHN MAFFEY continuing, proceeded to expand the views of the. General Staff on the subject of the two battalions. He indicated the very powerful influence exercised by their presence over the large town populations and the intelligentsia Of Khartoum and Omdurman, the centres which played a leading part in the White Flag troubles of 1924 and the military mutiny. From these centres were supplied our telegraph and railway officials on our communications, and it seemed very important to maintain a strong central British force at this point. That force had to be strong enough not only to produce this local effect, but to supply detachments to keep open communications and to supply stiffening when necessary in remote localities.There was one point he would like to emphasise, to which sufficient attention did not appear to be paid in the papers on the subject. It was the importance of the River Nile (the White and the Blue Nile) as an easy and natural channel of communication on the ground level, enabling us to maintain communications through the heart of the country and to keep in touch with many provincial and district headquarters. Steamers could travel by night or by day without danger of opposition. Motor cars and wireless could be carried on barges and could penetrate quite easily inland. The river in fact offered such immense natural advantages that it would be a pity to reduce the infantry to a point at which we could not fully utilise them.In considering the subject of infantry in the Sudan, one must bear in mind that the population is very sparse and scattered, distances very great, and country largely covered1 with scrub and. bush. The development of any hostile movement must necessarily be slow. There was no possibility of surprise. With good political intelligence we ought to be able to take early and successful steps.   For instance, a* C.I.D. Paper No. 809-B. para. 3.
few months ago a mad Mulla, or Fiki, had started on the war path on the western borders of Darfur. As he came along he gradually collected a following of some 300 enthusiasts. We received our intelligence in Khartum by wireless and a section of the Western Arab Corps was across the &quot;path of the movement. Meanwhile a small party of police some nine men with a sergeant utilising local information, succeeded in getting in contact with the fanatical party. A few shots broke up the whole show and the Fiki himself was killed. It would be difficult to improve on this method of meeting such an emergency. Aeroplanes would be out of touch with local information and would not have the same ease in establishing contact. But it must be recognised that our present methods were rendered easy by the fact that the tribal armament was negligible, not having advanced in any way since the &apos;eighties.Sir John Maffey said that he was and always had been a most warm supporter of the Air Force, more particularly in its work on the North-West frontier of India, and perhaps he might briefly analyse the reasons why he did not see the same opportunities in the Sudan. On the North-West frontier of India the tribes lived in compact and well-known areas demarcated by valleys. The whole tribal area is not very extensive, and any part of it is accessible from aerodromes in British territory. Aeroplanes could be kept hovering with great effect over a refractory section. Moreover, on the north-west frontier, the tribes were extremely well armed and had the advantage of their knowledge by night and day of a very difficult and rugged terrain. He could see nothing parallel to these conditions in the Sudan, and felt that, if any principle could be extracted from these differing conditions, it might be this, that where we had marked and obvious superiority and facilities on the ground, it was better, at any rate in the initial stages, to meet our problems on the ground.He could only say that in the Sudan they were satisfied with the present arrange-ments and, so far as experience went at present, they would not feel it safe to replace the British battalion by an air squadron.Mr. CHURCHILL enquired what sum the Sudan Government at present expended on Defence.SIR JOHN MAFFEY replied that he thought that it was in the region of  900,000 a year.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE said that the Air Ministry did not wish to open up a controversy between the relative merits of Air force and ground troops. The Chief of the Air Staff would deal with the arguments that had been put forward by Sir John Maffey regarding the advantages of ground troops over air forces in the Sudan; but in the meanwhile there were two main questions to be answered. The. first was Who was to pay ? and the second was Should the existing flight in Khartoum be retained there? With regard to the first question, it was of course prudent to husband financial resources, but, from Sir George Schuster&apos;s own Memorandum, there appeared to him to be a good case for the Sudan to pay the difference between the cost of the maintenance of the Air unit at Home and the cost of its maintenance in Khartoum. The arguments put forward by Sir George Schuster seem to show that we in Great Britain were harder up than the. Sudan. With regard to the second question, he was inclined to think that it was advisable that the flight should be with-drawn. Sir John Maffey had paid a tribute to the work of the Air Force on the north-west frontier of India; he (Sir Samuel Hoare) was grateful for this tribute, but he was amazed when he heard him say that, whilst the mountainous country on the frontier was suitable for air action, the flat country of the Sudan was unsuitable. Sir John Maffey seemed to ignore the results achieved by the Air Force in dealing with the scattered tribes in flat country in Iraq. The detachment of a flight from its parent squadron was objectionable, both from a financial and a military point of view. He therefore suggested that the flight should be withdrawn to Egypt, and that the possibility of effecting a reduction in the infantry garrison should be examined at a later date in the light of the developments in the financial situation. &apos;K&apos;SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that the suggestion of sending a squadron to the Sudan had been due to the possibility of a Mahdist rising. When it was first mooted, the Committee of Imperial Defence had thought that the extra cost should be borne by the Sudan Government. Now, in answer, it was urged that air power!was unsuitable. Sir John. Maffey had said that the lines of communica-tion could be better patrolled, and trouble more effectively nipped in the bud by [1G376-2] n 2\
infantry than by air. This was contrary to all the conclusions which the Committee of Imperial Defence had recorded during the last few years; and it was unnecessary for him to go over old ground again. Sir John Maffey had quoted the incident of the rising which had been dealt with by a Sergeant of Police and 9 men. One aeroplane could have accomplished this, without any risk whatsoever. If the Sudan Government did not think that the air force could be used to patrol the lines of communications and to nip incipient trouble in the bud as was being done at the present time in all parts of the world, and not only by ourselves then it was clearly better that the Khartoum Plight should rejoin its parent squadron in Egypt. Incidentally, this would mean a saving of about . 10,000 a year. He had learned from the officer who had been in command of the Khartoum flight that his unit had done no visiting for political purposes, and had not been used for patrolling; and, indeed, had been given no work to do beyond taking up Army officers and others to give them air experience. Sir John Maffey had said that aeroplanes had no moral effect on the natives of the Sudan because they had not seen them in action. He would like to point out that 99 per cent, of the air patrols in Iraq never dropped a bomb. He recom-mended that the flight in Khartoum should rejoin its squadron ; more particularly as the Sudan Government were not willing to pay the difference between the cost of its maintenance at Home and the cost of its maintenance in the Sudan.Mr. CHURCHILL said that it would be deplorable if the Committee were to make a wrong decision owing either to the attitude taken up by the Sudan Government, or to the strategic modesty of the position adopted by the Air Ministry. The case should be settled on its own merits. He had listened with surprise and pain to the views of Sir John Maffey with regard to the relative advantages of infantry and air forces. At the beginning of the South African war, the War Office telegraphed to Australia :- &quot; Unmounted men preferred.&quot; If to-day the Committee were to accept the doctrine expounded by Sir John Maffej&apos;, the future would prove that they had been just as far from grasping the realities of the situation as that unfortunate telegram of twenty-five years ago. Air power had proved itself in Iraq, in spite of the solemn warnings of the General Staff. It had practically ended the trouble in Somaliland, after three or four military expeditions had failed. And yet the Sudan Government wished to pin their faith in small parties of infantry wandering about the enormous country. After all, what was the extra cost involved &apos;? In-a budget as large as that of the Sudan Government it was surety imprudent to adopt wrong methods for the sake of the extra  30,000. For his part, he felt that unquestionably a full squadron should be stationed at Khartoum, and that it should be properly employed. In the last resort he would sooner see the  30,000 paid out of the Imperial Exchequer than that a wrong and reactionary turn should be given to our methods of defence.Mr. AMERY observed that the suggestion formulated by the Committee at the meeting when this subject was first considered was that the extra expenditure involved should be paid out of the Imperial Exchequer in the form of a loan to the Sudan Government for so long as the finaucial position of the Sudan Government rendered this necessary. On the general point at issue, experience in Iraq had shown that the mobility of the Air Force was the greatest asset in an open country. Supposing the small Police party, to which Sir John Maffey had referred, had been wiped out, it would have taken a long time to get another party to the scene of trouble. If, on the other hand, an aeroplane had come down, another aeroplane could have got there in less than no time. He thought that the arguments in favour of the employment of air forces in a flat country like the Sudan, where there were any number of natural lauding grounds, were; over-whelming.SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EYANS said that he desired to1 draw attention to the financial aspect of the question. The War Office haul two battalions, and certain other units, in the Sudan; and they were being paid nothing towards their maintenance. All that Lord Lloyd now suggest/ed was that the Sudan Government should, at a later date, pay the difference between the cost of their maintenance at Home and the cost of their mainten/ance in the Sudan. He noticed from the third Enclosure to Lord Lloyd&apos;s Riespatch (C.I.D. Paper No. 802-B) that the financial position in the Sudani showed appreciable surpluses. He also noticed that these surpluses weire being used for capital purposes.   But this was no reason why they should &apos; not bear
their share of Defence expenditure. He suggested that the payment of merely the difference in maintenance costs should not be regarded as a final arrangement, but that ultimately the Sudan should be called upon to pay the full cost of the battalions maintained there in the same way as was done in many other Colonies.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that the Chancellor had made a fair and reasonable financial proposal, which he had accepted. If it were approved, the Sudan Government would be responsible for the cost of the initial expenditure involved in the establishment of the necessary Air bases in the Sudan, and for the difference between the cost of the maintenance of the Squadron in the Sudan and the cost of its maintenance at Home. At the same time it must be recognised that the Sudan Government could not undertake this expenditure immediately. The debt would have to be carried forward. The finances of the Sudan were now in an orderly condition: but taxation was high, and everything depended on the cotton crop. One bad crop would mean the upsetting of the financial equilibrium. He had welcomed the Chancellors suggestion because he felt that the Sudan Government had not yet appreciated what had been done by the Air Force in other parts of the world, or what ought to be done by them. The Air Ministry had said that no effort had been made to utilise the Flight in the Sudan. In view of the fact that the Air-Force had proved pre-eminently efficacious in Iraq, he could not believe that they could have no utility in the Sudan. He, therefore, suggested that a full squadron of air force should be sent there, and used as it ought to be used; and that the whole question of the Sudan garrison should be re-examined next year. If this were decided, it was essential that the Air Force should send a real exponent of the use of Air power to the Sudan, and that the Sudan Government should thoroughly test it out for their own purposes. There was no need for them to give a definite acceptance until they had given it a fair trial.SIR JOHN MAFFEY said that he would gladly accept this proposal. He would have regarded the withdrawal of the existing flight with misgiving. The point he had wished to make was that, with the present garrison they feit safe, whereas if there was a induction in the infantry, they had felt that they would not be safe.He added that it was not quite correct to say that there were unlimited landing grounds in the Sudan. There was a lot of bush country, in which it would be very difficult to locate people from the air.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that, if the suggestion commended itself to the Committee, he wrould discuss its political side with Sir John Maffey : and perhaps Sir John would discuss the military side with the Air Ministry.LORD LLOYD agreed with the proposal, but asked that the financial, side of the question should be reserved.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE said that there was a practical question to be settled, the question of the buildings. He assumed that their cost would go into the loan.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend: That the efficacy of Air forces in relation to the defence requirements of the Sudan should be given a fair and thorough trial; that, for this purpose, a complete Squadron of Royal Air Force should be located in the Sudan for a period of one year; that, at the end of this&apos; period, the whole, question of the garrison of the Sudan should be re-examined; and that the financial adjustments should be reserved for arrangement between the Governments and Government Departments concerned.* * * * *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,   .

The Committee had, as a basis for consideration, a note on the recent history of Mahdism prepared by the Sudan Government and submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Foreign Office in C.I.D. Paper 697-B.2. To assist in the examination of the question the views of Major-General H. J. Huddleston, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.C., General Officer Commanding in the Sudan, were called for.   A copy of his reply is attached as Appendix A.Advantage was also taken of the presence in England of : A. J. C. Huddleston, Esq., O.B.E. (Governor of Blue Nile Province, Sudan), R. Davis, Esq. (Director of Intelligence, Sudan),Colonel F. P. Nosworthy, D.S.O., M.C. (Chief Staff Officer. Sudan Defence Force), and these officials gave the Committee the benefit of their views.The Degree of Danger to be Anticipated.3. In estimating the degree of danger to be anticipated from a Mahdist rising, the Committee took into consideration the following factors which were brought out in the evidence submitted to them : (a) The area of the Sudan is large (over 1,000,000 square miles), the people primitive, scattered and ill-armed, and communications are long and difficult. Concerted action on a large and organized scale is, therefore, difficult, and it is almost inconceivable that such action .could be taken without adequate warning being given.(b26/18)   100   12/2g   w.o.p.   292u
( ) The population of the Sudan is not homogeneous. It consists for the most part ol Arabs, negroes and a mixture of the two which calls itself Arab but is in fact negroid. The Arabs and negroids are all Mohammedans and the negroes mostly pagans. The main distribution of these races is shown on the map attached as Appendix C, but it is to be remembered that the area on the west of Darfur which is coloured blue on this map is inhabited by Mohammedan negroids.A Mahdist rising, in so far as it remained religious in character, would from its nature be confined to the Arab element and would, in itself, excite no sympathy whatever among the pagan tribes.The central focal point of the movement may be said to be at Abba Island, the place from which the original Mahdi started his campaign, and which is now the estate of his son, Abdel Rahman el Mahdi. This island is on the White Nile, about 150 miles south of, and, therefore, within striking distance of Khartoum.Isolated groups of potentially fanatical Mahdists within easy reach of this island, some of the riverain tribes of the White Nile, and a proportion of the inhabitants of the Gezira lying between the two branches of the river would be, if not actively hostile to us, at least benevolently inclined towards a Mahdist rising. The really militant section of potential Mahdists, however, are the tribes inhabiting the southern districts of the pro-vinces of Darfur and Kordofan, shown hachured on the map (Appendix C). It is to this area that one would look for the first outbreak of any large disturbance, but the collection . and movement of a force large enough seriously to threaten Khartoum would take a considerable time.The remaining sections of the population, especially those lying north of an east and west line through Khartoum, are considered unlikely to be affected, except in the improbable event of an outbreak in the west being completely and undoubtedly successful.(c) A general Mahdist rising might materialise as a spontaneous outburst of serious and widespread discontent, or might be stirred up on the inspiration of a Mahdi who would assume personal control in the field. The present head of the movement, Abdel Rahman, is unsuited by nature to this latter role, and is unlikely to assume it without strong inducements. The favourable social position which he has reached is based entirely on British support, to which, hitherto, he has displayed loyalty. If his ambition were to become ruler of the Sudan, it is considered improbable that he would, for choice, pursue unconstitutional methods to gain that end ; but there is always the possibility of his hand being forced by his followers, or of his being encouraged to make a change of front by signs of weakening of British control. In the opinion of the local authorities consulted, these contingencies are unlikely at the present time.The above considerations lead the Committee to believe that a general Mahdist rising such as would endanger our supremacy would only be likely to materialize as the result of widespread and serious discontent in the country, and that the best and surest safe-guard against any such contingency is the maintenance of tbe administration of the country on sound lines.The Mahdist movement at present is a political rather than a military problem.4. From the evidence referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the conclusions of the Committte in regard to the imminence or otherwise of the Mahdist danger may be summarized as follows : (a) The chances of a Mahdist outbreak on any scale other than that of sporadicrisings of a minor nature, are at present remote.(b) Ample warning of such an outbreak would be received, and time thereby givenfor taking the measures necessary to meet it.(c) The avoidance of the danger of an outbreak is a question of sound administrationrather than one of military preparation.(d) No Mahdist outbreak is likely to become a serious military danger unlessaccompanied by revolt of the Native Sudan troops, i.e., the Sudan Defence Force, to which reference will be made in the following paragraph.Military Considerations.5. In considering the military aspect of the situation, the Committee made a thorough examination of the question of tbe garrison from the point of view of its strength, corn-position, and suitability to carry out its functions both in peace and in the event of internal trouble.The garrison, as at present constituted, consists of two elements, the Imperial and ihe Sudanese.
1 Present strength, 1,733 all ranks,with a small complement of non-combatant services.The British Army troops are concentrated at Khartoum, with permanent detachments at Atbara and El Obeid. There is a summer station at Gebeit, on the hills between Atbara and Port Sudan.The Royal Air Force flight, consisting of 4 bombing aeroplanes and 24 British personnel, is on detachment from Euypt.   Tt was sent to Khartoum in 1924.The Sudanese element, is furnished by the Suiian Delence Force, a native organiza-tion with a proportion of British officers. It is recruited from both Arab and negro sources, and has an existing strength of 7,091 all ranks. It is, however, being gradually reduced to a total of 5,83(5 all ranks. This reduction is being made largely on financial grounds, bur. its complete execution i* dependent on the maintenance of a stable situation in the country.The Sudan Defence Force is distributed throughout the country, the several units being allotted to the different districts into which the country is divided for purposes of defence.6. Before reviewing the roles lor which the forces are designed, it is considered by the Committee advisable to emphasise reductions which have already been made in the strength of the Sudan garrison.Before the murder of Sir Lee Stack in 1924 and the subsequent withdrawal from the Sudan of all Egyptian Army units, the combined Egyptian and Sudanese strength in the Sudan was roughly 13,000 with, in addition, one battalion of British infantry which was stationed at Khartoum.The strength now contemplated (if and when the Sudan Defence Force reductions are completed) will bo about 7,570 British and Sudanese combined.In the opinion of the Committee an immediate further reduction, beyond that already contemplated and referred to in the previous paragraph, would involve an undue risk not only from the military but also from the political point of view. The political implication would undoubtedly be that the Sudanese might interpret further reductions in the fighting capacity of the garrison as a weakening of British control.7. The present role of the British garrison is to safeguard the centre of government and the white population at Khartoum, to protect the railway line of communication to the base and the base itself at Port Sudan, and to provide a stiffening and support to the Sudan Defence Force.The role of the Sudan Defence Force is to support the administration in main-taining the internal security of the country and to deal with raids from Abyssinia or the Western deserts.The Imperial forces are composed of Detachment of Royal Artillery ... 2 battalions British infantry 1 flight Royal Air Force,Views of the Air Staff.S. The Air Staff submitted a note for the consideration of the Committee (attached as Appendix B).The views of the Air Staff, as presented to the Committee, regarding the best method of dealing with the problem, are summarized in this and succeeding paragraphs.(a) The problem of safeguarding the Sudan is chiefly one of preventing a Mahdist outbreak, possibly combined with a simultaneous spread of disaffection in the Sudan Defence Force. The value of aircraft to the civil administration has been proved in Iraq, and would be equally effective in the Sudan. Periodic visits by military aircraft to all administrative areas and outlying garrisons of the Sudan Defence Force would provide an insurance against the spread of Mahdism and revolt of local troops. Aeroplanes which can be frequently seen on the spot are a more convincing proof of British occupation than are Imperial troops hundreds of miles away.(b) An adequate air organization in constant use is essential to achieve this end. A system of landing grounds throughout the Sudan would be necessary, with sufficient aeroplanes at Khartoum to ensure, by local visits, that the organization was efficiently maintained. The main landing grounds would be at those localities where garrisons of the Sudan Defence Force exist.When these measures have been taken, the Capacity of the aircraft to concentrate rapidly in any part of the country would largely prevent the spread of unrest.(2si2g) a 2
(c) The issue raised by the General Officer Commanding, Sudan (paragraph 10, Appendix A) that air forces would be unable to operate with their landing grounds in enemy hands, clearly applies to the stage of operations where a revolt has become wide-spread and successful, and re-occupation has become necessary. In all operations on such a scale, the use of territory in enemy hands is denied, but in the Sudan, during the initial stages, should disaffection among local troops be slowly spreading, these conditions would not apply. The use of aircraft enables personal touch to be maintained with garrisons which include malcontents, and rapid and drastic offensive can be taken should the situation demand. The influence of the disloyal is thereby greatly countered and a possible outbreak forestalled.(d) By organizing air bases and landing grounds in the Sudan, rapid reinforcement in time of emergency by aircraft from Egypt, Palestine, or Iraq, and their effective use on arrival becomes practicable. The security of the Sudan would then depend, not only on the forces available locally, but on other air forces maintained in the Middle East.The existing single flight of aeroplanes at Khartoum is insufficient to ensure throughout the country the maintenance of an adequate air organization, by which alone the full operational value of reinforcing aircraft can be attained.9. For the foregoing reasons, the Air Staff consider that the best means of safe-guarding the Sudan is to station one squadron of bombing aeroplanes at Khartoum, and to organize a system of landing grounds throughout the country. The existing air unit is insufficient for this purpose.Should financial (or other) considerations preclude an addition to the existing Imperial garrison in the Sudan, this increase in air strength can only be attained by substituting an air for an army unit.10. The Air Staff consider that in view of: (1) The remoteness of the danger of Mahdist outbreak or of revolt in the Sudan Defence Force ;(2) The superior ability of aircraft as compared with army troops to prevent and todeal rapidly with incipient trouble ; (3) The other advantages dealt with in paragraph 8 above ;the replacement of British infantry by aircraft would confer a greater degree of security than does the existing garrison.11. In amplification of this view the following observations are submitted by the Air Staff :-(a) The problem of the Sudan has a certain similarity to that of Iraq, from which all Imperial troops are shortly to be withdrawn ; the garrison will then consist of Air Force units and local troops with British officers. The Iraq Army is primarily maintained for purposes of internal security ; apart from raids and sporadic outbreaks, which are common to both countries, the probability of a general uprising of the populace against the Government is certainly not less in Iraq than in the Sudan. If such an upheaval occurred, the loyalty of Iraq troops is even more liable to be affected than that of the Sudanese, since in the Iraq Army the proportion of British officers is less, and the British have not, as in the Sudan, full executive powers.(6) The necessity for counterpoise of British to native troops has been accepted as essential in India. In Iraq, the stiffening effect is obtained by the free use of aircraft. In the Sudan, provided the Defence Force is efficient and at least one squadron of aeroplanes is in the country, the Air Staff consider that the necessity for counterpoise by British infantry is even less than in Iraq.(c) The danger area lies south and west of Khartoum ; the line of communications from Port Sudan is remote from this area, and the spread of revolt is likely to be slow.It seems unnecessary to retain permanently in the Sudan a British infantry battalion whose chief purpose is to protect these communications in the unlikely event of an outbreak of Mahdism. The ample warning available, the proximity of Port Sudan to British garrisons in other countries, and the comparatively small number of troops required to guard this line should enable the measures necessary for security to be taken before any danger arises.12. The Air Staff recommendations may, therefore, be summarized as follows : (a) When the air organization advocated is complete, it will ultimately be found possible to withdraw both the British battalions from the Sudan.4^b) During an intermediate stage and while the new organization is being perfected, one battalion should be retained.
(c) It is desirable, if other conditions permit, that the squadron of aeroplanes and the landing grounds should be rally established in the Sudan before even one battalion departs. The existing strength of British infantry would thus temporarily be unaltered.13. The Air Staff also point out that Khartoum will be an air base on an important route, required both for strategical and civil aviation purposes. This will in itself necessitate some initial expenditure on improving the existing facilities, whatever decision may be reached as to the composition of the British garrison.Views of the General Staff.14. The General Staff views on these proposals were presented verbally to the Committee by the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence, and were to the following effect : (a) If the solution of the problem was based on the timely arrival of reinforcements, there could be no question that the Royal Air Force was the arm most suited to rapid x-einforcement. Reinforcements of Army units arriving by sea and land routes (which would not necessarily come from Egypt) might be a matter of weeks reinforcements of Royal Air Force units could arrive in a few days or even hours.The first point, therefore, to ensure is that the seat of Government and its communications with the outer world are maintained secure during the period anterior to the arrival of such reinforcements as are considered necessary.(6) In the opinion of the General Staff the force required to secure Khartoum and to deal with trouble in that city and in Omdurman is at least one infantry battalion the only type of unit really suitable for the purpose. As regards the protection of the railway to Port Sudan, the first place to secure is Atbara, the vital centre for the whole railway system, with workshops and a considerable European population. There is also here an important railway bridge to be protected, and it is the one place in the Sudan where there is a danger of labour trouble developing.The importance of these two places postulates the employment of only such troops as are completely reliable, and the General Staff consider that British infantry is the arm best suited to meet requirements. Although two battalions may be slightly more than the minimum force required for these duties, one battalion is definitely insufficient, and, in view of the obvious objections to quartering only part of a second battalion in the Sudan, they are not prepared to recommend a reduction beyond the present two battalions.(c) There is a further element of danger which emphasises the need for maintaining a British garrison of adequate strength.Amongst the native officers of the Sudan Defence Force there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction, which is due mainly to the feeling that the reduc-tions in the force have diminished their chances of promotion, and to the belief, encouraged from Egypt, that if they had retained their position as officers of an Egyptian Army freed from British contaol, the highest posts would have been open to fchem. This dissatisfaction is one which time and careful administration alone can allay. Meantime, it constitutes, a potential source of danger, which might be stirred up by anti-British intrigue from Egypt.The mutiny of 1924 can be cited as an instance of what might occur again, and the situation appears to the General Staff to bear at least some resemblance to that which obtained in India in 185S. It will be remembered that the Peel Commission, appointed in that year, laid down the proportion which the British garrison in India should bear to the strength of the Indian Army, and a fixed proportion, which has varied slightly from time to time, has ever since then been maintained as a fundamental principle of policy. Whilst the General Staff have never been asked to suggest the proper propor-tion of British to Sudanese troops in the Sudan, they nevertheless think that the principle of &quot; counterpoise &quot; cannot be disregarded. It has undoubtedly a stabilizing effect in ordinary times, and in the event of serious internal trouble arising, it is essential to have on the spot British troops to whom the
Government can turn in the last resort. It appears to the General Staff that infantry is the arm best suited effectively to carry out the role indicated. (d) Taking all the above factors into considerrtion, the General Staff are of opinion that the present garrison is probably sufficient and suitable to cope with an outbreak due to JIahdism. They would, however, welcome an increase in the air forces, as recommended by the Air Staff, as giving still further guarantee of security. They further agree with the conclusions arrived at by the General Officer Commanding, Sudan, that in the worst possible situation  wide internal trouble combined with defection of a large portion of the Sudan Defence Force reinforcements from Egypt or elsewhere would be necessary to meet the situation.15. In comparing the problems of Iraq and the Sudan the General Staff was unable to agree entirely with the views advanced by the Air Staff referred to in paragraph 11 above.   Their view of the position may be summarised as follow : In Iraq the Royal Air Force was established in supreme control and in substitution of part of a military force which was already in process of reduction. The Imperial Army troops which were withdrawn were, however, partially replaced by the Iraq Levies and by the Iraq Army, both indigenous forces which are available to assist the Royal Air Force in maintaining the security of the country. The Imperial military forces and the above Iraq troops amount, at the moment, to 19,500 officers and men.The position in the Sudan in this respect is not quite the same. The country is more than six times as large as Iraq, and there are less than half the number of troops to guard it. There is not, therefore, the same margin for reduction as there was originally in Iraq.The military problems in the two countries are not similar. In Iraq, where the maintenance of an Imperial force is only a temporary measure, that force is designed to assist the Iraq Government and forces in the defence of their country until the country is capable of undertaking its own defence. The native Iraq forces do not, presumably, therefore, constitute in themselves a potential source of danger to their own State, as their interests must lie in the maintenance of peaceful conditions in that State. No counterpoise of British as opposed to native forces, therefore, comes into the question.In the Sudan the Government is, from the point of view of the population, alien, and the military problem is mainly an internal one ; in view of the actual occurrence of a mutiny in 1924, the possibility of further disloyalty on the part of the native forces cannot be ignored, and the maintenance of a due proportion of British troops appears to be a necessary precaution.In this connection, the danger latent in the present political condition of Egypt must not be lost sight of. It is difficult to believe that any serious anti-British agitation in Egypt would not be reflected in some similar disturbance in the Sudan.16. The views of the General Staff may be summarised as follows : (a) The security of Khartoum and of the railway joining it to Port Sudan is of prime importance, and must be entrusted to British infantry.(b) A counterpoise of British infantry as against Sudanese troops is necessary.(c) The problem of  secimty in Iraq and  the   Sudan are not in all respectssimilar.(d) No reduction in British infantiy is possible at present.(e) An increase of air forces in the Sudan up to one squadron is cleshwble.(/) No reduction is possible in the Sudan Defence Force beyoud that already con--   templated.17. The Committee considered the views submitted by the Air Staff and the General Staff and took note also of tbe financial aspects of the question, which, although not falling strictly within the scope of the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, cannot be ignored. The Committee understand that at present the Imperial Exchequer bears the cost of main-taining the Imperial garrison, but that the question has been raised of a transfer of the cost to the Sudan.Sir George Schuster represented this aspect of the matter as follows : That the question of finance was of primary importance and could not be ignored, even if the extra cost did not at first fall on the Sudan, as His Majesty&apos;s Government might subsequently insist on the Sudan paying the cost of the whole British force (which was, indeed, already being urged). If this were done it would be impossible for the Sudan to meet so heavy a charge from its present revenues, and it would then be necessary to reduce the force again.
The political effects of reducing the British force would be bad, and the greater the extent-of the reduction the worse they would be. Unless, therefore, it was (mite certain that any increase now made could be maintained, it was a matter for serious consideration whether it would not be wiser to do without it.The alternative of raising more money by taxation could not safely be considered, as taxation in the Sudan was already extremely high, and to increase it would increase just those dangers the prevention of which the Committee were discussing.The Sudan financial position was at present precarious because : (a) The continuance of the Egyptian annual contribution of  E.750,000 could notbe relied on.(b) Financial results were very grea&apos; ly dependent on the success of the large cottonirrigation scheme, just inaugurated, in which  13,000,000 was invested. Fluctuations in the yield and price of cotton made this very speculative.It was impossible to foresee the future a-? to these two factors, but after a reasonable period say five years, it might be possible to assess in a more reliable manner the financial strength of the country, and it might then be justifiable to reconsider the whole position. It appeared extremely improbable, however, that the Sudan would, at least within the visible future, be able to bear on its own revenues so heavy a burden as the cost of two British battalions and a squadron Royal Air Force, together with that of its native army.Any difficulty as regards the increased cost would, of course, not arise if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to decide that the maintenance of a squadron Royal Air Force and an Air base at Khartoum were desirable for Imperial reasons, and, therefore, that the cost should be met from the Imperial Exchequer.Conclusions of the Committee.18. From the evidence received and the arguments adduced the Committee were impressed with the undoubted value of an increase in the air strength in the Sudan.They appreciated the fact that, with the one flight now in the Sudan, it would be impossible to organise and maintain ground establishments, landing grounds, &amp;c, on the scale which the Air Staff&quot; considered advisable both for normal times, and also to enable full value to be obtained from reinforcing units in times of emergency.They were also impressed with the Air Staff view of the stabilizing effect which would be produced on the population by the more frequent visits of aeroplanes to the outlying portions of the Sudan, which would become possible with an increase in the air forces.Taking all these factors into consideration the Committee were forced to the conclusion that an increase of the air force from one flight to one squadron would be an undoubted advantage from all points of view, but that this increase must, in the first instance, be in addition to, and not in substitution of, the units of the British Army now stationed in the Sudan. The possibility of withdrawing any of the British infantry subsequently can be considered at a later date, if and when the situation in Egypt and the Sudan merits a further review being made of the military requirements of the latter country.19. Summarised, the conclusions arrived at by the Committee are as follows : (a) The chances of a Mahdist outbreak on any scale, other than that of sporadicrisings of a minor nature, are at present remote.(b) Ample warning of such an outbreak would be received, and time thereby givenfor taking the measures necessary to meet it.(c) The avoidance of the danger of an outbreak is a question of sound administrationrather than one of military preparation.(d) No Mahdist outbreak is likely to become a serious military danger, unlessaccompanied by revolt of the Sudan Defence Force.(e) A further reduction of the Sudan Defence Force, beyond that already anticipated,would involve an undue risk and should not be undertaken. (/) The existing strength of the British garrison should not be reduced for the present.(g) An increase in the strength of the Royal Air Force from one flight to one com-plete squadron, and the establishment of an organized system of landing&apos; grounds throughout the Sudan, would be advantageous, and is recommended from an operational point of view.
But if there is any possibility that the Sudan Government may have now or at any future date to bear the cost of this increase, then its advantages would have to be weighed very carefully against the possible adverse effects of the extra charge on the Sudan revenues, either by way of increase in taxation or reduction in other services. The Committee has regarded this question as outside the scope of its terms of reference, and considers that unless the Sudan Government can be guaranteed against this extra cost, then the question ought to be referred to it for consideration before any decision is taken. The Committee recognize the force of the contention put forward by Sir George Schuster that there would be serious danger latent in the position if the Sudan Government were to increase its British garrison to a strength which it might be forced later, for financial reasons and without any military justification, to reduce. (A) If the increase in the Air Force vecommended in the preceding paragraph is made, then the question of the composition of the garrison of the Sudan should be reviewed after such increase had had time to make itself felt.J.

HTJDDLESTON, Major-General,Commanding Troops in the Sudan.NOTES ON THE POSSIBILITY OF A MAHDIST RISING IN THE SUDAN NECESSITATING THE EMPLOYMENT OF EXTERNAL REINFORCEMENTS.1. General Situation.The attached map&quot; shows (a) Present distribution of units of the Sudan Defence Force (vide also Table A).(b) Landing grounds which have been prepared throughout the country.(c) Location and approximate limits of the zone of country which is occupied by tribes whichmay be said to be particularly liable to Mahdist influence.The strength of the British forces in the country is given in Table B. This force is concentrated at Khartoum, with the exception of 1 company at El Obeid.1 company at Atbara.1 company (approx.) possibly at Gebeit.t2. The military aspect of Mahdism.The headquarters or &quot; holy place &quot; of the Madhist cult is Abba Island, a bare, low-lying island some 25 miles long by 2 to 3 miles broad on the White Nile about 150 miles south of Khartoum.Isolated groups of potentially fanatical Mahdists (e.g., the Aulad Seleim between Kosti and Renk, and the Kinana, south of singapore), exist within easy reach of this island, but the really militant section of the cult may be said to be confined to the area which is shown hachured in black on the attached map, and which is inhabited by mainly Baggara Arabs.In addition it may be expected that the riverain tribes of the White Nile and a certain proportion of the inhabitants of the Gezira, would be benevolently inclined towards any Mahdist rising and might be induced to participate actively in it should it look like being successful.It is almost impossible to estimate the numbers which the Mahdi could rally to his standard if a serious revolt were intended. The following factors, however, set certain limitations and should be borne in mind : (a) A general Mahdist rising postulates the presence of a Mahdi, who will come openly into thefield, assume personal control, and be prepared to lead his men in battle. These are not the characteristics of the present head of the Mahdist movement who is no warrior. Therefore, although sporadic outbursts headed by local &quot; flkis&quot; impatient for &quot;&apos;the day &quot; are not improbable, it is considered that any concerted rising on a large scale is most unlikely at present.(b) It is almost inconceivable that adequate  warning of impending trouble would not be forthcoming. Moreover, even if the rising had initial success and the adherents of the Mahdi over-ran the provinces of Darfur and Kordofan, the collection of a large army within striking distance of Khartoum would of necessity be a matter of months.(c) Unless units of the Sudan Defence Force or local police join the revolt, the armament of theMahdi&apos;s followers would be limited practically entirely to spears. The few rifles available consist of old French (Gras 1874) or Remington patterns ; effective range not more than 200 yards. Moreover, the supply of ammunition is very limited. Such stocks as exist are very old and usually home-made.* Not reproduced.t A rest camp on the Atbara Port Sudan railway, about 100 miles from Port Sudan ; only-occupied from March to November.(2926) &quot; b
id(d) The Mahdi&apos;a influence among the natives of the Sudan is by no means unchallenged. Certain tribe3 would hold aloof; others would be definitely opposed to him. In particular, it can be reckoned tbat the inhabitants of the area north of a line drawn east and west through Khartoum, would show no signs of unrest until a Mahdist revolt in the west had been completely and undoubtedly successful. Even in tbat event they would probably remain unaffected unless aroused by prospects of loot or strong anti-British agitation from the north. This means that our lines of communication from Port Sudan, or down the Nile, would be tolerably seiure.3. In -view of these considerations, I am of the opinion that a Mahdist rising on any large scale could never materialize or succeed unless it were aided by a simultaneous revolt on the part of units of the Sudan Defence Force garrisoning the areas affected.4. The problem under consideration, i.e., &quot; What arrangements should be made for dealing &quot;with an outbreak of Mahdism which would be beyond the powers of my existing [resources,&quot; therefore presupposes defection of a large portion of tbe Sudan Defence Force.5. In that event, subsequent operations would fall naturally into two distinct phases : (a) Concentration for tho defence of Khartoum and maintenance of the line of communicationuntil opportunity offered for a decisive defeat of the enemy&apos;s forces in the field. (6) Operations for the reoccupation of the lost provinces.6. As regards (a), although much must depend upon circumstances as they arise, it would appear that my most probable dispositions would be as follows : (i) Maintenance of lines of communication to Port Sudan 1 British company......      ...      ...   Atbara.* ............Gebeit.............   Port Sudan (possibly).Railway patrols (Lewis guns) on 15 motor trolleys, which are now on order.(ii) Concentration of remainder of my forces at Khartoum, including British detachment now atEl Obeid.7. If reinforcements from abroad become available, the first infantry battalion to arrive would take over the line of communication from Port Sudan to Khartoum and, if possible, establish a garrison at Kassala.The remainder would concentrate at Khartoum.8. As I have already stated in other Memoranda on the subject of Internal Security in the Sudan, in my opinion the maximum reinforcements necessary to enable me to cope with the worst possible situation which I can foresee, are troops sufficient to complete my command up to 1 infantry brigade (4 infantry battalions).1 pack battery, R.A.1 armoured car company.Plus necessary auxiliary services.To these I would now add Royal Air Force reinforcements (vide paragraph 9).With this force I am confident I could take the field successfully ?gainst any force with which the enemy could oppose me. My operations would be limited to the vicinity of railway or river, but this would not preclude the capture of Abba Island, which, unless retaken by the enemy, would undoubtedly have a disastrous, if not decisive, effect on his cause.9. As regards the assistance which the Air Forces could give, the supposition that the Sudan Defence Force has become disloyal entails the assumption that all landing grounds to the south of Khartoum would be in hostile hands. Air operations would therefore be limited in the initial stages of the campaign to the maximum radius of action of machines from Khartoum. Within this area, however, their action should be very effective. Enemy concentrations should offer large conspicuous ^targets.   Moreover, Abba Island could be rendered practically uninhabitable.I estimate that two squadrons, Royal Air Force, would be the maximum force required for this work.10. Whilst, however, it is probable that such an air force could so harass and disorganize the enemy that he would find it exceedingly difficult if not impossible, to concentrate and advance in any large strength against Khartoum, I do not consider that its employment would reduce the number of ground troops ultimately required. Operations by the Royal Air Force would be strictly limited until other landing grounds could be re-established. This in itself demands the employment of considerable ground forces, an aerodrome being by its very nature a difficult object to defend. Moreover, after the defeat of the enemy&apos;s main forces, the reoccupation of the lost provinces would have to be undertaken. This would entail a systematic advance carried out primarily by ground forces. Owing to lack of communications and transport considerations, it is probable that columns of loyal native troops would have to be organized and employed, these being stiffened as necessary by a small complement of British troops. All this would take time. Air force co-operating with these columns would be of the greatest assistance, and would greatly accelerate their progress. But I do not consider independent action on their part could in any way obtain the desired result.

British Troops in the Sudan.
NOTE BY THE AIR STAFF ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF AIR FORCES.1. In discussing &quot; tho arrangements for dealing with any outbreak of Mahdism in the Sudan and to make recommendations as to the best means of safeguarding the position in that region&quot;, it is necessary to investigate how to prevent this outbreak rather than suppressing it, and this involves considering the peace-time garrison.The value of aircraft in Iraq has been clearly proved as an efficient and economical aid to the civil administration. Incipient trouble can be prevented from coming to a head by means of air demonstration and warnings, while the organization and upkeep of landing grounds throughout the country permits the swift conveyance by air of political officers to centres of potential disturbances. The loyalty of wavering tribes and of native troops is strengthened by periodic visits of aircraft.These characteristics of aircraft as a preventative measure are equally, if not more, applicable to the Sudan. The enormous distances to be covered in a country seven times the size of Iraq preclude rapid movement by means other than air ; the Sudan, being in a more settled state than Iraq, does not, however, call for so large an air garrison.2. If one squadron of aeroplanes were stationed in Khartoum, with landing grounds throughout the Sudan, and if an organization were established whereby the full political and operational advantages conferred by freedom of movement could be reaped, the Air Staff are of the opinion that the probability of any concerted outbreak would be very greatly decreased. If the trouble did arise, it could be dealt with in the early stages by air action, and the prospect of an initial Mahdist success would be considerably less.3. The Air Staff feel convinced that the security of the Sudan should not be regarded as an isolated problem. In order to reap full advantage from the mobility of aircraft, the situation must be considered in relation to the air forces available in Egypt, Palestine and Iraq.The organization of air bases and landing grounds throughout the Sudan will permit rapid reinforcement by air whenever the situation demands. Bombing aircraft could reach Khartoum in two days from Cairo or four days from Iraq : garrisons for the lines of communication could, if required, be conveyed in troop-carrier machines.A system of air control in the Sudan would depend for its strength not only on a local garrison in the area itself, but on the ability to move other Near Eastern air forces into the Sudan whenever the situation demanded.4. Ample warning is likely to be available of any Mahdist outbreak. Long before it can come to a head, the air strength in the Sudan can be largely reinforced, and the deterrent to an armed rising correspondingly increased. Further, troops can be moved rapidly by air to garrison posts on the line of communication between Port Sudan and Khartoum. Therefore, there does not seem any real necessity to maintain British battalions in the Sudan in peace, if the Sudanese troops are efficient and have a proportion of British officers.5. The Air Staff are of the opinion that the best method of dealing with the question referred to in the terms of reference would be to : (a) Station one squadron of bombing aeroplanes at Khartoum and organise a system throughoutthe country whereby free movement by air can be ensured.(b) Retain the Sudanese Defence Force, with British officers.Under such a system, the air forces in Egypt and Iraq would be available to reinforce the Sudan in an emergency, and on this power the ultimate security of the country would rest.6. As an intermediate measure, pending completion of the scheme outlined in paragraph 5 above, the Air Staff advocate the following measures : (a) Replace the existing flight of aircraft, on detachment from Egypt, by one squadron of bombers, and organize landing grounds throughout the country. (6) Remove one battalion of British infantry.Air Staff,11th October, 1926.APPENDIX B.

Memorandum by the Colonial Office.It must always be remembered in considering the Mohammedan religious move-ments in Africa that communication between Nigeria and the Sudan has been fairly close throughout the whole period of history. Apart from the fact that some tribes in the north of Nigeria cherish a tradition of having come from the east, and believe that some day they will return there, there has always been a considerable pilgrimage to Mecca. The Sultan of Sokoto (Sarkin Musulmi) has always been an important personage in the Moslem world, and in former days was said to. have ranked third in the Islamic hierarchy after the Caliph. It is, therefore, only natural that there should have been intercourse between Moslems in Egypt and the Sudan, and their co-religionists in the Emirates of Northern Nigeria. At the time of the great Mahdist movement in the Sudan (1880-1898) the Mahdi had a regular representative (Khalifa) in the west who hovered about round the north of Nigeria and in the Northern Provinces. This representative was Mallam Hayatu, who belonged to the ruling house of Sokoto. Associated with him was an individual called Mallam Jibrella, who is described by Mr. Lethem, Resident of Bornu Province, as &quot; a fanatic Mahdist.&quot; Hayatu in 1899 attached himself to the freebooter Rabeh (who had also been associated with the Mahdi in the Sudan) and followed him for a time. Later Hayatu revolted against Rabeh, and was killed by Rabeh&apos;s son ; Jibrella continued to create trouble until 1902, when he was captured after a small fight, and interned at Lokoja. After his capture, his followers bolted eastwards, and Mr. Lethem points out that &quot; nearly every one of the Fellata who have from time to time given trouble to the Sudan Government in the Mahdist and similar outbreaks has turned out to be one of the refugees from the followers of either Hayafcu Or Jibrella.&quot; When the ex-Sultan of Sokoto in 1903 determined to stand and fight against our. troops at Burmi, lie was almost certainly acting under persuasion of the Mahdist remnant. After Burmi, migration eastwards received a considerable stimulus for a time, probably from dislike of our rule and annoyance at our suppression-sion of slave-dealing and similar reforms, but it afterwards died down. The locality of these troubles was the south-western part of Bornu Province, the western part of Kano Province, and the eastern part of Bauchi, a matter which has some significance in that the events of 1923-4 occurred in the same area. [158801SECRET. 781-B.
Iu the early part of 11)23 the activities of Mallam Sa&apos;id Ibri liayatu began to draw the attention of the Resident at Bornu. Sa&apos;id was a son of Hayatu himself and was the great-great-grandson of Othman Ibn Fodio, the founder of the Fulani Empire about1800.Sa&apos;id had arrived in Bornu about the end of 1918, but the Shehu of Bornu refused to allow him to settle down in the Bornu Emirate. He was, however, allowed to settle at Dumbelwa in the Emirate of Fika, which is in the south-western part of the Bornu Province, but distinct from the territories of the Shehu. Dumbelwa is about 30 miles from Burmi, which was Jibrella&apos;s headquarters and is a sort of sacred place, or, at any rate, has sacred memories among the followers of Hayatu and Jibrella.At Dumbelwa, Sa&apos;id rebuilt the town, so as to attract followers to himself, and became its head man. The town was well managed, and the Emir of Fika was rather pleased with it, so were all the officers who inspected it, because it was well laid out and kept clean, and Sa&apos;id paid his taxes regularly and appeared to be a well affected and docile personage. Most of the people in his town, however, had been recruited from followers of Jibrella, or their sons, so that there was plenty of fuel in the event of a spark being forthcoming.In the beginning of 1923, rumours became current that Sa&apos;id was aiming at getting control of the Fika Emirate at least. At the same time, it became evident that he and his men were followers of the Mahdist Tarika. They wore the famous patched &quot;jibbeh,&quot;and in general modelled their behaviour on the followers of Mohammed Ahmed of Dongola (the Mahdi). The Emir of Fika did uot at all like this, and was of opinion that he could not be responsible for keeping the peace if Sa&apos;id remained within his jurisdiction. Accordingly, after full consideration, Mr. Palmer, who was then Resident of Bornu, arrested him and deported him to Kano, whence he was afterwards removed south to Idah. This action appears to have put an end for the time, at any rate, to the Mahdist activity in Bornu, and we have not heard since of any recrudescence.When Sa&apos;id was arrested his correspondence was impounded and various letters were discovered which purported to come from Sejyed Abd-el-Rahman, the son of the Mahdi of the Sudan. There has been a considerable difference of opinion between translators of these letters as to what exactly their meaning, either open or covert, is. The Intelligence Department of the Sudan Government put forward quite innocent, translations, whereas Mr. Palmer produced translations which turned the documents into something pretty near treason, and almost certainly heresy from the point of view of the orthodox Moslem. In sending the correspondence to the Sudan Government, the Nigerian Government wrote as follows : &quot;I am to say that the Nigerian Government dors not view these activities (i.e., activities of some of Sa&apos;id&apos;s disciples) with serious apprehension. Neverthe-less, the course of the movements will be seriously watched.&quot;In the correspondence it appeared that the Emir of Yola and the Erair of Bauchi were in correspondence with Sa&apos;id, and, after the arrest of that individual, a letter was found from the Emir of Yola to a friend of his saying that he was extremely sorry that he had ever fallen into error.Sa&apos;id&apos;s intentions are rather doubtful, but Mr. Palmer is of opinion that his object was to start a great movement-a sort of Jehad early in 1923 or early in 1924, that his plan of campaign was first to assemble his followers at Dumbelwa, and then, at a moment chosen by himself, to pick a quarrel with Fika and revolt, and then capture one of the leading towns. He woidd then have been joined by all those who are likely to flock to his standard, and would probably have gone south-eastwards towards Adamawa with a following which might have been enormous. He might have done a good deal of damage before he had been caught either by ourselves or by the French. While Sa&apos;id was at Kano he was given a good deal of liberty, and endeavoured to get his adherents to tamper with the troops at Maidugari. Incendiary literature was being circulated through French territory and the Province of Bornu, aud the situation was ticklish. However, Mr. Palmer&apos;s later action in getting Sa&apos;id deported to Idah, well away from the storm centre, appears to have effectually quashed the trouble.The question where Seyyed Abd-el-Rahman stands is hardly for the Colonial Office, but is difficult to answer. Gn the one hand, there is the firm conviction of Mr. Willis, who was then Director of Intelligence in the Sudan, that he.is thoroughly loyal to British rule, coupled with the fact that the letters are written in such a style and in such a way as to make it unlikely that he would have written them himself, although they might, of corrrse, have been inspired by him.   On the other hand, there
Colonial Office, March 9, 1927.  are the letters which were undoubtedly believed to come from him, and Mr. Letheni (the present Resident of Bornu who Ira veiled from Nigeria to Khartoum and Cairo in 1925), in a letter to Sir Efugh Clifford written in 1925, stated that everybody else in the Sudan was deeply suspicious of Abd-el-Rahman. The theory has been advanced that the source of the trouble is to be found iu Cairo, though Mr. P.almer and others&apos; held that it would more likely be in Darfur, assuming that Abd-el-Rahman was not in it. As to this, it is quite impossible for us to say. Mr. Palmer, in a memorandum written at the beginning of 1925, said that there could be no question but that the inhabitants of the Chad region, including Sa&apos;id himself, believed that Abd-el-Rahman was actively supporting Sa&apos;id&apos;s campaign and, if not directing it himself, was allowing his helpers to direct it for him. He went on to say that this was now a matter of comparatively little moment, because the &quot; Mahdia &quot; should be regarded rather as one of a series of plots directed against European Government than as a religious Jehad of the old type. Later, in the same memorandum, he comes to the conclusion &quot; it seems quite clear that we are not now dealing with Tarikas of the old stamp, but with sections, or individuals who, though the3&apos; profess to belong to the Tarikas in question, are, in reality, agents, probably paid agents, of some organisation which is directing a general policy subversive of European authority in the Sudan belt.&quot;That is how the matter stands at present. In conversation lately Mr. Lethem was inclined to agree that the situation in south-west Bornu was now quite quiet though there was plenty of fuel for a conflagration if anyone came along to supply the match. However, to organise a large movement would take time and the movement would almost certainly be detected in its early stages and Government would be warned by one or other of the Emirs.Mr. Lethem&apos;s view is that Mahdism in the proper sense is not a real danger to Nigeria, that any such religious or quasi-religious movement would have its direction in the Sudan from Abd-el-Rahman or his associates, and that it would hardly have much force in Nigeria now, as the native rulers would be hostile to it. What is more likely to cause trouble are political movements (which might be linked up with religion) inspired from anti-Bx*itish sources either in Cairo or elsewhere.There are many papers on the subject in the Colonial Office if required.

On this assumption the estimated cost of erecting further permanent accommodation for one squadron at Khartoum would be approximately  100,000.In the event of the whole of the Said Barracks, which are at present used for the accommodation of a detachment of British troops in addition to the Royal Air Force Flight, becoming available for Air Force purposes, this estimate could be reduced to approximately  70,000.A small amount of initial expenditure, not expected to exceed  5,000, would also be necessary for the provision of landing grounds, additional to those already in existence.In regard to conclusion (a) (ii), the extra cost of maintaining a Single Engine Bombing Squadron in Khartoum instead of at Home would be approximately  20,000 a year.I am, &amp;g.

As a result of my conversation with your Lordship, I understand you to be in agreement with the view put forward by me and supported by Major-General Huddleston that, so far as the situation in the Sudan is concerned, an increase in the existing strength of the Air Force up to one squadron cannot be regarded as a necessity, and that such latent possibilities of trouble as may exist in any parts of the country to-day would not be appropriately countered or in any Avay appreciably affected by the spectacle of aeroplanes flying over them.While I should welcome the presence of a complete squadron at Khartum, and be prepared to afford every possible assistance if it is considered, on Imperial grounds, desirable that such a unit should be stationed here, I cannot feel that the-imposition of any part of the cost as a burden on the Sudan taxpayer is justified.* Not printed.[162101 * b
3. On the general question of the financial responsibility of the Sudan Govern-ment, I do not intend now to dispute the contention that the country should contribute according to the measure of its ability towards the cost of the British garrison which is considered necessary for security although the Sudan taxpayer might well argue that the presence of the troops is primarily required to maintain the British position in the Sudan, and is intimately connected with the parallel necessity for maintaining the British position in Egypt. I propose rather to put forward certain considerations on the question of the Sudan&apos;s ability to pay.4. In this connection it appears to me that there may be some misapprehension in London as to the financial position of the Sudan, and that the fact that it has been found possible to show a &apos; surplus&quot; during the years 1923-25 has created an impression of prosperity which is misleading.I am enclosing a short note on the present situation by the Financial Secretary, based on his annual review on the introduction of the 1927 budget, in which he explains the absorption of past surpluses, and lays stress on the fact that before the financial position can be regarded as fundamentally sound the level of taxes and railway rates should be reduced, and the Sudan Government made independent of the present precarious contribution from Egypt.5. I think it very necessary that these general considerations should be taken into account, and the point which I myself wish chiefly to emphasise is this : The whole financial position of the Sudan is speculative to an extreme degree, depending as it does entirely on climatic conditions and almost entirely on the production of two commodities cotton and gum the prices of which are liable to violent fluctuation, and which are produced in two concentrated areas. Meanwhile, the greater part of the country is being administered at a loss, and is dependent on surplus revenues being provided from the comparatively small favoured areas. In such a position prudence demands not only the accumulation of reserves and the maintenance in normal years of a reasonable margin of revenue over expenditure, but also that every effort should be made to extend the economic foundations on to a broader basis by developing transport and other facilities in the unproductive parts of the country. This must be a slow process, and if a healthy situation is to be created it should be carried out from current resources and not accompanied by the piling up of a heavy burden of debt. It is essential, therefore, that any surplus realised in good years should either be kept available as a liquid reserve, or be put back into the development of the country.6. In these circumstances, I am strongly of the opinion that a further period of &quot;nursing &quot; and the careful building up of strength is required, and that it will be a fundamental mistake to call upon the Sudan to surrender any margin which good fortune at this stage may make available. If further time is given now, the result in the end may prove much more profitable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.7. The suggestion that no immediate cash payment will be required and that the Treasury will advance the necessary cash to the Sudan Government does not in any way weaken my objection. It appears to me that this Avould merely disguise the reality of the situation, and do so in a way which might be dangerous. It would, in fact, result in the piling up of a debt against non-productive expenditure which is precisely what ought, for the sake of the future health of the country, to be avoided.8. If your Lordship agrees with the views which I have expressed above, I would suggest that the Financial Secretary who expects to be at the Sudan Govern-ment Office in London from the middle of May should be deputed to give any further oxplanation of the financial position which may be required.I have, &amp;e.J. L. MAFFEY, Governor-General of the Sudan.Enclosure No. 2.Note by Financial Secretary.THERE are so many complicating factors in the financial situation of the Sudan that it is impossible within the compass of a short note to give explanations which may not be misleading, and if this question is to be decided in relation to the Sudan&apos;s ability to pay, I suggest that the best course will be for me to give detailed explanations to the Treasury in person.
In the meanwhile the attached table which is a summary of a more detailed table which I prepared for council at the time when the budget and reserve fund votes were under consideration brings out the main points, i.e., that, during the years 1923-25, there was a considerable strengthening of the financial position and proper provision was made for the first time for the current needs&apos; of renewal and equipment of the railways and for items of special expenditure, such as the housing of officials, &amp;c, which are met from the reserve fund. Under both these headings heavy arrears had accumulated. The table further brings out that the amounts shown as surpluses of revenue over budgetary expenditure are not real surpluses. They are passed to the general reserve fund from which all special expenditure  which, though not in the strict sense &quot;recurrent expenditure,&quot; is, nevertheless, unavoidable has to be met. Lastly, the table shows that the period of accumulating reserves appears to have ended in 1926.On this and the general financial situation, the following extract from my review of the situation when introducing the budget estimates is relevant: &quot; (22.) At the same time this table of the general survey of the financial position brings out that the year 1926 has brought to an end the period of accumulating reserves. It is true that this year includes the exceptional allot-ment of  E. 150,000 for capital expenditure on the Gezira Extension, but even without this the balance would have been slightly on the wrong side. I had, in fact, always anticipated this result, and the policy at which I have been aiming has been to maintain the revenue during the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 at a figure perhaps larger than was directly justified by expenditure during those years in order that, in 1926 when the heavy demands for loan charges, &amp;c, had to be met for the first time we should find ourselves, without increasing taxation, in receipt of an income large enough to meet these new demands. I had, at the same time, the additional intention of accumulating, as a result of this policy, sufficient reserves fo carry us through a few difficult years.iC The main demands, of course, which 1 had in view, were those m respect of the working of the Gezira Project and the interest on the Gezira Loans.&quot; As matters have turned out, the Gezira Project in its first year has not only not strained the country&apos;s finances, but has been their salvation, and it has been revenue from other sources which has failed to come up to expectations.&quot; But the result remains the same, and if we may hope for better years as regards other revenue in the future, it would be a reckless misjudgment to expect that the Gezira receipts can be maintained at anywhere near the high scale of 1926. We must, indeed, be prepared for a permanently lower level with occasional very bad years in the Gezira.&quot; (23.) A point has, therefore, been reached when expenditure, both recurrent and non-recurrent, must be strictly limited, and this necessity becomes the more apparent if consideration is given to the normal risks inherent in the economy of this country, and in the large prospects to which we are committed.&quot; (24.) As regards the former, I have already indicated in my statement on the budget estimates to what violent fluctuations some of the main sources of revenue in this country are subject, owing to their dependence on climatic conditions, nor have we yet so organised the system of production and transport of food crops as to be free from the fear of famine, which might require Govern-ment intervention on a large scale. A long continuance of very low cotton prices may also cause us serious difficulty. With this in view, I do not think it is excessive to maintain a balance of at least  E. 400,000 in the general reserve fund.&quot; (25.) As regards the main projects, I still feel that it is no more than ordinary prudence to keep a special Gezira Reserve of  E. 750,000. Our other reserves are all held for specific objects, and the pension reserve is, of course, only a fraction of what is required to cover our actual liabilities.&quot; (26.) Apart from the above normal risks, there are other contingent liabilities of a special nature hanging over us. I allude to the position of the Kassala Irrigation Project and to the possibility of our being forced to allow the Egyptian Government to proceed with their reservoir at Gebel Aulia.&quot; (27.) If, in the course of the next few years, we can safely meet all these contingent liabilities, and if the Gezira Scheme settles down to a steady equilibrium of prosperity, we have still other tasks to face.[16210] B 2
&quot; (28.) In the first place, the situation of this country will never be satis-factory until we can meet our own military charges from our revenue, and we 1)ought not to,be satisfied until we have built up a position when this can be done.&quot; (29.) Our next task must be to attempt substantial reductions in taxation and in the scale of our railway charges. As regards the latter, -although certain special industries on which at present we mainly rely are perhaps not being hampered by the burden, there is no doubt that substantial reductions must be made before trade from the southern provinces can be regarded as open to every chance for natural development by private enterprise.&quot; As regards taxation, the burden on the native cultivators is still heavy, and I always feel doubts as to whether it would be supported without discontent if they did not still retain memories of the heavier impositions under Egyptian and lurkish rule.&quot; Further, the sugar monopoly is a fundamentally undesirable instrument for collecting revenue. It cuts oil&apos; from private commercial enterprise one of the few important opportunities open to it in this country, and our aim ought to be to work towards its ultimate removal.&quot; Generally speaking, I think it may be said that the Government collects into its own coffers a very large percentage of all the profit which is to be made out of the natural resources of the country, leaving only a small margin for private enterprise. This is a dangerous position. The lack of attraction to private enterprise means that the Government itself must undertake the risks of new development, and, as the country cannot be allowed to stand still, this means ever-increasing burdens of work and financial risk.&quot; This process cannot go on indefinitely without breaking down the Government machine. The only way out of the position, I think, is for the Government gradually to reduce transport rates and taxation and even to give positive assistance to private trade.&quot; The position will be an unnatural and dangerous one until this is done, and the need for it must ever be kept in view.&quot; (30.) Beyond the above tasks lies that of improving certain administra-tive services, particularly the medical service, on which our expenditure now, I believe, lags behind that in the British Crown Colonies in Africa.&quot; (31.) Taking all the above factors into account, the position though it has developed well over the last few years is far from being finally settled on a sound and reliable foundation. Our apparent prosperity is, in fact, at present based to some extent on artificial supports which may at any time break or be withdrawn.&quot;

June 1927.SECRET.809-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PROPOSED  INCREASE  OF AIR  STRENGTH  IN THE  SUDAN.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a note by the Air Staff on the question of the air strength to be maintained in the Sudan.S. H.Air Ministry, June 22, 1927.Note by the Air Staff.1. On the 22nd July, 1926, the Committee of Imperial Defence approved the appointment of an ad hoc Committee to report on the arrangements for dealing with any outbreak of Mahdism in the Sudan, and to recommend the best means of safeguarding the position in that region. As a result of these terms of reference, the Committee recommended, in November 1926, that an increase in the strength of the Royal Air Force from one flight to one complete squadron would be advantageous.2. The recommendations of the Committee were considered at the 220th meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, when a tentative proposal was made &quot;that the difference between the cost of the maintenance of a squadron of Royal Air Force at Khartoum and the cost of its maintenance at home &quot; should be borne by the Sudan Government.3. The Governor-General of the Sudan, who has now been consulted on these proposals by the Foreign Office, has replied in a despatch to Lord Lloyd, dated the 12th April, 1927 (C.I.D. Paper No. 802-B): &quot; so far as the situation in the Sudan is concerned, an increase in the existing strength of the Air Force up to one squadron cannot be regarded as a necessity, and that stich latent possibilities of trouble as may exist in any parts of. the country to-day would not be appropriately couniered or in any way appreciably affected by the spectacle of aeroplanes flying over them.&quot; Sir John Maffey (and Lord Lloyd is in agreement with his views) deduces from this the conclusion that while he would welcome the presence of a full squadron at Khartoum, if desirable on Imperial grounds, it would be unjustifiable to impose any part of its cost on the Sudan Government.4. The Air Staff are surprised at the opinion expressed by the Governor-General and consider that this opinion is only held because the method of employment of the flight in the Sudan, up to the present time, has not afforded a test of the ability of the Air Arm to co-operate with the Civil authorities for purposes of internal security. Aircraft in the Sudan have been restricted to a much narrower range of duties than those undertaken under similar conditions by air units on the North-West Frontier, in Iraq, Transjordan, Aden and Somaliland. This opinion is based on recent conversations with General Huddleston and with the officer lately commanding the flight at Khartoum. [16327]Copy No.   62
Air Staff, 17th June, 1927.5. It was suggested by General Huddleston that the inhabitants of the Sudan are of so low an order of intelligence that they would not be impressed by the spectacle of aircraft flying over them. The Air Staff consider that this contention is contrary to proved experience under similar conditions in other areas. If aircraft were more fully employed and in larger numbers, the constant reminder which they would afford to the tribesmen of the ubiquity and power of the forces behind the Administration should be of as much value in the Sudan as in Iraq.6. From an investigation which the Air Staff have made into the work of the flight at Khartoum during the last year, it is clear that it has been misemployed and does not, therefore, serve any useful purpose in that country. In view of this consideration and of the Governor-General&apos;s opinion as to its utility, and of the, further fact that a flight detached from its parent squadron is expensive in upkeep, the Air Staff, in the interests of economy and *of the general efficiency of the air force located in the Middle East, recommend that the flight should be withdrawn from Khartoum and rejoin its squadron in Egypt.7. The Air Staff consider that an additional reason for withdrawing the flight is that, whereas the Governor-General is, prepared to pay towards the cost of the ground garrison in the Sudan, he definitely states that he is not prepared to pay anything towards the cost of the air unit in that country.

K. E. Charles, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., War Office (Chairman). Air Commodore C. L. N. Newall, C.M.G., C.B.E., A.M., Air Ministry. Sir George Schuster, K.C.M.G., C.B.E., M.C.Terms of Reference.&quot; That the Secretaries of State for War and Air, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should appoint a Committee to study and report to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the arrangements for dealing with any outbreak of Mahdism in the Sudan and to make recommendations as to the best means of safeguarding the position in that region.&quot;REPORT.The Committee having reassembled on 24th June, 1927, in accordance with Conclusion (/) of the Minutes of the 220th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence proceeded to re-examine the problem.The only aspects in which the Committee felt qualified to review their original recommendations were those alluded to in Conclusions (d) (ii) and (e) of the above-mentioned minutes of the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Committee understand, with regard to the former, that the French Government have not replied to the Foreign Office request for their views on the possibility of a Mahdist rising in French Equatorial Africa. They doubt whether the reply, when received, can throw much further light on the problem from the point of view of the military steps which they recommend should be taken to meet the danger of such a rising-.With regard to the latter Conclusion of the Committee of Imperial Defence the Committee have read C.I.D. Paper 781-B. of March, 1927 (Title : Mahdism in the Northern Province of Nigeria). The impression they receive from this document is that Mahdism is not regarded as a real danger to Nigeria and that any activity in this direction would almost certainly be detected in its early stages and could be adequately dealt with.CONCLUSION OF THE COMMITTEE.The Committee, therefore, having given fresh consideration to the special aspects alluded to above, see no cause to modify the Conclusions which they originally recorded.J.
