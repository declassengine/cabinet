(TIGS DOCUi&quot;JiiNT IS TIE PROPJSTY OF HIS BRITANNIC I!AJ5STY&apos;S GOvTT?.in&apos;.TiTT) ,S 5 C R 3 T. COPY HO;        O Q00P3 182 (27)..CABINET,BITTRY OF IRAQ INTO TIsTl^AGuE OF NATIONS,HEIIORAHDH; BY TIES CHANGSLLOR OF TJ-fl DUCHY OF LANCASTER,,(previous Papers: Cn?a&quot;173 (27) and 178 (27)),As I have to go to Geneva tomorrow I trust my colleagues will forgive me if I venture to put on paper some observations with reference to the above matter0The arguments of Sir Harry Dobbs appear to me exceedingly strong.     He may of course be wrong about the local position but I do not know who is be -.ter able to form an opinion than hen     I assume therefore that he is right in saying that on the conditions which he mentions the entry of Iraq Into the Loague of Nations would be of advantage to British interests in that part of the world, and that it therefore is in itself desirable that we should sxxpport her application for admission in 192S0His doubts arise on certain points not connected with the llesopotamian position but with outside considerations. In the first place, he fears lest the entry of Iraq into the League as early rs 1928 would come as a painful surprise to the members of the Council of the League of Nations in view of the terms of their&apos; resolution last year.      The Secretary of State for the Dominions takes this view even more strongly than Sir Harry Dobbs, since he regards it as one of the reasons why he cannot support to the full
Sir Harry Dobbs1 s recommendations.     I cannot think that this reading of the resolution is right.      The resolution was in the nature of a compromise.     All tho members of the Council with the exeePtion of the representative of Sweden were in favour of unconditionally fixing the boundary of IIosul in accordance with the British contention^     The Swedish representative took a different view for various reasons.      One of them was that he doubted the possibility of Mesopotamia being able to govern herself without British assistance and he wished to be assured that the British wore prepared to act as mandatories until she could do so,     It was to meet this view that we gave the undertaking that we would continue to discharge our mandate in Mesopotamia for twenty-five years unless Iraq were before thene dmitted to the League, her admission being regarded as proof that she was capable of self-go vernraent 0      But I do not think the members of the Council had any clear idea in their own mind.a as to how long it would take before Mesopotamia was fit for membership of the League,      On that point I think Sir Harry Dobbs has been partly misled by the use of the word &quot;eventual&quot;j, which is, I feel sure, a mistranslation of the French &quot;eventuel&quot;.      &quot;Eventuel&quot; surely does not imply a post-ponement of the entry to&apos;a distant date.      It would perhaps be better translated by some such word as &quot;contingent&quot; or &quot;possible&quot;0It is of course possible, as the Dominions Secretary suggests, that the League would desire to be satisfied that, to use the words of the Covenant, Mesopotamia was &quot;able to stand alone&quot;, and in that case it might be wished to send to Iraq a Commission of enquiry,       I cannot see any objection to that course and I  imagine   that such a Commission of Enquiry would certainly report that Mesopotamia had become capable of self government0 I submit therefore that there is no necessity out of regard for the susceptibilities of the League for us to postpone supporting the entry of Iraq beyond 1928,     Still less do I think that we
should have regard to the possible repercussion on the Frenchposition in Syriac     I do not see myself hov; it would affectthe French in the leastc     The reason why we a3?e able to contemplate the entry of Mesopotamia into the League is because theLesopotamians have believed in a reasonable and orderly manner, andthat would become abundantly clear in discussion of thesubject.     That example ought rather to facilititate thanhamper French government in Syria0     It ought to show the Syriansthat if they desire a greater measure of liberty in Syria theymust be worthy of it.     As a matter of fact I do not believe it would produce any effect one way or the other on the Syrianposition.      The French difficulties there are due to their ownblunders or worse and not to any direct or indirect influenceiron hesopotamia or anywhere elseDIf therefore the Kesopotamian position and our own interests make it advantageous for its to assist the application of Iraq for membership of the League in 1928, I very much hope my colleagues will not think it necessary to refuse British assistance to that application out of regard for the susceptibilities of France or the League of Nationsa     As to the suggested effect on Sgy?t I should doubt whether it would make much difference, though I ought perhaps to add that I do not myself believe that the entry of Egypt Into the League would do us any harm,,Hay I just add/this.     I am convinced there is no more popular move that-we could make as far as this coxintry is concerned than to diminish our direct responsibilities in Mesopotamia at the earliest possible momenta     It would be a complete answer to those of our critics who allege that we are anxious to have a militarist or advsnturoxis foreign policy. That charge has done i;s,a great deal of harm already and may
easily be fatal to our existence at the next election,,     It is no doubt utterly untrue and unjust.      3ut we have been compelled by circumstances to take action in more than one direction which lends colour to such caliimny.     Even o\rr Chinese policy, necessary and indeed inevitable as it was, has been, I believe, profoundly unpopular.Apart from a very small section I am convinced that the overwhelming sentiment of the electorate at the present timo is pacifiat in the extreme and anything that we can properly do to meet that sentiment &quot;ill be of great advantage to our Position in the country.(Intd.   R.C.Treasury Chambers, S.17,1, 17th June,  19270
