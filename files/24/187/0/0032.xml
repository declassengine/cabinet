The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was May 25, 1925        .... .... .... ....   10&apos;624, 1926        .... .... .... ....   14-1,,    23, 1927        .... .... .... ....    8&quot;7 (men only 10&apos;4)During the five weeks ended the 30th May the number of persons registered as unemployed fell by almost 60,000. The reduction is again accounted for by a fall in the wholly unemployed figure, but unlike last month, the temporary stoppages figure also, showed a decrease.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 23rd May, 1927, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 8&quot;8, as compared with 9&apos;4 at the 25th April, 1927, with 14&apos;3 at the 24th May, 1926, and with 10&apos;9 at the 25th May, 1925. The figures at the 23rd Mayf 1927, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

Part of the reduction was, however, brought about by some recovery in some of the more seriously depressed industries. In Engineering the improvement was shared by all sections, but employment remained very slack in Marine Engineering and in the Textile Machinery section. The improvement in the employment position of the Shipbuilding industry was brought about, in the main, by increased activity in the North-Eastern area and in Scotland.The only industry showing an increase in unemployment of 2,000 or over during the month was the Tin Plate trade. In this industry much short-time working was reported. A slight decline in employment also took place in the Cotton and Jute industries and in Canal and Dock Services.The employment position in the Coal Mining industry calls for special mention. A decrease in unemployment of 7,049 is recorded, but district reports indicate that little, if any, real improvement took place during the month.
(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 13th June, giving the total number on the registers as 1,028,700. This is an inorease over the position on the 30th May amounting to 43,187, and a decrease over a year ago of 601,239.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,June 23, 1927.
