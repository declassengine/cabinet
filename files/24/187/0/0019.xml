(This docoiment is the property of His Britannic liaj esty * s Gcvvernment).CP.169 (27) Cabinet.Situation in China. Proposed withdrawal of Indian Troops.Memorandum fry the Secretary of State for War..l;                     The monthly cost of the undermentioned troops of the Mixed Indian Brigade is.................... 43,000being -Pack Battery  3,0002 Britiah Bna . 25,0002 Indian Bns. 15,000 45,0002. If these units were withdrawn in the ships now at shangai the saving on transport (later) would amount to  100,000.3. In view of the rapid advance of the Southern troops and the apparent unwillingness of the northern troops to make a stand, trouble may arise in Tientsin similar to that which we anticipated and avoided in Shanghai.I do not think it safe or politically desirable to rely solely upon the Japanese for protection at Tientsin.4. I think we should keep a brigade ready to gothere at anytime, to be followed if required, if Shanghai makes it possible, by another Brigade,   lib one can foretell the action of the victorious southern troops, or whether the . -  Hankow elements will finally control them, or, if Chiang Kai Shek retains the upper hand, what he may think necessary to do to assert his Nationalism.5, I propose therefore that the Pack Battery should go back to India but that the rest of the troops&apos; should remain in China.(Intd.) L.W.S,tfar Office. 31st May, 1927,
