jj5 DOCUbDSKT IS THE PRQFSRTY OF HIS BRITAKKIC ^JESTYjS QQVERMSSEKT,&apos;   CABINET.IETSREAT 10KAL LABOUR COEFERaKCE, EIGHTH SESSIOK. Irroposed action on draft convention and recommendation.Copy No.       _3 T Llemorandum. by the Minister of Labour.7153(27)I submit for the consideration of my colleagues the. following proposals as to the action to be taken by the Government in regard to the draft convention and recommendation adopted by the eighth session of the International Labour Conference.     The texts of these documents have already been-presented to Parliament as Command 2745 of 1926 o 1,     Draft Convention concerning the Simplification of the Inspection of Emigrants on board ship.     This convention imposes no obligation to institute any system of inspection of emigrants, but makes provision for the simplification of such inspection where it exists or may exist.    I understand that the Chamber of Shipping, who have always taken an extreme view of the limited competence of the International Labour Organisation to deal with emigration matters, maintain their point of view that the adoption of the convention was &quot;ultra vires&quot; and express the opinion that it should not be ratified by His i^majesty&apos;s Government.   The Government, however, decided before the opening of the Conference that it would be unwise to raise the question of competence on this occasionj    their delegates took part in the framing of the convention and it seems clearly impossible at this stage to take up the attitude adopted by the Chamber of Shipping./It
It is the opinion of the Board of Trade that the convention is calculated to ease the position of the British Steamship Lines who are compelled in certain emigrant trades to carry foreign inspectors on board their vessels.     If ratified, it would enable these lines to refuse to carry more than one Government Inspector on any voyage.     No new legislation would be involved, and the position, so far as this country is concerned, would not be otherwise affected, as we have no system of inspection of emigrants on board ship by means of travelling inspectors^On the other hand ratification will be altogether ineffective unless the convention is also ratified by those countries, namely Italy and Spain, which already have such systems as the convention is designed to simplify and which, among others, compel British Lines to carry more than one travelling inspector at the same time.The   Board of Trade accordingly suggest that the Government should register its ratification of the convention with the proviso that it shall only become effective on ratification by the following Powers, France, Germany, Holland,  Italy, Norway and Spain.     It is thought more advisable to include the other chief maritime Powers of Europe rather than to single out the two  countries, Italy and Spain, whose adhesion it is chiefly desired to secure.I readily endorse this suggestion and in recommending it to my colleagues I would remind them of the conclusions reached by the Cabinet Committee* on International Labour Policy (0*1.198(25)) to which it appears to me to conform. It would be possible as an alternative to defer ratification by this country until the other countries concerned had ratified or signified their intention to ratify, but in my view the procedure I suggest is more likely to be effective as constituting a more direct challenge...
2.     Recommendetion concerning the Protection of Emigrant Women and Girls on board ship.     I do not think I need trouble my colleagues with the details of the position in regard to this matter, but I may say that while the statutory re quire-ments as to the carrying of supervisors for emigrant women and girls do not go as far as the provisions of the recommendation, our actual practice is substantially in accord with thenuI propose, therefore, that this recommendation should be accepted and that in notifying our acceptance we should inform the International Labour Office in general terms as to the British law and practice and state that It is proposed to continue to give to women and girl emigrants on British ships the same protection as at present.(Intd.)   A. S-MaMinistry of Labour. May 13th, 1927.
