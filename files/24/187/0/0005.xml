[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1927.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     30CP. 155 (27).REQUEST BY PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT FOR possible assistance AT MACAO.IN a memorandum dated the 28th April last, the Portuguese Embassy in London stated that, according to information received from the Governor of Macao, the situation in that colony was becoming disquieting as a result of the activities of communists and the threat of a general strike. The Portuguese Government, while reporting that the Governor was taking the energetic measures necessitated by the situation, requested His Majesty&apos;s Government to issue instructions to their authorities in China in order that assistance might be rendered to the Governor of Macao should the necessity for such intervention arise.The information in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, showed that the situation in the Hong Kong district of South China had, since the date on which the Governor had presumably reported to his Government, sensibly improved, largely as a consequence of the action taken by General Li Chai-Sum against the communists in the district in question, and there seemed, therefore, insufficient grounds on which to give serious consideration to the Portuguese Governments request.The First Secretary of the Portuguese Embassy was accordingly informed of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this sense on the 7th May. M. de Oliveira Bastos stated in reply that the Governor was understood to be taking active steps against the communist organisation at Macao, but that he had been somewhat nervous at the menace of a general strike. He would be asked to report again on the position in the light of the information supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to specify the nature of the assistance he might require.The Portuguese Embassy have now received this further report from the Governor. It is to the effect that thei&apos;e is no present menace either from communist activities or from the threat of a general strike. The Governor has the situation at Macao in hand, but he cannot foresee what sudden emergency may arise, and he fears that if such an emergency did arise, his available forces might not be sufficient to deal with it. In these circumstances, the Portuguese Government have stated that they would be most grateful if the position could be explained to the Governor of Hong Kong, and if the latter could be authorised in the event but only in the event of his receiving a sudden appeal from the Governor of Macao for military or naval assistance, to do what is possible, with due regard to the requirements of the situation at Hong Kong, to afford such assistance. The Portuguese Embassy regret that they are unable to specify the nature of the assistance which might be required as that must necessarily depend on the nature of the emergency.Portugal is the oldest ally of Great Britain and, under the Anglo-Portuguese treaties, the earliest of which dates back to 1373, His Majesty&apos;s Government are under a general obligation to defend Portuguese territories and colonies against all enemies of Portugal. It was held by Lord Granville in 1873 and, on his instructions, it was clearly notified to the Portuguese Government &quot; that His Majesty&apos;s Government reserved to themselves to judge of the circumstances under which any appeal was made to them by Portugal for succour.&quot; So, as regards the Portuguese mainland, it is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government are free to decide whether they will assume these obligations or not. As regards the Portuguese colonies, however, the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government may not be quite so free, since in 1899 at the time of the Boer War when the ancient treaties were 3983 [16168]
renewed the following passage from the secret article of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1661 was specifically quoted and confirmed : &quot; His Majesty of Great Britain shall promise and oblige himself, as by this present article he doth, to defend and protect all conquests or colonies belonging to the Crown of Portugal against all his enemies, as well future as present.&quot;In 1913, however, Sir E. Grey wrote with reference to this question : &quot; The conclusion therefore seems to be that while the treaties are admitted to be still in force, His Majesty&apos;s Government reserve to themselves the right of judging the circumstances under which help may be given or withheld.&quot;As regards Macao, in December 1909 His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking informed the Ghinese Government officially, in connection with Sino-Portuguese disputes over Macao, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to intervene forcibly in favour of Portugal in the event of China&apos;s respiting to any aggressive action at Macao after having refused arbitration.&quot;Whether or not communists are &quot; enemies&quot; within the meaning of the passage quoted above from the Treaty of 1661 would seem to be a matter for legal interpretation; but there would seem to be a certain degree of obligation upon us to assist Portugal, and it would presumably be desirable on general grounds to meet PortugaFs wishes on this point if this can be done without endangering our position elsewhere. We cannot, however, undertake any general responsibility for the defence of Macao, independent of the circumstances in which danger had arisen.Our mobile military forces at Hong Kong consist of one British infantry battalion and one Indian battalion, constituting the garrison of the colony, together with one British battalion belonging to the Shanghai Defence Force and consequently under the orders of General Duncan. The following of His Majesty&apos;s ships are at present in Hong Kong waters: &quot; Probisher,&quot; &quot; Dauntless,&quot; &quot; Delhi,&quot; &quot;Dragon,&quot; cruisers; &quot;Hermes,&quot; aircraft carrier; &quot;Bruce,&quot; flotilla leader, and seven torpedo-boat destroyers, together with some submarines and auxiliary vessels.Subject to the situation at Hong Kong remaining more oriess normal, as it is understood to be at present, it would seem possible, in the event of a sudden emergency at Macao, to detach some of these forces without unduly weakening the defences of the colony.It is suggested therefore that the Colonial Office should inform the Governor of Hong Kong of the nature of the request now made by the Portuguese Govern-ment, and authorise him, in the event of the Governor of Macao calling upon him for military or naval assistance, to meet a sudden and serious emergency, to render him such assistance as he can without further reference home, under the strict understanding that he is satisfied that the requirements of his own colony can be fully met.It is not at present anticipated that any such emergency will arise; it is thought that this appeal is due to somewhat excessive nervousness on the part of the Governments of Macao and Lisbon.A. C.Foreign Office, May 16, 1927.
