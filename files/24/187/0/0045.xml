This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.Printed for the Cabinet, July, 1927.SECRET.Copt No.    3 0CP. 197 (27).THE CABINET.MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS BY COLONIAL AND OTHERGOVERNMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR. Partly on account of certain recommendations of the Colwyn Committee on Navy,      16Army and Air Force expenditure on Colonial garrisons, I provided in Army Estimates,   Abroad1926, for the receipt of a contributions.   So littlespeculative  100,000 in respect of increased colonial military progress had, however, been made by the time that army estimates for 1927 were being prepared, that (as explained in paragraph C. 4 of memorandum N.E. 45) I had to increase the net provision to allow for this factor.I think it desirable now to place the position before my colleagues.1. Apart  from  India  and the   self-governing  Dominions,   Colonial and Governments may be classified for the purpose of this paper as follows : myotherI. Colonies with an Imperial garrison which make a contribution towards the costII.-of that garrison.-Colonies with an Imperial garrison which make no contribution towards the cost of their defence. III. Colonies with no Imperial garrison. IV. Other Governments.177I. Colonies which make a Contribution.2. Hong Kong has paid a contribution since 1863 and now pays either 20 per cent, of its revenue or the whole cost of the garrison, whichever is less. At present the former is less.3. The Government of the Straits Settlements was taken over in 1867 from India, on the third appeal from the Colony, on the express condition that no charges in respect of its military defence should fall on the Imperial Exchequer. The Colony has paid . a contribution ever since, but not generally equal to the full cost. The present arrangement is that the Colony pays 20 per cent, of the revenue or the full cost of the garrison, whichever be less. For the last few years the latter has been less, though it is not likely to be so when the new defences are in a more advanced stage. The War Office view is that the Colony should continue to contribute towards the increased military expenditure on the 119 existing basis, i.e., always within 20 per cent, of its revenue, but the present indications Abroad&quot; are that the Colonial Government will contend that the expenditure in connection with 508 the Singapore Base should be excluded from the cost of the garrison for which they are liable. The suggestion, sometimes made by Colonial Governments in the past, that a Colonial garrison could be divided into troops for local defence and troops for general Imperial defence has always been strenuously resisted by the War Office, though an unfortunate exception was allowed a long time ago in the case of the troops stationed at Trincomali (see below).4. Ceylon has borne part of the cost of its defence since its transfer from India in 1801 and has paid a cash contribution since 1837. The present arrangement is that the Colony pays 9  per cent, of its revenue or three-fourths of the cost of the garrison whichever is less, in addition to the cost of military lands and buildings required by the War Department (except at Trincomali). For many years three-fourths of the cost of the garrison has been paid, as being less than 9J per cent, of the revenue. At one time the limit was the full cost of the garrison, as in the case of Hong Kong and the(b27/17)   100  7/27   w.o.p.  31820983556
Ceylon   Straits Settlements, but in 1895 the limit was reduced to three-fourths cost, after much-JL-____controversy with the Colonial Government, as a partial and reluctant concession to the123     view that Trincomali was defended primarily for Imperial and not local purposes.5. Mauritius has borne part of the cost of its defence ever since its capture in 1819, and has paid a cash contribution since 1829. The Colony now pays 5j per cent, of the revenue irrespective of the cost of the garrison.6. I do not think that we could in present circumstances propose any modification in the arrangements relating to these garrisons with any prospect of advantage to Army Funds.II. Colonies with an Imperial Garrison which make no Contribution.7. Gibraltar. The Colonial Office in 1922 stated that if Gibraltar were able to make any contribution it would only be of negligible amount.-- 8. Malta paid a fixed contribution of  5,000 a year towards the non-effective cost ofthe Royal Malta Artillery for the period 1875 to 1912, when the contribution was 16      suspended owing to the impoverished state of the revenues.    In 1926 the War. Office Abroad   asked the Governor to raise the question of a contribution, and this was done, but the 96      Acting Governor has recently replied that the present is not an opportune moment to press the matter, owing to a temporary opposition aroused locally against certain provisions of a recent Military Ordinance.   The matter is still under consideration.064 9. Bermuda has never paid a contribution.   The War Office have recently asked for1379    a contribution, and the matter is now being considered by the Colonial Legislature.10. Jamaica contributed towards the cost of its garrison for about a century prior to 1845, when the contribution ceased owing to the depressed financial condition of the Colony; but at the same time a regiment was withdrawn to offset the loss to Army Funds.20 The coat of the garrison has been reduced by the disbandment, last year, of the infantry West India Regiment,   The estimated cost for 1927 is  247,000, the whole of which is 1768    borne by Army Funds.   The Colony&apos;s defence expenditure (on local forces) is less than  20,000 a year.   As this comes to less than 1 per cent, of  the Revenue, which  is a little over  2,000,000 a year, it is not apparent why Jamaica should not make a contribution towards the cost of the Imperial garrison.   The War Office view is that16_it should meet the whole cost of its military defence subject to a maximum of 20 perAbroad   cent, of the Revenue.   As far as can be ascertained from the figures available, the present lo*7     fun cost would be about 12J per cent, only of the gross Revenue.11. Sierra Leone has never paid a direct contribution towards the cost of the garrison, though it bears its share of the cost of the West African Frontier Force.The cost of the Imperial garrison for 1927 is estimated at  150,000, the whole of which is met from Army Funds.   The charge against Colonial Funds for the West African Frontier Force is less than  40,000 a year, or less than 4 per cent, of the 074     Revenue (about  920,000 a year).   The War Office considers that the Colony ought to &quot;78778   &quot; pay the full cost of the garrison within a maximum of 20 per cent, of the Revenue.The Treasury have recently (27th June, 1927) written to the War Office supporting this view, but suggesting that the 20 per cent, be reached gradually, by increases of 2J per cent, each year. I accept this suggestion, but consider that the annual increase should be at the rate of 5 per cent., and this proposal is being put to the Colonial Office.III. Colonies with no Imperial Garrison.12. None of these, colonies makes any contribution towards ,the cost to,.Imperial funds . of its military defence.   ,. ... ( . .     .     &apos;* mr . Neville,, Chamberlain, when Chancellor of, the Exchequer, in&apos; a letter to Lord Derby, the Secretary of State for War, expressed the.view, that &quot;: if the strategic disposition : of&apos; the, garrison is sound, it follows that all, portions of the, Empire benefit from their , presence.! and all alike should contribute to their cost.&quot;   t ,; j .:.,ThiS;is a yiew ,which had, been previously - considered . by the War Office, but Lord Derby replied that it was not within the range of&quot; practical politics to ask a Colony to pay for the support of military defences which are situated &quot;in other&quot;places and&apos; for s61diers whom it never sees.
IV. Other Governments.13. The Channel Islands. Army funds bear the cost of the regular garrisons of the      16 Channel Islands, and of the permanent staff of the militias.   The War Office recently   Home bi*ought forward the question of a contribution, but the Home Office did not consider it      86 desirable to approach the insular authorities pending a settlement of the general contri-bution to the Imperial Exchequer.    The War Office have asked that a share of the - contribution, when received, should be allotted to Army Votes in respect of the cost of the Imperial garrisons.14. Egypt. From 1882 to 1923 the Egyptian Government paid a contribution 0143 representing the extra cost of maintaining the troops of the garrison in Egypt instead of 2102 in this country. In 1907 this was calculated at  150,000, and this sum was paid annually from that date till 1924, when the Egyptian Government refused to continue the payment. Re-calculated under present conditions on the same basis as the  150,000, the amount would now be over  500,000 a year. The total cost of the British garrison is  2,666,000 per annum.15. Tlie Sudan. Since the changes of 1924 the War Office have frequently raised 0143 the question of a contribution from the Sudan towards the cost of the Imperial garrison. 2233 Hitherto the state of the Sudan finances has been urged against it, but the question is still under consideration. The total cost of the Imperial garrison is  433,000; the extra cost of maintaining the troops in the Sudan instead of in this country (see the case of Egypt above) is  85,000. (The cost of the Sudan Defence Force maintained by the Sudan Government is almost covered by the contribution made to the Sudan revenues by the Government of Egypt.)16. North China. No contribution has ever been received in respect of the garrison of Tientsin and Wei-hai-Wei, and the War Office do not consider that, in the special circumstances of North China, they can reasonably press for one.Table showing the estimated cost of garrisons and colonial military contributions for 1927 (including home effective and non-effective charges), and ihe revenues of the local governments according to the latest available figures.
