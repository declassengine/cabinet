TOTS PC-cumest IS the PROPERTY OP HIS bbitatoc KAJBSTYIS govjsmsment.0 a b x h ajet.,    ,tgogjgzLtROAD 002TV3YAITGJ3 OF PASSENGERS AND GOODS BY RAILWAY OOigAiTIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.A deputation representing the four Amalgamated Railways and the Metropolitan Railway waited upon me on the 13th July to ascertain whether the Government would be prepared to promote or support legislation to confer upon the Railway Companies a general power of operating road services.The deputation pointed out the disabilities under which the Railway Companies now stood and the extent to which they were exposed to competition which in their view was partly subsidised out of the looal rates, to which they were them-selves substantial contributors *     They also stated that certain traffics could be more economically and conveniently handled by road and they saw no reason why the Railway Companies should be debarred from participation in this new form of transport, Further, so long aB the Railway Companies were denied road powers it was difficult for them effectively to pursue negotiations with their road competitors as it had been suggested in various quarters that they should do.The deputation explained that the powers which the Railway Companies would desire to secure would be(a) power to operate rjad services subjeot only to thesame restrictions as other persons operating road servioes;(b) power to enter into agreements with and to subscribe towards the capital of road transport undertakings.They stated that they saw no need for any restrictions or regu-lations being imposed upon them in regard to either of these powers, but in the oourse of discussion it appeared that they were prepared to leave any question as to the reasonableness of their rateo by road to the decision of the Railway Rates Tribunal.
I aaid that, speaking for mysolf, I could see no reason why, subject to suitable safeguards, the Railway Companies should not in general &quot;be given extended powers to run road services, although I could not commit the Government without consulting them first.     In reply to an enquiry whether the Government would themselves introduce a Bill for the purpose, I pointed out that the congestion of - the Government timetable would males this impossible.     The deputation intimated that, in these circumstanoes, the Companies proposed themselves to deposit a Bill in the Autumn and desired to know whether they could look for Government support.The question whether the Railway Companies should be given power, to run general road services (a power which some of them already possess in respect of certain areas), even though the traffic has not travelled by rail and is not destined to do so, ia by no means a new one.   It arose acutely in 1922 when the old Ilorth Western and Midland group promoted a Bill in Parliament to take wide powers of this kind.   The whole matter was carefully considered by the Government of that day, upon a memorandum submitted to the then Home Affairs Committee of the Cabinet by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.     As that memorandum sets out facts and arguments which are still relevant, I have thought it well to incorporate the bulk of it below.     It ran as follows:-&quot;Apart from Special Acts the general legal position &quot;appears to be that a Railway Company may run road services &quot; or the conveyance of merchandise and of passengers and their &quot;luggage, provided that the traffio in question has originated &quot;on the Company^ line, or is destined for carriage on it but &quot;not otherwise,     Tho proposal contained in the Bill has &quot;excited acute opposition on the part of owners and users of &quot;mechanically propelled vehiolas and traders and Local &quot;Authorities generally, and I desire the decision of the
Cabinet as to the policy to be adopted when the Bill comes up for second reading,&quot;The following are the arguments in favour of conferring upon Railway Companies the general powers sought by the Bill:-&quot;(a)   The competition of independent road transport has &quot;withdrawn from the railways a considerable bulk of &quot;profitable traffic, and, irrespeotive of the loss &quot;thus caused to the Railway Companies, if the process &quot;continues, there, is danger that the general public &quot;may be damnified by the increase of rates and &quot;charges on the railwayc, the overhead expenses of &quot;which will have to be borne by a smaller quantity &quot;of traffic&quot;(b)    It is alleged on behalf of the Railway Companies &quot;that existing taxation does not impose upon inde-&quot;pendent road transport agencies a fair share of &quot;the costs of maintaining roads; the road transport &quot;undertakings are thus subsidised out of the rates &quot;to which the Railway Companies are heavy contributors, &quot;(o)    It would be an advantage to the general public &quot;and traders that the railways should be able to &quot;forward goods by a route alternative to the railway &quot;when, for example, congested terminals or inter-&quot;mediate transhipment could be avoided. &quot;Against the proposal oontained in the Bill it is &quot;argued that the Railway Companies with their strong financial &quot;position and the advantages which they possess in their &quot;existing equipment and staffing, could run independent road &quot;transport undertakings off the road by undercutting their &quot;charges and oould establish an effeotivo if not a oomplete &quot;monopoly, which would put them in a position either to &quot;withdraw their road services altogether and foroe traffic oat &quot;to their railways or to increase their charges to the &quot;detriment of the public.
&quot;Early in 1921 Sir eric Geddes appointed a &quot;Committee oonsieting of an independent chairman, the &quot;late Mr. J,Balfour Browne, K.G., with two reprseentatives &quot;each of Traders, Railway Companies, owners and users of &quot;mechanically propelled vehicles, and labour to enquire &quot;into the general question.    The result of this &quot;Committee was three separate reports which have been &quot;presented to Parliament, Cmd. 1228,   The Chairman and &quot;the railway representatives reoommended that powers should &quot;be given to the Railway Companies restricted (1) by the &quot;Traffic Acts (l,e. provision of reasonable facilities &quot;and prohibition of undue preference (2) by a clause &quot;similar to Seotion 9 of the Ministry of Transport Act &quot;(separate accounts of the road transport servioe to be &quot;rendered and expenses to be borne by the revenue of the &apos;berviQe) and (3) by the control of charges by the Minister &quot;of Transport,     The Road Transport and the TraderB &quot;representatives Bigned a report opposing the grant of &quot;any such powers to railway companies while one of the &quot;Labour representatives signed a report in favour of the &quot;nationaXisation of transport generally, .&quot;It is necessary to oonsider whether it is possible &quot;to devise such safeguards as will, while enabling the -&quot;railway Companies to secure the powers which they seek, &quot;provide against the establishment of an oppressive &quot;Monopoly either by the Railway Companies alone or by the &quot;Railway Companies in combination with the larger road &quot; transportint erests,&quot;The foilowing safeguards already exist: * &quot;(a) Natural or eoottomiq.    Even If&quot;the Railway &quot;Companies suooeeded in establishing an effective monopoly&quot;&apos; &quot;it would not be possible for thenc;either to withdraw their &quot;road services or to increase their oharges excessively. -&quot;the fate of Canals whioh the Railway Companies are Alleged &quot;to have killed, does rot afford a fair parallel reference if
&quot;the allegation is well founded.     The prevision or re-&quot; starting of a Canal requires a much, larger eutlay of (\capital than is required to start a road transport-service. *There would always be a number of firms owning road &quot;veMcleia^who would be able rapidly to expand and run &quot;services or undercut the Hallway Companies if the Railway * Companies withdrew their oervices or sxoessively lnor eased &quot;their charges.    Furthermore, new road undertakings could&quot;be brought into operation quite quickly.&quot;(h)   Artificial or legisla,^ve.    Under Seotion 58(4) &quot;of the Railways Act the Rates Tribunal, when fixing the &quot;charges necessary to produce the standard revenue for each &quot;oompany is required to prooeed on the assumption that &quot;adequate charges are in operation for all ancillary businesses &quot;carried on by the Railway.Company.     The effect of this &quot;Seotion would-be that, if a Railway Company eo out its &quot;charges for road transport as to make the road servioeenot &quot;self-supporting it oould not re-ooup itself out of the &quot;earnings of its railway, without reducing its net revenue.&quot;The value of this safeguard depends partly on the &quot;speed with whieh it oan be applied, partly on the extent to &quot;whioh it is practlcable to ascertain the true financial &quot;position of an ancillary business by the requirement of&quot;separate accounts, and partly on the interpretation plaoed &quot;by the -tribunal or the Courts on the phrase &quot;adequate &quot;charges&quot;.     With reference to the laBt point it is &quot;oonoeived that the oharges could not be regarded as adequate &quot;unless these were sufficient with due oare and management &quot;to provide, in addition to working-expenses and depreciation, &quot;a rea^onaable return on the oapital,     A Railway Company is&quot;&quot;&quot;however usually in.&quot;a position to raise oapital at a lower &quot;rate than the ordinary ^private-, haulier *&quot;To make this safeguard as fully effoctive as possible &quot;it would be necessary for the Minister to have power to &quot;prescribe statutory forms of aooount and to control their
*cwn^iJ^JLon and to require special returns and statistics, &quot;as might &quot;be necessary, on the lines of the Railway &quot;Companies (Accounts and Re*&apos;irns) Act, 1911, and Seotion 11 &quot;of the Railways Aot, 1921.&quot;The following safeguards are oontained in the Bill:-&quot;(a) The Bill provides that the Company may demand &quot;and take suoh reasonable rates and charges as they think &quot;fit in respect of traffic, and that the provisions of Part &quot;III of the Railways Aot, 1921, shall, so far as they are &quot;applioable, apply to suoh rates and charges, the effect of &quot;this Clause is not completely clear.   It appears -to- mean &quot;that ohargea would be fixed by the Railway Company subject &quot;to the right of Traders to appeal to the Rates Tribunal &quot;against them as unreasonable, but the Companies are &quot;understood to be anxious to plaoate opposition and would &quot;probably apply specifically the principle of fixed standard &quot;charges settled by the Rates Tribunal,     Though the Rates    j &quot;Tribunal is charged with the.duty of reviewing the &quot;reasonableness of the charges of a railway company for &quot;collection and delivery and the proposal contained in the &quot;bill would be to extend this to general road services, it &quot;is oontrary to the policy of the Railways Act to impose &quot;upon the Rates Tribunal the duty of fixing the charges &quot;for any other anoillary servioes, e.g* hotels, steamboats, &quot;and docks.&quot;(b) The Bill further provides that the Railway and &quot;Canal Traffio Acts, 1854 to 1894, in so far as they relate &quot;to reasonable facilities and undue preference, shall apply &quot;to the road traffio.     These provisions with regard to &quot;reasonable facilities would be ineffective and the &quot;safeguard is illusory.&quot;(o) The Bill further provides that the Company shall &quot;provide in their form of accounts furnished under the &quot;Railway Companies Acooun;te and Returns Act, 19Hj an
&quot;abstract of revenue and expenditure in respect of traffic &quot;conveyed under the powers which they seek.    The Accounts &quot;and Returns which would be required have been dealt Mith &quot;in paragraph 6(b) of this memorandum.&quot;Speaking generally I think that though none of &quot;theso proposals embodies a complete safeguard against &quot;abuse their- cumulative effect would be to give considerable &quot;protection to the trader, the road transport undertaking, &quot;and the general public.    I think that when the Bill comes &quot;up for second reading a speech should be made by a &quot;Government representative recognising (a) the fears of the &quot;traders, of owners and users of mechanically propelled &quot;vehicles, and of Local Authorities, (b) the difficulty of &quot;deciding on the principle of the Bill until a Committee had &quot;considered in detail the safeguards which could be devised &quot;to prevent the growth of an oppressive monopoly, ana  (c) &quot;recommending the House to send the Bill to Committee &quot;expressly reserving the decision of the Government until &quot;third reading-(Signed)    ARTHUR K3AL.Ministry of Transport. 28th February, 1922.&quot;The recommenadtiens made in the last paragraph of this memorandum were approved and. a speech was made on the lines indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry in the course of the Second Reading debate. the Government Whips were not put on for the division,-    When the Bill was in Committee evidence was given by Sir- Gocr-ge Beharrell on behalf of the Ministry and in the course of that evidence he criticised the basis of the rates for their road services which the Company proposed to adopt.    The basis was in effect to charge for conveyance by road the rate authorised as the standard charge for conveyance by rail between two points, stripped, of the other
-8-      icomponents of the ordinary railway charge whioh includes amounts for station accommodation etc.     It was pointed out to the Committee that if the Company put itself under obligation to ite traders to carry merchandise on these terms, there would be a general demand for the oonveyance by road of traffic at present oarried on the railways with a consequent diversion of tonnage from rail to road, leaving a smaller tonnage of traffio out of which the overhead charges and the standard revenue fixed under the Railways Aot, 1921, have to be secured.   An alternative basis of charge was propounded for the consideration of the promoters and the Committee, namely, that there should be equal rates for equal facilities afforded to the trader whether by road or rail, always, of course, subject to the rates by road being adequate in relation to cost. The l&amp;niatry&apos;s witness   said that that was the only way which suggested itself to him for keeping the diversion of traffio from rail to a minimum.     The promoters were unable to acoept the alternative basis of oharge or make other proposals to meet the criticism and withdrew their Bill,   The Committee, however, in a special Report, expressed themselves in favour of allowing &quot;the fullest possible participation by the Railway Companies of this group and all competitors in the service of Road Transport.&quot;,&quot;subject to the possibility of eliminating unfair competition,&quot;The problem has now to be reviewed afresh in the light of the oiroumetanoes of the present time.     The Railway Companies are undoubtedly exposed to very serious competition, in respect both of their paesenger and of their goods traffic, from the great network of road services which has grown up all over the country.   It is unlikely that all the Groups can earn their standard revenue under the Railways Act in the near future.    The competition  to whioh they are exposed hits more particularly the better paying traffics which they could perfectly/well handle with no inorease in their capital costs and with very little increase in their operating costs, but with great advantage to their net revenue.    The result muet
inevitably be that the burden of railway rates will bo maintained or even increased on the heavy traffios (coal, iron and ore and other raw materials) whioh-oannot economically pass by road, and this is certainly not in the interest oither of the railways or of trade . This argument is far stronger than it was in 1922.     The argument that the public would derive advantages if the railways were in a position more freely to afford road services is also stronger, and while the recent inorease in the duties on oommeroial lorries should have produoed a greater degree of eoonomio equilibrium as between rail and road, the Companies still maintain, as regards the third argument in Mr. 2Teal&apos;s memorandum, that existing taxation does not impose upon independent road transport agencies a fair share of the oost of maintaining roads.There appears to be no good reason why Railway Companies should be debarred from engaging more extensively in road transport if they are willing to accept neoessary safeguards of the public interest.   The proposal which the   Railway Companies themselves now make is apparently that they should be accorded powers to run road services with no acre statutory regulation or control than if they were ordinary owners of a fleet of lorries.     When I invited them to explain their proposals in detail, they fell baok upon the general principle, but organisations with reeources such as   tlv*ee of   the Amalgamated Railways, which are vested with statutory rights and obligations of all sorts, are not likely to be viewed by Parliament merely in this light.     It seems in any oase that it will be necessary to lay down the principle that they are not to conduct road services at a loss but at rates which wifcll meet the cost of operation and management and a proper return upon capital.   The existing machinery of the Railways Act, which requires the Rates Tribunal in fixing railway charges to Batisfy themselves that the charges in respect of subsidiary and anoillary services are adequate, would, I thfok, require some adaptation and amendment in tho Bill to be effective^ butHhere should be no difficulty in giving expression to this principle or in giving power to tbe Minister to&apos; prescribe a form of aocount which rould truly show the net results
of tbe operation of road transport services, and perhaps of individual road services, ae distinct from other services performed by the Railways (including the separate service of collection and delivery of goods whioh have travelled or are going to travel by railway).   I do not think that the Railway Companies could reasonablyresist provisions of this kind, and at the same time claim to retain the advantages of the Railways Aot by which they are entitled toask that railway chargea should, together with their other sources of revenue, be so fixed as to yield their standard revenue.The next important point is whether any basis of the rates to be charged by road is to be laid down other than the principlewhioh I have just mentioned at one end of the scale and itscorollary, namely, a protection against excessive rates by grantingan appeal as to reasonableness, at the other -end of the scale.   Xdo not suppose that the old theory of &quot;stripped&quot; rates which waselaborated-in the course of the evidence on the North WesternRailway Bill will be revived, nor is it easy to see any other alternative than(i) the principle of equal charges fo* equal facilities, which the Companies would probably not accept;(ii) some scheme of maximum charges per ton per mile(with an appropriate classification of goods) to be laid down in the Bill, with power of revision by the Minister,(iii) leaving the Companies free to quote suoh competitive rates as they wish, subject to the two principles of adequacy of charges and protection against excessive charges and subject to such obligations and restrictions as may be practicable and desirable.It then becomes necessary to contemplate the situation which may result from suoh latitude.     It is possible that the companies would not only attract to their new road services traffic nowpassing by road but would be forced into making a transfer oftraffic from railway to road.     If they quote rates lower than their present rail rates, this must indeed happen.    Thestruggle with their road competitors would then be fought outno longer on the rival fields of rail and road but largely uponthe roads themselves.   The stimulus to bring about lower rates onthe railway by resort to every possible form of economy that can
bo devised-would also be weakened.   In so far as-such-a-transfer of traffic took plaoe on a substantial- scale, the wear and tear of the roads and highway-expenditure would be increased and this is a national aspect of the question which cannot be ignored.     The Railway Companies&apos; answer on this point was that they would not transfer to the roads any traffio which they could retain on the railways and for the rest that more and more traffio will inevitably drift to the roadB0   They admit that some of their traffio from the nature of the case will go to ths roads as it can be more suitably, speedily and economically handled there, but they also contend that the drift will be magnified and accelerated unless the Government either increase the rates of taxation on commercial goods vohicles or, alternatively the road transport undertakings are subjected to some form of statutpry regulation and control such as is imposed upon the Railway Companies themselves.   At present road carriers are in effect free to pick and choose whatever traffio suits or pays them best, while the Railway Companies are obliged to carry what is offered to their railways.The exact limitations and conditions which oaa or ought to be made applicable to any road transport powers conferred upon railway oompanies form a very difficult problem which will have to be oonsidered further during the next few months.     Many of the limitations or conditions which oan be imposed upon a system of road transport in the hands of a railway oompany are equally applicable to a corresponding system of road transport owned by any other person.     It is only the faot that railway companies have to come to Parliament for powers that enables conditions to be imposed, but this ability to impose oonditions is not in itself a Justification for imposing them.     The Justification must be found in the publio interest.     It iB obvious that there may be much waste of capital and unnecessary wear of the roads before competition, whether between existing road transport agencies or between those agencies and the railway copopanioSf if the latter ba authorised to compete, has led to the inevitable result of &quot;districting&quot; J;he areas to be served by different interests.
-12- 15 7The risk of a railway company &quot;being able to establish a monopoly of carriage by road while not to be overlooked, can be exaggerated, for reasons already pointed, out, and probably the more serious question is whether some control of all road services,freight as well as passenger will not have to be introduced unless the roads of the oountry are to be brought to a state of chaos and much unnecessary expenditures incurredsAs regards the second proposal of the Railway Companies that they should be allowod to invest in transport underbp-ki:jgs, this is presumably an alternative policy to the direct op^t&amp;vxa of road services which some of the Companies may prefer to ad-opt*--*If Parliament were disposed to permit this, I think that it should be stipulated that each Company should show clearly in itB accounts the extent to which it has embarked its capital in road transport undertakings and the amount so embarked and the return received in respect of each partioular undertaking,    It would not in my opinion be right that a statutory under-taking like the London Midland and Soottish Railway, for example, should be allowed to own and oontrol a number of other transport undsx-takings up and down the country and to merge the results of the investment in some general item of their accounts,,   Moreover schemes of financial control of this kind would enable the companies to avoid any regulation imposed on their direct services and if developed would render more acute the problem to which I hare just referred.I should add as a matter of interest that the running $f road vehicles by Railway Cossr-anies has been the subject of reoent legislation passed by the two Irish, Parliaments.    In each case powers have been conferred upon the Railway Companies to run road services for the conveyance of both Passangers and Goods, but whereas in  for them Ireland unrestricted powers (apart from the general law as to read vehicles) have been conferred on the companies, in Southern Ireland the running of road services by Railway Companies is subject to approval by the Minister of
-i3- 258Industry &amp; .commerce as regards routes, charges and accounts, and is in other ways restricted and regulated.To sum up, my conclusions and recommendations are asfollows: -1,     That my intimation to the Railway Companies that inthe state of the timetable the Government would not be able to find time for a Government Bill enlarging the powers of the Railway Companies in the matter of the right to run road services should be confirmed.2,     That I should be authorised to inform the Companies that in principle the Government has na objection to an extension of their powers in this mattor- and. will be prepared in due course to advise Parliament to that effect, but that this general concurrence is subject to adequate safeguards of the public interest being introduced into the Bill.3*     That in the absence of further information as to the detailed proposals which the Companies have in mind it iB not possible to specify what safeguards would be regarded as adequate.     Provision must at any rate be made for ensuring that the rates charged by road while not excessive to- the user are also adequate to cover the cost of management and operation including a reasonable return upon the capital invested and that the appropriate forms of account may be prescribed by the Minister to ensure that the necessary information it.  *.vailable.     Meanwhile, I propose to give coneidera-tion to the extent of any furoher regulation or controlo4,     That if Parliament sees fit to grant power to Railway Companies to invest capital in roaxl transport undertakings, it.should be provided that the amount invested in eaoh undertaking and the result of the investment should be shown.
Ministry of Transport. l6th July, 1927.The Hallway Companies inform me that no objection to their proposals need he anticipated from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and this is not surprising.   In the Companies1 view little opposition would &quot;be raised in any quarter, hut Z do not think that it would he safe to assume that the proposals will not meet with strong opposition from the Commercial Motor Users and possibly also from bodies of Traders.    Within the limito which I have indicated, the Railway Companies, whose present difficulties may be aggravated by future development of road transport, are in my view entitled to support from the Government, and some declaration of the Governments attitude will no doubt be necessary on the Second Reading of the Bill.     By that time there will be some indication of the attitude of their competitors, parties direotly affected by the proposals, the traders and the highway-authorities, all of whom are also entitled to consideration. In view of the approaching Parliamentary reoess it has been necessary for me to oirculate this Memorandum within two Says of my first hearing of the Railway Companies1 intentions and many of the points raised will have to be examined further in detail,(intd.)
