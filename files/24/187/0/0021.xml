[This Document is the Property of Hit Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1927.SECRET. CCS. 94.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 804-B.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.WEI-HAI-WEI DEFENCE OF. REPORT.ON our recommendation the Prime Minister recently referred to the Oversea Defence Committee the question of the defence of Wei-nai-wei in the event of a serious situation arising owing to Nationalist forces penetrating into the Province of Shantung.The Oversea Defence Committee have now reported on this question, and their Memorandum, which is printed as an Appendix to this report, was considered by us at our 56th Meeting, on the 31st May, 1927.2. The first consideration to which we would draw attention is that, when the question of defending Wei-hai-wei was raised by the Foreign Office a month ago, there appeared to be a strong probability that in the event of considerable further successes-by the Southern Chinese Forces, Pekin and Tientsin would be evacuated by British nationals and troops, and that Wei-hai-wei might become the base of our diplomatic representative in China.Meanwhile the situation has changed. Although the Nationalist armies are now continuing their northward advance, and the possibility of their reaching Pekin and Tientsin has increased rather than diminished, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is now in favour of retaining the Legation at Peking as long as possible, and of withdrawing it, should the necessity arise, to Tientsin rather than to Wei-hai-wei.* *The contingency on which the Oversea Defence Committee were asked to report has, therefore, become more remote.3. We are in entire agreement with the conclusions arrived at by the Oversea Defence Committee in paragraph 12 of their Memorandum (Annexure I), but we would emphasise &quot;that these must be regarded as an academic appreciation of the situation, and that the actual plan of defence and the size of the force required to give effect to it must be left to the discretion of the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding in China.(Signed) BEATTY.G.

ANNEXURE.SECRET. - Copy No.C.O.S. 92.(Also O.D.C. Paper No. 532-M.)WEI-HAI-WEI:   DEFENCE OF.Memorandum by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.1. THE Prime Minister, on the recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, has referred to the Oversea Defence Committee the question of the defence of Wei-hai-wei in the event of a serious situation arising owing to Nationalist forces penetrating into the Province of Shantung.A joint memorandum by the Foreign Office and Colonial Office on this subject is printed as an Appendix.Description of the Territory.   (Reference :  1&quot; Map I.D.W.O. No. 1878, corrected to January 1908.)2. (a.) The Leased Territory.Comprises Liu-Kung-tao (often called the Island of Wei-hai-wei), all the islands in Wei-hai-wei bay, and a belt of land 10 miles wide along the entire coast line of the bay. The total area is about 285 square miles and the native population about 150,000.(b.) Zone of Influence.By Convention there is a &quot; zone of British influence &quot; lying east of meridian 121c 40&apos; (see dotted line on map), extending over an area of 1,650 square miles. Within this zone Great Britain has the &quot; right to erect fortifications, station troops, or take any other measures necessary for defensive purposes, and to acquire .... such sites as may be necessary for water supply, communication, and hospitals. Chinese administra-tion will not be interfered with, but no troops other than Chinese or British shall be allowed therein.&apos;&apos;3. General Physical Aspect.The surface of the neighbouring country consists of abrupt ranges of rugged hills, rising to a height of 1,600 feet, and well cultivated valleys, watered by streams, which are dry during the greater part of the year. All the hills are terraced for cultivation, but their general appearance is barren.Roads.Three roads lead to Wei-hai-wei from the west and south. They are as follows : (a.) From Chefoo via Ning Hai Chou.This road follows the north coastline of the Shantung Peninsula. Outside the leased territory it is only fit for pack, coolie and wheelbarrow. -Inside the leased territory it is 10 feet wide and fit for wheeled transport.
(b.) From Wei-Hsien via Lai Yang Hsien.This road links with (a) at Wei-Hsien. The Wei-Hsien-Lai Yang sector is fit for carts; from Lai Yang to Wei-hai-wei it is only a pack and wheelbarrow road.(c.) Tsing-Tao-W en-teng Hsien-Wei-hai-wei.This road follows the south coastline of the Shantung Peninsula. The section from Chi-mo-Hsien to Chen-Chia-kow (24  miles) is passable for carts and wheeled artillery. From Chen-Chia-kow to a point 17  miles outside Wei-hai-wei the road is only fit for pack and wheelbarrows. From 17^ miles into Wei-hai-wei the road is again fit for carts and wheeled artillery.4. Climate.The climate of Wei-hai-wei is the best in all China. The summer heat is never excessive (mean temperature 76-5&quot;).; during the winter, which is intensely cold, dry, bracing and exhilarating, special fur-lined clothing is necessary for troops, and ships are liable to be ice-bound. The usual rainy season is from June to September inclusive; during this period a camping ground is apt to get damp and foul.5. Places of British Importance.The important places, so far as the British occupation is concerned, are concentrated in the Northern part of the Wei-hai-wei peninsula, and in the Liu-Kung-tao Island. In the former a convalescent depot is to be established in the neighbourhood of Port Edward, and in the latter there are certain naval establish-ments.It is obvious that the control of the whole of the Leased Territory would be difficult, except with very large forces, and, in view of the location of the British interests already referred to, would be unnecessary. The Committee, therefore, suggest that it would suffice to secure the limited area mentioned above. The native population of this area is about 10,000.Possible Forms of Attack.6.   The types of attack to which British interests might be subjected are : (a.) By local bandits inflamed by anti-British propaganda.(b.) By a general anti-foreign rising, supported by Nationalist military forces..7. As regards (a), the Committee are informed that the local police are not to be relied on to maintain order in these circumstances, but they consider that the one battalion which it has been decided to send to Wei-hai-wei as an escort for the convalescent depot should suffice to maintain order in the area required.8. As regards (&amp;), the menace would be more serious, but it must be realised that the Nationalist military forces which could support an anti-British rising at Wei-hai-wei would be very inconsiderable. For one thing, the approaches to the Leased Territory do not lend themselves to the movement of troops. The roads are few and bad, and the country is difficult. For this reason, very little, if any, artillery is likely to be employed against us.Moreover, Wei-hai-wei is, so far as the Nationalists are concerned, a cul-de-sac, and leads nowhere. It is a long way from where their main forces would be operating, and it is very doubtful if they would consider it advisable to detach any considerable force for an attack on Wei-hai-wei, while the military and financial objectives within the Leased Territory are not sufficiently attractive to overcome this drawback.For these reasons, it is&quot; not expected that a military force larger than a Brigade would be used to support any anti-foreign rising.Defence Requirements.9. In order to secure the northern end of the Wei-hai-wei peninsula, it will be necessary (a) To keep the aggressors south.of a selected line; and(b) To maintain order north of that line.[16223] b 2
As regards (a), the Committee suggest that the line of the high ground running from Chien-feng-hsi through Hou-li-Kou to Mangtao would be suitable.This line is about 12,000 yards in length, but 6,000 yards of it is in broken hilly ground with difficult approaches, and in the rainy season (June to September) practically the whole frontage is covered by streams running east and west from the centre. The western flank of this line is also covered by marshes, which account for some 3,000 yards of front.In the circumstances envisaged, two battalions with one Pack Battery, and supported by warships on the flanks, should suffice to keep any probable enemy south of this line.In connection with Naval co-operation the Committee would draw attention to the fact that in winter ships are liable to be immobilised at Wei-hai-wei owing to ice.Some aircraft would also be required for reconnaissance and army co-operation purposes.Data regarding aerodromes at Wei-hai-wei are at present lacking, but the Admiralty have telegraphed to the Naval Commander-in-Chief, China, for further information.The Committee suggest that in the event of British troops having to oppose an organised attack on Wei-hai-wei it might be desirable to locate say one Flight of British fighters on the mainland at Wei-hai-wei. If, however, no suitable aerodromes or landing grounds are available the requisite aircraft would have to operate from carriers or on floats.As regards (b). the Committee are of opinion that one Battalion ehoxild suffice to keep order in the area north of this line.10. The Necessity for Suitable Winter Accommodation for Troops.So far as can be judged all existing accommodation and more would be required for the force of 3 Battalions, 1 pack battery and the Air Force detachment, and the Committee would emphasise the importance of providing suitable winter billets owing to the severity of the climate. They suggest that the presence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister and the whole Legation staff would not only involve an additional military commitment, but would also seriously complicate the accommodation problem.11. Water Supply.Assuming that the necessary accommodation could be provided for the force suggested above, and supply by sea could be arranged (with due regard to the possibility of Port Edward being icebound during the winter), the water supply situation does not appear to be satisfactory and the Committee would invite attention to a recent telegram from the Officer Commanding Troops, Tientsin (No. C.R. 518, dated the 14th May), in which it is stated that water at Wei-hai-wei is lacking and that if troops were located there the supply would have to be improved by means of deep bores.12. Summary of Conchisions.The Committee are of opinion that (a.) The defence of the northern portion of the Wei-hai-wei peninsula and of the Island of Liu-Kung-tao is practicable.(6.) For maintenance of order in this portion and defence against local bandits one battalion should suffice.(c.) For maintenance of order in this portion and defence against a general anti-foreign rising, supported by a small force of Nationalist troops, a minimum of 3 battalions and 1 pack battery, assisted by Naval gun-fire, and a detachment of aircraft would be needed. The possibility of ships being immobilised by ice must, however, be borne in mind.(d.) Whether the above troops can be found from forces nowr in the Far East will depend on the general situation prevailing at the time.(e.) The presence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister in the Colony would seriously complicate the accommodation problem, since all the existing accommoda-tion and more would be required for the troops mentioned in (b) and (c) above. His presence would also involve an additional military commit-ment, and would thus prove an embarrassment.
(/.) The evacuation of the remainder of the Leased Territory outside the defensive zone would be advisable in the event of the situation deteriorating.(Signed) G. N. MACREADY, Secretary,Oversea Defence Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, May 23, 1927.APPENDIX TO ANNEXURE.C.O.S. 89. (Revise.)DEFENCE OF WEI-HAI-WEI.Joint Memorandum by the Foreign Office and Colonial Office.SIR MILES LAMPSON has now been told that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to undertake alone the defence of Peking and Tientsin; that the maximum contribution which can be made is one brigade, and that the use of this brigade for this purpose is dependent on the provision by the other Powers of the balance of two divisions. He has also been informed that, failing a satisfactory response to the representations which have been made to Tokyo and Washington, his existing instructions must stand, namely, to evacuate Peking and Tientsin in the event of danger of which he is the only possible judge. (C.I.D. Paper No. 791-B and Cabinet 27 (27), Conclusion 1, of the 13th April, 1927.)It is understood that Sir Miles Lampson has already outlined a scheme of evacuation for Peking and Tientsin in case of emergency, but where the persons evacuated are to go, particularly the Legation Staff, is not yet settled. He himself recommends the withdrawal of the Legation to Wei-hai-wei. This recommendation is now under consideration of the Foreign Office, and it is by no means certain that they will approve it. But this possibility increases the urgency for considering how far Wei-hai-wei can be defended. The attached correspondence* with the Commis-sioner of Wei-hai-wei shows that, while the conditions at present are normal, a serious situation might arise in the event of Nationalist forces penetrating into Shantung. Before instructions can be sent to the Commissioner for his guidance in case of emergency, the Cabinet will doubtless desire to be informed of the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff from the naval and military aspects of the problem. It is requested, therefore, that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to consider this correspondence, and to state (1) whether in their view it would be practicable to defend the whole or part of the mainland territory of Wei-hai-wei (in this connection reference is invited to O.D.C. Paper No. 660-R, dated the 25th June, 1914, on the subject of the defence scheme for Wei-hai-wei);(2.) if not, whether they are of opinion that the European and loyal Chinese should be evacuated in case of danger to the island of Liukung, and the Island defended, or(3) whether they recommend total evacuation, and if so, what arrangements should be made for the evacuation to be carried out.In the event of the answer to (1) being favourable, it is requested that they will state what additional forces, if any, would be necessary if it should be decided to remove to Wei-hai-wei the British Legation at Peking. In this connection attention is drawn to the attached correspondencet with His Majesty&apos;s Minister.May 4, 1927.* Enclosures No. 1 to No. 4. t Enclosures No. 5 to No. 12.
Enclosure No. 2 to Appendix.Decypher Telegram from the Commissioner of Wei-hai-wei to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated April 7, 1927.YOUR telegram of 5th April. Permanent European population in this territory 68 men, 43 women, 12 children, total comprises 26 on island, 96 in Port Edward, [ ?] one in [ ?] interior of territory. European population very much greater during normal summer season. No difficulty about concentration, but if evacuation to Island became necessary, accommodation would be inadequate and foodstuffs might fail. Wei-hai-wei at present quite peaceful and friendly. I received warm welcome on arrival.But anticipate most serious trouble from anti-British propaganda and agitation and armed civilians if Canton party or allies get Control of Eastern Shantung.Our defenceless condition with less than forty British troops and without a warship is no doubt known to the Southern spy organisation. Commissioners secret despatch of 12th July, 1913, still applicable. Most hazardous to entrust European lives to the Chinese police, who in view of [ ?] approaching return of Wei-hai-wei to China would not offer serious resistance to anti-British action. I am strongly opposed to proposal of Officer Commanding at f ? j Tientsin to withdraw contingent as it helps to stiffen moral of police, maintain British prestige and overawe bad characters. We have no automobile or telephone communications in territory and might have no warning of raid on Port Edward. Therefore strongly urge that in addition to contingent of troops at least one of His Majesty&apos;s ships should be stationed at Wei-hai-wei to discourage possible invaders or cover evacuation of foreigners and loyal Chinese to island and also keep us in touch with other ports by wireless. At present our only means of telegraph communication is by land wire in Chinese hands. Our only source of political information even in respect of Shantung is newspaper several days old.Enclosure No. 3 to Appendix.Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Commissioner,Wei-hai-wei, dated April 25, 1927.YOUR telegram 7th April. Defence problem has been complicated by proposals in Peking telegrams Nos. 684 and 745 on which decision has not yet been given. I expect decision shortly and will then refer question to our naval and military advisers in order that full instructions may be sent to you as soon as possible for guidance if and when emergency arises. May I take it that you have no further developments to report.

No further development I await instructions.Cypher Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Commissioner;Wei-hai-wei, dated April 5, 1927.IN view of the possibility of advent of agitators in Northern China, I should be glad to learn whether you have any particular reason for anticipating trouble in your territory and to receive any observations you have to make on the subject. Report approximate number of Europeans now in territory, giving men, women and children separately. Are there any Europeans in interior of territory whom it would be difficult to concentrate in the event of trouble. Amery.
Enclosure No. 5 to Appendix. ^Decypher Telegram from Sir M. Lampson, Peking, No. 684, dated April 13, 1927.YOUR telegram No. 237* of 5th April: Shanghai, Peking and Tientsin.While I await decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to my telegram No. 634* of 7th April, and my telegram No. 642* of 8th April, before giving any public indication that evacuation of Tientsin and withdrawal of Legation from Peking are under contemplation, I am taking preliminary steps to organise evacuation in case of need.Scheme proposed is based on following appreciation by military attache&quot; of military position: &quot; Military clanger points for Chang&apos;s defence of the capital are Tientsin-Pukow line and Suiyuan line. The latter, owing to distances, difficult country and lack of munitions of war in the hands of Feng Yu-hsiang, is not of such importance as former. In other words, evacuation of Peking and metropolitan province is likely to be forced on Tientsin-Pukow line rather than on Suiyuan line. Internal Manchurian trouble might also contribute to an earlier evacuation by Fengtien troops than actual military situation south of wall requires. The present dispositions of Manchurian army on Pehan line cause holding of following places on Tsinpu line to be of the utmost importance to Fengtien troops : &quot;1. Huai River line through Peng-pu. &quot;2. Junction at Hsu-chow-fu.&quot; 3. Yellow River line, which any decent army could hold against Cantonese army for a considerable period.&quot; Presuming these three lines fall it wall be only a matter of time before both Tientsin and Peking are in the hands of the South and Manchurian troops are all out of Chihli.&apos;&apos; The fall of line 1 will produce little change of dispositions; 2 wall cause Fengtien army to retire behind Yellow River line; 3 will cause Fengtien army to block the whole railway system in their efforts to get north wall.&quot;With this opinion as a basis I have set up general committee composed of members of Legation to supervise evacuation of entire British community in North China. A sub-committee is considering evacuation of Peking, and His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Tientsin is being instructed to organise similar committee: (a) for Tientsin, and (b) for Tientsin-Chin-wang-tao Railway.Detailed plans have already been sketched out for evacuation of Peking, which, owing to its distance from the sea, is most exposed and difficult to evacuate. Question falls into two parts: (a) Evacuation of non-official British community, and (&amp;) evacuation of Legation and staff.Point which must be decided before further progress can be made with (b) is place to which Legation is to be retired. Place chosen should, if possible, be one which will not in turn have to be evacuated and where the protection of British forces will be available as and when required. Alternatives appear to be Tientsin, Peitaho (where there is already some housing accommodation, though far too limited, and entirely devoid of such necessary facilities as telephones and adequate telegraphic communications, &amp;c), Wei-hai-wei and Shanghai. I think it would be preferable on general grounds that Legation should, if possible, be at some other place than Shanghai. Of other places, Tientsin and Peitaho depend on whether or not we are going to evacuate whole of North China, but neither of them appears to me as particularly suitable. To go to Wei-hai-wei would in some respects be anomalous, but whole situation is anomalous, and Wei-hai-wei would at least be defensible. On the whole I favour Wei-hai-wei, and should be glad to learn of your concurrence as soon as possible, as plans must be made in advance.It is proposed that evacuation of Peking should be carried out in three stages : 1. On fall of Huai River the major portion of archives to be sent to Tientsin. At the same time bulky private property&apos; and articles of value to be. sent to the same place. Non-official British subjects to be advised to leave Peking.* Not printed.
2. On the fall of Hsu-chow-fu, women and children evacuated and all property-other than essentials to be sent away.3. On fall of Yellow River, all non-official British subjects to be told to leave-and Legation staff evacuated gradually by motor to Tientsin and thence to whatever place has been chosen as Legation site.It is proposed to have officers watching various fronts so as to advise when the moment has come to put each stage into operation, and thus avoid unnecessary movement.  This will be arranged by military attache.As evacuation of Peking would cause congestion in Tientsin, which place would also seek safety, Admiralty should supply continued schedule of normal north coast river sailings and should have special ship for refugees in readiness at Taku bar. Arrangements will also have to be made to commandeer tugs and lighters at Tientsin. Chin-wang-tao could be used for embarkation of part of community. I recommend general shipping committee be established at once in Tientsin with a naval transport officer attached.Arrangements will have also to be made to house Legation at whatever port is decided on.I wish to emphasise that this is merely a precaution. Any impression of panic or any unnecessary evacuation is to be deprecated. The only part of scheme which I am at present communicating to British community here is arrangement for successive evacuation in case of need of non-official British community in Peking.(Repeated to Shanghai Commander-in-chief, Tientsin and Wei-hai-wei.)Enclosure No. 6 to Appendix. Cypher Telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 296, dated April 17, 1927. YOUR telegram No. 684 of 13th April.Before coming to any decision on your proposal for the eventual withdrawal, in case of absolute necessity, of His Majesty&apos;s Legation to Wei-hai-wei, I should be glad of your further views in the light of the following considerations: 1. The position at Wei-hai-wei seems to be rather insecure at present and liable to menace from bandit attacks and other local trouble.2. WithdraAval to that place, would be tantamount to withdrawal from China altogether.3. By selecting Wei-hai-wei you would presumably be altogether out of touch with your diplomatic colleagues, who could presumably not withdraw to that place.Do you know what your colleagues&apos; views are about a possible withdrawal from Peking ? Are they making any plans or arrangements for such an eventuality, and if so have they, or the majority of them, any place in view? If, for instance, there were a general feeling in favour of moving to Peitaho, would it not be advisable for you to keep that place in mind rather than Wei-hai-wei, provided always that satisfactory arrangements can be made for its defence ?Please consider these points and let me have your further views.Enclosure No. 7 to Appendix. Decypher Telegram from Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 744, dated April 20, 1927.FOLLOWING is repetition of telegram from Wei-hai-wei in reply to enquiry from me regarding practicability of housing Legation.in case of need :-&quot; Your telegram of 12th April.&quot;It would just be possible for Legation staff and families to be accommodated in private houses of official and unofficial residents and in former officers&apos;mess, empty, but only lent to Government by the War Office. Another plan would be to commandeer King&apos;s Hotel, which would necessitate cancelling of reservations by summer visitor0 who will soon be beginning to arrive.  Officers&apos;
mess is unfurnished, but hotel might be able to supply essentials. Question of number of troops to be stationed here has to be considered, as barrack&quot; accommodation is limited.&quot; At present we are practically defenceless, as we have no ship and only thirty-three troops, which officer commanding wishes to withdraw from commission.&quot;(Repeated to Shanghai, Commander-in-chief, Tientsin.)Enclosure No. 8 to Appendix.Decypher Telegram from, Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 745, dated April 20, 1927.YOUR telegram No. 296.Following is opinion of military attache : &quot; Peitaho would not only be hard to defend but also might be actual battle-field (witness Wu Pei-fu versus Chang Tso-lin struggle thereabouts in 1924).&quot; I cannot think bandit menace at Wei-hai-wei can be much; in any case, Minister would have his guard as in Peking, and warship can come close in to support of soldiers.&apos;&apos; Unlike Peitaho, Wei-hai-wei is off main line of advance from any important place. Great advantage of Wei-hai-wei is, to my mind, that it does away with possibility of further [ ? groups omitted] such as might have to be undertaken at Peitaho.&quot;The above advice strikes me as very sound. There are additional arguments against Peitaho : 1. That housing and general facilities are quite inadequate, as already stated inmy previous telegram; 2. That there is no jetty and no facilities for embarking of any kind, and a sudden evacuation might prove of greatest difficulty, and even in bad weather an impossibility; 3. That, if Tientsin is not to be defended, much less will Peitaho be.The only one of my colleagues who seems to have any views at all so far is American Minister. He hints that if he has to withdraw his Legation he may leave China altogether as unfit to deal with any further. He seemed surprised when I told him that was in the highest degree unlikely in our case; work to be done would remain just the same, no matter where Legation moved to.His Majesty&apos;s Government having firmly placed responsibility for evacuation on my shoulders, I am not prepared to leave anything to chance and then lay myself open to a subsequent charge of negligence if things go wrong. I am anxious, therefore, to have everything cut and dried and not to get tied up waiting for others to make up their minds, which they will probably not do until the last moment.If decision had been to defend Tientsin whole picture would have been different, but as matters stand at present there can now be no question of all Legations moving-down there, which otherwise probably would have been the- solution. Consequently I must base my plans on some other point, and I still think that Wei-hai-wei should be the point. It is to some extent central; my idea would be to [ ? group omitted] Legations there, where there would be no further anxiety as to their safety, and then be free to move about myself north or south as need arose. I still hold that this is the right decision.You will of course realise that no one can attempt to say whether withdrawal of Legation from Peking will or will not be necessary. Estimates vary from day to day, and all these elaborate arrangements might prove in the event to have been premature. But that does not mean that we should not be fully prepared and ready in advance to move quickly in case need should arise.(Repeated to Shanghai for Commander-in-chief, Wei-hai-wei, Tientsin.)[16223]c
Enclosure No. 10 to Appendix. Code Telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 342, dated May 3, 1927.YOUR telegrams Nos. 684, 745 and 750 : Evacuation of Peking and Tientsin.1. Evacuation of Tientsin being a disaster second only in magnitude to the evacuation of Shanghai, the residents would naturally wish to postpone until the danger became very pressing. It seems possible, therefore, that a situation may arise making it advisable to evacuate Peking, which is far inland, but in which it might be possible to remain in Tientsin, Pei Tao-ho and other places on the coast for a considerable time longer. If you agree with this view would it not be advisable to prepare alternative plans for a preliminary evacuation of Peking only, via Tien-tsin and the coast ?2. If Tientsin also must be evacuated, would it really be of any use to maintain a Legation at Wei-hai-wei, where you would be out of touch with, any Chinese Government and any other Legation 1 Would it not be better for you to establish yourself with a small nucleus staff at Shanghai other members of the staff being either sent where they are required or sent to safety ?3. Archives should be divided into three categories : (a) To be destroyed; (b) to be stored on board one of His Majesty&apos;s ships or in Japan; (c) absolutely requisite documents and cyphers to be taken with you.4. Movable property must be dealt with by owners at their own discretion,, and Government property should be salvaged to the extent and in the manner which time and transport may allow. *5. I agree that plans should be prepared for such eventualities, but recent events are reassuring regarding stability of position in the North and safety of foreigners. We certainly shall not be justified at this stage in commandeering hotel at Wei-hai-wei, both on account of the expense and of the panic which such premature action would almost certainly cause.Decode Telegram from Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 750, dated April 21, 1927.FOLLOWING addressed to Tientsin, No. 6 :-&quot; Your unnumbered telegram of 18th April.&quot; While no action can be taken pending decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it may help you in considering possible accommodation to have the following estimate of requirements of the Legation and Legation guard : &quot; Office accommodation for Legation staff: Thirty-four rooms for offices, waiting-room, messenger, &amp;o, including one for wireless operator, one for two persons, one for three, two for four, and one for five. In addition to these thirty-four offices, a strong-room and archives room would be required.Residence accommodation for Legation staff: Married members of the staff whose wives would probably be with them are the following. Children, if any, are indicated by number after each name: Myself (3), military attache (1), commercial councillor, Chinese secretary, assistant Chinese secretary, second secretary, consul, vice-consul (1), private secretary, language officer (1), archives officer, clerical officer, attache^ constable, chancery attendant. Number of officers unmarried or unaccompanied by wives is 21, including councillor and second secretary.&quot;Accommodation necessary for 5 lady stenographers, 1 English governess, and 3 English maids. f&quot; In addition, there is a Chinese staff consisting of 3 clerks, 4 writers, and between 20 and 30 messengers and servants.&quot;Legation guards: Three married officers accompanied by wives, 3 children, 2 single officers, 6 married warrant officers or non-commissioned officers, accompanied by wives, 13 children of non-commissioned officers, 170 unmarried non-commissioned officers and men, 1 Russian driver, 12 Chinese personnel.&quot; Above represents maximum requirements. No doubt arrangements could be made to occupy less office space if absolutely necessary.&quot;

Lampson (Peking), No. 836, dated May, 9, 1927. YOUR telegram No. 342, paragraph 1.On my instructions two plans are being worked out for evacuation of North China (a.) On basis that, while all other towns, including Peking, will be evacuated,Tientsin will be held with adequate force against all emergencies. (&amp;.) On basis that Tientsin is also to be evacuated if threatened.I think we should do well definitely to eliminate the possibility of holding on at Pei Tai-ho and other places on the coast. Chang Tso-lin told me 4th May that a large body of so-called brigands, numbering about 1,500 and organised by South, is at present operating between Chin Wang-tao and Pei Tai-ho in an attempt to sever communication with Manchuria. But, quite apart from this, question is, in so far as Legation is concerned, one of general principle. If Tientsin is to be held Legation could and should obviously go there in the first instance. But it is surely most undesirable that Legation should keep retreating from place to place. I feel strongly, therefore, that if evacuation of Peking becomes necessary and Tientsin is net to be held Legation should be transferred straight away to some other place outside the area of possible evacuation where it will be secure and can be kept together.The whole question thus depends on the fate of Tientsin.While I still earnestly trust that means will be forthcoming for its adequate defence, thus making possible scheme (a) above, I feel bound, so long as there is no decision to hold Tientsin, to make arrangements in accordance with scheme (b).Paragraph 2. I am entirely opposed to splitting up the staff. The only place where they are required is at the seat of Legation, and we already have our work cut out to keep level. My view, therefore, is that Legation move and continue to exist as a body.As to place, I am rather averse to having Legation established in the atmosphere of Shanghai. My feeling is that the necessary detached view would be less easy to maintain there than elsewhere. I do not consider I should be more out of touch with any future Chinese Government or with other Legations at Wei-hai-wei than Shanghai; frequent visits to Shanghai would remain very desirable, just as they are at present, and my idea would be to visit other places also as seemed expedient.Paragraph 3 presents no difficulties.Paragraph 4. All possible prearrangements are being made, but if we have to move it may be at short notice, and some things may have to be abandoned. Bulky objects are not easily movable, such as pianos, bedsteads, &amp;c. If anything has to be left it is only right that staff should look to His Majesty&apos;s Government for adequate compensation.Paragraph 5. It would be most unwise to place reliance on present appearances. For the present, strategical position of the North has apparently improved, but it may just as quickly deteriorate. There is a general expectation in foreign circles here that it will do so sooner or later; that is entirely guess-work, but military attache puts it as some time in June. We should be altogether wrong to relax our preparations, however devoutly we may all hope and pray that they may never have to be actually applied. &apos;Unless instructed to the contrary, I shall continue to base my plans on moving Legation to Wei-hai-wei. (Repeated to Tientsin.)
in which such emergency may arise, and (b) there are military considerations regarding defence of Wei-hai-wei and presence of Legation there; (6) is now being investigated by Committee of Imperial Defence.Opinion of War Office is that the presence of the Legation would seriously complicate accommodation problem, since if territory is to be defended against serious attack, all existing accommodation would be required for troops. Also presence of Legation would involve additional military commitment, which might prove embarrassing.I must therefore warn you that there may still be serious objections to the execution of your plan, and that best and safest place for Legation may after all prove to be under the defence of our troops at Shanghai.Question of compensation is being discussed with Treasury.\
