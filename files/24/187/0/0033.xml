3. The weekly rates of Unemployment be refit payable in the case of Juveniles aged 18-21 are in lino with the rates recommended by the Blaresburgh Committee but represent s suhstantif 1 reduction vs compared v/ith tho existing rates.*     While: the contributions payable in respect oi such young persons have &amp;lso been reduced, the reduction in contributions is by no means proportionate to the reduction in benefits,  and it may be found necessary &quot;t a later stage to make some  concession as regards the juvenile rates of benefit.4- The Cabinet will observe that under Clause 5(5)if en insured contributor who is in receipt of a Disability Pension can prove that the non-fulfilment ijn his case of the first statutory condition is due to his disability, he is to be admitted to full benefit if net less than 15 cont ri but ions have been paid in respect&apos; of him ts an insured contributor curing the previous two years, instead of the 30 contributions required in the ordinary case.      The Committee consider that it may be necessary to reduce the minimum 15 contributions to a minimum of 10 contributions, but no further concession in respect of disabled ex-Service men should,  In their opinion, be entertained.5. The Committee recommend the Cabinet -(1) To approve the Unemployment Insurance Eill 1927 in the form of the draft annexed to this Report, subject to any minor or crafting alterations that may be icund ncceseary or desircblv; ^ and to determine the date of the intro-duction of the Bill in the House of &apos; Commons -
(2) To authorise the Minister of Labour to substitute a minimum of 10 contributions for the Diinimum 15 contributions in Clause 5(5) if, during the pas cage of the Bill,  this concession appears to be necessary or desirable.Signed on behalf of the Committee.
