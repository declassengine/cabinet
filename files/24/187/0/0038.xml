REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OP ARMAMENTS.The Naval Conference.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I AM anxious to record my view about the Naval Conference.We ought not to let ourselves be netted in a scheme of parity with tbe United States in cruisers and other aucillaries. Although for a few years this might seem convenient, it may ultimately prove a danger. The United States will be very ready to call in question every step we take, and the American Press will run a continued campaign accusing us of violating the agreement. There can really be no parity between a Power whose Navy is its life and a Power whose Navy is only for prestige. Parity for the former is supremacy for the latter. I do not think it would be worth our while to enter into an agreement of parity with the United States which would afford recognition of their unsound claim and give them the right to find fault with us at every step.We cannot, on the other hand, limit the cruiser programme of&quot; the United States. I agree with Lord Balfour that we must build for our needs and they may build at their pleasure. However, the modern cruiser fleet of the United States is so far inferior to our own that they could build ten new cruisers, at a cost of ; 25 millions, without calling for any additional exertions on our part. It seems very probable that such an act of building on their part would set up its own reactions in the United States, and I do not think it should be readily assumed thai; it would be continued indefinitely. Anyhow, I would rather be free than bound; and if we treat their building in the early stages with apparent16337
indifference, it is possible their ardour to waste their money would soon cool. I have never been convinced that our present Admiralty scheme bf seventy cruisers is the&apos; minimum cbinpatible&quot;&quot;with security, and I floubt the exactness of the methods of calculation which have been employed. The more we can retard or slow down new construction, the less we shall stimulate the counter-measures of the United States. The policy is one which should be measured from year to year; and we should try to set the slowest pace possible, and not be afraid of a sudden advance in United States construction as long as we have a good lead.Far more important than the cruisers is the battleship question. The Americans wish to keep the size of battleships as large as possible, in order no doubt to be able to cross the Pacific and attack Japan. We ought not to hesitate to press our Admiralty proposals into the fullest light of publicity, with the result that our interests in this respect will more and more be in harmony with those of Japan. This development, it appears, has already begun; and it must give cause for serious reflection in the United States. Above all we ought not to be disturbed by unjust American irritation, nor let them feel that we shall make haste to obey their will. All the concessions which we made at the Washington Conference in giving up the Naval supremacy we had so long enjoyed, in parting with our faithful Japanese ally, and subsequently in paying them these enormous sums, have only resulted in new assertions and demands on their part. It always seems to be assumed that it is our duty to humour the United States and minister to their vanity. They do nothing for us in return, but exact their last pound of flesh. On the other hand, a little coolness on our part and readiness to assert our own independence in a perfectly courteous manner immediately arouses their solicitude on our account.W. S. C.June 29, 1927.
