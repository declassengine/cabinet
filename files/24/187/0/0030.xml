&apos; I This Document is the Property of Hit Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1927.SECRET.  - Copy No.   30CP. 181 (27).CABINET.NEW HEBRIDES: REPORT OF COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IT will be remembered that on the 24th November, following on a refusal by the French Government to consider proposals for a partition of the New Hebrides which had been made to them as the result of an inquiry by a Committee of the Imperial Conference, the Cabinet approved* my action in arranging with the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand for a Commission, comprising representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand to visit the New Hebrides with the following terms of reference: &quot; To report upon the position of British settlers in the New Hebrides, with special reference to any disadvantages under which they may be working in comparison with French settlers :In particular to consider (i.) The provision of an adequate supply of labour for British settlers [from any sources within or outside the Group from which such labour may be obtainable];(ii.) Any further measures to assist British settlers in the production and marketing of their crops, and to indicate what financial assistance, if any, would be required from Government, whether by loan or otherwise, for carrying into effect any recommendations which the Commission may make.&quot;These terms of reference were later modified at the request of the Commonwealth Government by omission of the words in (i) shown in brackets.The composition of the Commission was subsequently arranged as follows: Great Britain:   Sir Eyre Hutson, K.C.M.G., High Commissioner for the ^western Pacific *Australia :  Brigadier-General T. Griffiths, C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., Adminis-trator of Nauru;New Zealand: Major-General Sir G. W. S. Richardson. K.B.E., C.B., C.M.G., Administrator of Western Samoa.The Commission sat in the New Hebrides between the 6th and the 19th April and has made a unanimous report recommending various measures for the assistance of British settlers; a copy of this report is attached hereto as Appendix A.2. The Commission^ Report confirms generally the facts as to the situation in the New Hebrides which were laid before the Imperial Conference Committee, and, in particular, the central fact which I explained to that Committee, that we are confronted with the alternatives of permitting the introduction of Chinese labour by British settlers or acquiescing in the elimination of almost all British influence from the New Hebrides. It is for this reason that I have to bring before my colleagues the two principal recommendations in the Report of the Commission which comprise the introduction of Chinese labourers and the provision of advances by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain to enable this to be done. The Commissions proposal is that &quot; Cantonese or British subjects of Chinese race&quot; should be* cabinet 60 (20).[16283] &apos; - b
introduced under contract to serve for a period of five years, such labourers to be repatriated at the end of their service. The conditions of service proposed for these labourers would be largely based on the &quot; Free Labour Conditions &quot; instituted by the New Zealand Government for Chinese labourers in the Mandated Territory of Western Samoa.3. The views of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments on the Commission^ proposals regarding Chinese, labour are set out in the telegraphic correspondence attached hereto as Appendix B. Of the 53 British planters and traders in the Group, 29 are of Australian origin, 12 from this country and 3 from New Zealand. It will be observed that the Commonwealth Government have stated that they would not feel justified in offering any objection should His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain determine that it was necessary to adopt the recom-mendations contained in the Commissions Report, whilst the New Zealand Government see no objection to the introduction of Chinese labour subject to the conditions set forth in the Report.4. It may be of assistance to my colleagues, if, in the first instance, I summarise briefly the considerations affecting the question of the introduction of Chinese labour into the Group : (1.) The French have, since 1923, introduced large numbers of Indo-Chinese (Tqnkinese) labourers into the New Hebrides, and there are now 3,600 of these Asiatics in French employ in the Group. These labourers work under agreement for 5 years, and it appears that the French Government wiU encourage a considerable number of them to re-engage or settle in the Group at the end of this period. We cannot prevent the French Government from importing these Tonkinese, nor is there the least prospect that they would allow British settlers to employ this labour, since it forms an essential part of the successful forward policy which the French Government have recently adopted with a view to increasing their influence in the Group. Other aspects of this policy comprise generous financial backing for French settlers by certain French firms intimately connected with the French Government and the. Government of French Indo-China, and a virtual monopoly of the export trade of the Group by means of subsidised steamers running direct to Europe.(2.) British settlers have hitherto not been allowed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to introduce or employ Asiatic labour, and are thus entirely dependent on native, labour. In recent years this labour has become increasingly difficult to obtain ;* even when the natives can be persuaded to engage, they now will rarely agree to serve for more than one year, and the difficulty and expense of recruiting them has become very great. The causes which have led to the present acute shortage of native labour are that the. native population has decreased considerably in almost all the islands of the Group, wdiile the demand for labour has increased propor-tionately with the extension throughout the Group of European settlement. Furthermore, the natives are now beginning to work on their own lands and to engage in trading on their own account; this tendency is undoubtedly in their best interests and is a matter for satisfaction and encouragement at the hands of the Government. In these circumstances, the natives prefer to engage themselves as casual labourers for a short time, e.g., during harvesting of crops, but are unwilling to engage for long terms. Offers of higher wages would not result in any appreciable increase in the numbers who can be persuaded to recruit for continuous terms, and it is said that the few long-term recruits now obtainable are generally only those influenced by such considerations as curiosity or the need for escaping tribal punishment.(3.) The favourable position of French settlers resulting from their assured supply of long-term Tonkinese labour and the unfavourable position of British settlers consequent on the. dearth of native labour has resulted in a great increase of the French interests in the Group, whilst British interests are at a low ebb and in danger of elimination. The Commission state : &quot; It was distressing to ns in our tour through the Group to compare* This dillicultv is not experienced by British settlers in the island of Tanna where there are no large plantations, and local labour is sufficient (see paragraph 7 (4) below).
the prosperity of the French plantations with the neglected and woe-begone appearance of the British holdings.&quot; For the past year and more French firms have made favourable offers to induce British planters to form their plantations into French Companies on the understanding that they would then be permitted to secure Tonkinese labour. The British settlers have deferred action on these offers pending the results of the Commission^ investigation, but their financial position is generally such that they will be forced to accept them at once if they are not permitted to obtain Chinese labour. Acceptance of these offers by the British settlers would mean the virtual elimination of British influence in the Group. (4.) The Commission considered that the substitution of labour from outside the Group, working under approved conditions and restrictions, should be beneficial to the native race (1.) As an object lesson to the natives of the value of regular labour. (2.) As leaving the natives free to remain on and cultivate their own lands.(3.) As tending to keep the young men with their tribes, which would tend towards the increase of the now decreasing native race.The members of the Presbyterian Mission and of the Seventh Day Adventist Mission who appeared before the Commission concurred in this view.5. On the other hand the disadvantages attendant on the introduction of Chinese labourers would appear to be (1.) It would entail a modification of the policy which has been generally followed by successive Governments. There would probably be consider-able criticism in Parliament not only as regards the terms of service of these Chinese labourers, but also in connection with the provision of advances from public funds for their introduction.It may be noted that at the time of the Conference with the French Government at which the 1914 Protocol was drawn up, considerable pressure was brought to bear on that Government with a view to inducing them to agree to prohibiting the introduction of outside labour into the Group. This action almost led to the breakdown of the Conference, and eventually His Majesty&apos;s Government gave way, but they stated that they did not wish that such labourers, when introduced by the French, should be employed by British subjects, or should become subject to British jurisdiction.(2.) Considerable administrative difficulty and expense will be entailed. No detailed proposals as regards additional police required have yet been worked out, but it seems probable that in view of the extreme sparsity of communications in the New Hebrides, it may be difficult to arrange for the protection of white planters unaccustomed to Chinese labourers and the maintenance of law and order as between the Chinese, the natives and the Tonkinese. Moreover, at least  2,000 per annum would be required for an Immigration Officer, extra police, &amp;c, together with a lump sum of  12,000 for initial expenses ( 10,000 of this  12,000 should be recovered from the settlers if the scheme is successful). It appears also that it might be necessary at a later date to provide the Immigration Officer with a separate vessel in order to enable him to visit and inspect all the plantations on which the Chinese are employed.6. It will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs that the problem of whether British settlers shall be allowed to introduce Chinese labour involves immediately the whole question of our future position in the Group. If Chinese labour is authorised, British settlers should be able to carry on and the Condominium can probably be continued. If Chinese labour is not authorised, it seems clear- that the almost total extinction of the British plantations in the Group is to be anticipated within a very short time. In such an event it would be difficult to justify a direct expense of some  17,000 per annum to maintain our share in the administration of the Group, which would then probably be almost wholly French except for the Southern Group (comprising chiefly the Island of Tanna) and for the presence of British missionaries and possibly some traders on the other islands. In other words, [16283 j B 2
we should have to withdraw from the Group and we should be unlikely to get any compensation from the French for doing so.7. The question for decision is thus whether the advantages of continuing to share in the administration of the New Hebrides are sufficient to off-set the expense and difficulties attendant on the introduction of Chinese labour. The arguments in favour of the continuance of the Condominium and against total withdrawal from the New Hebrides, which may be the only alternative in view of the French refusal to divide the Group, appear to be that: (1.) The Condominium is more advantageous to the natives than a wholly French regime would probably be, since : (a.) The British share in the administration tends undoubtedly to the. protection of the natives in connection with questions such as recruiting, sale of fire-arms, alcohol, &amp;c.(&amp;.) British missionaries, whose services are of real value to the natives, apprehend that they would not be allowed to continue their present activities under a French regime.(2.) It enables the British settlers to remain under British law as opposed to forming their holdings into French Companies and possibly being compelled by circumstances at some future date to naturalise as French subjects.(3.) It is conceivable that given an adequate supply of Chinese labour, there might be an increase in the number of British settlers in this fertile Group, and a certain amount of trade in cotton and copra with Australia.(4.) Our withdrawal from the New Hebrides would entail giving up the almost wholly British Southern Group of islands, comprising particularly the island of Tanna, where British mission influence is strong, the native population is over 6,000 and is increasing, and the British settlers are traders only and do not require Chinese labour.(5.) There would probably be considerable opposition to withdrawal by the missionaries, who have organisations in this country, Australia and New Zealand.8. The arguments against the continuance of the Condominium and in favour of withdrawal are : (1.) The present annual expenditure by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the administration of the Group is about  17,000 per annum. In addition, the Commonwealth Government subsidise steamers between Sydney, the New Hebrides and certain other Pacific islands at a cost of some  15,000 per annum. No revenue is received to off-set this expenditure of over  30,000 per annum. There are only 53 separate British undertakings in the Group, of which only 29 are engaged in planting, the remainder being traders. The total British population, including women and children, is only 211. Thus, if British settlers only are considered without reference to the indirect benefits accruing to the natives, Govern-ment expenditure is already almost  150 per head per annum, without taking into account the additional expenditure which would be entailed by the introduction of Chinese labour.(2.) There is no direct trade with this country, and the value of the exports to and the imports from Australia in 1924/5 were  32,200 and  94,400 respectively.(3.) It is understood that the Admiralty consider that the New Hebrides haveno particular strategic value. (4.) British planters would apparently suffer little material loss from our with-drawal, since they would presumably be able to form their holdings intoFrench companies and secure Tonkinese labour. (5.) The Condominium is an ever-present potential source of friction with theFrench Government, and owing to its complicated system of dualAdministration, it entails a large amount of diplomatic correspondenceand administrative work out of all proportion to its importance. (6.) We might conceivably succeed in exchanging our rights in the New Hebridesfor a fuelling port in the Eastern Pacific on the Panama Canal route.At present we are dependent in this area on French ports.   TheAdmiralty would support this on strategic grounds.
9. Three possible courses appear to be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter: (1.) To authorise forthwith the introduction of Chinese labour by British settlers, in the hope of enabling the Condominium to continue.(2.) To defer a decision as to the introduction of Chinese labour by British settlers and to enter into immediate negotiations with the French Govern-ment for the cession of the whole of our rights in the New Hebrides in return for compensation elsewhere. In the event of a negative reply from the French Government, it would then be necessary to choose between (a) authorisation of Chinese labour; (6) an endeavour to continue the Condominium, despite the elimination of the majority of the British settlers, in the interests of the natives, the missionaries and British settlers in the Southern Group; (c) withdrawal without compensation.We should, of course, have to secure the concurrence of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments in any policy adopted; we know that these Governments would not oppose the introduction of Chinese labour, but we should have to get their concurrence in approaching the French Government with an offer to withdraw-, and it is possible that considerable opposition might be encountered from the missionary element which is strong in Australia and New Zealand.10. My own opinion is that every endeavour should always be made to avoid giving up the Condominium unless we can secure some partition on reasonable terms or unless adequate compensation can be obtained elsewhere, and, in pursuance of this principle, the policy which I would recommend to my colleagues for proposal to the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments&apos; is : (1.) (a.) That authority should be given for the introduction by the British administration of 400 Chinese labourers into the Group on the conditions approximating as far as local circumstances will permit to those in force in Western Samoa;(6.) That the necessary financial provision should be approved for (1.) Advances to enable British settlers to obtain this labour; (2.) The administrative arrangements in connection therewith.(2.) That we should inform the French Government that we have done so, making it clear that as they have told us that they are not prepared to consider partition, we feel bound to do what we can to strengthen the position of British settlers.in all the islands, and then see whether our action either now, or by the gradual improvement of the British position in the islands, may not induce the French to reconsider their attitude over partition, or at least to offer us compensation elsewhere, whether in the form of the cession to us of a French harbour in the Eastern Pacific on the Panama route or otherwise.L. S. A.Colonial Office, June 24, 1927.
(appendix A.Report of Commission appointed to investigate the situation in the New Hebrides.The Right honourable the Secretary of State for the Colonies.H.M.S. &quot; Diomede &quot; at Vila, Sir, New Hebrides,  April 18, 1927.IN pursuance of the terms of our Commission, we have the honour to submit, for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and the Govern-ments of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand, the following report upon the position of British settlers in the New Hebrides.2.   The terms of reference issued to the Commission were as follows : &quot; To report upon the position of British settlers in the New Hebrides with special reference to any disadvantage under which they may be working in comparison with French settlers, and in particular to consider &quot; (i.) The provision of an adequate supply of labour for British settlers; &quot; (ii.) Any further measures to assist British settlers in the production and marketing of their crops, and to indicate what financial assistance, if any, would be required from the Government, whether by loan or otherwise, for carrying into effect any recommendation which the Commission may make.&quot;3. For the purpose of our Inquiry, we assembled at Vila on Wednesday, the 6th instant. At a preliminary meeting held at the British Residency on the same afternoon, we considered and agreed upon the procedure to be followed in conducting the proceedings of the Commission. A statement of the decision then reached forms Appendix A* hereto. On the following day, the 7th instant, the Commission was formally opened at the Resident Commissioners Office at Vila in the presence of the British Resident Commissioner and members of the public, thirteen in number.4.   Subsequent meetings of the Commission were held as follows :  April 8th-Vila.April 11th Bushman&apos;s Bay, Malekula.April 13th Tangoa.April 14th Hog Harbour, Santo.In all thirty-three persons, including British settlers from all the principal islands in the Group, appeared before the Commission and volunteered information. A summary of their statements is contained in Appendix B.* Copies of all relevant documents received by the Commission are enclosed in Appendix C.* Also we inspected plantations at Bushman&apos;s Bay, Malekula, and at Hog Harbour, Santo. On Tangoa we visited the Station of the Presbyterian Mission established there under the control of the Rev. F. G. Bowie.Appended to our report is a copy of a questionnaire (Appendix D*) issued by the High Commissioner to the Resident Commissioner prior to our assembly at Vila, with his replies thereto. The schedule attached to the replies shows that the total number of British settlers is fifty-three, divided into the following categories : Combined planters and traders ... ... 10Planters    ...         ...         ... ... ... 18Grazier     ...         ...          ... .... ... 1Traders     ...         ...          ... .. ... 22General merchants  ...         ... ... ... 2* Nor reprinted.
A Memorandum submitted to us by the Resident Commissioner during our inquiry, copy of which is appended to our report (Appendix E*), supplies amended figures, and shows the estimated extent of the holdings of British settlers at the present date.5. As the result of our Inquiry and from the evidence presented to us, we find that British settlers, comprising planters and traders, are working under the following disadvantages as compared with the French settlers :  (a.) Insecurity of Land Tenure.6. This is due to the suspension of the Land Work of the Joint Court of the Condominium. At present all land is held without title and subject in many instances to opposing claims in respect of the whole or part of the area occupied. This disadvantage affects to a limited extent only the position of the British settlers. We have found that the non-settlement of the land tenure is not a general ground for complaint on the part of the majority of British settlers who appeared before us, but we conceive that greater prominence would have been given by them to the question, had an assured supply of labour been available to an extent sufficient to justify further development of property now occupied or claimed, and to attract British capital or new British settlers to the Group.7. Our attention was directed particularly to the fact that the French settlers, being assured on their part of a ready source from which an unlimited supply of labour could be obtained, viz., Tonkinese (there being now 3,600 in the Group), have been in a position to enter into occupation of lands without any prescribed formalities and to undertake development thereon to an extent regarded by them as sufficient to establish their claims to such lands when their claims are dealt with by the Joint Court. We learn that in some cases the French have actually entered upon lands claimed and occupied by British settlers and Missions, who are stated to be without redress pending a decision by the Joint Court on the conflicting claims. Delay in the resumption of the Land Work of the Joint Court is increasing the difficulties of the situation. Owing to the disappearance from some districts of the entire native population or to the deaths in other districts of the native owners concerned, it will become increasingly difficult to oppose such claims to land, or to enter objections to the occupation thereof. There is reason to believe that the few natives remaining in certain localities will shortly cease to exist, due to many causes, including their susceptibility to diseases, i.e., malaria, yaws, and hookworm, that are now prevalent; and also to their acquired taste for &quot; grog &quot; the name given throughout the Group to the low-grade gin and rum which is alleged to be readily supplied by some French traders and planters to the natives.(b.) Labour.8. We have found that British settlers, who are dependent on the employment of natives labour under agreement for periods rarely exceeding one year, are at a serious disadvantage as compared with the French, who have now a supply of permanent labour from Tonkin, working under an agreement for five years at a total annual cost less than that incurred by the British settlers for native labour. The latter is, moreover, becoming more and more difficult to obtain. We are of opinion that if this position be not remedied at an early date, it will undoubtedly lead to a rapid decrease in the numbers, if not the elimination, of British settlers, and consequently of British influence, in the Group. We feel that we cannot stress this consideration too strongly, and.we shall refer later to the need that exists in our view for the taking of immediate steps to afford relief to the British settlers in this direction.(c.) Scarcity of Local Labour.9. We have found that there is undoubtedly a great scarcity of native labour available to the British planter, either as labourers recruited for service under contract for a definite period, or engaged in the vicinity of the plantations as casual labourers, even when small numbers only are required. Our inspection of native labour under contract on plantations has impressed us with the fact that, due to the
prevalence of malaria fever, yaws, and infection with hookworm, the general efficiency of the labourer is extremely low. The cost of recruiting per caput varies from  15 to  40--in some instances we are informed as much as  54 per caput. This expenditure, in addition to that on wages, rations, and miscellaneous items, renders the cost of such labour unusually high and prohibitive in respect of a term of one year&apos;s service only, unless such labour be of the highest efficiency, which we have not found to be the case. With the exception of one planter, Mr. Wells of Malo, we were informed by all planters with whom we came in contact, that natives will in no circumstances, at this date, contract to serve for a period in excess of one year. We were impressed by the general unanimity of opinion expressed, not only by planters but also by Missionaries, that high wages do not, ordinarily, offer any inducement to natives to engage in labour and that the offer of wages at higher rates than now prevail throughout the Group, viz., Is. Id. to Is. M. per diem, would be of little avail. The reasons that are stated now to influence natives to offer themselves for recruitment are: (a) the. need of escaping from tribal punishment for breaches or offences against the native social or moral codes; (&amp;) curiosity on the part of young men to visit other islands of the Group; (c) the desire to obtain a wife, for whose purchase a lump sum of money in cash must be obtained. Natives have evinced, during recent years, an increasing reluctance to engage in service under contract. In the past the Missions established in the Group did not encourage the natives to recruit; they were in fact opposed to the practice. It would appear that to-day the attitude of the Missions has changed towards this question, and we believe that the Missions now endeavour to assist or support British settlers in their endeavours to procure native labour; one cause leading to the present difficulty in procuring an adequate supply of labour is, briefly, that the demand for labour&quot;has increased proportionately with the extension throughout the Group of European settlement, while the supply of labour has diminished with the decrease of the native population. The principal contributory cause, however, is undoubtedly the fact that natives are to-day availing themselves of the opportunities now afforded to individual natives to engage in planting and trading on their own account. Many natives are engaged in the cultivation of their own lands in coconut and cotton, the latter crop returning a larger and speedier remuneration than the former. Natives can thus earn by a few weeks&apos; labour on their own land more than they would receive in wages for several months of constant daily labour on European plantations. We were informed that the tendency of the natives to develop their lands is increasing rapidly, and that, in some instances, they have accumulated considerable sums of money as the result of their industry. The tendency is undoubtedly in the best interests of the natives and is a matter for satisfaction and encouragement at the hands of the Government.(d.) Restrictions on Recruitment and Employment of Native Labour applicable solely to British Settlers.10. The enactment of independent British legislation by King&apos;s Regulation No. 1 of 1913, superimposing additional restrictions on British settlers over and above those imposed under the Convention, undoubtedly places the British planter at a disadvantage as compared with the French planter in obtaining native labourers. That legislation prohibited, inter alia, the recruitment of women for work on planta-tions. Statements were made to us that the French are in the habit of recruiting women to act as decoys in order to attract men to the plantations, and that these tactics have met with success. Whereas on British plantations the employment of women either under contract or at will was formerly illegal. To some extent relief has recently been afforded to British planters by King&apos;s Regulation No. 10 of 1926, amending King&apos;s Regulation No. 1 of 1913, m which provision is made for the employment of women, subject, however, to certain definite restrictions. We con-sicler that in the interests of the native race the existing legislation should not be repealed, nor do we suggest any further amendment thereto; but we record the fact that the legislation referred to places the British planter under a definite handicap in the competition for native labour as compared with the French.(e.) Marketing of Produce and Currency. ,11. This disadvantage does not affect planters as individuals to any extent but undoubtedly affects British interests as a whole, in the Group. We have found that British planters and traders are permitted to take full advantage of the facilities
offered by the French for the marketing of produce, particularly copra, cotton, and coffee.   An important facility is the provision of a direct steamship service to Marseilles via Noumea by the vessels of the Messageries Maritime Company, and on occasions by the vessels of M. Ballande and Co., an influential French mercantile company.  Owing to its present inferior quality, South Sea Islands copra finds the best sale in the Mediterranean Market, there being little or no demand for it in the United Kingdom or in Australia.  The cost of shipment by this route is, we under-stand, considerably less than by other routes vid Australia to Europe.  During the period of the heavy depreciation of the franc, French merchants were able to offer higher prices in francs for produce than those offered by British merchants who conduct their transactions in sterling in the Group.  Even with the rate of exchange at 122 francs to the pound sterling, it is still to the advantage of British planters, who can afford to do so, to ship their produce, principally copra, to Marseilles on consignment, instead of disposing of it by sale to local merchants.   Messrs, Burns Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd., the most important and influential British firm of merchants in the New Hebrides, who purchase a very large proportion of the copra produced by British planters and natives, ship the whole of it to Marseilles from Vila by the vessels of the Messageries Maritime Steamship Company. The parent Company, Messrs. Burns Philp and Co., Sydney, receive a subsidy at the rate of  12,000 per annum from the Commonwealth Government of Australia for a five-weekly service as between Sydney and Vila, performed by one steamer, and, in addition, the Company are paid a subsidy of  3,000 by the Commonwealth of Australia to provide one steamer for the interinsular trade within the Group by a five-weekly service.   The agreement with the Government of the. Commonwealth of Australia providing for both services contains no provision limiting the rates of freight and passenger fares to maximum amounts.12.   The planters and traders, who appeared before us, complained that the rates charged are generally excessive, being higher than those charged by the Messageries Maritime Company and by the French privately-owned interinsular vessels.   A comparison of the two rates is given in Appendix C (3).*   Further reference to this question will appear later in our report, hut the Commission desire to record that the contractors are general merchants in the Group as well as being carriers, and that, at the present date, their contract oversea ship brings a very small quantity of cargo from Australia to the New Hebrides, other than that consigned to themselves in the form of trade supplies for sale to traders and others in the islands. We understand that the Company debit their trading business with freight at the rate of  3 to  3 10s. per ton and credit the freight to the working expenses of their contract vessel.   Subsequently they dispose of their trade supplies to individuals, local traders and planters at a price which we have been informed is sufficient to give more than a reasonable, profit to that branch of their business.  We have been unable to verify the statements made on the subject of the contractor^ alleged sale profits, but we have received statements to the effect that the French merchants and com-panies are in a position to offer goods at prices lower&apos; than those offered by Messrs.  Burns Philp  (South Sea)  Co., Ltd.   There is evidence of bond-fide competition both as regards freight rates and purchase and sale of produce and goods as between the French Companies and Messrs. Burns Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd., that operates to the advantage of corporations or individuals that are not tied by financial obligations to firms of either nationality.   We are inclined to the opinion that the existence of the element of competition has been of benefit to both the British and French planters and traders.   The price of inferior copra at Vila paid by both British and French buyers is in excess of that offered in any other part of the Pacific.   We have not been able to ascertain whether any special preferences are granted by the French companies to planters and traders of that nationality.13. Statements received by.us in evidence lead us to believe that both French and British planters obtain advances freely, and without difficulty, from Messrs. Bechade and Co. and Messrs. Ballande and Co., French merchants. The latter, a rich company, is believed to be backed by the Indo-China Bank, and to have on its Board of Directors representatives of the French Government. The sums advanced by the latter company carry interest at rates varying from 9 per cent, to 11 per cent, per annum computed on the current accounts of the planters with the creditor company. The debtor, on his part, is not bound to the French company, i.e., we were informed that the planter is usually free to sell his produce to any
purchasers and to purchase his supplies from any merchant. The fact remains that the French merchants terms for purchase of produce from the planter, and his prices for sale of supplies, according to evidence offered, are better than those offered by the British merchants, principally Messrs. Burns Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd. Latterly, with the assistance of assured Tonkinese labour, most of the French planters have liquidated their indebtedness and are, at present, free. We fear that those British planters who have obtained financial assistance from the French companies continue to remain under obligation to their French creditors and to sell their produce to the companies concerned and to purchase, supplies from them.Terms of Reference.(1.) The provision of an adequate supply of Labour for British Settlers.14. The Commission are of opinion that it is essential to provide labour from some source outside the Group at the earliest possible date. Unless that step be taken, there is every likelihood that many of the British planters will be compelled by economic pressure to register their estates as French companies, in order to obtain Tonkinese labour. In considering the means required to give effect to this recommen-dation, we have no facts to lead us to believe that a supply of labour is available in any British or other Administration in the Pacific, or British Administration elsewhere.15. The Administration of Papua cannot, we understand, be considered as a source of supply, owing to the absence of sufficient labour to serve the requirements of that Administration. Were the policy of the French in reference to the New Hebrides other than we believe it to be, it is possible that some agreement could be arrived at through diplomatic channels, by which Tonkinese might be introduced to serve on British plantations on conditions similar to those that, we understand, were adopted for the supply of British East Indian indentured labour to Dutch Guiana in South America. The adoption of that expedient would require an amendment to the Protocol. In the circumstances, however, we have no alternative but to recom-mend the introduction of Chinese labour, to be recruited through the good offices of the British Phosphate Commissioners and on conditions to which we shall allude later in our report.16. The following comparison of the estimated cost of the three classes of labour that would then be employed in the Group, viz., Native, Tonkinese, and Chinese, should our recommendation be followed, will be of interest.Native Labour.(Under agreement for one year. Under local conditions no advantage would be gained in considering a longer period) : Annual cost of  .Recruiting per head, average, say   ... ... 15Rations ... ... ... ... 21Wages ... ... ... ... 20Miscellaneous costs ... ... ... 258Total, say,  60, or  5 per month.The position, however, is that British planters cannot rely on procuring a sufficiency of native labour under contract and an unsuccessful recruiting venture may increase to a disproportionate extent the- cost of recruitment, even up to the sum of  60 or  70 per caput of labourers recruited. Under existing conditions, planters are dependent on obtaining assistance from local casual labour, which is not always readily procurable. It must be noted also that it is impossible to maintain a planta-tion satisfactorily with casual labour or to develop land available for cultivation with such labour.
Tonkinese Labour.We append as Appendix F* a memorandum stating the conditions that we are informed apply to the introduction into the New Hebrides of this class of labour, viz.: Cost of introduction under agreement for a period   s.   d.of five years, based on a rate of 122 francs to the pound sterling       ... ... ... 28 10   0Repatriation ... ... ... ... 12   0   0Total                    --. - ...         ... 40 10 0(Spread over five years equals  8 2s. per annum)..       .   . .   s. d.Annual minimum wage at 160 francs per mensem 15 15 0Rations estimated at Is. 2c?. per diem ...         . 21   0 0Clothing   ...         ...         ... ...         . ; 10 miscellaneous         ...         ... ...         ... 2 10 0Total        ... ... ... ... 40  5   0(Total annual cost per head,  48 7s.)Say,  4 per month per head as compared with  5 per month, nominally the minimum cost of native labour, with the further difference that Tonkinese labour is not only more efficient but is assured for five years, while native labour is not assured beyond a period of one year.Chinese Labour to be Imported.  s.   d.Cost of introduction charges in respect of a contract service for a period of five years ... 24   0   0Repatriation ... ... ... ... 15   0   0. Total        ...         ...         ...         ...         39   0 0(Say,  40 spread over five years equals  8 per annum).  s. d.Annual minimum wage at Is. Qd.  per diem,equivalent to  1 16s. per mensem ...         ...         20   0 0Rations at Is. 2d. a day      ...         ...         ...         21   0 0Clothing    ...         ...         ...         ...         ...           10 miscellaneous         ...         ...         ...         ...           2 10 0Total        ... ... ... ... 44 10   0(Total annual cost per head  52 10s. or  4 7s. 6c?. per month.)17. It will be observed that the estimated cost of Chinese labour exceeds that of Tonkinese by the sum of  4 3s. per caput per annum. It is considered, however, that the superiority of the Chinese over the Tonkinese as labourers will more than compensate for the slight difference in cost.18. We recommend that, if possible, the period of engagement of Chinese labour should be for five years, on the following grounds, which we consider important: (i.) In order to reduce as far as possible the cost of labour to British planters;(ii.) Because we consider that with the dual control under the Condominium Government there should be uniformity as far as possible in labour conditions between the nationals of the respective Governments. We recognise that each national Government must necessarily impose conditions determining the measure of assistance, if any, to be granted
to their nationals towards the cost of the introduction of labour, the establishment of a fund for that purpose and its control, and the procedure to be adopted to ensure adequate security in respect of advances made. (We have been informed that the French settlers receive very liberal assistance, readily granted, in connection with the introduction of exotic labour.)19.   We append hereto, vide Appendix H,* draft conditions that we recommend for adoption to regulate the introduction of Chinese labour, that are based, to a reat extent, on those in force in Western Samoa.  The principal variations from the amoan conditions that we consider necessary owing to local circumstances obtaining in the New Hebrides are as follows : (i.) Compulsory repatriation at the expiration of the contract service of five years, and no renewal of contracts. This we consider important, principally in the interests of the future of the Native Race. We have no means of ascertaining whether the French Authorities make any attempt to secure repatriation of the Tonkinese. Evidence received leads us to believe that their policy is one of securing permanent settlement of the Tonkinese in the Group (see evidence by Mr. T. R, Salisbury, British Agent, and by Mr. T. Thomas). We consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government may appropriately seek information on that subject from the French Government through diplomatic channels, (ii.) A variation of the Samoan condition that the labourer shall have the right to give notice, at any time, of his wish to change his employer. We consider that owing to the scattered nature of the plantations situated on various islands of the Group, such notice may not be given until after the expiration of a period of twelve months&apos; service with the employer assigned by the Immigration Officer, (iii.) The elimination of provision requiring monthly contributions by the labourer towards the cost of medical attendance or for the other purposes set out in clause four to the Schedule of the Samoan Ordinance No. 10 of 1923. We shall allude later to the question of medical attendance.(iv.) The deletion of clause seventeen relating to the non-supply of rations to the labourer. We are of opinion that it will be preferable in the New Hebrides to provide that the employer supplies rations on a scale to be prescribed by the Regulations.Terms of Reference (2).20.   The final term of reference to the Commission is as follows : &quot;To consider any further measures to assist British settlers in the production and marketing of their crops and to indicate what financial assistance, if any, would be required from Government, whether by loan or otherwise for carrying into effect any recommendation which the Commission may make.&quot;21. We are of opinion that it is unnecessary to offer any direct financial assistance to British planters in the production of their crops. The planters themselves admit that with a supply of labour available they can hold their own with French competitors. Representations were made to us that the British settlers in the New Hebrides were not receiving benefit from the subsidy of  12,000 granted by the Commonwealth Government to the steamship service performed by the s.s. &quot; Makambo &quot; from Sydney to Vila, to the extent intended by the Commonwealth Government. That from the point of view of the British settlers, other than Messrs. Burns Philp &amp; Co. Ltd., the contractors for the service, it would be preferable if that subsidy were reduced and the amount of the reduction, say  2,000 per annum, added to the subsidy granted on account of the interinsular service in the Group, with a view to a corresponding reduction being made in the rates of freight and passenger fares now charged in respect of that service. We concur in that view and we advise that the Commonwealth Government should give consideration to the matter in connection with any agreement for shipping services
that may be entered into in the future. Moreover, we desire to record our view that it is desirable that a schedule of the maximum rates of freight and passenger fares should be included in the terms of the existing agreement, if possible. If not, then in any future contract for a subsidised interinsular steamship service in the Group, as is now the practice elsewhere in the Pacific.22. As to the financial assistance that will be required to assist British settlers, we recommend that, if possible, a sum of  10,000 should be provided as soon as possible, to be used in making advances to planters to cover partly or wholly the cost of the introduction of Chinese. We suggest that the advances, if made, should be repaid in the following manner : The planter should be required to meet an annual levy sufficient not only to cover the advance made towards the cost of introduction but also to meet the future cost of reparation. We have estimated, as stated above, that an annual payment in the sum of  8 for each labourer would be sufficient for the purpose. Should more definite security be required to cover the advance, we have ascertained that the planters are prepared to give, in addition, a lien on their crops.23. We have not so far alluded to the important question of medical supervision, for which provision will be necessary in connection with any scheme for the introduction of labour from any source outside the Group. The conditions that prevail in the New Hebrides, at the present date, owing to the absence of medical officers, we can only describe as deplorable. Even in regard to the present native labour we are of opinion that the situation demands the adoption of remedial measures without delay. Provision for the medical supervision of native labour throughout the Group should be made by the Condominium Government. Furthermore, the natives should be required, by the imposition of a medical tax, to contribute towards the education of native youths at the proposed Central Medical School at Suva, to be assisted if necessary by a grant from Condominium funds. The British Resident Commissioner has been-requested if necessary by the British High Commissioner for the New Hebrides to open negotiations with the French Authorities to that end. The provision of adequate means for the medical supervision of imported labour will of course be a question of British national concern, and we submit the following suggestions for consideration in that connection.24.   We suggest that it may be possible to obtain the services of a duly qualified medical practitioner to act as Immigration Officer, an appointment to which we shall shortly refer.   In order to attract a suitable officer, either by appointment on agreement for a period of five years or by loan from another Administration, we suggest that the salary of the joint office should be fixed at not less than  1,000 per annum, free of Income Tax.    The officer should be attached to the British National Staff and provided with quarters at Vila.   Under the terms of appointment he should be required to visit and inspect all plantations on which Chinese are employed as frequently as practicable and not less than on two occasions during each year at intervals not exceeding six months.   We were informed by the British Resident Commissioner that no difficulty will arise in arranging for the transport of this officer and the Chinese Interpreter by the Government vessel H.M.Y. &quot; Euphrosyne &quot; to enable him to make regular visits of inspection throughout the Group.   In the circumstances, therefore, we are of the opinion that the necessity for providing a separate vessel for his use should not arise in the immediate future. We desire to suggest that every effort be made to utilise the services of this officer to afford some measure of medical care to the native communities resident in the vicinity of British plantations, or near to the coast on the islands to be visited by him in connection with the duties of his substantive office.   At the present time the only medical attention available to the natives is at the hands of the various Mission Bodies.   It would be desirable that the Medical Officer should co-operate as far as practicable with the Missions in this work, and we are confident that his experience and advice would be welcome to them in co-ordinating and improving the medical care of the natives throughout the Group.   In that connection, consideration may properly be given later to the provision of a separate sea-going vessel for his use. We recognise that in making the above suggestion we are exceeding our terms of reference, but we have been so much impressed, from personal experience gained on our tour through the Group, by the obvious and distressing need in which the natives in the districts visited by us stand of medical care and attention, that we
uconsider it our duty to place our views before our respective Governments. In explanation of our attitude in this respect we may state that there is, at the present date, no Condominium or British medical officer, whose services are wholly at the disposal of either Government, but merely subsidised Medical Officers at Vila, who are Port Health Officers and in charge of the Presbyterian Mission Hospital and the French Hospital at that place. There is also a French Medical Officer at Santo who receives a subsidy from the Condominium Government. We have ascertained that the French Authorities impose, at the present date, a national tax on the French settlers employing Tonkinese labour at the rate of 30 francs per head per annum. We have been led to believe that the British settlers will be prepared willingly to accept the imposition of a tax for the purpose of contributing to the cost of maintenance of the local Immigration Staff and of the necessary medical services. The French national tax referred to above is alleged to have been imposed for a similar purpose, although there is no information placed at our disposal that would indicate that there is any medical supervision established by the French in respect of the Tonkinese labour. We recommend that if it be decided to introduce Chinese labour, steps be taken to impose a tax on British settlers at the rate of 15s. per head per annum in respect of all such labourers employed. This tax on British settlers would be 10s. per head in excess of that imposed on the French settlers and increase the. cost of imported labour for use by the British, as compared with that provided for the French, to  4 18s. per head per annum.25. We recommend that a decision be taken as early as possible to make arrangements for the importation of 400 Chinese in two consignments of 200 each, the second to follow the first after a period of six months. &quot;We are satisfied that the number of labourers suggested will be readily and quickly absorbed by planters. We advise that such labourers should be reserved for planters in the first instance, and that they only be assigned to traders in the event of the full complement not being required by planters. We recommend further that the sum of  1,300 per annum be provided for a period of five years to make provision for the employment of an Immigration Officer and at least one Chinese Interpreter to serve as clerk to the Immigration Officer and as interpreter to the Courts. We have suggested above that the post of Immigration Officer and Medical Inspector should be united in one officer. The erection at Vila of quarters for these officers, if appointed, will be necessary, at an estimated cost of  1,400.26. While we regret that we have found it necessary to recommend the introduction of a second nationality as plantation labourers, we consider that the introduction of Chinese, i.e., of Cantonese and British subjects of Chinese race, will not be detrimental to the native race, provided the condition as to repatriation is strictly enforced. We are glad to be in a position to record that the members of the Presbyterian Mission, and also of the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, who have appeared before us, concur in our view that the substitution of labour from outside the Group, working under approved conditions and restrictions, should be beneficial to the native race; first as an object lesson to the natives of the value of regular labour; secondly as leaving the natives free to remain on their lands to cultivate coconuts, cotton, and possibly coffee and cocoa for their own benefit; and thirdly as tending to keep the young men, the class from which recruits are obtained, with their tribes, which would tend towards the increase of the native race.27. We desire to record our considered opinion that the measures proposed by us will be for the benefit of the native race, as against the alternative of allowing the islands to fall completely into French hands.28. We have received information which we consider to be reliable as to the terms on which the French companies are, at the present date, endeavouring to induce British planters to form their individual plantations into French companies for the purpose of registration under the provisions of the Protocol, so as to permit them to secure Tonkinese labour. The usual offer made by the French is that the British planter should convert his estate into a company of forty shares, of which five would be allotted to French shareholders, thus enabling the company to be registered as a French company, when a supply of Tonkinese labour would be provided by the Company under the auspices of the French Government. The British planter would remain as managing director of the company and receive a salary for his services,
15131the annual net proceeds of the estate being divided in the proportions quoted, the British planter receiving 35-40 of the total. Having regard to the fact that the British planters are now, in many cases, at the end of their resources, and that unless immediate steps are taken for their relief, they have no alternative but to accept the offer of assistance held out by the French, we consider that the terms offered are generally fair and reasonable. We desire to lay emphasis on our view that, having consideration to the liberal conditions offered by the French companies, under which the British plantation manager of the company, thus constituted, is not bound to deal exclusively with French firms in the sale of produce and the purchase of supplies, it is important that the cost of labour introduced for British planters should approximate as nearly as possible to that payable by the French for Tonkinese labour, bhould this be impracticable, the British planter, though genuinely loyal, will continue to be tempted by French offers of absorption.29. We received many complaints regarding the non-observance by the French of Article 59 of the Protocol that imposes restrictions on the sale of alcoholic liquor to the natives. By Article 8 (i) &quot; native &quot; means any person of the aboriginal races of the Pacific who is not a citizen, subject to or under the protection of either of the Signatory Powers to the Convention, and is not applicable to Tonkinese and would not apply to Chinese, if introduced into the Group. We realise that these statements were made ex parte, but we consider that they were based on reliable information and we advise that strong representations should be made to the French Government, directing attention to the necessity of ensuring compliance with the Article in question by the French nationals in the Group.30. We have considered the desirability of amending the Protocol to extend the prohibition of liquor to labour introduced into the Group by subjects or by the Governments of either of the Signatory Powers. We doubt, however, the expediency of making any recommendation to that effect. We are of opinion that any attempt to enforce prohibition against Tonkinese and Chinese will create greater evils.31.   We have been approached by British planters as to the necessity for the provision of competent legal assistance for British nationals in regard to land claims before the Joint Court.   The matter does not appear to be one of urgency at tnis date.   We desire, however, to express the view that it is important that, if and when required, British nationals should receive assistance in defending their interests in regard to claims that it is anticipated will be brought by the French to  lands  claimed  or  occupied  by  the  British.    We  have  had  before  us Mr. F. E. Wallace, possessing legal qualifications as a solicitor and barrister, who has for many years past practised as a British solicitor at Vila.   We have been informed that he is retained by the Commonwealth of Australia, with a salary at the rate of  800 per annum, to represent Commonwealth interests in the Group. We have reason to believe that the British settlers generally, place little or no confidence in his ability to represent their interests adequately before the Joint Court, when land claims are being dealt with.   We are of opinion that the funds now provided by the Commonwealth Government may be more usefully employed in retaining the services of an officer with the requisite legal qualifications, in whom the British settlers would have greater confidence, to protect Commonwealth interests in the New Hebrides and particularly in connection with the land work of the Joint Court.   Having in mind the importance attaching to this subject, we venture to suggest, for consideration by the Commonwealth Government, the temporary appointment to Vila of Mr. F. B. Phillips, now Stipendiary Magistrate at Eabaul, who served with distinction recently as Native Lands Commissioner in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. We are confident that the necessary additional funds would be forthcoming from British planters and traders in the form of fees for services rendered, to be supplemented, if necessary, by a grant from British national funds, to provide a remuneration sufficiently attractive to Mr. Phillips, in respect of an appointment for five years.   Should Mr. Phillips now be holding an office carrying pension rights, we would suggest that it may be possible to arrange for the continuation of his pension rights while serving in the New Hebrides.   It would not be necessary, in our opinion, that the appointment should be made until within, say. six months before the date fixed for commencing adjudication of the land claims. We consider this matter of vital importance to British interests in the New Hebrides, and we advise that British settlers should be informed as early as possible that steps will be taken to appoint an officer with adequate legal qualifications to the British
usNational Staff to appear on their behalf, should they so elect, on terms to be communicated to them in due course.32. We venture to refer to a further matter, not strictly within the terms of reference to us. We desire to recommend that His Majesty s Government should give consideration to the question of establishing an Advisory Council to assist the British Resident Commissioner, on the lines of the Advisory Council established in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. We suggest that the Council may be composed of the Resident Commissioner, as President, a Senior British National Official, as may be nominated by the Resident Commissioner with the approval of the High Commissioner, two representative British planters, if possible one each from the Northern and Southern Districts, and two representatives of the Missions established in the Group, as members. Members of the Council should be nominated by the British Resident Commissioner, subject to the prior sanction of the High Commissioner. The Council would ordinarily be convened once every year and should be solely advisory to the High Commissioner. We are confident that the establishment of such a body would not only assist the British National Administra-tion, but would also tend to consolidate and strengthen British influence in the Group.33. Two persons appearing before us applied that assistance should be granted to them for new development work in the Group. While we are in sympathy with their expressed intention to refrain from seeking financial aid at the hands of the French companies, if such assistance could&apos; be obtained elsewhere from British sources, we are of opinion, after careful consideration, that we would not be justified in recommending that advances should be made from public funds for that purpose.34. The following is a brief summary of our recommendations as to the action required, in our opinion, to overcome the disadvantages under which British settlers are labouring in comparision with the French settlers; and to promote British influence in the New Hebrides : (1.) The provision of an adequate supply, at regular intervals, of labour from outside the Group, which we have&quot; assumed will be effected by the intro-duction of Chinese labourers under contract to serve for a period of five years, such labourers to be repatriated at the end of their agreements.(2.) The establishment of a fund, from which advances may be made to British settlers towards the cost of the introduction and repatriation of Chinese labour. Such advances to be repaid by annual instalments covering a period of five years.(3.) The provision of medical attendance and care of (a.) The native population by Condominium action;(6.) Chinese and. if possible, natives, by the appointment of a british national Medical Officer &quot;who would also hold the conjointappointment of Immigration Officer. (4.) The grant of an increased subsidy to the existing interinsular steamship service, for which a schedule of the maximum freights and fares charge-able should be fixed.(5.) The appointment to the British National Staff of an officer with legal qualifications to assist the British settlers in connection with land claims before the Joint Court.(6.) The creation of an Advisory Council to advise and assist the British National Administration.35. The expenditure that we estimate will be required to give effect to our recommendations is as follows : Advances in connection with the introduction of Chinese labour    First batch of 200 in number  ... ...     5,000Second batch of 200, after, say, six months     5,000- 10,000Residence for Medical Officer and Immigration Officer 1,000Quarters for Chinese Interpreter   ...         ...          ... 400Total of initial expenditure ... ...      11,400

We trust that ways and means may be found for giving effect to the recommendations that we have the honour to submit in this report for the considera-tion of our respective Governments. British interests in the New Hebrides are to-day at a low ebb. Unless immediate action can be devised and is taken, many of the best estates will be lost to the British, beyond recall. It was distressing to us in our tour through the Group to compare the&apos; prosperity of the French plantations with the neglected and woebegone appearance of the British holdings. It may safely be said that had it not been for the genuine patriotism of the British settlers during the past few years, the New Hebrides would to-day have been almost wholly French and the complete loss of British interests in the Group but a matter of time. Overwhelmed with adverse conditions and resisting the temptation to accept the attractive offers held out by the French, the British settlers have steadfastly looked for assistance from British sources; and we trust that, the position having been represented to our respective Governments, they will not look in vain.37. In conclusion, we desire to express our appreciation of the welcome extended to the Commission by the British Resident Commissioner, Mr. G. W. B. Smith-Rewse, and of the assistance afforded by him to us in our work. The arrange-ments for holding the Commission at Vila and in the most important centres of the Group were eminently satisfactory, and enabled the majority of the settlers to appear before us, in the minimum space of time and with little inconvenience to the settlers themselves. It was gratifying to us to receive frequent expressions by the British settlers of their confidence in the British Resident Commissioner and their apprecia-tion of his services on their behalf. To him personally, and to Mrs. Smith-Rewse, we are indebted for much hospitality. At a Garden Party given by the Resident Commissioner at the British Residency on the 9th instant &quot;to meet&quot; the Commission, there was an unusual attendance of French officials, President and Judges of the Joint Court, and French settlers in the district adjoining Vila. The British residents were also fully represented. Marked cordiality prevailed amongst the British and French officials and residents during the&apos; period of our visit.38. Mr. G. W. B. Smith-Rewse, British Resident Commissioner, offered evidence as the last person appearing before us. He attended, at our invitation, the taking of all evidence from planters, traders, and missionaries. His evidence appears at the end of Appendix B. He also put in a written memorandum, which we accepted and which appears as Appendix G.39. We desire to record an expression of our deep gratitude to Commodore G. T. Swabey, R.N., D.S.O., commanding H.M.S. &quot; Diomede,&quot; for his hospitality on that vessel, and for the accommodation placed at our disposal and for our Secretary, during our tour, at much inconvenience, we fear, to himself and to the officers of his ship. Commodore Swabey evinced the greatest interest in the Commission^ task, and the resources of his ship were readily placed at our disposal. With his assistance we have been able to &quot; show the flag,&quot; on a peaceful mission, throughout the Group.40. Finally we desire to record our high appreciation of the valuable services rendered to us by Mr. H. G. Pilling, Secretary to the Western Pacific High Commission, who served as Secretary to the Commission.EYRE HUTSON (Chairman). G. W. S. RICHARDSON. T. GRIFFITHS.
- Notes on Tanna.ldth April, 1927.The Island of Tanna was visited by the Commission^ on 19th April.The following British settlers were interviewed: Mr. Eadie representing Mr. J. Carruthers, absent in Sydney; Mr. A. Shrubsole, Trader; Mr. Hobertson, Trader.The above-named are the only traders in what is termed Tanna Eastern District. Two other British traders, Messrs. Craig and Suggate, are on the Western side of the island.There are no French traders or planters on Tanna.The British traders appear to work amicably together and to have very strong feelings regarding the maintenance of British interests in the Group.In Tanna East the exports are almost entirely limited to copra, the small amount of cotton exported being due to the fact that the natives have considerable areas of coconuts, and copra returns a better remuneration than cotton, due to the present low price of the latter.About 700 tons of copra is exported from Tanna East by the three firms inter-viewed. This is produced entirely by natives, who number about 2,000. Thus, their annual production works out at 7 cwt, per caput, representing an annual income per native of  4 4s. Judged by the annual earnings of natives in many of the other islands of the South Pacific, the New Hebrideans of Tanna are prosperous.The three trading stations are situated close to each other. Nevertheless, the traders appear to be doing well. One trader stated that his average takings in the store were about  5 per day.The natives are keen barterers, and trade only where they can get the best prices for their produce. One trader stated that he is at present paying the natives  2 more per ton than the price paid by Burns, Philp &amp; Co., in order to attract the native trade to his store. Native store purchases are chiefly tobacco, tinned meats, biscuits, and calicoes.Complaints were made that Burns, Philp &amp; Co. did not do their best for British settlers. One trader complained that the landed cost of goods imported by him from Sydney was only 14 per cent, above Sydney prices, while the cost of goods purchased locally from Burns, Philp &amp; Co. was increased above Sydney prices by : (a) 1\ per cent, on Invoice, (b) Freight, (c) Duty at Vila, and (d) 20 per cent.Prices paid by the French for copra were invariably higher than those paid by Burns, Philp &amp; Co., and the goods supplied by French firms were also cheaper.The British settlers on Tanna do not wish to encourage trading with the French who are apparently out to destroy British trade in the Group at any cost.The traders expressed themselves as satisfied with the five-weekly steamer service. They appealed, however, for assistance to obtain cheaper freight and cheaper passages to Vila and Sydney.They stated that the native copra trade was gradually getting into French hands owing to French schooners calling at all places around the island, at which there was a passage through the reef, and where there was native copra to be bought, whereas British schooners only called at a few places round the Island.In this district, Tanna East, the natives bring in their copra to the traders by means of pack horses. It is of inferior quality, and no effort is being made to improve the quality, solely because improvement in quality would not result in better prices.The land is very fertile, and about 60 per cent, of it is cultivable. A large area of land suitable for grazing sheep is said to exist in the North of Tanna. Cattle thrive well on the island and the natives own a large number.Large areas of land have been claimed by the Missions on behalf of the natives. Portions of these areas could be made available for European plantations without prejudicing the interests of the natives. The natives are well off and able to supply all their needs from the coconut crops of existing areas. In consequence they are not planting any additional areas. The island will, therefore, not progress commer-cially unless the natives can be stimulated to develop further areas on their own account or development is undertaken by Europeans.Cocoa is apparently not grown on the island. The reasons given are that the the climate is not suitable, and that natives will not take up this industry.Natives. Tanna may be considered as wholly British, and it is satisfactory to note the interest taken in the natives by the traders, who undoubtedly observe the native liquor laws. The population is estimated at present to be 6,300. It is reported* Sir Eyre llutson and General Richardson only.   Brigadier-General Griffiths was unable to be present.
that the natural increase for the past two years was 500. If these figures are correct this represents an annual increase of approximately 4 per cent., and constitutes an excellent record.The natives of Tanna are generally of superior physique and intelligence to the natives of some of the Northern Islands of the Group. Nevertheless, they are obviously badly infected with the usual tropical diseases, judged by the large numbers seen in the vicinity of the trading stations.The European population of the island consisting solely of British missionaries and British traders, a splendid opportunity is afforded on Tanna to develop the natives on proper lines.It should be possible gradually to institute a good system of native administra-tion, including provision for medical attention and supervision, with the object of awakening the natives to further( their own interests, and thus to promote the prosperity of Europeans and natives alike.The British settlers are able to procure locally all the labour they require at approximately 2s. per diem. They do not require to recruit as they have no large plantations to maintain. They are therefore not in the unfortunate position of the British planters in the Northern islands of the group.The settlers now on the island naturally oppose recruiting from this island to supply labour for other islands, as every native who leaves is an economic loss to Tanna. Their experience is that only a portion of those recruited ever return, and that of those who return many are spoilt through having acquired a taste for grog.Evidence was given that the French, until two years ago, recruited from the island, and that they used grog to entice natives to indenture. The natives preferred to join up with the French rather than the British, as they were promised by the former a daily ration of grog. British traders refrain from reporting Frenchmen for violating the laws of the Condominium for fear of being boycotted by French commercial firms.Recently the settlers on Tanna held a meeting with the natives and inquired as to whether they would prefer the French or the English to govern them. Their answer was equivalent to saying that they preferred the present arrangement. They liked the English in Tanna, but they appreciated being able to get grog from the French, and also the better prices which the latter gave them for their copra.The sum total of evidence from Tanna indicates that the British settlers only require assistance to get better freights for their produce and goods, and cheaper passages both within the group and from the group to Sydney. Also that excellent opportunities exist on the island for working out a scheme of native development.APPENDIX B.(i.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governors-General of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand.(Sent 2-5 f.m., 2(Jth April, 1927.)Secret.

Your telegram of 29th April: New Hebrides Commission. His Majesty&apos;. Government in New Zealand see no objection to the introduction of Chinese labour into the New Hebrides subject to the conditions set forth in the Report. They desire to acquaint His Majesty&apos;s Gevernmeut in Great Britain of the personally strong emphasis laid by the Administrator of Samoa on the urgency of an early  decision, as in his opinion a number of British planters will undoubtedly sell their interests to the French at an early date unless they receive official intimation that the British Government will help them in regard to obtaining labour in the very near future.(iii.)Telegram from the Governor-General of the commonwealth cf Australia to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(Dated 3rd June, 1927.)(Received Dominions Office, 9&apos;55 A.M., 3rd June, 1927.)Secret. Following from my Prime Minister. Your telegram of 29th April. Government has now had opportunity of perusing and cousidering the full text of the report of New Hebrides Commission.Your telegram inviting the observations of my Government on the proposal by the Commissioners that British settlers in the New Hebrides should be assisted to obtain Chinese labour. The following seem to ns to be the considerations which are pertinent to the question.It appears from an examination of the evidence that the unanimous conclusion of the Commissioners that British and Australian settlers are working under grave difficulties as compared with the French is incontrovertible. The regular and assured supply of Tonkinese which the French obtain at a cost much lower than native labour and the rapid decrease in the supply of the latter places the British settlement in a position of undoubted inferiority and threatens its ultimate extinction.From economic and broader natioual aspect this is manifestly undesirable, as it must inevitably result in complete domination by the French. Expressed opinion of the commission that under present circumstances British planters will be compelled at an early date to register their plantations as French companies or sell outright is, in our opinion, most serious. The Commonwealth has continuaUy endeavoured, by means of mail subsidy and by provision of land to settlers at purely nominal rates, to extend the sphere of British influence in the group. We have done this because we regard the maintenance of British iufluence there as important to Australia and therefore to the Empire. As you know, we have been continually active also in our endeavours to effect a solution of the Condominium problems with the same object in view. Australian sentiment is as hostile to the destruction of British influence and prestige by economic pressure as it is to complete surrender of the islands to the French.We have, however, approached the consideration of the questions raised in the report mainly from the standpoint of the effect that continuance of the present conditions with their inevitable trend must have upon the welfare of native inhabitants towards whom we assume definite moral responsibility. In this connection it is noted with grave concern that reci&quot;uiting of essential native labour, upon which British settlers at present entirely rely, is rendered difficult because of their adherence to the protocol and British law. The fact that certain French settlers condone the illicit supply of liquor to natives and make use of women to assist their own recruiting to the detriment of ours is obviously one which calls for immediate action. We feel that this portion of the Commission^ report should be brought under the notice of the
21134French Government. It is clear also that, if the present drift towards French registration continues, these undesirable practices must extend. Briefly, the interests of the native inhabitants are jeopardised while the present situation exists, and will be more seriously affected unless prompt and effective action is taken.Even should the situation as regards treatment of natives be remedied by concerted French and British action, the Commission^ report makes it clear that British settlers would still fail to obtain an assured and adequate supply of native labour. It is gratifying to note that one of the main contributing factors to the rapid decrease in available supply is due to the tendency on the part of the natives more profitably to cultivate their own land. This is eminently desirable in the interests of the natives themselves, but it brings us to the inevitable conclusion that no satisfactory remedy for the present position can be found inside the island, and that, if the British settlement is to continue, we must look further afield.This point of view is also confirmed by the fact that representatives of missionary societies who for years have been concerned with the native welfare are of the opinion that the introduction of outside labour is in the general interests of the native race and necessary in British interests. Report contains convincing evidence that, if no action is taken, an increasing number of Tonkinese will be introduced under conditions over which Great Britain would have no control.Under these circumstances my Covernmeut would not feel justified in offering any objection should your Government determine that it was necessary to adopt the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission.Shall be glad to be advised at the earliest possible date as to your views and views of the New Zealand Government when these are communicated to you.(iv.)Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Governor-Generalof New Zealand.(Sent 2 p.m., 11th June, 1927.)Secret.
