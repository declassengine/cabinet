2The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was April 27, 1925       .....    .... .... ....   10*626, 1926       .... .... .... ....    8-825, 1927       .... .... .... ....    9&apos;3 (men only 11*1)A further reduction in the number of unemployed to the extent of 36,972 occurred during April. The decrease was brought about by a fall in the wholly unemployed figure, the number of temporary stoppages having risen by over 6,000. At the end of the month the numbers on the registers were still 62,880, greater than the same time last year.(C.)-Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 25th April, 1927, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 9&apos;4, as compared with 9&apos;9 at the 21st March, 1927, with 9*1 at the 26th April, 1926, and with 10*9 at the 27th April, 1925. The figures at the 25th April, 1927, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the inorease or decrease as compared with the previous month and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.	Number of Insured Persons recorded as Unemployed at Apr. 25, 1927.	Increase (4-) or Decrease ( ) compared with 			Mar. 21, 1927.	April 26, 1926.All Insured Industries..	1,133,090	-    54,692	+    39,261Building Distributive Trades Shipbuilding&apos; and Ship Repairing Hotel, boarding house, club services Tailoring General Engineering : engineers&apos; iron and steel founding Canal, river, dock and harbour service   ..

Cotton Coal Mining..          ..	62,190 82,665 58,029 21,597 6,288 65,911 47,297 33,510 39,251 218,542	- 13,682 - 8,709 - 6,889 - 5,577 - 4,471 - 3,579 - 3,532 +     3,673 +      4,950 -r    12,681	+     7,063 - 1,773 - 25,867 - 1,815 - 937 - 4*302 - 6,207 - 7,212 - 17,457 +  120,662The major part of the reduction in unemployment during the month was accounted for by improvement in the seasonal trades. The largest decrease occurred in building, the improvement being most marked in the painting and decorating section. Among the heavy industries, shipbuilding and shiprepairing again showed the most marked improvement. It will be observed that the employment position at the end of April in this industry is appreciably better than it was a year ago, but the percentage of unemployment remains at 25*9 per cent. A further slight reduction in unemployment in the Engineering trades also took place, but in Marine Engineering employment remained very slack.The further increase in unemployment in coal mining was again brought about by an inorease in short-time working which took place in most areas. The number of miners wholly unemployed fell by about 7,000 during the month. Unemployment in the Iron and Steel industry followed a somewhat similar course during the month, the temporarily stopped figure having risen, while the wholly unemployed figure showed a slight decrease. A slight adverse movement also took plaoe in the pig iron industry and it is rather unsatisfactory that the tendenoy towards recovery which has been shown in these trades during the last few months has been, at least, temporarily checked.    Employment was more
irregular in the Cotton industry during the month, the decline being most apparent in the American Spinning Department. The improvement indicated last month in the Weaving Department was maintained.(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 16th May, giving the total number on the registers as 1,007,000. This is a decrease over the position on the 25th April amounting to 37,757, and a decrease over a year ago of 605,744.ARTHUR STEBL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,&apos; May 25, 1927.
