[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1927.SECRET. Copy No.     30CP. 196 (27).I CIRCULATE to my colleagues two memoranda recording conversations with the United States Ambassador on the 8th and 11th July, together with a letter to the Ambassador on the subject of the Naval Conference at Geneva.A. C.Foreign Office, July 12, 1927.(1.)Memorandum.Mr. HOUGHTON made an urgent request for an interview this morning. He told me that he was without instructions, he was acting entirely on his own initiative and he was taking some responsibility in so doing, but the news which he received from Geneva and the effect which it was having in the United States caused him such anxiety that for his own peace of mind he felt it necessary to see whether there was anything which he could do that might prevent an impending calamity. He was afraid that the Geneva discussions had very nearly reached a deadlock. If they broke down the result in America would be formidable. The President had no sympathy with the big navy people and no great liking for big ships, but in the commotion which would follow a disagreement at Geneva he would be a cockle-shell on the waters, quite unable to control or direct the storm. The difficulty arose from the size of our demand for cruiser tonnage. He knew the point of view of the American navy people. It was that, owing to the fact that America had practically no naval bases abroad and we had many scattered over the world, small cruisers were useless to the United States, and the multiplication of small cruisers resulted wholly to our advantage. If, then, agreement failed on this point, what he feared was that American opinion would regard the Washington Conference as having failed and the restrictions we there accepted as having proved wholly to the disadvantage of America. A new programme of construction would be begun to which no limit could be put, and the ultimate result might probably be a movement on the part of the United States to get rid of all restrictions.The Ambassador spoke with evident feeling and, I am sure, with complete sincerity. I need not repeat here the arguments which I drew from our recent discussions and telegrams to Mr. Briclgeman to show the nature and the cause of our need and to convince him of the unreasonableness of the American position. He came back always to the statement that, in the view of Americans, the small cruiser was useless to them for want of bases, and that an unlimited construction of small cruisers would involve for America the building of a large number of the big cruisers, and would not only prevent further agreement but jeopardise the measure of agreement which was obtained at Washington.He said that he considered the position so serious that he had felt bound to ask me whether there was anything that he and I could do to avert disaster, and he tentatively put forward the suggestion that if we could provisionally agree to some moderate figure of aggregate tonnage say, in the neighbourhood of 400,000 tons  he would then do his utmost to procure American assent to a limitation within that total of the tonnage of particular classes, notably of the large type of cruiser. He was in a position to write direct to President Coolidge, and felt that he had a not negligible influence with him.I told the Ambassador that, speaking with the same friendly frankness which he had used, I must say that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt deeply the ungenerous and, I must say, the misleading character of the messages sent by the American 4042   [16398]      &apos; .-&apos;
Press correspondents at Geneva, who had grossly misrepresented the attitude of the British delegation and the effect of the British proposals. I said that the view which was held in America in regard to the small cruisers which we considered vital to patrol our lines of communication and supply prevented me from being sanguine of success, but I took as serious a view of the possible consequences of disagreement as he did himself, and like himself felt bound to do anything that was possible to avert so disastrous a result.I would at once communicate what he had said to me to the Prime Minister, Lord Balfour and the Admiralty, and I would see whether there was any possibility of making progress on the basis of his suggestion. I added that the latest telegrams that I had seen from Mr. Bridgeman seemed a little more hopeful, as it appeared from them that other suggestions had occurred to some of the delegates and were being discussed among them. Mr. Hough ton replied that that was not his informa-tion; he feared the Geneva conversations had come to an absolute deadlock. Is it possible for us to meet at any time this afternoon, or even late this evening after King Alf reactions&apos;s dinner ?A. C.Foreign Office, July 8, 1927.(2.)Sir Austen Chamberlain to Mr. Houghton.(Personal.)My dear Ambassador, Foreign Office, July 8, 1927.I IMMEDIATELY communicated to the Prime Minister and the colleagues whom I named to you the substance of our conversation of this morning, and this evening we met to discuss it with the close attention which it required.We are at this moment expecting further telegrams of great importance from our delegation at Geneva which may have a very important bearing on the points you and I discussed. We must therefore await them before taking any decision. It is possible that they may require personal consultation with our representatives, and that we may therefore have to ask for a short adjournment at Geneva; but I hope in any case to be in a position to make a further communication to you on Monday.We greatly appreciate the friendly feelings which inspired your initiative. We ourselves are much concerned at the course which the public discussion of these questions has taken, and we shall, you may be sure, do anything we can to find a solution on which all can agree.Yours very sincerely,&apos; AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.(3.)Memorandum.IN pursuance of the promise which I had made in my letter of Friday evening last to the American Ambassador that I would make a further communication to him to-day, I asked him to call upon me at 6-30 this evening. I said that he would have seen from my letter that we had given immediate and most careful attention to the verbal communication which he had made on Friday morning. I had been again in conference this morning with the same colleagues, when we had hoped to be in possession of the telegrams which we were expecting from Geneva. For some reason, however, we were still without the information for which we had been waiting. - Nevertheless,. I was authorised,on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make a suggestion, to him. I should like, however&apos;, in the.first instance to state very briefly the position as it.appeared to us. . When we,received President Coolidg&apos;e&apos;s invitation, we had already been studying for some time the &quot;question&apos;&apos;6f a.further limitation.of naval, armaments and that study was naturally carried on intensively when we, decided.toaiccept the Pre;sident&apos;s;invitation. Our delegation had, therefore, gone to Geneva with&apos;a carefully thought but scheme,&apos; of the-effect of nvhich I might give him perhaps some idea when&apos; I said that; if. Our proposals as a whole- were
adopted, they would produce in our own case a reduction of nearly  50,000,000 over what we otherwise estimated would be our normal naval expenditure in the next few years and corresponding relief to the budgets of other Powers. I did not suggest that the immediate relief .to the United States would be as great as we recognised that they were in some sense behind in their cruiser programme and had leeway to make up.Our delegation from the first made the frankest statement of our needs in the Experts Committee and had given detailed information to enable the other delegations to appreciate and judge them. On the other hand the American experts had until Tuesday or Wednesday of last week persistently refused&apos; to give any information as to United States needs on the ground that such a statement involved political considerations which were not suitable to the Experts Committee. But in the middle of last week they had produced a document, almost in the form of an ultimatum, which indicated that, out of the total cruiser tonnage which they proposed, 250,000 tons would be devoted to the construction of the largest class of cruiser not included in the category of capital ships, in other words to what might be described as 10.000-ton cruisers with 8-inch guns. At present we had built or building fourteen of these cruisers and a fifteenth was included in our approved programme. The United States Government had actually two and the construction of six others had been contemplated, though as yet no money had been provided for them. Admiral Jones&apos;s proposal was therefore to increase an actual two and a contemplated programme of eight to the number of twenty-five. Whereas our &quot;proposals meant, as 1 had said, a reduction of something like  50 million in the expenditure which we contemplated as normal, this American proposal would force us into a great new building programme of the most costly and most menacing class of vessel outside the category of capital ships and would result in an increase of expenditure and armament instead of in a reduction of either. In our view any overhead limitation of cruiser tonnage was useless as a means of limitation unless a limit were also placed upon the amount of this tonnage which could be devoted to the 8-inch gun ship, for it was obvious that this latter class of ship could only be met by its like and that the smaller cruiser with the lighter gun would be useless if there were to be a greatly extended construction of the more powerful type.The Ambassador here interrupted me to refer again to the. smaller cruiser as the cruiser of limited range, useful to the Power with numerous naval bases but useless to the United States. I replied that I had duly reported his argument in this case and was not in a position to reply to it. I was informed that the American naval experts at Geneva had never produced this argument, and the British naval experts could not believe that they would ever base themselves upon it, for they must know that it had no technical foundation. The smaller class which w7e contemplated of about 7,500 tons with 6-inch guns would have a cruising range at full speed of between 3,000 and 4,000 miles, and at their normal or economic speed, which was, of course, the speed which they would employ except in moments of urgency or in the chase, their cruising range would extend to between 7,000 and 8,000 miles. Such cruisers, therefore, could proceed from America throughout the whole line of American naval bases and could reach to whatever port the American Government might desire to send them.Reverting to the question of the tonnage limit, I said that it appeared to us that, if we had to make an agreement with America only, no great difficulty would arise. It was equally true that we had every reason to suppose that we could easily reach a limit applicable to Japan and ourselves if we were negotiating with Japan alone and had no other Power to consider, but the difficulty arose from the tripartite nature of our conversations. The proportion of cruiser tonnage which Japan was prepared to accept vis-a-vis England she was not willing to adopt vis-a-vis the United States. If, therefore, the United States embarked on the large cruiser extension which was suggested by Admiral Jones, it would put up the Japanese demand and again react upon our own. It appeared to us, therefore, that in a three-Power negotiation there were almost insuperable difficulties in getting agreement.to a ratio of total tonnage based on the theoretical needs of each of the three Powers for all time,, and that we must, therefore, seek some other method of turning, this difficulty,. In these circiimstances, His Majesty\s Government.proffered the following suggestion: ; ( -   i &apos;   1,1   *;      &apos;: ;,;&quot;,! 1  &apos;&apos;   i   r   n,&apos;        iInstead&apos; of .endeavouring to-fix;maximum overhead^ tbnnage ,1&apos;or a.11 time based on theoretical needs and embracing far largerbpnstruqtibri&apos;tliari&apos;;ariy of the Powers now had in contemplation,, absolution should be&apos;&apos; sought oh lihoivof an
agreement as to the total in each class beyond which each party would not go up to 1936. viz.. the date of the expiration of the Washington Treaty, before which the whole subject must obviously be again considered.If the United States Government approved this suggestion and would issue instructions to Mr. Gibson to seek a solution on these lines, the British Government would send similar instructions to Mr. Bridgeman.I told the Ambassador briefly what I had said in the House of Commons this afternoon, which he said would be helpful. He asked me to note on a piece of paper for him the exact words of the British suggestion as stated above, and I accordingly gave him a copy of it. When I was explaining to him the effect upon our building programme of Admiral Jones&apos;s proposal to construct twenty-five 10,000-ton cruisers, he enquired what number we claimed, and I replied, &quot; the same parity for which you ask,&quot; but I added that, so anxious were we for an alleviation of the burden on our peoples and for a restriction of armaments that, though we had actually fourteen such vessels under construction and though our present programme included a fifteenth, we should be prepared, if the American Government were content with a lesser figure, actually to scrap some part of the cruisers already under discussion.Finally, as I had just received Sir E. Howard&apos;s private and most confidential telegram of the 10th July, I said, but without specifically alluding to it, that, if Mr. Kellogg and the American Government thought that conversations between Mr. Houghton and myself would facilitate agreement, I would readily lend myself to them, though there was a little danger in carrying on negotiations simultaneously in two places, and it was for that reason that we had suggested the issue of parallel instructions to Mr. Gibson and Mr. Bridgeman. I added with mental reference to the concluding words of Sir E. Howard&apos;s telegram, that if by any chance Mr. Kellogg thought it desirable that he and I should meet. I should be glad to fall in with his wrishes. not that I contemplated that it would be possible for me to go to Washington at this moment, but that, if Mr. Kellogg thought it desirable, we could both go to Geneva.A CForeian Office.
