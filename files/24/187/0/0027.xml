[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]SECRET. Copy No. 30CP. 178 (27).CABINET.ENTRY OF IRAQ INTO THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum Cjrcllated by the Secretary oe State eor the Colonies.I RECENTLY circulated, for the information of the Cabinet, (CP. 173 (27)), a copy of correspondence with the High Commissioner for Iraq on the question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should support an application for the early admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations.Article 3 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926 stipulated that this question should be examined by His Majesty&apos;s Government in August 192S (viz., upon the expiration of the period covered by the protocol of April 1923), and thereafter at subsequent successive intervals of four years. My colleagues will recollect the circumstances in which this provision came to be inserted in the Treaty. The Commission appointed by the League Council to investigate the question of the northern frontier of that country, reported that although the most suitable alignment would be the &quot; Brussels Line &quot; (giving Iraq the Mosul Vilayet), conditions in Iraq were such that, if the British Mandate were to be prematurely withdrawn, it would be better for the inhabitants of the Mosul Vilayet to be placed under the sovereignty of Turkey. Indeed, the Commission expressed their conviction that, if the League of Nations&apos; control of Iraq (Le., the British Mandate) were to terminate on the expiry of the protocol period, the majority of the people directly affected by the frontier decision would have preferred Turkish to Arab sovereignty. Consequently the Commission in recommending the adoption of the Brussels Line as the frontier between Iraq and Turkey, suggested that this should be made conditional upon Iraq remaining &quot; under the effective mandate of the League of Nations for a period which may be put at twenty-five years.&quot;In delivering its award on the frontier question, the Council of the League stipulated, as a condition precedent to the award becoming definitive, that a new Treaty should be concluded between Great Britain and Iraq ensuring the continuance of the mandatory regime for a period of twenty-five years unless Iraq were admitted as a member of the League before the expiration of that period.In the despatch which I have circulated Sir Henry Dobbs argues in favour of supporting an application by Iraq for admission in August next year, the first of the quadrennial dates contemplated in article 3 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926. I will briefly recapitulate his principal arguments.Sir Henry Dobbs admits that the recommendations of the Frontier Commission and the decision of the Council were clearly directed towards the continuance of the present regime for some considerable time after the date of the expiry of the period contemplated in the protocol, and he recognises that an attempt to secure the admission of Iraq upon that date might meet, with a critical reception. He also anticipates opposition on the part of France from the point of view of the probable effect upon Syria. He points out, however, that the disqualifications of Iraq for membership of the League are common to other countries which are already members. He shows that the unstable conditions which the Commission found in Iraq, and which coloured their recommendations, were largely transitory and disappeared with the frontier settlement, slP?e which Iraq has made great advances in stability and sound administration. He adds that the entry of Iraq into the League, although bringing to an end the present formal relationship, would not necessarily mean tho discontinuance of British advice and military support.Sir Henry Dobbs considers it impracticable to leave things as they are and merely announce when the time comes, that we are not, prepared to press for Iraq&apos;s admission, lne present excellent political atmosphere in Iraq, and the harmonious relations [16-261]
between the Iraq Government and their British advisers, are not an argument for inaction; they are due to the confidence felt in our intention to carry the country forward as quickly as possible to the goal of complete independence. If this confidence were destroyed, the political atmosphere would at once change for the worse, the present amity would be replaced by covert or open hostility, and a generally unsatis-factory situatiou might be created. In Sir H. Dobbs&apos;s own words, Great Britain would then &quot;experience in Iraq the same dreary disillusionment which she has had to bear in India and Egypt.&quot;But apart from these general considerations and apart from the provisions of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1926, Sir H. Dobbs argues that we are bound by a definite pledge to apply without delay for the admission of Iraq to the League. In support of this view, he quotes the following extract from the message sent to Iraq in 1922 by the then Colonial Secretary (Mr. Churchill): &quot; They (His Majesty&apos;s Government) confidently look forward to this application (viz. : an application by Iraq for admission to membership of the League of Nations) being made as soon as the frontieis are settled and a stable Government set up in accordance with the Organic Law, when they will use their good offices, provided that effect is being given to the provisions of the Treaty, to secure the admission of Iraq to membership of the League . . . .&quot;As Sir FTenry Dobbs points out, the conditions mentioned in this assurance have all been fulfilled, or will have been fulfilled by the end of 1928.Finally, Sir H. Dobbs examines the probable effect upon Egypt of His Majesty&apos;s Government supporting the application of Iraq for admission to the League. He admits that this would probably increase the difficulty of resisting a similar demand from Egypt, but points out that it is a choice of evils and that &quot; the only effect of our refusing to advocate the admission of Iraq for fear that this would excite the envy of Egypt, would be that we should have two Egypt&apos;s instead of one on our hands.&quot;Sir Henry Dobbs&apos;s views cannot be lightly disregarded ; but not unnaturally he has approached the problem mainly from the standpoint of its effect upon Iraq and the relations between that country and Great Britain. He has not overlooked the probability of difficulties with the League or with the French, but he does not, perhaps, fully realise the extent to which such considerations must weigh with His Majesty&apos;s Government.I cannot conceive that anyone at Geneva eighteen months ago imagined that we should propose Iraq for membership of the League so soon as 1928. The League Council, in making their award, clearly contemplated that a much longer interval should elapse before Iraq was released from mandatory control. If we now press for admission so soon, it might have the appearance almost of sharp practice and might lay us open to the suspicion of having secured a favourable frontier award by under-taking further obligations which we had no real intention of discharging. We cannot, therefore, assume that the League generally would regard such a proposal with favour, and any hesitancy on their part would undoubtedly encourage French opposition. It seems to me most unlikely that a proposal for the admission of Iraq next year would be successful, even if it were supported by all the influence at our disposal.Nevertheless, I feel strongly with Sir H. Dobbs that this matter cannot be shelved indefinitely. Since his despatch was written the question has become an active political issue in Iraq. Both in connection with the problem of the future defence organisation in Iraq (which has recently been under reference to the Cabinet) and with the proposed Conscription Law, attempts have been made by King Faisal and his Ministers to secure a public announcement that Great Britain will support an appliea-tion for Iraq&apos;s admission next year. It has been represented that some such announce-ment is essential in order to sugar the pill of conscription. Considerable pressure is being brought to bear upon the High Commissioner. The Iraq Cabinet, inspired by King Faisal, whose main object seems to be to iigure in a popular role, have already resigned on the ground that, failing a pronouncement of British intentions in regard to the admission of Iraq to the League, they cannot proceed with the introduction of the Conscription Law nor with the necessary- measures for the reorganisation of the Iraq army. It is obvious that if we maintain a purely negative attitude we are certain to be faced with a troublesome campaign of political agitation in favour of the entry of Iraq into the League, which cannot fail to prejudice the excellent relations at present, existing.To avoid such a regrettable development I think it necessary that a definite pronouncement of our policy should be made forthwith.   This should be of a nature
to take the wind out of nationalist sails by satisfying legitimate Iraqi aspirations without giving just cause for resentment in Geneva or Paris. The pronouncement, I consider, should be to the effect that, if all goes well in Iraq in the interval, His Majesty&apos;s Government will he prepared to support an application by Iraq for membership of the League in 1932, viz., the second of the dates contemplated in the 192(5 Treaty.This would have the great advantage of giving nis Majesty&apos;s Government a reasonable breathing space in which to make their arrangements for safeguarding vital Imperial intei-ests in Iraq after her entry into the League. It would also, I believe, if made promptly and before an agitation in favour of earlier admission had time to gain impetus, satisfy reasonable public opinion in Iraq, and thus minimise the risk of troublesome developments.The prospect of Iraq becoming a member of the League in five years&apos; time could scarcely arouse any very lively opposition at Geneva, nor need it be expected to excite any stronger resentment on the part of the French than did the signature of the protocol in 1923, which set a maximum limit of four j-ears to our mandatory relations with Iraq.I realise that it might have been preferable to avoid any definite commitment, however hedged round with conditions, to support lraq&apos;s candidature in 1932. No one can say what will be the state of the world at that date or that events may not occur in the interval rendering it either difficult or undesirable to relinquish our present degree of control over Iraq. But I am convinced that nothiug less than the course of action proposed would satisfy the bulk of opinion in Iraq and thus avert an agitation which would in any case be embarrassing and might lead to serious difficulties. 1 therefore trust that the Cabinet will concur in the issue of instructions to the High Commissioner for Iraq in the terms of the draft telegram attached to this memorandum. 1 should prefer to retain the words which the Air Ministry wish to omit.L. S. A.Colonial Office, June 9, 1927.Draft Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissionerfor Iraq.Your secret despatches of the 24th, 30th and 31st March.His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined with close attention important question discussed in your despatches, viz., that of admission of Iraq to League of Nations. They appreciate force of arguments in favour of taking action with League at earliest date contemplated in Treaty of 1926, viz., the 6th August, 1928. They realise that a decision to this effect if communicated to Iraq Government at an early date might conduce to satisfactory settlement of important questions now pending, and would convince people of Iraq beyond all possibility of doubt that British Government are in earnest in their avowed policy of promoting establishment of full autonomy in Iraq with the least possible delay. On the other hand, they cannot but feel that it would be premature and against best interests of Iraq to take such a step at as early a date as August 1928. You yourself have quoted in your despatch, Secret C., of the 24th March, certain extracts from Report of Frontier Commission indicating that Commission contemplated continuance of British supervision for much longer period. It was on basis of Commissions Report that Council of League recorded decision under which whole of Mosul Vilayet was awarded to Iraq. I cannot believe that when Council had question before them in 1925 and 1926 any of its members supposed that question of Iraq&apos;s admission to League and consequent discontinuance of British supervision would be raised so soon as August 1928. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that to bring matter forward after so short an interval might have appearance almost of sharp practice and would lay us open to suspicion of having secured frontier we desired by undertaking further obligations which we had no real intention of discharging.In all the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government do not feel justified in raising question in August 1928. They will be prepared, however, provided all goes well iu the interval, to approach League in matter at next date contemplated in Treaty of 1926,
[ ] viz., August 1932 [and to use all their influence to induce League to agree to admission Air Ministry ofclraq at that date]. They believe that in Iraq&apos;s own interest this will prove much would omit. better course. If question is raised prematurely next year, it seems certain that opposition will be aroused which, if it led to rejection of application, would create most unfortunate impression and might have the effect of prejudicing claims of Iraq for some time to come. If, on the other hand, matter is deferred to 1932, and if in meantime Iraq continues to progress, as we all hope and believe she will, proposition when brought forward is much more likely to secure general acceptance.It is possible that when our intentions in this matter become known League may think it desirable before matter comes up for decision to send further Commission to Iraq to investigate conditions on the spot. It is not intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to volunteer any such suggestion, but I presume that if suggestion is made there would be no strong objection on your part or on that of Iraq Government to its being carried into effect. It would clearly be not unreasonable that League should Avish to satisfy itself by independent enquiry that local situation is such as to justify modification of policy adopted on recommendation of previous Commission sent to country under its auspices.Subject to any further comments you may have to offer, you are authorised to inform Iraq Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend, provided present rate r   -     of progress in Iraq is maintained, to take up with League in August 1932 question of . L . J     Iraq&apos;s admission [and to press the matter with all the influence at their disposal], trouidomit! There is no objection to Iraq Government making public announcement to this effect, in such terms as you and they may agree upon as calculated to have the best effect.o
