The Minister of Health and the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury have bean unable to attend theMeeting held since they were added to the Committee., but thelatter was represented by the Treasurer of the Households2. The Cabinet will remember that in his Memorandum theLord Privy Seal drew attention to the serious evils resulting from the present arrangements under which important Pills originating in th a Commons constantly reach the House of Lords at so lfste a cate in the Session as to give wholly inadequate opportunity for their proper consideration by that House end pointed out that but for the existence of the Parliamentary
rule under which when a Session Is ended &quot;by prorogation all Bills, which have not reached the stage of being presented for the Royal Assent, lapse, the House of lords would be in a position to deal properly with such Bills at the commence-ment of the following Session when the House of Commons would he concerned with financial business o3. The lord Privy Seal accordingly suggested that theStanding Orders of the two Houses should be so modified that, where a Bill has passed the House of Commons and not passed the House of lords or vice vnrsa, the Bill sh ould be carried over to the next Session as if no prorogation had taken place,    These new facilities would, however, b9 subject to certain limitations, for example-, provision would have to be made to protect the working of the Parliament Act.4. The Committee entirely agree with the lord privy seal respecting the wholly unsatisfactory conditions in which the House of lords has to carry cut its legislative functions at the clcso of a Session.      Important Bills of a technical, complicated,  and sometimes highly controversial character, often reach the House of lords -oath in a few weeks of the Sessions end in a condition which calls for a number of substantial or drafting, amendments.      Some of such Bills would normally, if time permitted, be referred to Select Committees of the House of Lords for exhaustive scrutiny; and others would receive prolonged consideration in the Committee of the House.     If a Revising Oh ember is to function efficiently, ample time should be available for its work; but at the most critical period of the Session from this point of view the House of Lords is compelled by circumstances over which it has no control, to work under
conditions which may have results highly detrimental to the public interest.5, Among many recent examples oi important Bills whichhave passed into law in the circumstances described above, reference may be made to the Rating and Valuation Bill (mentioned in CPo538(25), and the Judicial Proceedings (Regulation of Reports) Bill 1925 - a Bill which had received the almost unanimous approval of the House of Commons., but which must have been lost unless in December last the House of Lords had agreed to take all the stages of the Bill on a single day.      The Lord Privy Seal has warned the Committee that the House of Lords cannot bo expected to acquiesce much longer in the existing state of affairs and that that House may be forced to make its protest by allowing some Government Bill of importance to expire on a prorogation.6. The question raised by the Lord Privy Seal is one of very long standing and v/as the subject of complaint by the House of Lords at least as early as 1668.      Through oat the nineteenth century various proposals were made xcr the provision;, either by Statute or by Standing Orders for the suspension of Bills from one Session to another or for resuming proceedings upon such Bills notwithstanding a prorogation^ but these proposals &apos;.-hich were fully discussed in Parliament and carefully considered by Committees of both Houses failed to materialise owing to the suspicion with which they have hitherto been regarded by all Parties )rr the House of Commons.    A Summary of these proposals is attached (See Appendix A)-The members of the Committed who are members of the House of Commons hold the view that there has been little if any change of feeling in this respect, and that accordingly proposals to modify the existing rule must be
regarded from the point of view of the House of Commons as highly contentious..7* The Clerk of the Parliaments has circulated to theCommittee a Memorandum, attached to this Report as Appendix B suggesting ways by which the present rule could be altered and pointing out the dangers and objections to the various alternative mode3 of procedure.     The position as it appears to the Committee, is summarised in the following paragraphs.8. The present rule, that v;h-.n a Session is ended byprorogation, all Bills die and cannot be proceeded with in the next Session unless introduced again, is an unwritten parliamentary lsv;*      Any direct infraction of the rule should strictly speaking only be made on the authority of a Statu-ir While there is no sufficient precedent for carrying over a Public Bill in any form, there are many precedents for carrying over, by Indirect means, Private Bills, either generally in order to prevent proceedings on such Bills and money spent by the Promoters being wasted when a dissolution takes place? or specially In the case of a Bill which has been delayed owing to some particular circumstance in any Session^9c The simplest and most practicable solution would beto enact that the Kovise of Lords should have the right to carry over to the beginning of the next Session a Bill which only reaches that House within a short time, say a month, before the end. of the Session.      The principal objections to this solution are - (1) it involves a direct interference by written law with unwritten law on a matter affecting the constitution;    (S) to be really effective the legislation must allow the House of Lords to carry over a Bill without the consent of the House of Commons - and it seems certain
that such s preposition c only not ho sustained in the House of Commons;    (3) the existing arrangement provides an effective check and safeguard against hasty and revolutionary legislation and also against legislation of a mischievous character,  open opposition to whioh may he undesirable.    legislation of general application on the linos suggested would accordingly operate seriously to the disadvantage ol a Conservative Opposition in the House of Commons.10- Assuming that procedure by Bill is impracticable,the alternative solution of procedure by St an di ng Ord a rs may be considered^     The passing of general Standing Order-by both Houses (following the precedent of Orders carrying over Private Bills) is open to very much the came objections to procedure by legislation - for example in order to be effective from the point of view of the House of Lords, the Standing Order to be passed by the House of Commons must in terms affirm the freedom of the House of Lords to carry over any 3ills ,  other than Bills, such as Money Bills, which would be specifically exempted from the proeedu.ro--Pailing the practicability of procedure by means of general Standing Orders, it would be possible if both Hocsenagreed to pass Orders as regards any special Bill or Bills which the House of Lords, owing to want of time at the end of the Session, might des.ir9 to carry over to the next Session, naming the Bills to which the Order should apply-      Sams members of the Committee think, however, that even this limited and conditional proposal is open to objection on the  round that ii  toe principle of carrying over Public-Bills is once conceded,  it will be impossible to resist demands for a wide extension of the scheme.
11.       In tho course of&quot; their enquiry, the Committee have been informed by the Treasurer of the Household that one of the causes why important 3ill3 reach the House of lords so late in the Session, is to be found in the slow progress made with the Bills by Standing Committees of the House of Commons.    This slow progress is often due to the difficulty of securing the necessary quorum,  in the absence of which  ohe Chairman of tho Standing Committee must either suspend the proceedings until a quorum is present,  or adjourn tho Committee to some future dsy*12.After careful consideration the Committeesubmit to the Cabinet the following conclusions :-(l) Tho Committee unanimously agree that the conditions in which the House of Lords has to carry out its legislative functions at the end of a Session are unsatisfactory end prejudicial to the public interest; but(2) The Committee make no recommendation as regards the Lord Privy Sealls proposal for the carrying over of bill  from one Parliamentary Session to another.(3) In th e opinion of the Committee the only remedy at present available is that the Lords should press their claim to have important measures sent up to them in time to allow of their being adequately considered before the end of the Session.(4) With a view to relieving the situation in the House of Lords, the Committee wish to draw the attention of the Cabinet to \the desirability Of securing greater expedition in the transaction of business by Standing Committees of the House of Commons by. some alteration of the present quorum rules\ of those Committees.(Signed on behalf of the Committee), Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.

The principal criticisms raised, by Lord Brougham, Lox-u Campbell and Lord Sedesdale were directed to constitutional and technical points, but reference was also made to the undesirability of increasing the facilities for thepassage of &quot;freak&quot; legislation        to the danger in the numberthat the proposal might lead to an increase/of he styand ill considered jiots and to the risk of disputes between the Houses if the Lords suspended important and urgent bills sent up by the House of Commons&apos;.

In the course of the Debate the Marquess of Salisbury said that &quot;he was formerly of the opinion held by the late Lord Derby that some change was necessary in order to facilitateand improve the proceedings of the House,  and that if he did not Venture to express the same opinion so confidently now it was rather because he did not see any sufficient agreement in that House and still less in the other to make such a remedy at all practicable.     lie thought that both Parties in the House of Commons were averse to any such Shartgo in their procedure.      Conservatives held the opinion which might be summarised by the view thatthere had been too much legislation and that it would benot-increased by such an arrangement.

In their Report, after pointing out the essential differences between their proposals and those which had been rejected In the years 1848, 1851 and 1869, the Committee observed &quot;Ir the first place that a plan by which one House isenabled more effectively to deal, with business which has originated in it and which has never left it can hardly form a precedent for a totally different scheme by which one House may bo able to postpone without rejected Bills initiated in the other- Aid in tho second place it is obvious that no endeavour on the part of tho House of lords to carry out the second of these
objects can be effectual without the concurrence ofthe House of Commons.    For the change of proceduremust either be effected by        Bill or by standing order.    If by Bill,then the assent of both Houses isrequired.    If by Standing Order,then only by standing orders adopted by both Houses and to which bothbeenHousos must therefore be parties.      &quot;It has/alleged that the Standing Order now proposed would invite and countenance the adoption by the House of Lords of a similar Standing Order, and thus enable that House to postpone the consideration of all Bills passed and sent up from the House of Commons.&quot;     In reply te this allegation, your Committee deem it right and necessary to record their opinion that any claim or attempt by either House ef Parliament of its own authority, by Standing Order or otherwise, to postpone to a future Session of Parliament any Bill sent to it from the other House of Parliament, would be a breach of the constitutional usage of Parliament&quot;.The above extract shows that even as late as 1890 the House of Commons was disposed to regard with great suspicion        proposalsemanating from the House of Lords . for carrying over Bills.(Sg-d. ) R.B.

AJ...T.. E r D I I      &apos;3&apos;Ca rrying^Oyer 51lls. Note by the Clerk of the Parliaments.Lord Salisbury proposes that some provision should he made for carrying over a Bill from one cession to the next, In order to give the House of Lords time properly to consider Bills which come to them at the end of a session, and owing to want af time cannot be effectively dealt with by the House.There is always plenty of 3pare time in the Hou3e of Lords at the beginning of the session,  and Lord Salisbury&apos;s proposal would enable this time tc be usefully used for work which, as things are at present,   is necessarily scampedThe trouble, of course,  is nc new trouble but has recurred in varying degrees every session for years.As shown in Mr. Howorth&apos;s note of the references given on page 302 of May1s Parliamentary Practice, various proposals have been made to mend the matter, but without result.      The influence of the House of Lords has never beer-sufficient to overcome the dislike of the House of Commons ti &amp;nj x^proposals for carrying ever Public Bills.     A dislike which is possibly intuitive and sentimental rather than founded on reason.      At the same time it is a dislike which cannot, and -should not, be lightly disregarded.
At pressrit the rule is,  that when a session Is ended by prorogation all Bills die and cannot be proceeded with in the next session unless introduced again.     This is unwritten parliamentary law and any direct infraction of the rule could, I think,  only be mads by the authority of a Statute.     There i3 at any rate no precedent for carrying over&apos; a Public Bill in. any form.There are, however, many precedents for carrying over, by indirect means  , Private Bills-;    either generally in order to prevent proceedings cn Private Bills, and money spent by Promoters, being wasted when a dissolution takes place,  or Especially in the case of a Bill which has been delayed owing to some particular circumstance in any session-This carrying ever of Private Bills Is now effected, net by direct infraction ^f the rule which kills Bills at the end of the session, but by a provision that if a Bill,  which has passed through various stages in a former session,  is brought in in the same form in the next session, the Bill Is to start at the stage in which it left off in the previous session, the earlier stages being passed pro forma.      This provision la made by a Standing Order, and has practically the same effect as the provision which continues a Bill and keeps it alive from one session to another.The simplest and most practicable form of meeting the case is to introduce a Bill allowing tho House of Lords by resolution to carry over to the beginning of the next session a Bill v?hich only reaches the House of Lords within a short time,  say a month, before the end of the session.The objections to this simple form are -(1)  It Involves a direct interference with the unwritten parliamentary lavi that the end of a session kills all bills.s    See footnote on Page 7.
From a general point of view any interference with the unwritten lav: by written la%&apos; is much to be deprecated especially In matters which affect the constitution.     From a practical point of view the rule that the end cf a session brings to an end all the proceedings of the session is the turning point of all our parliamentary practice and any Infraction of the rule, however strong may be the practical reasons in favour of it and however strict the safeguards, must always be treated as dangerous.     In this case the infraction could not be treated as negligible or unimportant and there tvould be much difficulty in. overcoming the strong arguments against the infraction of the present rule and the strong feeling that rightly exists against touching the rule.(2) To make the provision really effective it would be necessary to allow the House of Lords to carry over bills without the consent of the House of Commons.     Whether such a proposition would be -maintained in the House of Commons seems dcubtful.(3) The proposition in this&apos; form would involve a Bill which would certainly not be uncontentious in the House of Commons.An examination of the various attempts that have been made to carry through a proposal in this form shows that the proposal has never met with much favour in past years,  and it is difficult to see that there would be any change in the feeling as regards such a proposal at present.On the supposition that procedure by Bill effectively enabling the House of Lords to carry over hills is not
practicable as natters are at present, it remains to bo soon whether anything could be done to effect the required object in other ways.Ho doubt the passing of Standing Orders by both Houses following the precedent of Orders carrying over Private Bills would in a way get round any direct infraction of the rule that the end of a session kills a Bill and would also avoid objection on the ground that tho House of Lords would be given power to carry over bills without the conssnt of the House of Commons.At the same time as far as precedent is concerned it must be remembered that the    carrying over of Private Bills is a very different question from tho carrying over of Public Bills.      In the case of Private Bills no general political question is involved and the 2*ea3on for carrying over the bills is to do justice to the promoters of the bills and to prevent their time and money being wasted by repetition of proceedings and the duplication of fees which would be involved by the reintroduction of the bill in another session in the ordinary manner.To make procedure by Standing Order effective it would be necessary for the House of Commons to pass a Standing Order of general effect taking tho form of an Order providing that if the Lords pass a resolution as respects a bill sent up to them within a certain time, say a month, before the end of a session,  carrying over that bill &quot;&apos;;o tho next session then the bill if introduced in the next session in the form in which it has been sent to the Lords shall ho treated as having passed through all the stages which it has passed, through in the previous session and shall be sent to the Lords direct,
The passing of such Standing Order would no doubt do what is required but would be open to very much the same objections as those to which such a bill as is dealt with above is open.      It is true that the Order does not directly infringe the parliamentary rule but it merely gets round it and does not really avoid the objections which are urged against the direct infraction of the rule. Also the Standing Order, if it is to bo really effective and to enable the House of Lords to carry over bills withou difficulty, must onco and for all give the assent of tho House of Commons to the freedom of the House of Lords to adopt such a course and, though an assent given by Standing Order is more easily revoked than an assent given by Bill, it would not be easy to persuade tho House of Commons to give such a general assent,It seems on the whole very doubtful whether such a general Staiading Order -would be accepted by the House of Commons.Failing the possibility of general Standing Orders. being passed it would of course be possible to pass Orders as regards any special bill or bills which the House of Lords, owing to want of time at the end of tho session, might desire to carry over to the next session naming the Bills to which the Order is to apply.     For instance it may well be that, if tbe House of Commons wish to end the present session at the end of July, they will not be able to pass tbe Trade Unions Bill sufficiently soon to allow proper time for the consideration of the Bill in the House of Lords and the Government might be persuaded to get an Order passed in the House of Commons providing that, if a Bill is introduced in the Commons at the beginning of next session in the same form as the bill sent up to tbe House
of Lords, that bill is to bo deemed to have passed all its stages in the Eouse of Commons and to be sent direct to the Eouso of Lords.As regards any of these proposals the difficulty, of course, rests with the ilouso of Commons, and in this connection it must bo noted that the Eouse of Commons do not gain any practical advantage from the adoption of these proposals, which will compensate for the general objections and atmosphere of suspicion which attach to the proposals. Theoretically, of course, tho short time at the end of the session which is allowed for the Lords to consider Bills might be saved in the Commons;    but as a matter of practice the saving of the time would not be great, and would certainly in practice not be so long as tho time which would be taken by the Eouse of Lords to consider the Bill.Besides this there would be a feeling in the Eouse ox Commons that having passed a Bill they would be glad to be rid of it at once, and not to have Lords amendments hanging over thoir heads on a subject which would become stale in another session.     Ho doubt suoh a feeling should not exist, but it would certainly exist in sufficient force to make any weakening on the part of the House of Commons on the general arguments unlikely.Prom the Whips point of view these sort of objections have a very considerable force and it Is reasonable to conclude that the Whips point of view has played a considerable part in the &quot;unfavourable reception given in past years to any proposals of this character.In this note no notico has been taken of the proposition that the power to carry over should be given, not only to the Eouse of Lords, but also to the House of

This Bill was carried ever to the 1904 session and effect was given to the resolution carrying over the Bill, although the Bill was ultimately dropped at the end of the 1904 session.
