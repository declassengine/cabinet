C. 23907Revise.-&quot;Iraq-L.N.-889L.      300, 80.The SECRETARY OF STATE to the HIGH COMMISSIONER. [Answered by No. C. 40299/27 [No. 5].](Secret.)Sir, Downing Street, 4th January, 1927.Article 3 of the Anglo-&apos;Iraq Treaty of the 13th January, 1926, provides that, at the expiration of the period covered by the Protocol of April, 1923 (i.e., the 6th August, 1928), and thereafter at subsequent successive intervals of 4 years until the expiry of the period of 25 years mentioned in the Treaty of January, 1926, or until the admission of Traq into the League of Nations, His Britannic Majesty will take into active consideration the following two questions, namely : (1) The question whether it is possible for him to press for the admissionof Traq into the League of Nations;(2) if it is not so possible, the question of the amendment, on account ofthe progress made by the Kingdom of Traq or for any other reason, of theagreements referred to in Article XVIII of the Treaty of 10th October, 1922. 2. It is to be anticipated that the question of the admission of Traq into the League of Nations will arouse active discussion in Traq during the next one-and-a-half years, and that interest in the subject will increase in intensity as the date&quot; contemplated in the Treaty, viz., the termination of the Protocol period in August, 1928, draws nearer. I am not aware what view is likely to be held by the Traq Government on this subject, or how far it may be their intention to press for admis-sion to the League at the earliest opportunity. But an agitation in favour of early admission may easily be aroused; and the Traq Government, whatever may be their own wishes, may find themselves compelled, in deference to their critics if for no other reason, to raise the question officially with His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is clearly desirable that a decision should be reached, as soon as possible, as to the atti-tude which, in that event, His Majestv&apos;s Government should adopt. I should be glad if you would take the whole matter into your early consideration and favour me with an expression of your views.I have, &amp;c,L. S. AMERY.
C. 40299/27 [No. 5]The HIGH COMMISSIONER to the SECRETARY OF STATE. (Received 4th April, 1927.)(Secret &quot;C&quot;)Sir, The Residency, Baghdad, 24th March, 1927.I have the honour to reply to your Secret despatch dated the 4th of January, 1927, which deals with the question whether it will be possible at the termination of the Protocol period of the original Anglo-Traq Treaty for His Britannic Majesty to press for the admission of Traq into the League of Nations.A.   Possible Objections to the Early Admission of Traq.2. The first points Avhich appear to deserve discussion are the likelihood of objections on the part of members of the League to the early admission of &apos;Iraq and the extent to which Traq will, so far as can be foreseen, be qualified towards the end of 1928 for admission. In examining these points I must ask pardon if my com-parative ignorance of the attitude of the League towards the admission of new members and of the policy of France in particular leads me into unfounded speculations.3. It seems probahle that the League will largely base its appreciation of the fitness of Traq for admission upon the Report of the Commission appointed to examine the question of the frontier between Turkey and Traq, which was presented to the League on the 16th of July, 1925. I quote below the relevant passages from Chapter V of that Report: &quot; The internal situation in the State of Traq, however, seems unstable. Those who direct the government have undoubtedly the best intentions, but lack political experience. Serious difficulties are being encountered owing to the tension between Sunnites and Shiites, the latter of wTiom are less open to modern ideas of reform. It should be noted that the Shiites are in a majority in the two Vilayets of Baghdad and Basrah, while the vast majority of the population of the Vilayet of Mosul are Sunnites. The relations between Kurds and Arabs are also uncertain; at the time of the Commission^ visit the Government had not yet ventured to set up an Traq administration in thp Liwa of Snlaimaniya, which was still ruled by British officials. The Corn-mission formed the impression that the Mandate, in the shape of the existing Treaty, must be maintained for something like a generation in order to allow of the consolidation and development of the new State. In the opinion of many persons whom we consulted, the very existence of the State might be imperilled if the guidance and protection afforded by the League of Nations Mandate were withdrawn after a few years.It is clear, therefore, that the economic and other advantages which the Vilayet of Mosul as a whole would derive from union with Traq would be exchanged for very serious political difficulties if the Mandate should expire before Traq could be regarded as ripe for self-government without League support. In that case it would certainly be better for the Vilayet of Mosul to be placed under Turkish sovereignty, since the internal and external political situation of Turkey is incomparably more stable than would be the case with Traq if the latter country were left to itself.Though in comparison with the pre-war situation considerable progress &apos;has undeniably been achieved by the Traq Government with the help o&apos;f British advice, more especially in regard to general security, publichealth and education-tion, there can be no doubt that the internal conditions of the Kingdom are still very unstable. Notwithstanding the good intentions of the statesmen of Traq, whose political experience is necessarily small, it is to be feared that serious difficulties mav arise out of the differences which in some cases exist in regard to political ideas between the Shiites of the South and the Sunnites of the North, the racial differences between Arabs and Kurds, and the neces-sity of keeping the turbulent tribes under control. These difficulties might-be fatal to the very existence of the State if it were left without support and guidance.   For the sake of the development and prosperity of the country.
The Council of the League adopted the following decision on the foregoing-recommendations of the Committee :-&quot; The frontier between Turkey and Traq shall be fixed as follows. (Details omitted.)The British Government is invited to submit to the Council a new Treaty with Traq, ensuring the continuance for twenty-five years of the Mandatory regime defined by the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Traq*-NJB, The wording-in Miscellaneous No. 20 (1925) is &quot; Unit during 25 years of the regime,&quot; whichis an obvious, misprin-b.the Commission feels that it should remain under League of Nations Mandate for about twenty-five years.Final Conclusions..... The Commission is of opinion that important arguments . . . . operate in favour of the union with Traq of the whole territory south of the &apos; Brussels line,5 subject to the following conditions :(1) The territory must remain under the effective Mandate of the League of Nations for a period which may be put at twenty-five years.The Commission is convinced that if the League of Nations&apos; control were to terminate on the expiry of the four-years Treaty now in force between Great Britain and Traq, and if certain guarantees of local administration were not to be given to the Kurds, the majority of the people would have preferred Turkish to Arab sovereignty.The Commission is also convinced that the advantages of the union of the disputed territory with Traq would in that case be exchanged for very serious political difficulties, and considers that, under those circumstances, it would be more advantageous for the territory to remain under the sovereignty of Turkey, whose internal conditions and external political situation are incom-parably more stable than those of Traq.&quot; The Committee of the Council of the League appointed for the examination of this report made the following recommendations to the Council:  &quot; The allocation to Traq of all the territory south of the so-called &apos; Brussels Line&apos; in fact appeared the best solution adopted to solve the problem submitted. The Council on the basis of the recommendation of the Commis-sion of Inquiry, subject however to the eventual (italics are mine) admission of Traq to the League of Nations in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of the Covenant, will no doubt consider that the* duration for 25 years of the regime laid down by the Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Traq and by the undertaking entered into by the British Government and approved by the Council on the 27th September. 1924, is an essential condi-tion, and that if that condition be not executed the decision would not become definitive.&quot; ....The Committee of the Council took the view that the continuation of this regime should at once be assured by the conclusion of a new Treaty between the British Government and Traq; it therefore thought that it should inquire from the British representative what period of time would be required for submitting to the Council a new Treaty for a period of twenty-five years between the British Government and Traq.The representative of Great Britain replied : &quot; In answer to the question put to me by the Council, I see no difficulty in submitting, within six months from the present date, a new Treaty with Traq, which will continue the Mandatory responsibility towards the League which is embodied in the current Treaty and in the League decision of the 27th September, 1924, for twenty-five years or until such earlier date as Traq is, in the opinion of the Council, qualified for admission to membership of the League.L. Amery.&quot;
and by the British Governments undertaking approved by the Council on the 27th September, 1924, unless Traq is, in conformity with Article 1 of the Covenant, admitted as a Member of the League before the expiration of this period.As soon as, within a period of six months from the present date, the execution of this stipulation has been brought to the knowledge of the Council, the Council shall declare that the present decision has become definitive and shall indicate the measures required to insure the delimitation on the ground of the frontier line.&quot; 4.   It is of course clear from these extracts that the Council of the League, in taking its decision, contemplated that Traq might be admitted to the League a con-si considerable   time before the end of the twenty-five years&apos; period suggested by the Frontier Commission and it is also clear that, when the new Anglo-Traq Treaty of the 13th of January, 1926, was communicated to them, they must have realized the possibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government pressing for the immediate admission of Traq at the end of 1928 as a result of the first periodical &quot; active consideration&quot; of her circumstances promised in Article III of that Treaty.   But it could be plausibly argued that the whole sense of the recommendations, both of the Frontier Commis-sion and of the Committee of the Council on which the League based its frontier decision, was against so early a termination of the Mandate.   The word &quot; eventual&quot; used by the Committee is a strong indication of this, since, as the context runs, it seems to have been intended to point to a comparatively late stage of the twenty-five years&apos; period.5. If a substantial body of opinion is inclined to this view, French views are likely to reinforce and uphold it. For, to judge from their present attitude in Middle Eastern affairs, they will dread the effect upon Syria of the raising of the status of Traq and of its increased emancipation from control. I understand that now they usually meet Syrian complaints of the greater freedom of Traq by denying it and allege that in reality British control there, though veiled, is as close as Frenclv control in Syria. They could hardly take this ground if Traq were admitted to the League. Moreover, any release of Traq from supervision will make her freer to indulge in her sympathy for the Syrians and, as the French will believe, to incite the Syrians to resistance. Again, if, as is probable, it becomes necessary to help Traq for several years by allowing a British Air Force to remain there (this question will be subsequently discussed) and if, as is fairly certain, the various British officers who have long contracts under the Traq Government continue to advise the Traq Admin-istration for at least five or six years beyond the Protocol period. the French may well feel that Traq will in fact remain a mere satellite of Great Britain and that her admission to the Lea cue will swell the already large number of British votes. Thus it is hardlv open to doubt that a British proposal to admit Traq to the League about the end of 1928 will meet with a very critical and, from France at least, a hostile reception and that Great Britain must be prepared, if she is to press for admission, to put forward an overwhelmingly strong case in its favour and in favour of the release of Traq from the status of a mandated territory to which category the League still holds her to belong. In the immediately following paragraphs I shall inquire whether such a case can be made out.B.   Qualifications of Traq for Admission.6. The first qualification for admission to the League appears to be release from the Mandate. Article XXII of the Covenant affirms the condition of release to be that the &quot; Community&quot; shall be &quot;able to stand alone&quot; without &quot;the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory.&quot; If, as I have already said to be probable, Great Britain at the request of Traq continues after the Protocol period to maintain an Air Force in her territory, the opponents of her admission to the League may argue that this is proof that she cannot &quot; stand alone.&quot; I submit that this would be a misinterpretation of the Article. The stress, as I understand it, lies upon the word &quot;administrative&quot;; and if a community, though militarily too weak to secure entirely by herself internal order or external defence, is yet sufficiently advanced in applying the principles of civilized administration to be able to direct her internal affairs without official advice from outside, the fact that she receives military help should not necessarily prevent her from being allowed to quit the class of mandated territories. The position of Traq -would indeed be very similar to that of-the Papal States between 1849 and 1870 with a French garrison maintained in
Rome at the request of the sovereign Pope, and somewhat similar to that of Haiti and Cuba, which are members of the League. Haiti, I understand, became by the Treaty of November, 1915, a virtual protectorate of the United States of America, which maintain there an armed constabulary under American officers and a High Commissioner, while Cuba, by the Treaty of 1901, gave permanent rights of inter-vention to the United States of America and also granted to them the use of portions of its territory as Naval Stations. On the other hand, the position of Traq would not be similar to the present position of Egypt, since the British garrison in Egypt is not kept there at the request of the Egyptian Government but at the will of Great Britain; nor perhaps would it be precisely similar to that of Panama which, in spite of its complete dependence on the United States of America, is, like Haiti, a member of the League.7. Other qualifications for admission to the League appear to be the possession of fixed frontiers, stability of administration and the enjoyment of &quot; full self-government&quot; (vide Article 1 of the Covenant). As to the frontiers of Traq, they are fixed by Treaty between her and all her neighbours, but delimitation of the Turco-Traq and Syrian-Traq frontiers has not yet been completed. There have also been some hints from Teheran that the Persian Government are preparing to main-tain that the Turco-Persian frontier delimitation of 1913-14 is not final, because not ratified by the Persian Parliament. Other countries without completely delimited frontiers are, however, members of the League. One instance is Lithuania, the frontiers of which with Poland is still under dispute. Another is Persia, whose frontier with Afghanistan in the neighbourhood of Hashtadan has never been settled.8. As to stability of administration, it would be easy to show that Traq is at least as stable as China, Portugal, Greece or Abyssinia. It is true that the Frontier Commission Report already quoted threw doubt upon her stability, if prematurely released from British tutelage; but the period which has elapsed since the signature of the Turco-Traq Treaty and the settlement of the frontier has shown that it was mainly the uncertainty as to their future up to the time of the League&apos;s decision which troubled the minds of the population and made them unstable. There is now no trace of pro-Turkish feeling in the country, least of all on the borders, where the ferocious treatment of the Kurds by the Turks and their hostility towards the Mohammedan faith has alienated all their former friends. &quot;When the Commission made its pronouncement, the Turkish anti-Kurd drive was only beginning. A year later, when all its implications were understood in Traq, General Laidoner reported a firmer attachement of the people to the Traq Government, and, if the Commission were now to revisit the country, they would, I believe, find that the prospect of stability in Traq, even without official British administrative supervision, is at least equal to that in Turkey, where all seems to depend upon the life of a dictator. It is true that, as I shall show later, the complete cessation of consultation with Great Britain in foreign affairs and the complete withdrawal of the British Air Force would be very dangerous to the State; but even so it might be no worse than China or Greece, and, as I shall also show, it might be arranged that consultation on foreign affairs shall continue and that the British Air Force shall not completely withdraw.8a. As to the enjoyment of full self-government, I need only cite again the status of Cuba, Haiti and Panama, which are all three specially attached to a Foreign Power and permit the stationing of its forces in their territory, but which are nevertheless members of the League. The status of Traq, if she were to covenant for the retention of a British Air Force in her territory, would in fact closely resemble that of Cuba.C.   Consequences to &quot;Iraq of Admission to League.9. I have so far discussed what may be called the technical qualifications of Traq for membership of the League and have attempted to estimate the opposition to her early admission. But, if her technical qualifications were admitted and opposition were overcome, her membership would if so facto entail the termination of the present Anglo-Traq Treaty and Agreements, and she would then be confronted with the necessity of making with Great Britain a new treaty either of ordinary friendship, under which she would trust to the League or to alliance with some Power other than the British, in addition to her own small forces, to secure her from foreign aggression, or of specially close friendship, under which she would lean primarily on Great-Britain for advice and support. I will now examine these alternatives.
10. If Traq were to make with Great Britain a new treaty of ordinary friend-ship, she would deprive herself of our special advice and support in (a) foreign relations, (b) the judicial treatment of offences and suits by foreigners, (c) internal securit)&apos; and external defence and (d) finance and fiscal administration, but she would still enjoy the benefit of the advice of the British officers who have received long term contracts and who would continue to serve her under Article XVI of the Financial Agreement and Article 4 of the British Officials Agreement, unless dis-missed and compensated under Rule 11 of Schedule III of that Agreement.D.   Result on her Foreign Relations.11. In the matter of foreign relations Traq is chiefly concerned with her limitrophe neighbours, Nejd cum the Hejaz, Transjordania, Syria, Turkey and Persia, and she is more remotely concerned with India and Russia, the former of which has in Traq many subjects in Government employ and sends thither a yearly increasing number of pilgrims, and the latter of which sends many pilgrims through. Traq to the liejaz. Russia is also more and more inclined to intrigue in Traq from the basis of her consulates at Tabriz, Kermanshah and Ahwaz. Apart from these Powers, Traq is liable to find herself at any moment involved in discussions with other nations resulting from the passage of civil aeroplanes over her territory, which is an almost inevitable corridor for air-journeys between the continent of Europe and Southern Asia or the Antipodes, and from the establishment of the Turkish Petroleum Company with British, French, American and Dutch interests. It is a regrettable fact that the present relations of Traq with Nejd, Syria and Persia can barely be described even as correct and, were it not for the restraint which I have exercised upon her policy under instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, she would almost certainly have come into conflict with one or other of them. For so long as King Faisal remains King of Traq and the French remain in Syria, the causes of disagreement with Nejd and Syria will be permanent, while disagreement with Persia springs from much more secular causes which it would take too long to examine. If Traq were free from all obligation to consult Great Britain, I cannot doubt that she would soon fall out with one or other of these three neighbours, with results possibly fatal to herself and certainly very agitating to the League of Nations. She has no trained diplomatists and no practice in foreign affairs, but this only confirms her in the temerity of ignorance. She might indeed consult with some other Power such as German)1- with whom, without a specially close treaty of friendship with Great Britain, she would be free to make an alliance.E.   Result on Question of Revival of Capitulations.12. In the matter of the judicial treatment of offences and suits by foreigners, the decision of the Council of the League made on the 27th of September, 1924, laid clown that &quot;the privileges and immunities including the benefits of consular juris-diction and protection formerly enjoyed by capitulation or usage in the Ottoman Empire, will not be required for the protection of foreigners in Traq so long as the (Anglo-Traq) Treaty of Alliance is in force &quot; and the United States of America are, so far as is known, disposed to follow this lead, although they have not yet recognized Traq or made a Treaty for that purpose. Traq has always been much concerned over the possible renewal of the capitulations and in the course of the negotiations over the Agreements subsidiary to the Treaty she obtained from His Majesty&apos;s Gov-crnment the following pledges : (1) &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared upon the expiry of the Treaty, subject to the satisfactory conclusion of the fresh agreement referred to in the second clause of the Protocol to the Treaty of Alliance, to afford their support to the Traq Government in obtaining all such modifications provided in the Judicial Agreement as may appear justified in the circum-stances, as they then exist.&quot;(2) &quot; If the Traq Government continue to pursue an enlightened economic and fiscal policy, Great Britain will not insist upon the revival of the economic capitulations for herself at the conclusion of the Treaty period and will sup-port the Traq Government in resisting their revival in favour of other Powers, Great Britain would, however, require to receive most-favoured-nation treatment.&quot; . - .   . -til the termination of tlie Treaty, the Judicial Agreement which Avas specifically made &quot; in consequence of the non-application of &quot; the capitulations, will prevent the
b&quot;question from arising, but on its termination this question must be faced and it is probable that, however much the British Government may, in accordance with the pledge set forth above, oppose the reimposition of the capitulations, France, the United States of America, and Italy at all events will insist on their reimposition, unless the Judicial Agreement is continued in something like its present form. Indeed, the French Consul in Traq, in a recent conversation with the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, said that, in the view of Frenchmen, the termination of the Anglo-Traq Treaty would ipso facto revive the capitulations and that on the admis-sion of Traq to the League his consular court would forthwith come into operation. Traq would, I believe, make great sacrifices to avoid this eventuality. She might attempt to avoid it by inviting some other Power such as Germany to lend her judges and magistrates for the purpose of making her judicial administration acceptable to Europe and America. But it is improbable that France or Italy would accept this or any similar substitution. Again, she might accept the institution of Mixed Tribunals, but the troubles which these have brought upon Egypt would probably deter her.F.   Result on Questions of Internal Security and External Defence.13. In the matter of internal security and external defence, I have frequently expressed the view, which I believe His Majesty&apos;s Government now accepts, that Traq cannot either control her Arab and Kurdish tribes or defend herself without an Air Force, however efficient may become the comparatively small ground forces which she can afford to maintain. The Arab tribes are growing more amenable, but among the Southern Kurds anti-Arab sentiment is still strong: and the only instrument of control within the means of Traq is an Air Force. There is now no time before the end of 1928 to create an &apos; Iraqi&quot; Air Force; a British or Foreign mercenary Air Force* might perhaps be still constituted in time. But the initial cost of the installation either of an Traq i Air Force or of a British or Foreign mercenary Air Force would be beyond the financial strength of Traq. Without an Air Force in the background, the tribes would slowly cease to pay revenue, the civil administration would crumble down, and the security of established foreign interests such as the Turkish Petroleum Company would be threatened even if Traq continued to follow the good advice of the British officers still serving her under lone term contracts. I have shown that at the same time, if freed from the necessitv of con-sultation with Great Britain on foreign affairs, she would probably be embroiled with certain of her neighbours and a combination of external hostility and internal disintegration-tegration would make for a catastrophe. From this she might save herself by-recourse to an alliance with some such Power as Germany, who would, I think, be least repugnant to her. If Germany were willing; to supply her with a mercenary Air Force on easy terms, spreading the initial cost over a number of years, she would, I think, he forced to accept the offer and, in view of the former ambitions ofGermanv in Trao and of German&apos;s renewed yearnings for penetration of sub-tropical and tropical countries,-1 cannot doubt that the offer would be made.G.   Result in questions of Finance.14. In the matter of finance and fiscal administration the result of the termina-tion of the present Treaty and of the substitution of a mere Treatv of friendship would probably not be so great. British advisers would remain until the conclusion of their contracts and, when this came, Traq might well follow the example of Siam and trust to British financial and revenue advisers. In such matters she will, I think, be for a long time willing to take British advice and the more readily, if it is not forced upon her.71.   General Results of Ad?nissio?i without Treaty of Specially Close friendship with Great Britain.15. My conclusion is that if on entry into the League and the termination of her present relations with Great Britain Traa were to make only an ordinary Treaty of friendship with Great Britain, she would shortly find herself confronted with such difficulties in relation, at least, to France in Syria, and to Nejd and Persia, combined with internal disorder threatening- established foreign interests, that she would be compelled to turn to some other Power, probably Germany, for advice in foreign affairs and for a mercenary Air Force; but that even this would not save her from the probable necessity of submitting to a revival of the. Judicial Capitulations, or
773to the institution of Mixed Tribunals, a prospect most abhorrent to her, especially as large numbers of foreigners will by the end of 1928 be established within her boundaries in connexion with the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concessions.I.   Alternative of Treaty of Close Friendship ivith Great Britain.16. The second alternative which I set out to examine was that of a Treaty of specially close friendship with Great Britain, the terms of which would not so far deprive Traq of independence as to disqualify her from membership of the League. It goes without saying that what she would like would be a Treaty of Defensive Alli-ance containing terms which would leave her almost untrammelled both in foreign and domestic policy. But it is evident that she could not expect this. In order to secure membership of the League, a continued suspension of the capitulations and the continued help of the British Air Force, she would, I believe, accept a much less ambitious programme, including a practical renewal of the British Officers and Judicial Agreements and a modification of the Military Agreement, which would, however, retain the all-important Article VIII, the last sentence of which reads as follows : &quot; The Traq Government shall not be entitled to the assistance of an\ forces maintained or controlled by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government against or for the suppression of any external aggression or any civil disturb-ance or armed rising which shall, in the opinion of the High Commissioner, have been provoked or occasioned by action taken or policy pursued by the Traq Government contrary to the advice or express wishes of His Britaunic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; It is this Article which even now secures to the British Government the real control of the foreign relations and domestic policy of Traq.     Article II of the Military Agreement could be modified by confining the assistance of the British Government to the stationing in Traq of an Air Force only.   There would be various other modifications in the Military Agreement necessitated by the disappearance of British ground forces and levies, and Articles XI, XIV and XV of the Financial Agreement, with some slight changes, could be tacked on to the Military Agreement. The rest of the existing Financial Agreement need not be formally renewed, since the financial obligations of the Traq Government under Articles V to XI of that Agreement continue in force by virtue of Article XII, notwithstanding the termina-tion of the Treaty of Alliance.   (The validity of Articles V to VII has already dis-appeared.)   This sketch does not of course purport to be a complete exposition of the possible provisions of a Treaty of specially close friendship with Great Britain, but details could be rapidly worked out if the principle were accepted.   It is prob-able that Traq would stipulate that a limit, say, of five years, should be set to the retention of the British Air Force in Traq and that in the meanwhile the British should train an Traqi Air Force to take its place.   If some such suggestion were made, it would seem wise, in pursuit of an opportunist policy, to accept it.   By 1933 many doubts are likely to be solved.    We should know by then whether the oil industry is likely to be permanent and whether an air route through Traq is essential to our interests.   If it is worth our while we can then make new arrangements for a longer connexion with Traq.K.   Possibility of Treaty with Some Other Power.17. It may be objected that such a renewal of many of her existing obligations to Great Britain would obviously not prove sufficiently attractive to Traq, and that she would enjoy greater freedom in Treaty with some other Power, which might, as I have already indicated, be willing to lend help in the shape of a mercenary Air Force, without so many stipulations. But this argument ignores the vital point of the capitulations. If my conjecture stated at the end of paragraph 12 is correct, there is no Power likely to enter into alliance with Traq whose nationals would be accepted by other European Powers, as the British judges are at present accepted, as sole judges in the criminal and civil suits of their nationals. Therefore, except by a renewed alliance of some kind&apos; with Great Britain, Traq cannot escape from the capitulations, or from Mixed Tribunals, and to secure such an escape she would sacrifice much. It may, however, be still further asked why Traq should not make a Treaty with a Power like Germany to secure a German mercenary Air Force on -easy terms, and at the same time employ British judicial officers with security of
tenure and assured powers of judicial control, which would satisfy European Powers as to the prospects of justice for their nationals and stave off the capitulations. Or why should she not imitate Siam, which has an American Adviser in Foreign Affairs. British Financial and Judicial Advisers, a French Legislative Adviser, Legal Advisers of various nationalities for the International Court and a Provincial Gendarmerie under Danish Advisory Officers. My answer is that I do not think that Traq is at present disposed to have such a macedoine of foreign advisers and helpers. She knows and trusts the British and especially the British Air Force, and it would, I believe, be only the imposition of onerous conditions for the grant of British help which would drive her to the other alternative. It would be essential, of course, that there should be no appearance of Traq consenting to allow a British Air Force to remain in Traq as a concession to Great Britain. It must be emphasized that the concession would be on the part of Great Britain and at the instance of Traq.L.   Reasons why Things cannot stay as they are.18.. Having thus examined both the qualifications of Traq for admission to the League and the possible consequences of her admission, I shall next inquire whether the easiest, and best plan would not be to let things be as they are and to announce to Traq on the first &quot; active consideration &quot; of her circumstances in 1928 that Great Britain does not consider it possible to press for her admission. The present Treaty and Agreements could then remain in force with some slight modifications and the Military Agreement might be changed, so as to permit the retention in Traq, after the Protocol period, of a British Air Force comparatively small and cheap, but big enough to dominate the tribes. There is on the surface much to be said for this plan. Traq seems at the moment quieter and more contented than she has ever been perhaps since Sumerian times; her new Parliamentary Constitution is working well; her finances are improving; a spirit of complete unity reigns between her native officials and their British Advisers; the King and his Ministers regard the High Commissioner more as a colleague than a mentor; the voices of the extreme nationalists are hushed and the whole nation recalls with lively gratitude the stand taken by the British Government against Turkish pretensions. A large body of solid opinion is forming in favour of quieta non novere. But the advocates of this course forget that the present contentment and gratitude of the politically minded Traqis is due solely to their belief in the intention of Great Britain to carry them forward quickly to complete independence. They have seen that she has (unexpectedly to them) fulfilled her pledges hitherto. She has interfered little in their internal politics, has resisted Turkey, has helped them to form their Army and has gradually reduced her garrison and her civil officers. In not a single thing can they yet allege that she has fallen short. If now this rapid process of release from tutelage were checked and they suddenly lost the hope of early enfranchisement, I am convinced that the whole political atmosphere would change and that Great Britain would soon experience in Trap the same dreary disillusionment which she has had to bear in India and &quot;Egypt. For the political classes do in truth count far more heavily in power for mischief than do the solid classes in power for tranquillity. In no long time the students would be striking and parading, the King and his Ministers suspicious and intriguing against us, the lawyers, as in the anti-Treaty agitation of 1924, plotting assassinations, and the Traq troops, the only forces left to guard our aerodromes, wavering. We should then have either to evacuate altogether or to bring back our troops and govern, whether with or without an Arab facade, a sullen people. We should have to abandon the hope expressed in the official letter addressed to all British Advisers that &quot; The basic principle underlying the relations between the two Governments is co-operation towards a common end. namely, the establishment of an independent Government of Traq, friendly to and bound by gratitude and obligation to His Britannic Maiesty&apos;s Government.&quot; So true is it, that whosoever Avill save his political influence shall lose it, but whosoever will lose his political influence for the sake of right dealing, the same shall save it. Thus, if Russia after her liberation of Bulgaria had kept to the liberal principles of the Treaty of San Stefano and had not struggled against the cry of &quot; Bulgaria for . the Bulgarians.&quot; she would almost certainly have retained the affection of the Bulgarians and would have been soared the discreditable struggle which led to the abduction of Prince Alexander and the subsequent assassination of Stamboloff.. If Napoleon III in return for the liberation of Italy,had not bargained for the cession
of Savoy and had not sought to gain influence in the Catholic World by maintaining the Pope on his secular throne, Italy would probably now have been as firm a friend of France as she is of England; and if Great Britain had not, after helping to liberate Greece, ceded to her the Ionian Islands, she would have suffered the same eclipse of her influence in Greece as France has in Italy. Coming to more recent times, if Great Britain had during the War withdrawn her troops from Persia, as soon as Russia withdrew hers, and had not attempted to establish a virtual protec-torate over her by the abortive Treaty of August, 1919, it is fairly certain that Persia would now be our devoted friend and, as far as she dared, would proclaim it. To you, Sir, who have shown at the recent Imperial Conference that you hold that the loosening of apparent bonds to be the tightening of real ones, these reflections will come as a truism. The more we show ourselves disposed to withdraw from Traq and to foster her advance to real independence, the greater and more per-manent will be our influence in that country. I am persuaded, then, that the best way to secure peace and prosperity in Traq and her attachment to Great Britain is for us to press for her admission to the League at the earliest moment and to do our best by such help as we can afford in the shape of the retention of an Air Force and discreet advice in foreign and internal affairs to mitigate the political difficulties which such admission may entail, retaining only the minimum control which is necessary to prevent Traq from embroiling herself with her neighbours or antagonizing the more difficult sections of her population. This end I submit that we could attain&apos;by the measures which I have sketched out in paragraph 16 of this despatch.19.   I must also submit that, apart from the general considerations which I have advanced above and apart from the provisions of the Treaty of January, 1926, Great Britain appears to have bound herself by a definite pledge to apply without delay for the admission of Traq to the League.    For at the end of the serious political crisis of September, 1922, caused by the dislike of the political classes to the British Mandate, your predecessor, Mr. Winston Churchill, sent to Traq the following assurance which was published in Baghdad on the 12th of October, 1922, and was received as a charter defining the intentions of the British Government: -&quot;His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, conscious Of the deep obliga-tions into which they entered towards Traq,  are convinced that these obligations will be completely fulfilled bv means of the &quot;Treaty of Alliance which has been signed on behalf of His Britannic Majesty and of His Majesty the King of Traq.   They will do everything in their power to speed delimitation of the frontiers of Traq, in order that Traq mav be in a posi-tion, when Treaty and subsidiary agreements therein provided for have been duly ratified and the Organic Law has been brought into effect, to apply for admission to membershin of the League of Nations.They confidently look forward to this application being made as soon as the frontiers are settled and a stable Government set up in,accordance with the Organic Law, when they will use their good offices, provided that effect is being given to the provisions of the Treaty, to secure the admission of Traq to membership of the League, as provided for in Article 6 thereof, which affords, in their opinion, the sole means by which mandatory relations can legally be terminated.&quot; The conditions set forth &quot;in this assurance have all been fulfilled or will have been fulfilled by the end of 1928.   The &quot;frontiers have been settled by Treaty and are in the course of&apos; delimitation.   A stable Government&quot; has been set up in accordance, with the Organic Law and effect is being given to &quot;the provisions of the Anglo-Traq . Treaty.   Any delay in applying to the League would be regarded as-an undoubted breach of this assurance. &apos;M.   Best Method of. Presenting our Conclusions to Traq.  - / .20. If my contentions are accepted that (a) Traq is qualified to enter the League and (6) &quot;that our good faith and her and our true interests require us to press for her admission,&apos; but (c) that she will have to meet consequent difficulties unless she obviates them by the renewal of-certain of the existing Treaty conditions, it remains to discover what should be our method of presenting this view for her consideration. I suggest that we should explain frankly to the Traq Government the difficulties which I have set forth in paragraphs 10 to 15 of &quot;this despatch as likely to ensue upon&apos; her admission to the League, unless she simultaneously makes a new
Treaty with us of close friendship (without, of-course, hinting at the possibility of an arrangement between herself and one or more other Powers, which may onlv too readily present itself to her imagination). We should then give her the free choice of either entering the League without special arrangements with us and in reliance on the power of the League of Nations to protect her, or of entering it after making with us a new Treaty on the lines which I have sketched in the first part of para-graph 16 of this despatch. If, as I think unlikely, she chose the first course and, adopting the policy of Siam, sought to interest a diversity of Powers in her fate, we should certainly feel chagrined, but could wash our hands of her, in confidence that she would long hold us in grateful and affectionate remembrance. If, as I think more probable, she chose the second course, we should then enjoy the benefits of her unforced adherence to us and of a very commanding position in the East for the development of our air communications and it would be the task of His Majesty&apos;s Government to persuade the British nation that the retention of a small Air Force in Traq at a cost which, I suppose, need not exceed three-quarters of a million oounds a year, would be worth while. It should not be difficult to show that the Royal Air Force needs stations in the East similar to the stations of the Royal Navy at Gibraltar, Malta and Aden and that if, bv arrangement with Trao.&quot; we can cheaply secure air stations in that country, without involving ourselves in serious commitments, this will be an advantage and not a burden to us.N.   Effect on Egypt of Admission of &apos;Iraq to League.21. I have left to the last the consideration of the effect on our relations with Egypt of the entry of Traq into fhe League of Nations at our instance. With this question I am scarcely competent to deal. I am aware, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not at present inclined to favour the admission of Egypt to the League and that the admission of Traq would probably weaken their hands in resist-ing the request of Egypt for admission, or might at least prove a grave embarrass-ment. On this point I submit that there is a choice of evils. I am sure, as I have foreshadowed in paragraph 18 of this despatch, that delay in pressing for the admission of Traq would tend to reproduce in that country the present conditions in Egypt. If this forecast is correct, the only effect of our refusing to advocate the admission of Traq for fear that this would excite the envy of Egypt, would be that we should have two Egypt&apos;s instead of one on our hands.Summary.22.   I have now attempted to prove the following points-: (1) There may be considerable opposition in the League of Nations to the admission of Traq to the League on the ground of the statement of the Frontier Commission that British tutelage must continue for a long period, and there may be strong French opposition on other grounds.(2) Therefore if Great Britain decides to press for the admission of Traq, she must be prepared to bring forward strong arguments in her favour.(3) Great Britain can easily show that any apparent disqualifications for mem-membership of the League from which Traq suffers are common to other countries which are already members and she should be able to overcome opposition on these grounds.(4) She can also show that the Frontier Commission report is now out of date and that Traq has made great advances in stability since it was written.(5) But before Great Britain decides to press for her admission, the results to Traq of admission and of termination of the present Anglo-Traq Treaty must he fully considered.(iS) Traq will have the choice either of making an ordinary Treaty of friend-ship with Great Britain and trusting to the League for her defence, or of making an alliance with a third Power, or of making a Treaty of specially close friendship with Great Britain, the terms of which will not be such as to disqualify her for membership of the League.(7) Traq is unlikely, unless forced to do so by our onerous conditions, to choose either of the first two of these three courses, because of the difficulties of her rela-tions with her neighbours, her inability to defend herself or maintain internal security without an Air Force, doubt as to whether recourse to any other Power than Great Britain would save her from the renewal of the capitulations and genuine preference for Great Britain.(8) Conditions of a Treaty of specially close friendship with Great Britain which Traq would be likely to accept and to ask for would be the stationing for some
years in Traq of a comparatively small and cheap British Air Force and a promise to train up an Traqi Air Force during that period, a renewal of the portions of the Military and Financial Agreements necessary for its maintenance there, including especially the power of refusal to lend its aid unless the policy of Traq conforms to our wishes, and the renewal of the Judicial Agreement relating to suits by or against foreigners.(9) Things cannot stay as they are, the admission of Traq to the League being deferred, because the present quiet and contentment is due mainly to the confidence of Traqis that we shall press for her early admission. The politically-minded classes, including the King, would be alienated if we now decided not so to press, and difficulties similar to those which we have had in India and Egypt would appear in- Traq. Moreover, we are bound by our declaration of October, 1922, to apply without further delay for the admission of Traq.(10) Therefore the good faith of Great Britain and the best interests of Great Britain and Traq require us to press for the admission of Traq and to make a Treaty of specially close friendship with her, if she so wishes.(11) The best way of presenting these conclusions to Traq will be to explain to her the difficulties likely to follow upon her admission to the League and to give her the choice of her policy.(12) If she chooses to stand bv herself, trusting only to the good offices of the League, or to make an alliance with a third Power or to try an amalgam of foreign advisers all of which courses seem unlikely, we should make our bow and depart. , But if she asks for a Treaty of close friendship with us, we should give it on the lines already sketched.(13) Possible objections of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the foregoing policy on account of its effect on Egypt are answered by the fact that to defer our applica-tion for the admission of Traq would merely result in our having two Egypt&apos;s on our hands instead of one.&apos;   I have. &amp;c,H.
