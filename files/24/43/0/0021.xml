52929 cipher M.I.O, On 17th February Dunsterville reached Enzeli and has been obliged to return to Hamadan.  Read from Hamadan to Enzeli was crowded with disorderly Bolshevik soldiery. About 3,000 Bolsheviks and Red Guards with guns and gun-boats are in entire occupation of the Port.  They are being assisted by  German agents, and they are furnishing Jangalis with arms and information.  Dunsterville and his party were virtually prisoners at Enzeli in hands of Bolsheviks, who picketed his house and every steamer. Vain attempts were made by Dunsterville to persuade Revolutionary Committee to change their point of view, which is, that Caucasus Government are their enemy, and they will resist with armed force any attempt by non-Russians to assist Caucasus. Dunsterville has been informed by Kuchik Khan that he will attack all English parties. His armed men are posted on the Kasvin-Enzeli road, which must be regarded for the present as entirely closed. Revolutionary Committee informed Dunsterville that Baratoff is to be arrested and tried.  They are actively opposed to the raising of Volunteer forces in Persia, and intend to break present organization, their policy being complete evacuation of Persia by all white races. Goldsmith preceded Dunsterville to Baku, and has been ordered to join you.

Reference your 269 4th February, as Caucasus Government and National Councils are only too ready to welcome Mission, can yon move them to take any action to facilitate passage either by sea or land route via Tabriz.  Tartar Council, if they so desired, could perhaps take effective action at Baku and Enzeli. You should use your discretion as to approaching any of the local authorities on the subject, but it is suggested that you might point out that if Dunsterville and the Mission do not arrive there will be no funds, our organization will collapse, and there will be almost certain conquest by Turks.
