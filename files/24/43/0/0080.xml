Fob, 26th,The present situation in Persia being in the melting pot  owingto weak government and Russian evacuation,  it seems necessary,with a view to  operations in  Caucasus and  to safeguardingBritish interests in Persia,  to occupy line of rasrishirin tol^nzeli,  I am convinced inhabitants in Persia would Welcomethis, they only  want security and do not care &quot;/ho gives it tothem.  The Persian politician vho does not  represent peoplewould doubtless  agitate raid make capital out of it.  I thinkthat small number of troops would suffice  and suggest oneregiment of cavalry, one infantry brigade  one battery ofmountain artillery one battery 1.A.M, cars  and aeroplanesstationed  at &quot;Kermanshah, :Kasvin and Ramadan.

Country from jMc-njil toResht very difficult for operations of regular troops but thewhole situation  could be controlled from rasvin and aeroplaneoperations would probably quell any trouble that might occurin Gilan country.
