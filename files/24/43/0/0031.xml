THIS  DOQIILENT IS THE PROPERTY CF EIS BRITAI*flIO MAJESTY15 GOviau&amp;JKT).j C HI T*.T..3751.WAR   OABIHETDRINK  PROHIBITION,Copy of kcmor.ia.1 addressed to tho.. Pri^ij^kini^stor.Sir,     A short time ego a Memorial was sent to Lord Khondda inreference to the waste of food-stuffs involved in the making .of intoxicants,   His Lordship replied that this was a matterwhich wan dealt with by the War Cabinet,   We shall thereforebo grateful if tho L&quot;embers of that Body oan kindly considerour appeal..     We earnestly wish to act in a truly patriotic spirit in thistime of crisis, and loyally to oo-oporate in all measuresproposed for the eonocrvetion of our food supplies.,   It ishowever a matter of grave concern and disap.po.inoment to us thatso much grain and sugar and. other food materials should sontinu-ally be wasted in the manufacture of alcoholic drinks,   When weconsider that over 5/000.000 tons of- food have been destroyedoinoo the War begun, in the making of intoxicants,  and that forevery sixteen pints of beer the materials of a- quartern loaf arcconsumed,  we feel th-1 this state of things is a very serioushindrance to cur effective adveoacy of individual economy infood.     Vie would point out,  that, on tho evidence of eminent scien-tistc the food value of alcoholic drinks is very small.   TheBoard of Eduction in its syllabus for 3Chola.ro attending elementary schools affirms that &quot;Boer cannot bo considered to bo one ofthe foods which the body requires&quot;.     The question of tonnage is also serious, and wc have reasonto believe that ships which arc urgently needed for bringing foodare being used for carrying intoxicating drinks,     Wc 3hould be grateful if you could see your way to put outposters giving facts concerning the food value of alcoholicdrinks, also a poster urging the people to &quot;Drink less Beer&quot;,But wc would go further and bog that the manufacture of intcxi-ennts bo entirely prohibited during the War in order to conservethe food supplies.We are,               Your obedient  servants,(Signed).
