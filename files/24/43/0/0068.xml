                     DEMOBILISATION.122/244         Memorandum by the  Secretary of State for War,          I think that  it would be  wise  to allow  the  troopsboth at home and in France to be made  familiar with the generalprinciples on which we  are framing  our schemes for  demobilisingthem when the time comes and for resettling  them in  civil life.My Department has made  considerable progress  with the Regulationswhich will be issued in due course, containing the  orders to  allconcerned in the process of Demobilisation of the Army.
