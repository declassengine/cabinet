                  TECHNICAL DIVISION.Inspection of Land,  The following Inspections were made byofficers of the Technical Division during the week:-     (1)  A farm of 113 acres In Staffordshire was inspected onbehalf of the Executive Committee.   In view of the deplorablecondition of the holding it is suggested that the Committee shouldbe authorised to take possession, and (1) have the tenancydetermined, (2) instal a working bailiff, (3) summer-fallow andmole-drain the greater part of the landj (4) slag and mole-drainthe meadows, and (5) recover as much as possible of the outlayfrom the subsequent crops and from the landlord.     (2)  Penmon Parks, Anglesey, were inspected in order to advisethe Committee with regard to proposals made by them.   The Parksare five in number, aggregating 364 acres.   The Inspector statesthat from 25 to 27 acres could be brought under cultivation for1918, but the greater part would have to be fenced as a protectionfrom rabbits.   If labour and fencing can be secured the owner Isprepared to plough all the available land for 1919, and also tocrop with potatoes this year a field of 12 to 14 acres, in placeof a scheduled area of 10 acres.   It is recommended that thisoffer be accepted, and that the Committee should not enter intopossession of the parks.     (3)  The Wynnstay Estate, Denbighshire, was visited In orderto advise the owner as to the cropping and treatment in 1918 of thearable land on the Home Farm.   A number of suggestions were made,which the owner has agreed to carry out.&apos;   The farm extends toabout 585 acres, praclicaily the whole of which has until recentlybeen grass land.   Under the suggested scheme of cropping nearlyone-half will be under the plough this year.Seed Testing Station. Nearly 5,000 samples have been received upto date, and reports have been issued in respect of 3,750.  About
900 tests are running.. .  Arrangements have been made for thecarrying out of soil gemination tests at various centres withsamples tested at the Station;  thus., barley will be tested atWye College, wheat and oats at Chelmsford, and trefoil andclovers at Bangor.   In addition the degree of contaminationof the barley samples with &quot;smut&quot; will be investigated at Wye,                    LABOUR DIVISION.          The Ministry, of National Service have been suppliedwith lists of firms engaged in the production of fertilisers whare handicapped by reason of shortage of labour, with a view tosecuring if possible some of the labour.that is expected to beset free from munition work for employment on this work.   In tsame connection the Ministry have been furnished with particulaof the Department&apos;s requirements as.regards men for farm work.Application has been made to the National Labour Priority Coiraniwith regard to the mechanics required for the up*keep of theDepartments tractors. ...         VSoldier Labour.  During the week an additional 500 soldiers havarrived at Agricultural Distribution Centres.   As difficulty ibeing experienced in obtaining the necessary number of soldierploughmen to act as gang leaders under the Prisoner Ploughmenscheme, it is hoped that many additional men will be suppliedduring the next few weeks under the recent. War Office decisionrelease further skilled men.  &apos;          With the 500.men above.-mentioned, a total of 35,591soldiers  (25,354 so-called &quot;skilled&quot;. and 1-0,237 unskilled) havebeen attached to depots to date, and of these 31,961 (24,061skilled and 7,900 unskilled) are out with farmers.   In additioto these men, 1,283 ploughmen on three months&apos; agricultural,.furlough from over-seas are out on farm work.          The total number of soldiers sent out for trainingas tractor drivers and ploughmen Is 3,275.                            -6-

Prisoners of War.  93 prisoner camps for 3,297 ploughmen have been approved by the War Office, to date, and particulars of 47 other schemes are under consideration, ffhich, if approved, will require 1,720 prisoners.   Thus, 5,017 prisoners will be required to meet the demands to date.   As the Department have been allotted only 4,000 prisoner ploughmen to meet these and any subsequent demands, the Department are making an. immediate-demand for a further 1,500 prisoners.           In addition to those mentioned above, 27 prisoner ploughmen camps were opened during the week, making a total of 46 sueh camps opened to date, whilst in the case of 13 other camps prisoners are In course of being moved.

         A Burford Cleveland tractor in Buckinghamshire plough5I acres in one day.  A Cra/ley tractor in Cambridge ploughed 2acres in 60 hours.  Tho fuel consumption for 15 acres ploughed 1an Overtime tractor in Hampshire was 3-J gallons per acre.         In Hereford one team ploughed 35 acres in 4 days.        , The Market Rasen unit in the Lindsey division of Lincostill heads the list in the county for the greatest number of aploughed.  It accounted for 82 acres during the week on a fuelconsumption of 4.6 gallons, per acre.         In Middlesex a 25 h.p. Mogul tractor ploughed 28 acresof heavy derelict land, on which there was a long tough growthof grass, in 61 hours.         The best result in Norfolk was obtained by a Titan witha 4-furrow plough on two horse land.  Working 60 hours this outfploughed 36 acres, consuming 132 gallons of paraffin, giving anaverage consumption of 3.7 gallons per acre.         A low fuel consumption is reported from Oxfordshire,where a Titan used 3.27 gallons per acre to plough 29 acres.                         SUPPLIES DIVISION.Sulphate of Ammonia.  The reduction in the output of munitionsenable makers of sulphate of ammonia to produce an increasedquantity after the end of this month.  As the result of thisit will probably be possible to meet the. greater part of theagricultural demand.         A preliminary discussion has taken place with theMinistry of Munitions and the Irish and Scottish Departments ofAgriculture with regard to the arrangements for next season.Superphosphate. Inspectors have reported that makers are fullybooked for several weeks ahead, and that orders are no./ beingplaced more freely.  The weekly quantity of phosphate rock whiciis being ground continues to increase and makers are receivingsufficient rock to keep their plant going.  The labour difficult
JVhas not been entirely overcome,  but it is hoped that-the release.  -of men from munition works F?!!!  relieve the shortage,at a numberof centres.Basic Slag - The proposals for fixing the price of basic slag andfor controlling distribution in  1918   19 have been rut before thebasic slag makers.  These proposals were well received and adetailed scheme Is now-being prepared in conjunction with a smallcommittee of makers.Potash - The Department has obtained the consent of the Ministry ofMunitions to release about SCO tons of nitrate of potash foragricultural purposes.  This has been offered to manure mixers andup to the present about; 140 tons have been sold.Stable Manure - The War Office has not yet agreed to the proposalfor an -Army Council Order fixing the price of army stable manure,butthe Department is asking for an  early decision.  -In the meantimethe manure from various remount  depots is being sold locally, butdifficulties of transport are met with in individual cases, owingto the high cost of transport by road.          About 20 barges are now working on the Basingstoke Canalremoving manure from the Eelmoor dump at Aldershot, and up to thepresent about 1,600 tons have been delivered to various places inSurrey and Hampshire.  The Hampshire Agricultural ExecutiveCommittee has appointed an Agent to collect orders from farmersand undertake local distribution.  Difficulty has been experiencedin meeting the needs of allotment holders at Walton-on-Thames fromthis centre owing to the long journey from Aldershot,  but anexperimental delivery has been made by barge, and the  War Office hasbeen pressed to deliver some manure from London or lryoolfcCch to thislarge group of allotment holders.Lime   About 20 lime works have  recently been visited  by theInspectors in order to assist them with regard to labour, and these
works have been asked to make application for priority certifies. and also to consider the possibility of employing prisoners of war.   Experience of the employment of German prisoners at seve lime works has been very satisfactory. Seed Wheat for Spring Sowing.   Arrangements with the Approved Agents selected by the Agricultural Executive Committees have be practically completed for the distribution of a limited quantity of No.l Northern Manitoba wheat for spring sowing. Seed Oats.  Advices indicate that consignments of Manx oats whic&apos; have recently come forward are steadily improving in quality.           Two cargoes of Irish oats are now on passage, but thei arrival has not yet been notified.           The demand for white oats in Scotland is less keen tha it was, and the Departments purchases during the past week have been small.           The demand for black oats Is still in excess of the supply.           The first consignment of seed oats for the Ar^y in Frar is practically ready for shipment, and arrangements are being mat for the dispatch of a second consignment in accordance with a later request received from the Director of Agricultural Product! In France. Licences for the Export of Seed Oats from Scotland.   Number of licences Issued 742.   Number of quarters for which licences have been issued 35,526. Seed Potato Supply.  The total quantity of seed potatoes ordered forward now amounts to 19,838 tons,  and the total quantity delivered to 5,645 tons.   These figures include the quantities ordered forward to France.           One serious complaint has been received during the past week relating to the &apos;dressing&apos; of certain consignments of &apos;&apos;Arr&amp;r. ChiefThe Department are Investigating this matter&apos; and have                              -12-
already warned loaders In Scotland that any deviation from theriddling prescribed for the different varieties in the SeedPotatoes (1917 Crop) Order will be regarded as a serious offence,Wart Disease in Potatoes. The proposed Wart Disease of PotatoesOrder of 1918 will be considered by the Potato Advisory Committeeon the 27&apos;th instant, and at a Conference on the 28th instantrepresenting all the interests likely to be affected by It.  So faras can be judged at present, growers in scheduled areas areexperiencing little or no difficulty in securing the quantitiesof immune !seed! which they require.Potato Spraying. The following resolution has been adopted by ameeting of manufacturers of spraying knapsacks held on the 18thinstant i-         &quot;The manufacturers of Spraying Knapsacks are strongly ofopinion that the recent advances in wages, namely 12^% on day workretrospective to last October, and the December advance of 5s.,have practically absorbed all the profit on this class of machine.In view af the fact that all arrangements have been made for salesfor this season, manufacturers are anxious to avoid any alterationof arranged prices, but they wish to point out most emphaticallythat any further advances in wages will leave no option other thanan increase in the selling price,&quot;                    I am,                        Sir,                          Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The  Rt.  Hon. Rowland E.  Prothero, M.P.,     President  of the  Board  of Agriculture and Fisheries.
