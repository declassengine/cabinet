An exaggerated view of the disorder existing inIreland may easily be formed if the representations in someEnglish and Irish newspapers are taken literally.  Nothingworse has come to light or appears te threaten than what Idescribed to War Cabinet a week ago.   Military eooupationof Clare has temporarily paralysed author of disorder there,and by the help of the troop8 the Constabulary expeot to re-gain control over the lawless element.           InSligo, Roscommon and Mayo, where agrariandisturbances were worst outside Glare, the police are re-inforced and are doing well.   Prosecutions with prospectof effective imprisonment are also proceeding.   Certainother arrests are likely to have good effect.   One hungerstriker at Limerick who appeared likely to die last nighthas given in, and the twenty-two prisoners in MountjoyPrison, Dublin, who were on hunger strike yesterday aretaking food to-day.
