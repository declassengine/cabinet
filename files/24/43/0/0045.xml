 This Document is the Property ot j^^&quot;^3  ?-*     141His Britannic JVIajesty&apos;s Government.)                AMOUNT OF  SUG^R RATION           MBLiORANDUH BY TElJ FOOD CONTROLLER...1     Having regard to the increased gravity of the corealposition, as shown by the  latest estimates of the RoyalCommission on Wheat Supplies, I desire to ask the Cabinet toreconsider their decision that the sugar ration should bereduced from 8 oz, to G oz, per head per week (War Cabinet547, Minute 8),2.    The Commission now (16,2.10) estimate that arrivals ofcereals for human consumption in the United Kingdom duringMarch and April are not likely to amount ts more than 621,000tons, against an estimate  of 1,170,000 tons made on January28th and an estimate of 1,340,000 tons made on January 10th.3,   On the present estimate stocks of imported breadstuff-cereals 7/111 probably fall to come 4 weeks1 supplies on May1st,  Farm stocks, taking the wheat and half the barley asavailable for bread, will only add another 2 to 3 weeks&apos; supplies.4,   In these circumstances it seems desirable, not to reducethe supply of any other food that may be available, but ratherto increase other supplies so as to relieve the pressure upon cereals,I am endeavouring  to arrange accordingly for the purchase inAmerica of larger quantities of essential foodstuffs and theshipment of minor but useful foods such as canned fish, dried fruit,eggs and dried fish.5.   The reduction of the  sugar ration by 2 oz, per head per weekwill only, In so far,  nullify these efforts,6.   I recommend therefore that the decision of the Cabinetshould cither be rescinded, or that at least the suggestedreduction should be postponed till the summer when the supplyof meat and fats Is likely  to be larger and the matter might age&amp;nbe considered In the light of the then existing circumstances.Ministry of. Food.                                       &apos; RKONDDA.       26.2.1018
