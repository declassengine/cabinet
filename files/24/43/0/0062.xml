[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majssty&apos;s  Government.]                  Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1918SECRET         RCULATE to my  colleagues a  copy of a  letter I  have received fromLord Northcliffe, together with my reply.                                                                      A. J. B.                         Lord Northcliffe to Mr. Balfour.                      Department for Propaganda in Enemy Countries,                                              Crewe House, Curzon Street, W. 1,My dear Mr. Balfour,                                   February 23,  1918.    The  enclosed  communication  is largely  the  result of  conversation  betweenMr. Wickham Steed and myself,  though I  had consulted  other  authorities  beforeasking Mr. Steed to place the matter in its present form.    This communication has already been read to the War Department of the ForeignOffice.                          &apos;                                                    Yours sincerelv,                                                              NORTHCLIFFE.                         Lord Northcliffe to Mr. Balfour.                                              Crewe House, Curzon Street, W. 1,My dear Mr. Balfour,                                  February 24, 1918.    1 have long been of opinion that it would be well to concentrate on propaganda inAustria.    I have made a point of seeing every available person who has come out of Austria,including many Americans who returned to the United States when I was there.   Allshared the same view-that the Dual Monarchy entered the greater war in a half-hearted spirit, is weary of  the war, has endured hardships approaching starvation, andrealises that there is  no benefit for Austria arising out of the war.    The control of  the  presses of  the various  nationalities  composing  the DualMonarchy is so absolute that the real  facts of the war are unknown to the multitude.Germany is not idle in Austria or elsewhere.    For example, the entrance of the United States into  the war has been belittled.and described as mere American &quot; bluff.&quot;   Many subjects of Austrian nationalities had,before  the  war, considerable knowledge  of  the United  States  owing to  the  greatemigration to that country.  They would realise the power of the United States ifexplained  to them.    It is submitted,  with respect, therefore, that one of the first steps to be taken is tospread, through all available channels, accurate facts about the American preparations.    But, before making any  beginning in that direction, or any  others,  I feel that Imust be placed in possession of knowledge of the  policy of the Allies as to the DualMonarchy.    I should be greatly obliged if you would give me  your  opinion on the followingsuggestions, which are made after consultation with those well acquainted.with Austria.If they merit your  approval, it is suggested that they. be  submitted to the UnitedStates, France, and Italy.   As  for  the United States, I would personally ask ColonelHouse to expedite their consideration.  Time  is essential.    It is reported that this  week Krupps have purchased  no less  a  journal than the&quot; Fremdenblatt,&quot; despite the fact that the policy of Vienna newspapers is controlled bytelephone from Berlin.                            .                &quot;   -&quot;    &apos;    It is suggested that there are two  policies for  the Department of Propaganda in
Enemy Countries.  In order that there  may be  no misunderstanding in  the UnitedStates, France, and Italy, I have recapitulated elementary facts generally kuown.    These two policies are as follows :     (a.) To work for  a  separate  peace with   the  Emperor,  the  Court, and  the           aristocracy, on the principle of not  interfering with  the domestic affairs of           the  Hapsburg  Monarchy  and of leaving its territory  almost or quite           intact; or    (o.) To try to break the  power of Austria-Hungary,  as the weakest link in the           chain of enemy States, by supporting and encouraging all  anti-German and           pro-Ally peoples and tendencies.    The (a) policy has been tried without success.   The Hapsburgs are not free agentsThey have not the power, even though they may wish, to  break away from Germany,because     1. They are  controlled by the  internal structure of their dominions  (the Dual           System) which gives  Germany decisive leverage over them through  the           Germans  of Austria and the Magyars of Hungary; and    2. Because the Allies  cannot offer them acceptable terms without breaking with           Italy.    It remains to try the (6) policy.    This policy is not primarily or even, in the last resort, necessarily anti-Hapsburgian;it is not opposed to the interests of the Roman Catholic religion; and  it  is in harmonywith the declared aims of the Allies.    The Empire of Austria contains some 31,000,000 inhabitants.   Of these, less thanone-third, i.e., the 9,000,000 or  10,000,000 Germans of Austria,  are pro-German.  Theother two-thirds (including the Poles, Czecho-Slovaks, Rumanes, Italians, and SouthernSlavs) are actively, or passively anti-German.    The Kingdom of Hungarj^, including the &quot; autonomous &quot; Kingdom  of Croatia-Slavonia, has a population  of approximately 21,000,000, of which one-half * Magyars,Jews, Saxons, and Swabians) may be  considered  pro-German, and the rest (Slovaks,Rumanes, and Southern Slavs) actively or passively anti-German.    There are thus in Austria-Hungary, as  a whole, some 31,000,000  anti-Germansand some 21,000,00.0 pro-Germans.  The pro-German minority rules  the anti-Germanmajority.  Apart from questions of democratic principle, the policy of  the Aiiies shouldevidently be to help and encourage the anti-Germans.    The chief means of helping them may be specified thus : -     1. Allied Governments and the President of the United States should insist upon           their determination to secure democratic freedom for the  races of Austria-           Hungary on the principle of &quot;government  by consent of the governed.&quot;           Expressions  such as  &quot;self-government&quot; or  &quot;autonomous development&quot;           should be avoided, because they have a  sinister  meaning in  Austria-Hungary           and tend to discourage the friends of the Allies.    2. For the same reason, statements that the  Allies  do not wish to  &quot; dismember           Austria &quot; should be avoided.   The war cannot be won  without so radical           a transformation of Austria-Hungary as to remove its peoples from German           control.   The  Hapsburgs may be  driven to help in this  transformation if           Allied encouragement of the anti-Uerman Hapsburg peoples is effective.           By themselves  the  Hapsburgs cannot effect  a transformation except in an           increasingly pro-German sense.     3. For propaganda among the anti-German peoples the agencies already existing           should be  utilised.  These  agencies   are  chiefly  the Bohemian (Czecho^           Slovak) National Alliance;  the  Southern  Slav Committee; and  various           Polish organisations.     4. The present tendency of the  Italian Government to shelve the policy embodied           in the London Convention of the 26th  April, 1915, and to adopt a policy of           agreement  with the anti-German races of Austria-Hungary,  should  be           encouraged and stimulated.     5. The ultimate aim of Allied policy should  be, not  to form a  number of small,           disjointed States,  but to  create a non-German Confederation  of Central           European and Danubian States.
    .6. The Germans of Austria  should  be  free to join the Confederated States of           Germany.  They  would, in any case, tend  to  secede from a transformed           Austria in which they would  no  longer  be able to rule  over  non-German           peoples.    In view of the great amount of cabling  that will  be necessary to achieve unity,may I ask you to let  me have either your own  suggestions, or your  approval of thoseabove mentioned, as speedily as possible ?                                                        I am, &amp;c.                                                             NORTHCLIFFE.                         Mr. Balfour to Lord Northcliffe.(Private.)My dear Lord Northcliffe,                      Foreign Office, February 26, 1918.    Your  very lucid memorandum raises  in  one  shape or another the fundamentalproblem of the Hapsburg Empire.  A final and authoritative answer to the questionyou put to me can only be given (if given at all) by the Cabinet, speaking in the nameof the Government.   But I offer .the following observations on the subject, in the hopethat  the)&apos;  ma)&apos; help you in the immediate task  for which you have been maderesponsible.    If the two alternative policies of dealing with the Dual Monarchy set forth in yourpaper were mutually  exclusive, and if they involved distinct and even opposite methodsof propaganda, our position  would be even more difficult than it is.   For what we cando with the  Austrian  Empire does not wholly depend upon our wishes, but upon thesuccess  of our  arms and the views  of our  Allies; and,  as these elements  in ourcalculations cannot be  estimated with certainty, we should inevitably remain in doubtas to  which of the two mutually exclusive methods of propaganda it would be judiciousto adopt.                                            v    Fortunately,  however, our position is not quite so embarrassing.   As you point outwith  unanswerable force, everything which encourages the anti-German  elements inthe Hapsburg dominions really helps to compel the Emperor and the Court to a separatepeace, and  also diminishes the efficiency of Austria-Hungary as a member  of the Middle-Europe  combination.   The Emperor,  by these  means, might be induced, or compelled,fundamentally to modify the  constitution  of his  own State.  If he refused to lendhimself  to such  a policy, the  strengthening of the non-German elements might bringabout the  same and  even more effectually than if he lent his assistance to the process.But in  either case the  earlier stages of that process are the same, and a propagandawhich aids the struggle of the nationalities  now, subject either to Austrian Germans orto Magyar Hungarians towards freedom and self-determination must be right, whetherthe complete  break-up of the Austrian Empire or its de-Germanisation under Hapsburgrule be the final goal  of our efforts.                                                    Yours sincerely,                                                            A. J.  BALFOUR.                         Lord NorthcWTe to Mr. Balfour.                                              Crewe House, Curzon Street, W. 1,My dear Mr. Balfour,                                   February 27, 1918.    Many thanks for your prompt reply to my letter.    Why I am anxious that we should move as rapidly as possible is that the Italiansbelieve that a strong Austrian or Austro-German offensive  against Italy will be launched,within the next two months.  If our propaganda in Austria is to help to weaken thisoffensive, or to turn it into a defeat, it ought, in my judgment, to begin at once, and allthe agencies we can command ought to be hard at work within a fortnight.    The representative of the American Propaganda Department  is in  London.  TheItalian will be  here next week, and we could no  doubt have a French representative atthe same time.    As to the  memorandum, I am very pleased that you are in  substantial agreementwith the policy outlined.   The two policies  may not be mutually exclusive, in the lastresort, but it is very important that one or the other of them  should be given absoluteprecedence.  It would place me in  an awkward predicament if, after basing vigorous
   propaganda on the (b)  policy, I were confronted with  some  manifestation of the (a))   policy on the part of the British or other Allied Government.  For this reason I  hope\   that the War Cabinet  will not delay its  own  decision, and that it  will  try to get a!   decision from France, Italy, and the United States as quickly as possible.&apos;       It goes without  saying that public declarations  on behalf of the British, French,   and Italian Governments, and, if possible, on the part of President Wilson, in the sense   of the (6) policy would, if promptly made, greatly facilitate my efforts. -                                                           Yours sincerely,                                                                 NORTHCLIFFE.o
