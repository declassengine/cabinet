General liarsvlcff Conmondinp Bolshevik forces invitedmilitary representatives of Allied Powers to meet him thismorning.   Major FitzwiAiioms joined.     Muravicff stated that Ukrainian and (small ?) Polishforce was retiring in cUaordor pursued by Bolsheviks toJitomir now solo town in &quot;Eccinc not in their hands that allDon basin captured and fall of Novochorkask end Rostovexpected daily, that Bo^shsvik ( ?s were) in complete agreementwith   *X*  Czechs (Professor Massaric. was present) .   Thisaccords with long conversation I had with Professor Massaricon February 7th when we agreed that only policy was to enterinto relations with Bolsheviks - tho sole real Power in Russiatoday - and hoped to come to amicable arrangement with Poles.He refused to express opinion as regards Roumania.   He expressedfirm intention of continuing: war against Central Powers.   Hewas very friendly to the Allies and hoped we would continue toassist Russia with war material.   In reply to question as towhether ho could rely on his troops he said 90% were reliable.     They certainly showed admirable spirit in capture of Kicff,He expected Austrian offensive within about fortnight.     Major Pitzwilliams in reply to question explained that I washere simply for conduct of business and that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-mont had not recognised independence of Ukraine     ( ? I am of opinion that) I should remain here quietly untilBolsheviks have settled position of Ukraine and that should it bedeclared an autonomous federal state in Russia that I should &apos;then rcsumo present function with (which)   -X   Kharkow BolshevikRada which has arrived (sic).   Position will be probably definedin a few days.   If it is recognised as Ukraine Government I con-sidor good, impression would be created by my remaining, here and byall work of relief b^gutt,.by Anclo^Fren^h Committee (?pjp.eoid$)(fover omitted) by General Tabouis and myself being continued.  Anglo.Russian hospital should also remain.   Bolsheviks arc disposed tobe friendly and I consider that working from here I could help inremoving any friction that at present exists.   00   I consider mydeparture except (V enforced) would be demonstratively unfriendlyand at present moment, when from all. declarations made, Ukrainiansscorn to have recognised that peace can only be attained by victory,undesirable to give them the impression that our support is beingin ony way withdrawn.     This opinion aa regards friendly relations with                                                      Bolsheviks
Bolsheviks is the one I have expressed in my telegram^of last fortnight w&amp;ich m&amp;  not  hare reached you and which&quot;being out of date I shall not repeat.     Vice Consul report0 that his  interview with (?Commandant)was most friendly every protoction and assistance will b*given , order and iron discipline is the watchword, allthieves are shot at eight.      Vioe Consul Jorram who arrived yesterday from Odessaafter 9 days jousmey reports that  he met French officeron the way who told him that when  he left Hovocherkask threeweeks ago two Cossack divisions  who were sent againstUkrainians had gone over.

February 11th),     We approve  of your remaining at Kieff and keeping intouch with Muravieff with  a  special view to bringing abouta reconciliation between Roumanians and Bolsheviks .  Youwill doubtless mtiil out to  him in this connexion that hieprojected attack Vn Roumanians is ineoneiett-nt with hisalleged pro-Sntente sentiments and is not calculated toassist the resistance  to Austrian aggression which hecontemplates.     You will  of course bear in mind that the French Missionare responsible for Allied policy in the Ukraine and youare no doubt keeping your  French colleague informed ofall you are doing.
