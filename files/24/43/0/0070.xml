Owingprobably to the cost of the valuation and other expenses  involvedno such transaction has been effected under these Sections for atleast 40 years, but it is possible  that existing conditions maylead to a revival of this method of extinguishing tithe rentcharge.The Board continue to receive enquiries as  to the rights  of land-owners to raise rents in order to meet the  increase in the value oftithe rentcharge.   As a rule a reply is sent to the effect thatunder Section 1 (l) of the Tithe Act,  1891, tithe rentcharge ispayable by the owner of the land on which it is charged,  notwithstand-ing any contract between him and the occupier of such  land, and anycontract made between an occupier and owner, after the passing ofthe Act, for the payment of tithe rentoharge by the occupier is void.
