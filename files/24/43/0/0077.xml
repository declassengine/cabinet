m PIHis Britannic (Vfajesty^s Government(This Document is the Property ofSUMMARY OF BLQCXAMB I8$0MkTXQ$February ZZ - 86. 1918.I, RUSSIA/&apos; ^  We noted In a previous Summary (January 4th to 10th)   that the eight Russian Departments of the White Sea basin desired   to make their economic arrangements independently of Petrograd sad   if possible to maintain trade relations with the Allies.  The   Russian authorities at Archangel have now presented the United   States and British Governments with a list of their requirements   for 1918,   They include 165,000 tons of foodstuffs.   We have of-   fered  to despatch three cargoes of coffee, rice, herrings etc,  to   Murmansk in exchange for military stores from Archangel, snd we are   informing the United States Government that we have no objection to   the delivery of foodstuffs proceeding to Korth Russia from the   United States.   The British Authorities at Archangel strongly re-   commend that we should give as much support as possible to the   Eussiam there,   Sermon agents already appear to be at work in   Horth  Russia.          Sir 3. Howard recommends that we should also send supplies   to Finland, though there seems little prospect of our inducing the   Finns  seriously to restrict their trade with the Central Pomersc   He represents that an absolute refusal to help the Finns would   seriously impair our influence In the Scandinavian countries,   fe   can obtain guarantees from the Finnish government that neither the   foodstuffs imported, nor any similar articles will be re-exported   from Finland;  but we cannot hope to prevent Finland from supplying   Germany with native Finnish produce such as  timber,  pulp and  paper.   The Finnish Government are importing arms and ammunition from &amp;er-   many and are relying upon German support in  their straggle with  the   Bolsheviks.   The Germans are a hready offering to supply Finland   with cereals in return for lubricating oil,  metal s and such  stores   as may become available for purchase by their agents  o%lng to the
   breakdown of our  Bussisn contraband organisation.         Finland seems  bound  to hsve  the cloests economic relations   with the Scandinavian  countries,   A specific arrangement has al-   ready been discussed for exchanging Danish produce against supplies   from Finland of hemp,  rosin, turpentine, linseed oil etc,  We hsve   been invited to sanction tMs trade on the understanding  that   it will be supervised  by the Danish Associations and that fall   statistics will be regularly submitted to H.M. Legation.flQKSAY,.    The United States  War Trade Board have accepted the lat4   est rations proposed by the Norwegians for their exports  to Oer-   many of calcium carbide and ferro-eilioon. and the final Agreement   is now being prepared  for  signature at Washington.  Under this   Agreement the Norwegian will be able to export to Germany:-                  10,000 tons of  Calcium Carbide                    2,000  &quot;   &quot;   Ferro-Silicon                    8,000  rr   f&apos;   Calcium Ifitrate                  40,000  vf   &quot;   Iron Qre                    1.000  &quot;   &quot;   Zinc                       40  &quot;   !T   Aluminium                    1,000  &quot;   &quot;   Felspar &amp; Felspar Flour.         Ho exports  to  the  memy will be permitted of domestio   animals or the products thereof,  old metals, nitrogen  compounds   (other than those specified above), molybdenum or pyrites.SW&amp;DBH.    fe  still  await the views  of the Swedish aovernment re-   g urging their exports  to the  enemy of iron ore, ferro-sllicon   and wood pulp.   We hsve  proposed       (l)  That the Swedish exports  of  iron ore  to Germany           should be limited to 3,000,000  tons per annum.       (2)  That the Swedes should  allow  the Allies the option           of purchasing 2,500,000 tons  of ore.       (3)  That  their exports to  Sermany of  ferro-silloon           Should be limited to 5,000 tons per annum; and       (4)  That  their yearly exports to  Serai any  of wood pulp           and paper yarn should be limited to 154,000 tons.
         The Swedish delegates have agreed to prohibit the export   from Sweden of all imported goods, of all msnufeetures thereof   and pro duit a s Imilsi res, o f food stuffs end fee&amp;ingstuffs, of   hides,  leather.and leather manufactures and tanning materials,   of wool and cotton manufactures and waste, of yarn and paper   textiles, of all  ores and metals (unless expressly excepted),   of all  the more important acids and chemicals, Including carbide   and cyenamide.   They have agreed to prohibit the export, except   to the  Allies, of ferro-alloys and all hardening materials (except   ferro-ailioon), of tinpiatee and cork manufactures.  They hate   also undertaken to make arrangements for an Allied loan and to   place 500,000 tons of Swedish shipping at the disposal of the   Allies.HMAi^.  H.M. Government are recommending the United States Govern-   ment not to accede to the Danish counter-proposals, noted last   week, without securing important modifications.   We think that   if the  Danes are  allowed to import supplies of Chile nitrate,   they should not be free to denounce the proposed Agreement insix   months  but should be bound for at least a year,  We suggest that   the Danish exports to the  enemy of bacon, butter, eggs, milk and   fate should be limited to 500 tons per week and that no cheese or   casein should be  exported.   We also desire the option to purchase   at reasonable prices quantities of dairy produce equal to those   which they export to  the enemy.         We consider it eesential that Danish vessels should be em-   ployed In the Spanish and Cuban ore trades and that 4$ least one-   third of the Banish shipping handed over to the United States   should be ava11 able ibr service In the danger zone.          We hope the United States Government will be able to reach   a settlement with the Banish Government before the Danes begin   negotiating with  Germany  for a renewal of the German-Danish Agree:   ment of November  last.   This Agreement expires at the end of
225  4.far eh,i HSTHEHLAIPS.   The Butch interpret the raising of our embargo on       Butch commercial cables as a confession that we were in the wrong       in penalising them  for allowing the transit of German sand and       gravel over Dutch territory.  We understood that our concessions       was  to be  followed by a prompt and satisfactory settlement of the       whole question, as the Dutch had already admitted that the transit       over Dutch territory of sand and gravel destined for military       purposes was indefensible.  She Dutch now suggest that we should       send a Mission  to the Hague to reopen a general discussion of the       whole question  They argue, moreover, that, since we have raised       the  embargo on  Dutch cables pending a settlement of the sand and       gravel  question, we should  similarly cease to restrict the deli-       very in Holland of  certain metals pending a settlement of the       question  of the transit of metals over Dutch territory for German       account.    She  Dutch Minister in London has been informed that       there is  not the slightest prospect of our making any further cen-       eessions  while  the  attitude of the Dutch Government is unchanged.            2he German Coal Agreement expires on March 31st and the       Dutch Government will shortly hsve to negotiate for its renewal.       Mr,  London has  informed Sir W, Townley that the Germans have not       carried out  their deliveries of German steel to the Dutch ship-       yards according to  the Agreement, and that the German deliveries       of coal have been short of  the stipulated quantities.   here is,       however,  reason to  believe that the German deliveries of coal       have been rather more satisfactory than Mr* Boudon allows. Ap-       parently  914,000 tons were delivered between October 15th and       February  1st, and the Dutch have secured supplementary supplies       in compensation for a number of Ehine bargos which they have       placed  at the disposal of the German Government.           H.M.  Government have decided not to send any further4 sup-       plies of  British Goal to Holland until there appears to be some
    prospect of the  early  conclusion of a general Agreement with    the Butch,ITALY.    Our arrangements for supplying France and Italy with coal    will have to he  completely revised owing to the exhaustion of    the Italian stocks.  Sight of the principal ge$s works in Italy                                                                     n    are shout to close  down and the munition factories are similarly  I    threatened.   The  Italian  Hallways have virtually no reserves    and depend upon  their  deliveries from day to day.  As an eraer-    geney measure the French have agreed to send  810,000 tons of coal \    to Italy during  March,  hut they require immediate supplies of    British coal in  compensation, to be used exclusively on the    French reilwavs.   The  French stocks are already dangerously    depleted,   A report is being prepared on the ooal position in    France,    When this report is ready a comprehensive plan of    supply will be drawn up by the French and British Governments,SPAIN.     We understand that  the United States Government have con-    eluded their negotiations  for an economic Agreement with Spain    end that the Agreement  is  now awaiting signature.   We were    anxious that this Agreement  should include provisions for the    employment  of Spanish tonnage in Allied services,  more espeeial-    ly in the iron ore trade.    But this Agreement contains no  re-    fere nee  to  this  important matter.    It  seems  that  the united    States War  Trade Board, were  asked  by the French Government  not    to press  the  question of tonnage,  so that  the  clauses of the    Agreement which secure Spanish credits  for Allied purchases in    Spain  might become  operative without more delay.          The Spanish Government are asking  the German Government    to  guarantee that Spanish  shipping will not be sunk by  the Germstfi    submarines.   The Germans have offered not to molest vessels en-    gaged  in  the Spanish coasting trsde  so long as the cargoes are    exclusively for Spanish consumption.   The Spanish Government do
      not  apparently  consider  that  this  is an acceptable offer, but      they do  not propose  to press  for any further concessions until      after the elections.8.
