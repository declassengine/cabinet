Ilg DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF- HISBRXEAKNIC dU   (J           f,lUti$Ti: 3 GO&apos;7 RtelT*)SECRET,17 A RCABINET.SITUATION IN IRELAND.Decipher of message received in Irish Office^^^^^M^SIZ3!3IJ3^ML  g6th^PeBruary 1918.   From Chief Secretary to Msgill.      Please send following message to Secretary, War Cabinet(begint) j-      &quot;Situation in Ireland. Since the despatch of troops toClare there has been no extension of lawless demonstretionsin that county.  No further attacks on police ere reportedbut the unlawful ploughing of lands hss not yet been suppressed.Four cases are reported to-day in districts widely apart andremote from effective police control.  la two the policepresent were too few to do more than take names for proeeou-tlofig.  In one the scene could not be reached in time to preventaction.  A service of motor lorries for troops and police isbeing developed and I share the expectation of the InspectorGeneral that the offences In question will shortly be suppressed.      In Sligo and Rcscoiamon vory vigorous action of theConstabulary in h&amp;ving good effect.  Parties of agrarian offendershave been breken up.  Numerous arrests are in progress, and&apos;theprocess Of prosecution is being specially speeded up.      I anticipate that the enforcement of sentences of imprison-ment irrespective of the hunger 3trike, with the support now-verygenerally expressed in the country towards such c course willproduce good effects in counties at present disturbed.      Except the conspiracy for breaking up large pasture fsrmino special activities of Sinn Tola are noticeable st the rcomsntbut I am dealing with certain notorious disturbers of tho peaceunder the discretionary power given me by the War Cabinet.H.E.DUXg.T1
