L ^       &quot;            MEMORMDUM on RUSSIA *           The Bolshevik revolution took place  on the  8th,      November.   At the end of that month the  Cabinet began      to consider how far it would support movements which      were anti-Bolshevik and pro*Entente, and,  after  some      hesitation, on the 3rd, December they decided to pro*-      vide money for such movements.   Nothing,  however,  ef*      fective was done in that connexion,  still  less in the      direction of sending personnel in to help, until after      the Conference at Paris on thi 23rd, December,    A      policy was then laid down in accordance with the memoran-      dum which had been approved by Monsieur Clemenceaua the      substance of which was that though we should continue  to--      have unofficial relations with the Bolshevik Government      at Petrograd, we should do everything we could to sup-      port the movements in the South and  South-East of Rus-      sia, and elsewhere,  if they should develop, and  it was      distinctly agreed that if the result of such action was      to produce a rupture with the Bolsheviks we should not      he deterred by that happening.           On the 16th, January the Russlar Committee at tha-      Foreign Office presented a report which was communicated      by the Secretary of State to the Cabinet^ urging  strong-      ly that we should promote Japanese intervention  in      Siberia, and pointing out that General Knox had  strongly      advocated that course in a private letter dated the      16th, December,   This report was considered at a      Cabinet held in the House of Commons  on January .25th.                                                         at
                                                 oat which Sir George Buchanan and General Knox werepresent.     The Cabinet had before them, in addition to theMemorandum of the Russia Committee, a note by theSecretary of State in favour t%-*Japanese intervention,,It was decided to approach the Governments of our Alliesand particularly the United States,.on the subject.The French assented immediately;  the Italians aftera little delay did,the same.   The State Department inthe United States gave an unfavourable reply, but atthe same time the President privately intimated that ifwe pressed the matter strongly he might consent,     Meanwhile the Japanese, who had at first shown con-siderable reluctance to have anything to do with inter*-vention in Siberia., gradually took up the attitude thatthey were not averse to some intervention, and that they.were opposed to co-operation with any other power inany such operation, and at the same time complained ofthe want of decision and unanimity which they thoughtexisted amongst their Allies,     The advice we have received as to the effect of in- &apos;tervention on the Russian psychology has bee, very con-flicting.   My own opinion, for what it is worth, isthat if it were carried through with vigour and decisionthe Russians would not object to itr    There seemslittle doubt that the Germans intend  to intervene inSiberia if they can, probably by commercial rather thanmilitary agents, at any rate in the near future,   Un-questionably the prizes offered by Western Siberia areenormous, and if it is possible for the Allies to oc-                                                 cupy
occupy the Siberian railway up to Cheliabinsk it wouldconstitute a very serious military and economic blow toour enemiesr   They will, unfortunately, get a certainamount of stores from the Caucasus over the Black Sea,particularly oil&apos; and manganese, but according to thebest opinion they will get little food from the southernprovinces,     I venture to urge the enormous importance of aspeedy decision,   Had we been able to agree upon apolicy and carry it out vigorously a month or six weeksago, I am myself very doubtful whether any separatepeace would have been made by Russia,           (Signed)     Robert Cecil,Foreign Office,-     February 23rd, 1918,4f
