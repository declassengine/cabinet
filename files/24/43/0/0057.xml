Colonel himy((Phis document is the property of His Britannic LIajestyTs Government),ORB  Tp,  3757.WAR_0 A B I n t %  H0M3  PROPAC-1AEDA .Memorandum by the Chairman of the national Uar Aims Committee.          With reference to the Memorandum on Home Propagandaby the Minister of Information       3703), I do. not see howa Government Department can undertake Home Propaganda withoutits activities being liable to misconstruction and frequentattack, on the grounds that it is Government Propaganda in disguise.          The only body that can undertake anti-pacifist Pro-paganda without such criticism would appear to be a mixed Partyorganisation, such as the National 7ar Aims committee.          Jhe operations of this Committee are capable ofdevelopment to almost any extent and the Committee would welcomeadvice and assistance from the Ministry of Information.          The oinion of the national War Aims Committee isunanimous that there should be no connection whatever betweenthemselves and any Government Department,                           (3d)  FR2D3RICIC GUS3T,                  Chairman,  National 7ar Aims Committee.February 28th,  1918.
