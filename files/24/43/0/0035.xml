MEMORANDUM FROM THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR.

February 25th 1913.
RECONSTRUCTION  FINANCE.     I wish to express my complete concurrence in thegeneral argument put forward &quot;by Dr. Addison in his memorandumdated 10th February (G.T.364-3) on the subject of ReconstructionFinance.     It is certain that the nation at large and the workingclasses in particular expect the Government to play a largo andgenerous part in rebuilding the social and industrial life ina way which will not merely remove the losses and dislocationswhich have been caused by the War but&quot; which will pla^e thewhole fabric on a better and surer foundation.   This can onlybe done by the adoption of far-reaching schemes which willnecessarily involve considerable expenditure, but in our viewthis expenditure ought to be regarded as a necessary prelimin-ary to enabling the country to pay off the heavy debt which hasbeen incurred during the War.   In fact, we would go so far asto say that, if necessary, this will have to be increased bymeans of a &quot;Peace Loan&quot; or seme similar expedient, if the fundsrequired cannot be raised by taxation.     The country will certainly not accept the plea that weare unable to afford to spend the neoessary money on reconstructtion after be comi^ habituated to the oollossal expenditureinvolved by the War.   Unless large sums are spent:\on. housing,on a general soheme for unemployment insurance, on theacquisition of land for small holders, on a better healthservioe and other objects which are essential to any real reconstruotion.   I entirely agree with Dr. Addison in thinking th^-tthe Government would be foroed to adopt hasty and ill-consider-ed proposals which will in the long run prove more expensive.The country^ financial position can only be restored^byincreased production,  but increased production will not besecured unless the general conditions of life for industrialand agricultural i?orkers are materially improved,  and unlessthe necessary funds are forthcoming for enabling industry toresume its full activity at the earliest possible  moment.    Idesire,  therefore,  to  associate myself with Dr.  Addison1smemorandum.Geof H. Roberts.      21st. February, 1910,
