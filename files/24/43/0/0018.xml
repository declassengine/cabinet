In  continuation of my letter  of the 18th instant, Iam directed  by the  Shipping Controller to report, for theinformation  of the  War Cabinet as follows:-CONVOYS.

     COAL POSITION IN SOUTH AFRICA.              The coal position in South Africa has had another     set-back owing to the  railways  between the Natal Collieries     and Durban having been washed out.              It is probable that the shipment of considerable     quantities of coal from South Africa to the Plate for bunkering     British and Allied ships there, and also for South American     Railways in which British capital is interested, will have     to be stopped.   This  will necessitate increasing shipments     from the United Kingdom which is not a desirable alternative     from the tonnage point of view.4.   COAL FOR ITALY.              The quantity  of coal shipped to Italy during February     will, it is estimated, amount to 250,000 tons.   The position     has, however, been improved somewhat by the fairly large     quantities of coal sent to Italy by France (estimated at     120,000 tons for this  month) under arrangements reported to the     Cabinet in paragraph 9 of my letter of the 19th ultimo.5.   STORES FOR THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCS.              The quantity  of military stores discharged In France     during the week ended  the 16th instant was 174,674 tons.6.   EXCHANGE OF BRITISH AND GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR.              On the fourth trip of  the  vessels carrying out  this     work, only one British prisoner was brought over -  a mental     case.              800 German prisoners (civilians)  were embarked  at     Boston, one of whom committed suicide after he had embarked.              The vessels sailed for Rotterdam on the 15th instant.7.    AMERICAN TROOPING.              To provide for the conveyance  of the additional     numbers of American troops to be conveyed under the Versailles     agreement, it has been necessary to approach the Governments  -
     of Francs and Italy with a view to obtaining the use of some     French and Italian vessels suitable for trooping which are at     present either lying idle, or are employed In work for which other     vessels less adapted for trooping purposes might be used.              It is1 hoped also to arrange for the use of the four     Russian steamers &quot;CZAR&quot;, &quot;CZARITZA&quot;, &quot;DVINSK&quot;, and &quot;KURSK?&apos; on     American trooping service.8.   ENEMY. ALIENS IN CHINA.              With reference  to paragraph 10 of my letter of the     9th instant, the Foreign Office have been informed by this     Department that if the  Japanese are unable to convey all the     enemy aliens in China,  this Department is prepared to transport     to Australia the adult  male aliens.9.   HORSES FOR THE BRITISH  ARMY.              The War Office  have now agreed to the shipment of     horses from America ceasing after the end of this month.10.  REQUISITIONED FOREIGN TONNAGE.              The Norwegian  s/s &quot;DJERV&quot; was torpedoed on tho 20th     instant and, in the absence of furthsr information is presumed     sunk.                                I am,                                        Sir,                                Your obedient Servant,                              (Signed)  John Anderson.
