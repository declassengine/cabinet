                 MIUISOBY OP MUNITIONS 01? WAR&apos;,                      VJhitohall Place,                           LONDON,  3.W.                         15th January,  1910. Sir,           I am  directed by the Minister  of Munitions  to state for  tho information of tho Army Council that he  has had under  consideration the question of the orders which it ,7ill  be necessary  for him to  issue to  munition factories in the event of peace negotiations  taking place either with or without  an armistice.  It  is, however, impossible for  him to  draw up a  precise plan of action without  knowing what are the conditions likely to prevail  in these circumstances and he is anxious to have  the  views  cf the Army Council on the matter.          A memorandum has  been&quot;drawn up  indicating the results from the munitions1 standpoint thatwould follow on certain  assumptions  and,   in this connection, I am to ask  for an  expression of opinion on the following  specific points: (i)   Do the three propositions on page 1 exhaust      the possible arrangements in  the event of      an Armistice. (ii)   Is the conclusion  concurred in that during      preliminary discussions  of peace no      restriction oan be placed on,output or      movement of munitions.- (iii) (a) Do tho War Office agree that defensive      warfare only is likely to be maintained      during such discussions?      (b) &quot;is a complete  cessation.of hostile      activity by land but not by sea a possibility      to be provided for?
 (iv) What  is  tho maximum  tonnage  of ammunition     for which  the Army in France cot-Id provide     emergency  accommodation at short notice     in excess  of their present storage programme? (v)  Yrtiat  is  tho maximum  expenditure of ammunition     which could be maintained for a period of     3 or  4 months in  tho event of negotiations     proving  abortive?           The Army Council will appreciate that the complexity  of the munitions organisation makes it impossible to work out a satisfactory scheme at  short notice and the Minister would therefore  be  glad to have the views af theArmy Council as soon as possible.I am,  Sir,    Your obedient Servant,       (SGD.)  W.  GRAHAM GREENE.The Secretary,    VI ar  Office.
 COPY.                                War Office, 57/3/5458.  (A,2.).                                     London,  S.V/. -                              12th February,  1918. Sir,          In reply to your letter No. Munitions Council 377 of the 13th January, 1918, enquiring what are the conditions likely to prevail in the event of the conclusion of an armistice and covering a memorandum drawn up by your Department indicating the results from the munitions1 standpoint that would follow on certain assumptions as to these conditions, I am Commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you, for the information of &quot;the Minister of Munitions, that an armistice implies nothing more than the suspension of hostilities in the area to which it extends and that every pther act is lawful which is not strictly specified in the agreement to be unlawful. Accordingly, in the Council1s opinion,  the.only condition for which provision need be made is that during the armistice naval warfare will continue and the blockade will not be raised.          The Council consider that on this assumption the manufacturing and filling programmes need not be maintained at their present level,  since there would not be sufficient storage accommodation in Eranc6,  and facilities for the transport to  the  various theatres ofwar of these stocks,  if they wero accumulated in England,would-no$ be available.
           In these circumstances,  therefore,the Council consider that in the event of theconclusion of an armistice the manufacture ofmunitions of which the supplies are adequatemight safely he reduced, without prejudicingfuture expenditure, so far as is consistentwith the possibility of restoring within sixweeks tho normal output in the event of aresumption of hostilities,  and that theopportunity should he taken of supplementingstocks of those munitions in regard to which ashortage exists.                   I am,  Sir,                       Your obedient Servant,                            fSGD.)  B.B.  CUBITT.The Secretary,     Ministry of Munitions;.
