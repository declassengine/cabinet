FAS CABINET.SIM ffBlfl ACTIVITY,Copies of:-te^^^gg^Jrom-the ChiefSecretary for Ireland.Decipher of wire .r^eij7gd. 4,.54 p,m,24,2.18* in Irish Office fromDublin Castle.    Chief Secretary recraests that  you deliver  following messageto  Sir Maurice Hankey for  immediate  submission  to  &quot;*-&apos;ar Cabinet.(Begins)    &quot;Beside  usual widespread revolutionary action  of Sinn Feinparty an agrarian movement of  a highly organised,  lawless,  andeaiKorous character is being developed .in-western  countiesof  Ireland, and may well extend throughout tho  country.   &apos;Entryis  made iritb overwhelming  numbers on the lane of well-to-doand lav abiding: farmers and land,  owners,- areas  of  land devotedto  pasture are mar.&apos;ie.d out5 declared  to be  seised in. the nameof  the Irish Republic, and sub-divided between  participatorsin  the crime.   By these proceedings grave discredit is castupon the Government * orderly administration is  seriouslyImperilledj-. cad great loss is Inflicted on individuals as  wellas  on the community.   There is risk al.se  that  food  suppliestrill be appreciably diminished.    The pretext for  this courseof  lewless action is a peril of famine.    The object is to  breakdown British rule.   The chief actors&apos;are  men concerned inSinn Fein movement who can easily bring together a multitudeof  lawless people,for an object which is popular and  attractive.In  order to counter this conspiracy,  I propose  to  direct  arrestof  men guilty of and ring-leaders in open  criminal acts,  andhave them tried and upon sentence  kept in  prison,  but  it  --illalso be necessary, as I think,  to  remove out of Ireland someother persons evidently concerned  in  the general scheme,  butnot easy to make amenable  to the  criminal  law.   ;  I thereforerequire a direction of the : ar Cabinet to  the Army Councilthat removal orders under Befence  Regulation Fourteen  shall bemaHe immediately in esses of individuals -here  I concur withGeneral Office Commanding,  Ireland,  in the necessity for  removaland that such orders ahall  be me.de effective In England by meansof directions fixing -&amp;e place of residence of each oerson.Directions should  also be given,to Home Cffice for the issue ofInternment orders without delay in any cases in which internmentmay appear justifiable end  necessary.   Besides this action it is  possible that some-  extension ofthe work of the Department of Agriculture under  the powers ofthe Corn Production Act may be  advisable.    For  this there isfull statutory.authority,  and&apos;I. am consulting with  Departmentto ensure that iv-such extension aopears  desirable  and pra-c-c^b]it shall  be  made without delay.
         I shall ho glad to know ,on Monday morning that theArmy Council and Home Office will he ready to act as aboveindicated.  DUKE.&quot;                           II       $ccitihor of wire received from Sublin Castle       in&apos;Irish Officet   4*48 p.mi 24-th February.1918*         Chief Secretary sends following further message forSecretary,  War Cabinet (/begins).         &quot;Further to my Memorandum of this date..         In the oases of persons deported from Ireland butnot interned, it is desirable that for greater certainty ofexclusion of undesirable characters power should be takenunder Defence of Realm Regulations to require that no personshall be allowed to travel from Groat Britian to Irelandwithout a permit or passport which should provide means ofidentification.
