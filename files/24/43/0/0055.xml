ETV;/OOI.WEEKLY REPORT OK TURKEY AND OTHER UOFLEk COUNTRIES. I.     (1) Turkish Delegation at Petrograd..          In a note dated Petrograd 15.1.18 Major Keyes reportedthat the Turkish Delegation were ill-informed and were feelingtheir way cautiously.          Tvith regard to the nineteen million Moslems in Russia, thedelegation appear to be pursuing a double  line of policy.   Amongthe Moslems of the Caucasus they are encouraging the separatisttendency, obviously that Trans-Caucasia, v,ith the Moslem elementin the ascendency, can be attached directly or indirectly, to theOttoman Empire.  On the other hand they are fostering the &quot;collect-ive&quot; or centripetal movement among, the Russian Moslems elsewhere,on the calculation that if these can form  a political block (about15 millions strong) within a united Russia, they will exercise anIslamic influence on Russian policy and keep Russia friendly toTurkey.     (2) The Moslem Movement in the Caucasus and Turkish Claims.          The tvo tendencies upon vhich the Turks are working haveexisted among the Russian :oslems since the beginning of theRevolution.  The centripetal tendency tovrrds an All-Russianblock * ithin a united Russia predominates  among the scatteredMoslems surrounded by non-roslem majorities - the Tatars of theVolga and Ural, the Crimean Tatars, the Siberian Tatars.   Thecentrifugal tendency, vhich aims at breaking avay from Russiaand forming independent ioslem F-tatesjj shovs itself among compactpopulations on the fringes of Russia, like the Azerbaijanis ofTrans-Caucasia, the Kirghiz of the Steppes, the Turks of Central
Asia.       Central Asia  seems  to hare-split off already.    InTrans-Caucasia there  is a  provisional &quot;Commissariat&quot;, con-taining representatives of the National Councils of theArmenians, Georgians  and Azerbaijanis;  but Turkish propagandais rife among the Azerbaijanis, and they are evidently  in anaggressive mood.           It appears that in the  armistice negotiations lastDecember between the Turkish and Russian High Commands on theArmenian front, the Turks  claimed  the restoration of the StatusQuo not merely of 1914 but of 1877.           This claim is possibly  an imitation of the Frenchattitude towards Alsace-Lorraine\   but if the Turkish notionof integrity extends to provinces  lost in former wars, it isdifficult to see the limits of the application of this doctrine,and It involves awksard consequences for some of Turkey*sallies *           The claim in Trans-Caucasia concerns tho districtsof Kars, Ardahan and Batum, which were ceded to Russia by theTreaty of Berlin in 1878.    The population consists of Turks,Armenians and Georgian-speaking Moslems, and the presenoo ofthe last element is important from the political point of view.The Georgians and Aacerbaidanis have already been disputing overthe allegiance of this element,  and if Turkey now definitelydemands its reincorporation in the Ottoman ijnpire,  the Georgianswill consider that their national  unity is being impaired.   Thiswill drive them into the arms of the Armenians,  a result whichis extremely desirable in the interest of Great Britain, sinconothing but cooperation between Georgians and Armenians canstem Turoo-Moslen aggression in thv  quarter.           It may also be noted thA.fr,  by the terms  of theCyprus Convention between Great Britain and Turkey  in 1878,
  the British tenure of Cyprus was contingent on the tenureof the Ears-Ardehan*-Batum territory by Russia.   Of coursethis convontion lapsed when Great Britain and Turkey went towar with one another, and it has been superseded by the aii-noxation of Cyprus to the British Empire.   But the point isalmost certain to be raised by the Turks, and this was doubt-less one of their motives in claiming the restitution of theaforesaid districts by Russia.     (g)  The All-Russian Moslem Movement.           This movement is organised by the Executive Oom-mittee of the All-Russian Moslem Council at Petrograd, and itsspokesman is Ahmed Tsalikov (by origin an Ossetian Moslem fromthe Northern Caucasus).           On Dec.6th 1917, the Bolshevik Government issued anappeal by wireless to all Mosloms inside and outside Russia,to which Tsalikov responded in an open letter:-    &quot;We do not doubt the good sentiments entertained by the  Bolsheviki Commissaries towards the oppressed Moslems in tho  world;  but promises are one thing and their fulfilment  another.   The Bolsheviki authority has at present adopted  a line of policy which may ultimately have oontrary results  for the Moslen population of Russia and the East.    &quot;To the Islamic East, the emancipating mission of Democra-  tic Russia is feasible on onu condition only: if Russia  maintains her integrity and force, or in other words, her  state authority.   Otherwise the result would be quite oon-  trary to expectations.    &quot;&quot;The Russian Moslems think that it is of great importance  to create immediately a solid authority in Russia founded on  all the elements of Revolutionary Democraoy.   Suoh an author-  ity alone would be able to wage battle for the groat ideals  of mankind.   This is tho standpoint of the Revolutionary  Democraoy of Moslem Russia.    &quot;Commissaries of the peopleI  It is not too late yet;  but  any more delay may be fatal.   If you delay, you will perish  under the weight of tho problems you have raised, you will  destroy the work of tho labouring classes and will postpone  for years to oome the emancipation of the oppressod classes  of the world from the grasp of European capitalistic! blood- r  suckers;  and therefore you will postpone alBo ^emancipation A Hve  of 300 millions of Moslem people in tho East.&quot;           This reply is characteristic of the conservative,orderly temperament for which the Moslems of European Russia
have a reputation.   Isalikov evidently elings  to therteontripetal&quot; idea of a consolidated Russian State, linkingup tho scattered Moslem elements included in the old RussianEmpire and thereby giving them a voice in the central directionof affairs.           At the same time, the disruptive tendency is Showingitself among these Moslem elements also.   The  Crimean Tatarshave made terms with the Ukrainian Ro&amp;a, and as oarly as lastAugust the Moslems of &quot;Inner Russia&quot; (the Volga-Ural region)and Siberia set up an administrative organisation at Ufa toprovide for the &quot;national cultural&quot; autonomy of the Moslempopulation in this area.   In this connection the MoslemEcclesiastical Council at Ufa, which had been constituted thesupreme religious authority for the Moslems of All Russia bythe All-Russian Conference in May 1917, was turned into the&quot;Ministry tf Cults&quot; of the new local administration.           Altogether, with the progressive disintegration oftho Russian State, the centripetal tendency among RussianMoslems is distinctly losing ground to the dangerous oentri-fugal movement.PERSIA.           When the mutual evacuation of Persian territory wasincluded in the terms of the armistice between Russia and theenemy powers, the German press began to pay increased attentionto the Persian question.           On Fob. 7th, the Kfflnisoho VolkszeitunjB; registereda claim for the maintenance of the interests secured to Germanyin Persia by the Russo-German agreements of 1910-11, and aremarkable article had already appeared in the Europ&amp;ischeStaats- una wirtschaftszoitung of Jan.5th, In which Persia wastreated as the starting-point for a German continental policyin Asia:-
    &quot;The first step of our new world-policy in alliance with  Russia and Turkey will bo the oreation of a Persian Army  by German instructors in the territory evacuated by the  Russians and Turks.    &quot;As a gcnoral point of polioy wo shall have to secure  Dilitary independence for the native states of the whole  world, in South America as well as Abyssinia and Siam&quot;.           Tho writer finally demands the construction, by Ger-man capital, of a now Central Asiatic trans-continental rail-way.   This will open a back-door into China, and enableGermany to liberate that country from the maritime power ofJapan, England and America.Turoo-German Relations:           There are persistent rumours of dissension withinthe Q.&amp;P. as well as between the Governments of Turkey andGermany.           Tal&amp;at Pasha, who has been at Berlin and Brest,is reported to have left for Turkey on Feb.11th.   Ris rela-tions with Etthlmann are said to be strained,  and it is statedthat he has failed to procure guarantees of German militaryassistanoo to drive the British out of the Occupied Territories.           Those rumours can bo accepted with less hesitationthan another series of rumours to the effect that the TurkishGovernment is now prepared to bargain with Great Britain on thoArab question.   This second supposition is very possibly a merededuotion from the first, and the one thing certain is thatTurkey still insists publicly on her ccmpleto territorial in-tegrity, while in the case of Armenia, the only torritorialquestion which has yet come within sight of discussion,  she hasshown horself not only intransigent but aggressive.           Turkey will hardly break away from Germany untilit becomes clear that the German General Staff cannot obtainsuch a general military decision on the Western front as
would force the Allies to accept tho Central Powers1 termsen bloc.           So long as this possibility remains open in theminds of the Turks, they will judge it better policy to stickto Germany than to try their fniiuno in separate negotiations.27 * 2 * 18 c
