Te tho War  Cabinet,         I wish to draw attention to the extract from a letter  received at the Office of Works from one of the Directors of a  Company engaged on Building Gontraets at Montagu Houae, and in  St.  James1  Park.  Although this is the first c&amp;so that has come to  my kno?&amp;edge, officially^ I am afraid that this instance is only  symptomatic of a great many more that must arise on Government  work, throughout the country.   The present meat ration allowed  in the Home Counties will., I think, be universally oonsidered by  pr act is si mesa insufficient to  allow workers engaged on heavy  employment  to continue the standard of efficiency that they have  maintained  in the past*  Unless steps can be promptly taken to  provido for an extra allowance of moat to the heavier workers, a  considerable falling off of production must follow.  It seems a  pity that in working out the scale of rations, no account apparently  has bean takoa of this fact, and sedentary workers and women  employed in ordinary civil life, domestic servants, etc., have  identical meat rations with men engaged on arduous work.  If the  supply of meat makes it impossible to provide a larger ration, a  modified adjustmont, bearing somo relation to the werk done,  should not  bo impossible^         X have not the information te deal with any details, but I  would like  to draw attention to the following  salient facts.  I understand the rations of the Homo Army are still very largely  in excess of those allowed to  the   civil population.  It is diffi-  eult to soo in what respect tho physical energy expended by them  in their duties exceeds that of men engaged in heavy manual labour  in industry..  In a very great  many instances it must be far less.  Certainly,  where sedentary and clerical work is conoeraed, it can  be so  more than that of any other clerical worker engaged in  civil life.         Secondly, tho meat rations of the Army in the Jfield are, -undoubtedly, on a liberal seals,  While no one wishes to diminish  $no efficiency of the fighting soldier, it does not seem conclusively  -established that some reduction in their moat rations would be  harmful% and that a further reduction of tho moat ration of the  very large  body of men employed is France and ether theatres of tho  war, who are not members of a combatant service, could advantageously  be made?         Thirdly, it is notorious that there are large reserves of  moat held in this country.  A resexvo exists to be used at a  eritieal moment-s aad the question eeeurs, whether it is likely  that a more critical moment will arise i;a the meat question than  during the  next three or four  months.  Puri% this period our   erne HBiapnly of fat cattle is at its ;lowest ebband our importations ,oongeated&quot;sad restricted,.        .liJ&amp;nm ^aan induced to  submit this Memorandum which deals tWifch^malriesrs for which I am not directly responsible, but which I  feel may 3er? ouely /affect the  work with which my Department is  charged. X-am also conscious  of the possible/effect of an inadequate  meat ;rat^on.^n the general industrial situation.(Sgd,),,   j^ssd MOiJU,.H.MS Office of Works.,      1st March, 1916.B.T.O.
