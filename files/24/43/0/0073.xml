Memorandum &quot;fey Celonel Knno , Japanese General Staff,   embodying suggestions for immediate and future Anglo^   Japanese co-operation.NOTE,   Celenel Kenc is an Officer whe has feeen an        special duty in Petregrad for some time whence        he has recently arrived in England.  He wag       . deputed to accompany the first party of British        Officers from the Quetta Staff College on their        visit to the Manchurian battlefields in 1907.        He is an extremely capable Officer who commands        the confidence and esteem of all British Officers        with whom he has been associated.  There is no        question of his sincere feelings of goodwill        towards this country.27th February ,  1918.R.S^/          I wish to take this opportunity of my visit to Englandto inform you witheut reserve of the views which I hold as aprivate individual.  If you will be good enough to make themknown to those concerned , I should not only be personally gratefulbut it would be of the greatest value to our countries, ,          As everyone knows, the policy of Germany vis-a-visRussia has of late made great strides and is now showing results.Germany has in view the immediate supply of produce to relieveher shortage^ and also, as an essential to the restoration of herstrength after the war, a revival of her intercourse and oommeroewith the whole of Russia, and a gradual growth of amity in theirrelations.          Moreover the middle and upper classes throughoutRussia are most anxious to secure the aid of some force whiehwill oppose the extreme Socialists , and will restore Russiato normal conditions , so securing their life and property. Ofthis present state of affairs German policy has made U8e\ andshould the war continue, Germany will as a matter of course take,as time goes on, a gradually firmer hold in Russia, and it willfollow in the natural course of. events that Russia willeventually form part of the German league.  Hitherto it has beendifficult for the Allies to repress the Central Powers, even withRussia on our side; and if- one day Russia, with her greatpopulation , should leave us and go over to the enemy , we shouldhave to loek forward to the growth of a really terrible worldpower in the future.          The time in fact has come for an immediate andexhaustive consideration of means to be taken for the defenceof territory and the maintenance of peace in the East.          My plan for combating German influence in the Eastis as follows;-
     An independent State to be  set up  and  supportedby Japan and&quot; Great. Britain, east of the Urals,  and  theline Ural Mountains - Ural - Baghdad  to bo  the  jointfirst line of defence of  Japan  and Great Britain againstGermany,     Further, with such a State  as a  political  centre,  iflater the 7/e stern Germanic States could be---- ?  - and  a  GrRussian Union established to drive out  German -politicalinfluence, this would be of the  greatest advantage.     It would be desirable to  include the Don region  in &apos;this independent State; but the  rising  in the Don regionwas anti-Lenin, and it does not  follow  that  it  was  anti-German, so that it must be ejected that they will  not  hoiout long against contact with  German influence.     It is important not to omit  consideration  of thepolitical aspects of contact in   British and Japaneseterritory with Russian Socialistic principles.     Should the first proposal not come to  anything,  wemust&apos;gradually restrict the limits of our influence.  How-eve rf% we mast at least take as the basis of  our defence thline BAGHDAD - PERSIA - AFGHANISTAN N.  FRONTIER -SEMIPALASHENSI - JJOVOHIKOLAIEVSE - TOMSK,, ?     VJhat must be considered at this&apos;juncture is thatJapan*s influence must proceed,  as to position  and  relationships,  in concert and unison with Great Britain in  theSouth 7/est.   Thus Japan must held the  territory East ofCentral Siberia, and exert herself to set up- an independentState the re e     It is my earnest hope that the British  and JapaneseGovernments vail recognise the Eastward trend of Germanpower,  and without any delay take definite measures to  stenthis onward movement,   A day1 s  delay&apos; means&quot;  a day * s dipinutof our sphe re of &quot; influence I &quot;&quot;T/e&quot; are  confronted^wiTn^a&apos;&apos;situation similar to&apos; thaTTVhich confronted us at the  time cthe Anglo-Japanese Alliance;  but  the  enemy,  we  must realiseis a much stronger one.   However, I hope the   Alliance wilcome to have a greater significance ancl grov/ in strength ansolidity*     When the Alliance v/as revised it was severely  oritieisby students, and of late,  arising out of oconomio collisionin South China and the South Seas between Japan and   GreatBritain, there has beon considerable discussion as  to theadvisability of continuing the Alliance, which, as  is nodoubt known in England,  caused the  Xaiser to state thatEngland had lost Japan from among her Allies,   But if hereforward England&quot;and Japan could act in  close  concert, andcarry out in Siberia this policy  of opposition  to Germany,the Alliance would be promoted, and   Japan*s economicdevelopments in Liberia would do away with   such collisionsas those mentioned above,  and thus help to  give increasingstrength to the Alliance    - There is one thing I should like  to mention in conclu-sion.    I learn with regret that most  of our  officers inilingland are not content with the  treatment  accorded to the
Your Army has now been at war for 3 years, and possesses awealth of information.   I need not say that any lessonsour officers in England can learn are for the advance andimprovement of the Army of your Ally.   But at presentcapable officers specially selected by our Government areeating their hearts out in London doing nothing, and Icannot refrain from saying that this is not - ? - actionunder presout conditions.     They are all the best men of our Army, men of promisewho will one day hold prominent positions.   To treat themsatisfactorily,  and to make cordial relations between uswould surely, &quot;be  the best preparation for a future closeco-operation between our two Armies.     At the time of the Russo-Japanese war I was on the&apos;Staof the 2nd Army and had to do with the foreign attaches,and I know that  there was some discontent among the EnglishOfficers at the  treatment accorded to thorn, which was thegeneral treatment of all officers,  since all countries wererepresented.   But I venture to think that Colonel Ilaldaneand Colonel Tulloch will have appreciated that,  in thematter of military study,  special facilities woro given tothe English officers.
