OPERATIONS.prom t    General Dunsterville,To   :    CI.G.S.         Repeated G.O.C.  Mesopotamia.         Handed in 1.5 p.m. 22.2.1918.         Received 6.50 a.m. 23.2.1918.25 D. February 2oth.          I have been obliged to return to Hamadan, in view ofsituation at Enzeli, and to await furMier orders.  Road from Hamadanto Enzeli is 287 miles and crowded with disorderly Bolshevic soldiers.prom Kasvin to Enzeli, 142 miles, road runs through jangali territorymostly narrow defiles and later on thicfc jungle both right and left.The port Ksubvian is in the hands of the Bolshevics and Red Guardsabout 3,000 with guns and gun-boat, who are very friendly withJangali and actively support them with information and arms andvarious German and Austrian agents are working with former.  TheBolshevics control telegraph, wiieless petrol and all ships at Enzeii.We were practically prisoners in the hands of the Bolshevics from thetime of our arrival, who picketed my house and every steamer.  Iattended three meetings of the Revolutionary Committee but failedto persuade them to change point of view which is that the Caucasus  1are their enemy and the^ will resist with armed.force any attempt   ^by non-Russians to assist them.  They further stated that theirattitude towards my party would remain hostile until my return. Theyknow or  guessed object of my mission having news of it from Caucasusnot from this side.  Was informed by Consul-general Resht that.......uchi Khan had arranged attack on my party on the way toEnzeli if Russians would remain neutral; latter refused,  so theattack was not carried out.   But he officially informed me throughthe British Consul that he will attack all English parties.  Hisarmed men are posted on the road ready to act but we passed throughthem without molestation.   Consider that till situation improvesthis road must be regarded as entirely ciesed.  I withdrew fromEnzeli and through Jangali territory with difficulty without bobloodshed but cannot consider it could be done twice.   At one timeowing to likelihood of being made prisoner and searched the situationwas eo critical that we were obliged to burn all  papers.   Revolution-ary Committee informed me that General Baratoff is to be  arrestedand tried.  They are actively opposed to the raising of volunteerforce in Persia and intend to break present organization,  theirpolicy being complete evacuation of Persia by all white races.Goismi had preceded me to  Baku,  have ordered hiia to join  pike atTiflis.
