ini.....BA?This Document is the Property ofHie Britannic jgajesty^s Government.)Ooloael dontIntelligence Bureau Department of InformationWEEKLY  REPORT  ON  PRANCE    gVj.       (March 1 1918)   The principal political interest of the last fortnight hasagain centered in the doings of the Socialist party.   TheReport of a fortnight ago spoke of the strange doings of thelargest of the Socialist Confederations, that of the Seine, atwhose meetings three weeks ago the more or less Pacifist minoritygot t^he upper hand and carried resolutions against further votingof credits and against the continuance in office of the threemembers of the party who hold minor and non-political posts inthe Government.   It was remarked in the Report that the partyas a whole has more than once refused to follow the lead of theSeine,   This has now proved to be the case onoe more.   Whenthe National Counoil of the whole Party met, the old Majorityproved to be still able to hold its own though with some difficultyAfter hearing Mr Henderson and the other English delegates the Councildecided by an immense majority to give a general adhesion to theBritish Labour Memorandum on V&apos;ar Aims with oertain amendments.This decision was in substance a victory for M. Albert Thomas and theold Majority, as on the question of Alsace-Lorraine    Longuet andhi 8 friends would have proposed that Pranoe should admit aplebiscite as a right after the two provinces had been returned,whereas the text adopted in Paris (and subsequently by the Inter-Allied Conference in London) merely says that, after it has been *reoognized that the Treaty of Frankfort is simply abrogated sofar ao the two provinces are oonoerned, France may agree to a fresh
consultation of the people  of Alsace-Lorraine as to their desires.Both  these points  were  pressed in the debate, but M. Thomasinsisted on the maintenance of the text as prepared before the meetingand carried the mooting  with him by 2618 to 218.   On the quostion  of the party refusing to vote the war credits,as resolved by the  Socialists of the Seine, M. Thomas had more-difficulty, but he  insisted, as he said, on knowing \7hether theMajority were or were not any longer the Majority.   In the end the motion re-affirming the policy of supporting thecredits as a &quot;symbol of  national defence;&apos; was carried after somesharp passages of arms between Majority and Minority by 154-8 to 1415.One retort of K. Thomas  to  M,Longuet is worth quoting.   r. Renaudelwas sarcastioally alluding  to the Minority attitude which pretendedto refuse credits on grounds of &quot;clearsighted patriotism&quot;, when M.Longuet, the Minority leader, interrupted &quot;Yes, clearsighted toprevent the assassination of Prance&quot;!   to whioh Thomas replied&quot;Better see her assassinated by the Kaiser, X suppose&quot; a retortwhloh was followed by loud  applause.   Renaudel, the leader of theMajority, insisted vigorously that the party could not afford, byrefusing credits, to let it be supposed that it deserted the nationaldefence or associated itself with any German propaganda, - anotherphrase which caused a tumult.   In the end the voting was as alreadygiven:   and on the third question raised by the Seine people, thatof demanding the resignation of the Socialist commissaires theywere again defeated, this time without a division.   This meansof course that, as the official organ of the party says, theMajority is still the Majority. But there are certain qualificationsto make.   On the important question of the war credits the votingw\s alarmingly equalj  in spite of the fact that the Majority hadtried to conciliate the  Minority by threatening that support of the
                          A 3 -credits might he withdrawn if the Government placed obstacles in the wayway of an International Conference,    And the large majority by whichthe statement on Vfar Aims was adopted in spite of its containingsome things which the Minority disliked was not entirely due todisinterested enthusiasm for it.   It was at least in part due to thedesire to work if any success was to be obtained.   It was dueagain to the passionate desire of the MixUrity  to obtain aninternational Conferenoe which they oould not obtain If theyquarrelled with the Majority.   And it may have been due to a desireto obtain certain concessions from the English, such as in facthave been obtained, especially in the matter of the Colonies,the return of whioh has been declared (on French suggestion) tobe one of the things which ought not to stand in the way of theconclusion of peace.   There is obviously a danger here.   If thingsgo well with the Allies, the Germans are likely enough to offer tomake concessions about Alsace-Lorraine on condition that theircolonies be restored to them.   And the French ought to understand,what thore is no sign of their peroeiving, that the Labour partiesmost conoerned on this subjeot viz,  those of Australia, NewZealand and S.Africa are not likely to regard the return of theGerman Colonies with equanimity!  and they ought to bear in mindthat whatever be the rights and wrongs of this difficult problem, itshould not be assumed to be a question of British Imperialistambitions, but rather one of the possible dangers to the union ofthe British Empire.   Melbourne and Sydney, Cape Town and Pretoriaare much more interested in it than London;  and Frenchmen, whetherSocialists or others, must learn to give a fair hearing to whatthey have to say.   And there is one other thing whioh ought toappeal to French Socialists.   They cannot but recognize that the
democratic principles for which they stand will depend for theirpower in the world very largely in future on British and Americansupport.   Is it wise to adopt an attitude which, by insistingas a matter of right on what France wants, and treating as amatter of comparative indifference what South Africa andAustralia want, might conceivably jeopardise the union of theBritish Empire and with it all these ideals of liberty and progressfor which the existence of the British Empire is one of the strong-est guarantees ?   In that case the concessions made at Paris and ratified inLondon might prove to have done the worst of service to theSocialist cause.   But people do not alwcys see remote results;and it is likely enough that these oonoessions helped theMinority to unite in the resolutions which were ultimatelyunanimously accepted at the London Inter-Allied Conference.   From the point of view of internal French politics theSocialist situation is not greatly altered.   The Majority showedno hesitation or lack of courage in their speeches;  they wereaware that, as the Belgian VanderveLe said, the only thing whichprevents their resolutions from being mere scraps of paper isthe Allied Army btratiched out from Nieuport to Venice;  and theyhave even insisted on the Gorman Socialists taking some realaction as a preliminary to the making of an InternationalConference.   On the whole they may be said, In spite of concessions,to have recovered most of the ground they appeared to have lostat the time of tho meeting of the Socialists of the Seine.   It isto be noted that a new Socialist body oalling itself a Committeefor a &quot;paix du droit&quot; has been formed which stands at the extremeright and vigorously attacks the official leaders for willingnessto meet the enemy, pacifism and even Bolshevism.   Whether this
Committee will prove to be of any importance is doubtful.   Butit is not at all impossible that the ignominious collapse whichhas followed on the Bolshevist orgieB of crime at home and blusterabroad may have opened many eyes and so tended to strengthen the .Majority section and weaken the Pacifist Minority, who have, atleast in part, shared the Russian delusion that German guns canbe put to silence by eloquent proclamations,   There is little else to report about France exoept that anotherimportant arrest has been made, that of M,Humbert, the Senatorand Editor of the Journal who has long been under accusationfor Ms strange proceedings about his paper, the proprietors ofwhich he bought out, as he says, because he was not comfortableabout the sources of the money with whioh they had acquired it;and himself, for this laudable purpose, obtained money from M.B0I0J   The food situation continues to provoke criticisms fromEnglish visitors;  ?/ho often report that not only are there veryfew regulations but that those which exist are not at all strictlyobserved.   Meat is not rationed at all, and the few regulationsare not even noticed, French papers say, by the customers atrestaurants.   Nearly all foods are said to be abundant though dear.Several of the papers have spoken with admisationof the sacrificesmade in the matter of food by London and New York as comparedvrith Paris,
