                        PART  I.-ACTION  TAKEN.              ORDERS UNDER DEFENCE OF THE  REALM  REGULATIONS.   The following Orders have been issued from the Ministry during the week :      (1)  The Pigs Control (Ireland) Order, 1918, dated 21 February, 1918, provides            for  the licensing and registration of buyers of pigs in Ireland.  After            the 1st March next it will be illegal for anyperson who has not applied            to the Irish Committee for a certificate of registration under the Order,          .  and after  the 15th March for any person who is  not a  holder of  such.            certificate  of  registration,  to  buy  pigs  in  Ireland  for  slaughter;            Registered buyers will  receive  an  allocation of  supplies on  the basis            of a  period of  normal trade and proper allocation will be made to            English and Scottish buyers.     (2) The Potatoes (Protection) Order, 1918, dated 21 February, 1918, enacts that            every person who owns  potatoes, or  has  potatoes in his  possession or            control shall at  all times take  reasonable precautions  to protect  them            from frost, damp, or other damage, whether such potatoes  are growing,            in transit or in store, and that anyone who consigns potatoes for transport            by railway in open trucks  shall also  take all necessary steps to protect            them.     (3) The Waste of Foodstuffs Order, 1918,  dated 21 February, 1918, makes it an            offence for a person to waste any foodstuffs or permit them to be wasted.            An exception is made in the case of trade waste, not arising from want            of due care,  where the trader has  been ready to sell  foodstuffs at            reasonable prices, and could not reasonably have made it available for            human food otherwise than by way of sale.  Any person  authorised in            writing by the Food Controller may enter premises  where he has reason            to believe that there is waste.      (4) The Malt (Restriction) Order, 1918, dated  26  February,  1918, prohibits            (except under licence) the  manufacture,  sale, purchase,  delivery, or use            of any malt or malt extract on and after the 1st March, 1918.  An excep-            tion is made of malt already in process of manufacture on February 28,,            and also the use of malt under contract of delivery.  It permits  the            purchase by a baker of malt for  the purpose of making bread.      (5) The Barley (Requisition) Order, 1918, dated  26th  February,  1918, enables            the Food Controller to requisition stocks of  barley on 1st March,  1918.             This refers to natural  and  kiln-dried, barley, both home-grown and             imported.  Returns giving full particulars  of such  stocks on  the             1st  March and contracts  for sale of the same  are to be sent to the             Ministry  of Food,  not  later than 7th  March.  The Order  does not             interfere with purchases by Controlled Flour Millers of barley not taken             over under the Order.    The  Joint Orders  Committee of the Board  of Agriculture and  the  Ministry ofFood met on 26th February to discuss  amendments in  the Live Stock (Restriction ofSlaughter) Order and the Horses (Rationing) Order.    There has been set up a Propaganda Committee consisting of two members of theBoard of Agriculture and two members  of  the  Ministry of Food, for the purpose ofconducting a propaganda campaign throughout England and  Wales with  a view togiving  special information to farmers on all Orders issued, publishing leaflets dealingwith such  special  points as the  production of potatoes,  preservation  of the pigpopulation, and substitution  of home-produced animal  food  to meet  the  shortage ofgrain and other feeding stuffs.                                            &apos;    *  (33)4987-4 Pk 1  115 3/18  E &amp; S                                           A
    At a meeting of the Consumers&apos;  Council held at  the  Ministry  of Food onWednesday, February 27th, the following resolutions were passed :     (1) &quot; That as a result of our consideration  of the new Tea Order, we urge Lord           Rhondda to abolish all  rebates and to fix a flat rate to wholesalers and to           retailers, allowing to the latter a gross profit of 3d. per lb.  We also urge           that inquiries should be made  into.contract prices  with tea-growers in           India and Ceylon and into  shipping freight, with a view to reducing the           retail price from 2s. Sd. to 2s. Qd. a pound, this to be the only price.&quot;    (2) &quot; That in &quot;the event of a serious shortage of a rationed food being ascertained,           the Food Ministry should at once instruct and  authorise the Distributing           Authority in the various districts to guarantee to each person rationed an           equal ration of such food, based upon the division of the smaller amount           available.&quot;    (3) &quot; The Consumers&apos; Council, having heard the statements Of Lord Crawford in           support of the proposed Cakes and Pastry Order,  re-affirms its previous           resolution on the matter so  far  as the Order maybe made applicable  to           domestic cookery.&quot;  .                             SUPPLIES AND PRICES.    &apos;Allied Purchases, The following cable was sent by Lord Rhondda in reply to a cablegram from Lord Reading stating that the United States Railway Administration had undertaken to provide transportation from  Chicago and other centres for  about 40,000 tons of beef and packing-house  products to the seaboard, but adding that the situation  as regards shipment of cereals  did not  show much improvement.:            &quot; Food Controller desires to  inform you that while all foods are of urgent -   ii:  importance  the  most vital foodstuff at  the  moment,  providing  cereals for       shipment are short, is bacon, since this  supplies both  meat and fats.  Food       Controller is advised that quantity of bacon purchased but not shipped is over       100,000  tons, and  he  therefore trusts that special efforts will  be  made       towards expediting deliveries of bacon.&quot;     The  United States  Food Administration has informed Mr. Owen Smith that in addition  to the 5,000 tons frozen beef authorised  for purchase  in the  March pro- gramme,  there  will be available a further quantity of 20,000 tons steers, 3,000 tons cows and 4,500 tons boneless beef for delivery up to the middle of April.     Mr. Owen Smith cables  that the  United States Food Administration state they are now  able  to relax the prohibition of  the export of cotton-seed oil and that the position as regards lard substitutes, lard, and  also  margarine  is  easier. . This will enable the Allies to increase their purchases of these  articles.     Mr.  Owen Smith cables that in addition to  purchases on Government account, all possible private shipments in accordance with priority,  and such other food products as are quickly available at New York and  other American ports  are being shipped and  that no  ocean space is  being missed so  long as Government- or  private food purchases can be secured to fill it.  He has already purchased  sufficient  meats, fats, and  oils in America to fill the 180,000 tons  of  space  allotted  by the  Ministry  of Shipping for the month of March, and more supplies are available.      Bacon, Hams, and Lard. Arrangements have  been made to meet all anticipated requirements of the London and Home Counties Rationing Scheme, and the supply  of bacon should bs ample.  A  special reserve of 800 boxes  is  being held by certain wholesalers to meet any emergency which may arise.      The proposal that  Irish production should be  first used to satisfy Irish require-  ments, the surplus only being  exported  to  Great Britain, which was mentioned in the  last Report, has made further progress.   Concrete  proposals have  been laid  before  the Food Control Committee  for  Ireland, and if,  as is probable, the proposals are  accepted, not only will the waste of the present  system of imports - of &apos; Irish - bacon  from Ireland  and  export  of  American  bacon from  Great  Britain  to  Ireland  be  avoided,  but  the  problem of  distribution in Great  Britain  will be  considerably  simplified, as  the imported North American bacon  wholly  under  the  control  of the  Ministry of Food will be. a very great proportion of the total sxxpplies in Great Britain.      Butter.-The statement made last week with regard to the purchase of 500 tons  of Danish butter at 312s. per cwt. landed, should have referred to Dutch butter; no  Danish butter was purchased last week.      A further purchase of  60 tons, of butter  at prices ranging from 44 to 48 cents  f.a.s.  New  York has been made in the  United States.of America,  and  a further
16 tons at 391- cents has been purchased in Canada.  Steps are being taken to acquireabout  900 tons  of butter  available in Denmark, for shipment  to this country; it isexpected that the price will be approximately 610s. c.i.f.:  :  About 17,500 tons of butter are now on  the water.                             :    Cheese-The quantity of New Zealand  cheese &quot;now oh the way to this countryis 6,953 tons, of  which, 5,000 tons  is expected in  March  and 1,953 in April.   Thearrival of 1,532 tons of Old Season Canadian Cheese is  expected within the  first halfof March, and 674 tons still remain to be shipped.  1*500 tons  of cheese have  beenallotted to the Ministry of Food by the United States of America Food Administration,and;it is hoped to complete the February allotment shortly.    The distribution of cheese to the civilian population which  was  begun last week,is: nearly completed;    Cocoa. Instructions have been sent to Mr. Owen Smith to  secure the  shipmentof: some 1,200 tons Of loose Cocoa; powder now lying in New York, which  has  beenpurchased by firms in this country.  Mr. Owen Smith has been instructed to buy thisquantity if he can at did. per lb., and, in any case, to make  arrangements for  itsexport.    Cold. Storage. Mr.  Brickwell, formerly  Chief Surveyor to  the Great  NorthernRailway Has been appointed Director&apos;of the Cold Storage Section,  in succession toMr. J.  Wardle.              &apos;    Dried Fruits.: The s.s. &quot; Rooke &quot; sailed from Patras with 1,000 tons of currantson February 20th. :.    The s.s. &quot; Cadagua &quot; has been chartered, and wall sail from Spain on  March 10thfor  a Bristol Channel  port.   1,375 tons of  Malaga raisins have been purchased  atslightly; under 40s. f.o.b.,  and  an option obtained for  a further 200 tons in case the&quot; Cadagua &quot; will take deck cargo.   The cost of the raisins will thus - be just under60s. c.i.f.    Fruit Supplies and, Preservation.-.91,000 half-chests.of Spanish bitter orangeshave been landed in  this, country.up to date.   Shipments of Sicilian bitter orangeshave not yet been  delivered.    Notification has been received  that 1,000,000  bee sections are awaiting  shipmentfrom the United States.    The  fruit pulp laid down by the Ministry during  last season is being sent tocertain firms for making jam, for despatch  to various centres where there is a shortage.Buildings for prospective fruit pulping&apos;stations have been surveyed in various,townsin the  fruit-growing centres.  Arrangements are being made with the War Office totake over their pulping factories at Evesham. and Wisbech;     Meat.- The position during the past Aveek has been  distinguished  by the  intro-duction of rationing in the London  and Some Counties area.  It is already evident thatconsiderable changes will he effected in the consumption of meat,  and  it is possiblethat experience will show some modifications of the original scheme to be desirable. - &apos;  The tendency at present is for the consumer to delay purchases untilthe end ofthe week, with  the result that more than  sufficient meat  has been placed on themarket, in the early days of the, week and  offal has been entirely neglected.   In orderto prevent waste of such a perishable article as offal, a concession has been  made fora period of one week, enabling  restaurants and eating-houses to utilise:  this  offal without requiring coupons from the public.                                      &apos;  -     The standard of  approximately 1. lb. per head in the  London rationing area hasnot.unnaturally created some  dissatisfaction in those areas where the reduction ofconsumption to 50 per cent, of! the October standard brought the figure to much lessthan 1 lb. per head.   It is assumed as a matter of course that if 1 lb. can be providedfor London and  Home Counties other areas are entitled to the same standard.    &apos;  --     There are,  also very  strong  demands  for an addition to  the ration for. those engaged on heavy manual labour,  and the Food Controller has promised that as  soon as  rationing  is1&apos; universal&apos;and the supplies permit&apos; this additional ration shall&apos;be regarded as a first charge on the additional supply.     Some &quot;-difficulties  are being experienced  in connection with the importers of Irish .. cattle.  The special channels of trade which have been established for the conduct of  this business in the past are not proving very amenable to  the  system&apos;cf control which is necessary.   One result is that the  meat  supply in Lancashire at the-present time is deficient, and a number of the large towns are practically dependent upon frozen; meah  rThe reserve stocks, of frozen  meat have not yet reached a figure which\
wo aid-provide any. large, measure of safety as: compared with, the-terms.-of consumptionunder the. rationing, scheme, but North America is still.able to offer,meat very freelyand  the  only obstacle  in  the way  of  getting more ample;.supplies  from the usualsources is the limitation of refrigerated : tonnage.   The killings of, home-grown stockhave not yet increased to the level required for the purposes of the rationing scheme,and  the upward movement of the curve is very slow indeed.  This season of the yearis, however, the one at which the numbers of beasts ready for slaughter are always attheir lowest.                                                    &apos;     The change from the method of selling  cattle and  sheep on a live weight, basisto a dead  weight basis is  being proceeded with gradually,  and has  as  yet beenadopted  only  in  few districts.  It is not  intended that  the dead weight basis shallentirely supersede the present system of grading or estimate of weight, as this appearsto be the more suitable to conditions in some parts of the country.     Oils and Fats.--During the week ending, February 24th the output of home-produced margarine reached  the record  amount of 5,115 tons, 5,077 tons being thelargest amount previously produced in any one  week.  The question of  includingedible oils  for cooking purposes in the  present ration of butter and margarine is beingconsidered.     Sugar. The Food Controller, after consultation with  the Royal Commission onthe  Sugar  Supply, has announced  that,  so far as the  position  can at present beforeseen, it will be possible to allocate  approximately 10,000 tons of sugar during thecoming fruit season to enable private fruit-growers to convert their own fruit into jam,without reducing the issue required to supply fully the jam manufacturers who servethe  bulk of the urban and industrial population.     Tea. The Food Control Committee for Ireland has  fixed the 15th April as theappointed day  under clause 6 of the Tea (Prices) Order, 1918, on and after which themaximum retail price of all tea shall be at a rate of 2s. Sd. a pound.     Food Control Committees in Great Britain have been  advised that a fortnightsextension from the dates named.in the clause may be advisable to avoid hardship toretailers, but that in no case should the postponement be greater than three weeks.     Vegetable Preservation.-Owmg to the  restrictions placed, on the  textile tradesthe  actual  demand for farina is  estimated not to  exceed  25,000 tons.   Arrangementsfor  the  manufacture of this quantity in factories situated  in the  potato-growingdistricts are under consideration.  The consumption of farina in the textile trade willrelease a corresponding quantity of rice and maize.     The policy decided on in regard to setting  up plants for the manufacture ofpotato flour has been settled  on the lines that these plants  shall be  placed  in thecentre of the principal potato-growing districts  rather than in the larger towns, so asto minimise transport difficulties as  it is easier to convey the dried product ratherthan the heavy raw material.  The  delivery of the first units of the  machinery isbeing pressed forward acs fast as possible.     Attention is  being given to  the question of preparing sliced and dried potatoes,and experiments  have resulted in satisfactory products.     Vegetable  Supplies. In  order to assist the  importation  of  Irish  potatoes  intoGreat Britain,  committees have  been formed in Ireland  and in South Wales to carryout  their importation and distribution, and to  prevent  the flow of English potatoesinto South Wales, an Order has been issued forbidding the transport of potatoes fromother areas.   Shipping facilities have been provided for the cross-Channel traffic,  andthe  importation  of potatoes from  Ireland  has  become sufficient  to  enable theirdistribution to be extended to the South-Western counties.                          DISTRIBUTION AND ENFORCEMENT.     Food Control Committees. In the past week sanction has been given to 28 com-mittees to  increase their representation of labour.   The increase  already allowed  hasled  in Lancashire to a better understanding between the committees and labour;  andmuch  good has  followed  the efforts  of  the labour representatives to  explain  thedifficulties with which the  committees  have to contend.     Distribution.-A conference attended by all the Food Commissioners was held onthe  21st to discuss rationing schemes and methods of food distribution.     The London and  Home  Counties Rationing  Scheme has. definitely started, andthere appears to  have been comparatively little-friction  or serious trouble in spite of
the great difficulties experienced in meeting the demands madron the printers for thelarge supply of forms required.         ,  \.       ,     .     The large consumption of food in the Y.M.C.A. and&apos;other  canteens continues toexcite remark.     It is estimated that the total number of persons rationed for butter and margarineunder all the rationing schemes in force now amounts to 27,000,000.     There has been a decided improvement in the  situation as  regards queues, whichhave in many places practically disappeared.  In some towns they are  reported tohave been most noticeable  outside pork  butchers&apos; shops,  and in  Leicester it waafound advisable to close these shops in consequence, and to make over the supplies tomeat butchers and grocers.     The Corporation  of Glasgow are  taking immediate steps to establish two largekitchens.  The interest in this movement appears to be growing.     Enforcement. For the  week ending the  16th February  returns  have  beenreceived of 658 prosecutions in England, Wales, and Scotland,  of  which 577 resultedin convictions.   1     The average fine was SI. 4s. lid.     A  notable  feature is the  increase to 77  in the  number of prosecutions forinfringement of the Orders affecting meat.   There were also  65 prosecutions in con-nection with  the  Butter  Orders, and 52 for Hoarding.   Of these  last, 17  wereunsuccessful.     In. the following cases specially heavy penalties were inflicted.Defendant.	District.	Ofiences.	Penalty.Thos. E. Blair, Wal-lington. Mrs. Chas. Roberts -James Bisset, Wal-lington.

PART  II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD  POSITION.   . The supplies so far as imports are concerned, though lower,  approximate tothe more satisfactory level reached in the previous week.   As will be seen from theensuing paragraphs and Table A. wheat and flour show a considerable  advance, andin this respect February compares favourably with January.  On the other hand,, itmust be pointed out that circumstances have reduced the stock of cereals below whatwas anticipated when  the cereal year began.   Moreover, the full effect of the meatshortage on the consumption of bread remains to be seen.    The meat supply still gives rise to anxiety.   As compared with the same periodin last year, home-fed meat has fallen off  markedly and little  improvement can  beanticipated for some time.  Hence the necessity for reduced consumption, which canbe attained only by  rationing.  With  this  in  prospect  and  with the supplies  ofbutter, margarine, and cheese still  very low, the next two months cannotbut  bedifficult.  On  the other hand, there is an appearance of improvement  in the baconposition, while  in  the  case of  tea  both  stocks  and  supplies   have  increasedconsiderably.                                .                                    IMPORTS.    Aggregate imports of principal foods were 173,270  tons in the  week endingFebruary 23rd  (Table  A);  this total fails to-reach the fairly satisfactory  level of181,000  tons of the week February 10th-16th, but it  is well above  all other weeksthis year.                             &quot; .          .    x  4987-4       &apos; ]                                                      u
 &apos;:   56,400 tons of wheat and 35,100 tons of flour arrived.  To  find so large a weekly-import, we  have to turn, back  to the 2nd week in September when  the  receipt of75,900 tons of wheat and 22,000 tons of&apos; flour  was recorded.   This week&apos;s importsare, however, only equal to the average necessary for the rest of the cereal year, if thereserve of 13  weeks supply is  maintained.  Imports of other cereals were 29,000 tonsbelow the level of  the  previous, week, which included a specially large consignmentof rice.   The imports of oats has again fallen to a very low figure.    Some improvement in imports of meat and a considerable  increase in imports ofbacon, ham, and lard is shown.  Together these amounted  to  24,500  tons, which isabove the average weekly imports  of  the pre-war year 1913, viz.. &quot;23,000 tons.   Therehas. been some increase in margarine and butter.    There is a fall in the imports of sugar while those of tea have improved.                                 CONSUMPTION.    Meat.-Table  B shows a falling off  in  the  supply of home-fed  meat,  nearlycompensated  by an increase in that of foreign meat at  four principal meat markets,when the week ending February 16th is compared with the previous week.    At the Central Market alone the figures for recent weeks are as follows: 	Home-fed Meat.		Foreign Meat.		1917.	1918.	1917.	1918.Week ended :  February 2nd -9th -16th -,, 23rd - - -Total (4 weeks) -	Tons. 2,846 3,315 2,815 2,652	Tons. 1,555 1,711 1,551 1,472	Tons. 4,047 3,311 2,242 2,767	Tons. 1,590 1,741 1,887 2,537	11,628	6,289	12,367	7,755   . The aggregate supply of  home-fed and foreign meat  on these figures is 41 percent, less this year than last.    At the 59 markets  summarised in  Table C  the supply of fat cattle increasedII per cent, and that of fat sheep increased 26 per cent, in the week ended February20th, as compared with the previous week.    As has been pointed put in  previous weeks the markets included in Table C areno longer  typical, especially for comparisons with last year.   Returns on a differentsystem have been received  which make a more  adequate  basis for  comparison, asfollows : Number of Beasts Stalled.	Number of Markets.

The returns from co-operative  stores and multiple shops (supple-mented by returns from eight large London retail firms) of sales in the four weeksJanuary 20th to February 16th, may be summarised as follows :--Sales  (Number of  Tons).

A 4987-40     l^ne totals for margarine  are  difficult to  interpret ior  two reasons:  they atedominated  by the sales  by the Maypole Dairy Company, which were  below  normal ayear ago, and  they include 1,593 tons and 2,588 tons requisitioned from this companyby Local Food Committees or the Government in the four  weeks ended January 19thand February 16th, 1918 respectively, part  of which may have been returned, also byother dealers and so included twice in the totals.   All  that can be said with certaintyis that the sales were larger in the most recent four weeks than in the previous fourweeks, which included Christmas.    Of butter, sales were far lower than in the previous four weeks; as  comparedwith the previous year there was a fall of 72 per. cent.  Bacon, hams, and lard, takentogether, fell off 27 per cent, from the previous  month, and the sales were  less thanone-third of those a year ago.  Cheese showed a slight fall, and the sales  were lessthan half of those in 1917.    Index-numbers affording a  comparison with  previous  months are  given  inTable E.
