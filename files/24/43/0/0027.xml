PROPOSED INCREASE IIf &apos;AIR&quot; FORCE PROGRAMME.                   (Memorandum by Lord Rothermere)       The  Air. Council desires the sanction of the war&apos;Cabinet &quot;to  the addition of 40 squadrons (together.with the necessary training  units)  to  the present approved, programme for the Air Force,  viz.,  200 squadrons.       This addition is in accordance with the recommendations of the  Field Marshal Commanding in  France  which are.analysed in the  attached copy of. a. letter from the  War Office and is intended, to  cover, the  requirements of the British Armies in France up to the  Summer  of  1-919...       Th.ese recommendations  represent a constant figure of 3,428  machines in commission, on the Western Front of which 1,028 are for  .  long ..distahce bombing.       The  Air Council,  while concurring in the Increased programme,  point out;    (l)   That the addition is  based on R.F,C.,requirements only, and          does not include any put forward on behalf of the R.U.A.S.    (2)   That-while the &quot;present -programme., of 200. service squadrons          includes- 34 squadrons to meet eventualities,  this margin          is reduced to 21 squadrons only in the proposed programme.    (3)  That it  is proposed to submit shortly, a programme which         . will-include &apos;all the requirements, of the unified Air          Seivi ce in ail theatres down to. the end of-1919,  but that          preliminary, sanction is urgently needed for the additional          40- squadrons already approved by the Army Council.       The  Air Council desire to add-that they have noted the 8th  paragraph  of. the attached&apos;War Office letter,  but that  as regards  the last sentence of the paragraph  they understand the  situation  to  be that it is for the War Cabinet and not the Army  Council  to  decide  on&apos;  the relative priority in  respect of personnel between the  Air Force  and the infantry.          -   &apos;       The  position as regards Air Force personnel as at the  beginning  of February.1918 was as follows:-                                           Male  &apos;&apos;    Female       .Total establishment..........&apos;.-   158, 250 -   20, 900       Actual., strength-,.................  114, 550    &apos; 7,137Required to complete 200Service Squadrons  ...........    43,700    13,763Increase for 40 additional&apos;Squadrons ... v.....&apos;,......   14,000     4, 500Total  - &apos;   57,700    18,263      The gross requirement of 57,700 men and 18,263 women willbe distributed ever 11 months as follows:-&apos;

ENCLOSURE.                                   WAR OFFICE,                             - .         &amp;iV Board Office,                                           Strand, W.C2                                              9th February,19i8.Sir.         With reference to your letter Ho. 5324/1918,  dated28th January, 1918, I am commanded to acquaint you, for theinformation of the Air Council, that the Army Council  have hadunder consideration the expansion of the Royal Flying  Corps tomeet the requirements of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief,the British Armies in Prance, up to the summer of 1919* as cut-lined in his letter of the 20th November,1917, No .O.B./I826/B!2*       The proposals have obviously been prepared on theassumption that the forces now in France and Italy will remainapproximately as at present, i*e.,20 Corps  and 1 Cavalry Corps.3.       The increase demanded is principally in fighting andbombing squadrons-   The number of... such, units that can beemployed is only limited by the proportion&quot;of the total reservesthat can be devoted to raising and maintaining them, having dueregard to the Vfe&amp;im of other fighting and national services, andby the possibility of providing aerodromes.         In addition, the Commander-in-Chief recommended thatthe establishment of fighting squadrons should be increasedfrom 18 to 24 machines each4.  ,     As you are aware, the present programme in regard tothe expansion of the Royal Plying Corps provides for the forma-tion of 200 service squadrons, together with the necessarytraUding units.   The proposed distribution of these 200squadrons is as follows:-         France and Italy   ...  ...       ...   86 squadrons         Other Theatres     .    *........   40     tt         Long distance bombing  ...  ...  ...   40                                               166         To meet other eventualities ...  ...   3411Total   2005.       The demands of the  Commander-in-Chief  now amount  to113 squadrons for the use  of the  British Armies in Prance  andItaly,  plus 66 squadrons for long distance  bombing operations,against Germany.    The total number of  squadrons required,therefore, is:-         Prance and Italy          (including long  distance bombers)     179 Squadrons         Other Theatres                         40    nTotal   219
6*    Is addition to this increase of 19 squadronsit la considered that at least 21 squadrons should lieprovided for unforeseen eventualities, involving a totaladdition of 40 squadrons to the present approved programmeof 200 squadrons.7.    I am to state that tha Army Council approve of thoprogramme submitted by the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief,especially the increase of fighting squadrons from 18 to 24machines each.      They therefore recommend the provision of an additional40 squadrons, together with the necessa?y training units, tomeat the requirements of this programme.8,    I am to add, however, that the Army Council desire toemphatiae that, while tho provision of the material part oftha demands should be pressed *r,  the supply of the necessarypersonnel should no more thaa keep pace with the output ofequipment, etc., and that tha man-power requirements of theArmy in respeot of the infantry, ae already formulated,should take precedence of those necessitated by the new airprogramme.9.    Tho Army Council assume that, if the Air Ministryooncur in the views expressed above, thoy will obtainthe necessary sanction from the tfar Cabinet.                              I am, Sir,                                  Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   2U H. SHADE.
