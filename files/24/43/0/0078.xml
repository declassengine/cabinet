                         f- 3 -   The Swedish Socialists are also attempting to mediate -in Finland,  with what result is not at present Imown.   Thereis considerable effervescence In extreme socialist Circles allthrough Sweden owing io  the olass-war in Finland and this  isaccentuated  by the  growing difficulties of the food problem.jprobably Bolshevik  ideas have to some extent percolated toSweden owing to the rela- tions between the de facto Governmentat Petrograd and the extremists at Stockholm.   But the Swedein normal times is  peacexul and lawTabiding, and unless the armybecomes contaminated it  is unlikely -that the rumours of possibleinternal disturbances will take any definite form.   The times, howeverare stirring, and revolutionary ideas, as was evident in 1848, arevery catchingj  it  would therefore be incautious to attempt toforetell events in  any European country at present.
