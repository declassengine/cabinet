ACTION  TAKEN.CONTROL  OF  SUPPLIES,  PRICES, AND DISTRIBUTION.    Allied  Requirements. In reply to  cables from the Wheat Export Company atNew York foreshadowing a  shipment of only 700,000  tons in February and a verypoor shipment in March, the  Wheat  Commission have  cabled  that  this would  bedisastrous for the European Allies.  They point out that bread supplies in the UnitedKingdom, France, and Italy depend mainly on shipments from North America ; helpcannot be obtained from any other country except the Argentine,  and even if strikesdo not interfere  with Argentine shipments, arrivals from  that  country will not  beavailable for  consumption in Europe  until May, while shipping directed there forloading in February and March  cannot  be  increased.   They decline  to believe thatthe American Government will  allow  the  whole  of  Allied Europe to be plungedinto  bread  shortage  and distress while  prices are  being discussed;  or  that maizecannot be shipped in  large quantities fit  for admixture with the  loaf;  if such is thecase, the maize should be consumed in America and increased quantities of wheat orother breadstuffs sent to Europe in its place.  The Allies have proved the urgency oftheir needs by the diversion of tonnage to cereal transport  to  such an extent as tocause a serious interruption of importation  for direct war services, and it is essentialthat cereals be provided for shipment, whatever sacrifice of  effort in other directionsmay  be involved.    Mr.  Owen Smith has been instructed in view of the  possibility of a shortage ofbreadstuffs  for shipment to  hurry all other foodstuffs  to the United States seaboard,so that no opportunity should be lost of utilising any tonnage  for which cereals maynot be available.     Steps are being taken by Mr. Owen Smith, in co-operation  with the CanadianFood Controller, to extend the  scope of  the  existing  British Cheese  Commission inCanada into a Dairy Produce Commission to deal with purchases of  cheese, butter,condensed milk, and  any other milk products that may be required.     Mr.  Owen Smith cables that he could probably obtain 12,000 tons of  frozen meatin Canada for prompt shipment if the necessary financial  and tonnage arrangementscan be made.     Arrangements have been made with  the Navy and Army  Canteen  Boards fortheir representatives to join the Ministry of Food Mission in  the United States.     Bacon, Hams, and Lard. Measures have been taken to secure an adequate supplyof bacon for  London and the Home Counties  for the rationing  scheme which comesinto operation on the 25th February, 1918.   A meeting with the leading  representa-tives of the wholesale trade was held at the Home and Foreign Produce Exchange onthe 18th February, 1918, in order to arrange distribution with the greatest efficiencyand economy of transport.     A new Order fixing maximum prices for bacon, hams, and lard is  in preparationunder which  bacon will be retailed without bone at. 2s. 2d. per lb.  It is not intendedto make the Order until the further control now contemplated is exercised in regardto these  commodities produced in the United Kingdom.     A  conference was held with lard refiners on the 19th February, 1918, to  considerthe  proposal to  import refined lard only.   Counter  proposals  were made  by therefiners and these proposals are  now under consideration.     It is proposed to take measures to  avoid the waste involved in the present systemunder which  Ireland both imports and  exports bacon on  a  considerable scale.  It isproposed that Irish requirements should be satisfied from the Irish home production,the surplus :only being exported.  Exports of American bacon from England to Irelandwould then cease.  The matter  has been the subject of official correspondence withthe Irish Office and discussions have taken place with officers  of the Irish Office andmembers of the Food Control Committee for Ireland.

    Butter. A further purchase of 15  tons  of  butter at 46  cents per lb. f.a.s. hasbeen made in the  United States of America, and arrangements have been concludedfor the purchase of 500 tons of Danish butter  at 312s. per cwt. landed ;  the exportableoutput of South African butter has also  been  purchased  at  170s. per cwt. f.o.b.; thequantity will not exceed 2,000 tons.    About 16,300  tons of  butter are now on the water;  225 tons have arrived thisweek from the Argentine and 692 tons from Australia.     Cheese. The  War Office survey of  the stocks of cheese in this country have nowbeen  completed, and the amount available  for the civilian population enables theMinistry of  Food to make  a distribution of half the  amount required for February ;this is now in course of delivery.     Six thousand  one hundred tons of New Zealand cheese is now on the water, ofwhich 5,000 tons is expected before the end of March, and the rest at the beginningof April.  On February  7th, 21,000 tons  was awaiting  shipment in New  Zealand;about 2,500 tons is also held in Australia; 2,000 tons of Canadian old season cheeseare on the water, and 1,360 tons remain to be shipped.     It is hoped  that confirmation will shortly be  received at the Ministry of Food ofthe purchase of  5,000 tons of cheese in the  United States of America through theBritish Commission;  this supply cannot reach this country before March.     No considerable quantity of Dutch cheese will arrive in  the immediate future,but it is expected that after the new season  has  begun  the. shipments will be largerand more regular.     Dried Fruits. Arrangements have been made to substitute Malaga raisins for acargo of sherry consigned to this  country in  a Spanish ship.  The  quantity to  belifted by this ship  will probably be about 1,000 tons, and a further 4,000 tons are saidto be available at Malaga.  Practically the whole Valencia crop of raisins (10,000 tons)has been purchased by the Army Authorities.     The S.S. &quot; Mellore &quot;  has arrived at  Hull  with some 3,000 tons of Indian sultanaspurchased by this  Ministry before Christmas.  Arrangements have been made to storethe sultanas in a bonded  warehouse at that port.     Eggs. The Egg (Restriction) Order, dated February  15th, 1918, prohibits  as from25th inst., the use of eggs in any form for purposes other  than human consumption,except under a licence granted by the Food Controller.  The use of eggs for breedingpurposes is exempted from the provisions of the  Order.     Meat. The arrangements for the distribution of  the supplies of home-producedmeat are now complete and will be put into operation on and after March 2nd ; thequantity  of meat  consumed in each Live  Stock Area  in Great Britain  has beencalculated and an  assessment made of the amount of live  stock each area can provide ;eight of these areas consume more than they  produce and their deficiencies have to besupplied from the  other six areas, which have a surplus, from  Ireland, and from theavailable  supplies of imported meat.   The  arrangements have been  made in everycase with a  view to economy of  transport and the utilisation of the usual tradechannels.   There  is now sufficient meat in store  to meet any immediate deficiency inhome-killed supplies.     Arrangements are being made to substitute a dead weight basis  of  sale for the present system  of the sale of cattle and sheep by estimated live weight;  the chief reasons for this alteration are that  an average  loss  of approximately  SI. per  beast is being incurred owing to inefficient grading, and that the  more  exact system, based on. actual not estimated weights, is a  necessity  to make the compulsory meat  rationing scheme a success.  The  dead  weight  system is the most just to all concerned; the farmer will be paid the exact price  for  every pound  of meat  he  produces  and similarly the butcher will give the exact price for every pound  of meat he buys.  The necessary machinery for the new system is not very complicated.  The auctioneer at a market will be  the purchaser for the Ministry of Food, for which he will receive a fixed commission  of 6s. per head for cattle and 9d. per head for sheep ;  the auctioneer will advance the purchase price, and recover  it from the butcher ; this means a weekly turnover  of approximately l,200,0O0Z. for cattle and 520.000L for sheep ;  the auctioneers will therefore finance the  Government  to  that  extent weekly, and also relieve the Ministry of the necessity of setting up an enormous staff for financial business.     The  larger slaughter-houses will be taken under Government control, but it willnot be necessary to set up additional slaughter-houses,  as about 40 abattoirs used for the Army will be taken  over, as well as many owned by municipalities  and private
    The fourth meeting of the Consumers&apos; Council was held  at  the Ministry of  Foodon 19th  February.  Mr. Clynes presided, and Mr. Beveridge and Captain Tallentsattended on behalf of the Ministry.   At Lord Rhondda&apos;s invitation^ Lady  Selborne,Lord Rathcreedan, and Sir William Ashley have consented to serve on the Council.    In the House of Lords, on 19th  Februar)7, in answer to Viscount Chaplin,  LordRhondda stated that the cost of the Ministry of Food during the month of Decemberlast was  42,0001.  Viewed in  relation to the food consumption of the country, theexpenditure worked out at less than 0&apos; 1 per cent.    The Joint Orders  Committee  of  the Board of Agriculture  and  the Ministry ofFood have held conferences on agricultural questions  in which these departments arejointly interested;  the  position with regard  to  grain and feeding stuffs has  beendiscussed, and in order to restrict the consumption of these by live stock, the CattleFeeding  Stuffs  (Rationing Priority)  Order, and  the Feeding of Live  Stock  (OatsProhibition Emergency) Order have been considered  in draft form and  approved  bythe Committee.                             LOCAL ADMINISTRATION.    The Food Control Committee (Local Distribution)  Amendment  Order, 1918, datedISFebruary 1918, provides that where a Food Committee adopts a scheme under theprincipal Order for controlling within their area.the distribution and consumption ofany article of food, the scheme may,  with the  consent of the Food Controller, includeprovisions relating to the regulation of  retail  sale, restrictions, consumption;, andacquisition, and the production of information and returns, together  with such  other.provisions as  may be thought requisite  for  the purpose of controlling within thedistrict the distribution and consumption of the specified article.    Provision is also made for the application of any such scheme  to  other articlesof food.                         REPRESENTATION ON COMMITTEES.    Applications  from  Food  Control  Committees  for sanction to increase  theirmembership continue to  be  received.  In the past week 19 such applications havetraders.  The total cost  of working will be covered by a flat charge  of  which thefarmer and butcher respectively will pay their fair share.    It should be  observed  that 75s.  per live cwt. is virtually the  highest  priceavailable under the grading  system.  Under  the new method, cattle  which kill  atmore than 36 per cent, will obtain a still better figure,  so that an animal going up to,say 60 per cent., will make 80s. per cwt. live weight.    Milk. The Food Control and - the Local Government Board have issued the Milk[Mothers  and Children)  Order, empowering Local Authorities  to  supply milk  tochildren, and milk and food  to expectant and nursing  mothers, at  cost price  inordinary  cases, and free or at less than  cost price where the women supplied cannotafford  to pay the cost price; certificates authorising applicants to obtain food andmilk will be granted by Medical Officers  of  Health, Medical Officers of Maternity andChild  Welfare Centres, working in co-operation with the local authority, and bypersons empowered by either  of these medical officers, or by  the local  authorityitself.  It will rest with officers empowered by the local authority, and acting undertheir directions, to decide the cases  in which  the milk and food are to be suppliedfree or less than cost price ; the expenses incurred under this Order will be defrayedas to  one half by the local rates, and as to  one half by grant from the Local Govern-ment Board.   Children under 18  months will  obtain  up to 1-1 pints of  milk per day,children from 18 months to 5 years 1 pint per day, and  the  mothers&apos; supplies will beprescribed by the appointed medical and other authority.    Oil Seeds. Priority has  now been  obtained for  the shipment  of  oleo oil  fromSouth  America, but considerable difficulty is still  experienced in obtaining freightfor linseed from the Argentine,  which is urgently required.    Tea. The Tea (Prices) Order, 1918, and the Tea (Distribution) Order  1918, weremade  on  14th February.   The Food  Controller^ Regulations  on the  price  anddistribution of National Control Tea have been issued to the trade.    It is probable that some extra period will have  to be allowed by Food ControlCommittees for the disposal of existing stocks of tea.    Treasury sanction has been refused for the purchase of Java tea, and negotiationsfor the importation of such tea have been suspended.
been granted.  The demand for increased representation  of  labour becomes moreinsistent, and an increase has also been made in some cases to admit of the appoint-ment of women or of co-operative representatives.  A deputation representing  labourorganisations in Plymouth  has objected to the action taken by the City Council ingiving effect to the Food Controller^ sanction to increase the number of members ofthe Local Food  Control  Committees  from 12 to  .15.  It is now  reported that  theCouncil are arranging for a public meeting to discuss the position.    As a result of frequent conferences with labour deputations, two of the Commis-sioners have referred to the very favourable impression made on them by the earnestrepudiation  of the labour  representatives of any desire for preferential treatment.They do not  demand an  undue  share of available supplies, but the assurance of  anequal  share for  all.  They would then to  quote a  colliery representative  from theNorth-Western Division be willing &quot; to carry on  to their last crust.&quot;                               RATIONING SCHEMES.    It may be said, now that every large industrial centre in the United Kingdomhas not only prepared an  approved rationing scheme, but has begun to put it inoperation.   This  has  involved assiduous work,  and  much public spirit has beendisplayed by Food Control  Committees in abandoning local schemes on which  theyhad expended a large amount of time and trouble for the sake  of greater uniformitythroughout the country.  .                                FOOD SUPPLIES.    Fewer complaints have been received in the past week from the general public.    The difficulty experienced  by  railwaymen in obtaining supplies, reported  lastweek,  has been met by  the Railway  Executive Committee,  who have  made  thenecessary arrangements.    The question  of supplies for billeted soldiers has also been settled by the WarOffice  undertaking to provide the necessary supplies,  or in cases where  that is notfeasible, to withdraw the men from the billets.    Complaints of the inadequacy of local supplies to meet the demand  of workersengaged on the construction of aerodromes have been met by the Air Ministry, whichhas undertaken to provide rations for all such workers throughout the country.    A few complaints have been made by Co-operative Societies of  the inadequacy ofthe supplies allowed to them as compared with other  distributing agencies.    Some cases have  occurred of  trading vessels being held up by Avant of meatsupplies.    Amongst private consumers complaints of food shortage have arisen more parti-cularly among workers engaged in heavy manual labour such as  blast furnacemen,quarrymen, and iron-stone workers.  Amongst the Food Control  Committees them-selves  a very general anxiety is expressed lest the satisfactory results of the rationingschemes in  operation should be affected by  any failure of  supplies.  Numerousrequests have been received for  increased stocks  of  supplies, to meet contingencies,such as, for instance, the supply of rations in rural areas where  distribution only takes;place  once a  fortnight.                                    *                                   TRANSPORT.     There is still no further development  to report  since  the  formation  of the new Road  Transport Board under the Board of Trade.                        EXEMPTION FROM  MILITARY SERVICE.     The Ministry, of National  Service have agreed not to  oppose applications for exemption of Grade 3 men engaged in food production and distribution when supported by this Department.                                  SUGAR CARDS.     It is estimated that out of  a total number of 37,472,419  sugar cards issued in. Qreat Britain the number deposited up to the present is 36,888,162.                                    MATERIAL.     The serious shortage of tin-plate is causing  anxiety in trades where wood-pulpcontainers cannot be used.   There has been a considerable  increase in the number ofapplications for all classes pf materials for the packing of foodstuffs.
ENFORCEMENT.    For the week ending the  9th of February 1918 the following statistics have beenreceived for England, Scotland and Wales             Number of prosecutions     -     -     -    -    -   667.

Prosecutions for hoarding continue to increase.  There were in all 81 during thepast week, 68 of which resulted in convictions.    There is a large increase in prosecutions in connection with meat, the total being88, of which 81 resulted in convictions.    For an offence against the Milk (Amendment) Order,  T. Setchfield, of the Fulham -Road, was sentenced to six weeks&apos;  hard labour, while Messrs. Hoobermann and Cohen,of Stepney, were fined 1,000Z. and  50Z. costs for selling butter above the  authorisedprice.                 PART  II.-SUMMARY OF FOOD  POSITION.                                   IMPORTS.    There was a marked improvement in imports last week, and the aggregate weightof principal foods (181,000  tons) is the highest recorded since September  1917.(Table A.)                   .    The increase  over the  previous week is, however, confined to cereals, lard,cheese,  and $tea,  other  commodities having diminished.  Of wheat  and flour  theincrease is 30,800 tons ; an increase in barley balances a fall  in maize ; considerablequantities of oats and of rice arrived  after two nearly blank weeks.  In  all,  theimports of cereals amounted to 129,000 tons, an improvement  of 64,000 tons over theprevious week.    The following table shows the fluctuations in  cereals and in other foods this year.The total for last week is 15 per cent, below the average of the first seven weeks of1917.

Meat. The supply of home-fed meat  at four principal markets was 1 per cent.higher in the week  ending February 9th than in the previous week; foreign meatincreased 9 per cent.  (Table B).   At the Central Market, London, the supply of home-meat fell 9 per cent.,  and that of foreign meat increased 8 per cent, in the subsequentweek  ended February 16th.  At the 59 markets shown in Table C, the supply ofcattle improved 11 per cent, and that of sheep decreased 1 per cent, in the week endedFebruary 13th as compared with the previous week.    A 4987-3                                                               ij
    A better comparison  is  afforded  by the new system  of  returns from which.figures  were quoted  last week, but  they are  not yet sufficiently numerous andcomparable to give precise estimates.  The following tables  show the results : -        Number of Cattle stalled at various Markets in England and Wales.                                                                      Fall.

The index-numbers based  on returns from slaughter-houses in Great Britain(Table D) afford a comparison between January 1918 and January 1917.   The numberof: sheep and lambs slaughtered was the same in the two months,  the number of cattlewas 35 per cent, lower and the number of calves 30 per cent,  higher in January 1918than in January 1917.                                   PRICES.    Since  most  of the wholesale prices  that have been  shown  in former weeklyreports in Table F are fixed, it has been decided to discontinue the table, and only toremark on any changes that are reported.    The Gazette price&apos; of oats rose Is. Qd. to 52s. a quarter  in the week February 3rdto February 9th ;  at the beginning of the year it was 46s. 9d.
