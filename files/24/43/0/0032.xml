Colonel JonesThis Document is the PropertyBritannic Malestv&apos;s Government)Intelligent Bureau Department of Xnforwtlon    G*S,W, /009SECRETWEEKLY  REPOlfe  OXj  S7/EDEN,  IX      (Feb. 25th, 1918)   The situation in Finland, although still obscure, continuesalmost exclusively to occupy public opinion in Stockholm.flhe Conservative Press insists that Finland must be lost if theAnarchists are allowed to win, owing to the refusal of the SwedishGovernment to assist the Finnish Government with war material.Mr- C4.ltr*n, the emissary of the Finnish Government^ In Sweden isreported by the Press to have stated that his Government. In manyimportant places lacks both arms and ammunition and that unlessimmediate assistance is obtained the position is desperate.)This may well be true, and the lack of food mafr be an even moreImportant faotor although the peasantry are as a whole on theGovernment side.   The feeding of an army in northern Finland inthe winter must be a diffioult problem at any time, but food wasshort even before the outbreak of the Civil War, and in presentconditions the problem with which General itonerheim is facedmust be almost insoluble.   The U.S. Minister at Stockholmrecently telegraphed to the State Department at Washingtonreoommending, in view of the disorder in Finland, that the 40,000tons of cereals destined for that country should be held up.In view, however, of the fact that the Finnish Government--controlthe railways In the North and most of the ports on the Gulf ofBothnia he has now suggested that these food-stuffs shouldgradually be forwarded to Narvik there to remain under control ofthe U.S. Legation pending delivery to General-Mannerheim.
                              - 2 -The Finnish Socialists, assisted by the Bolshevik Government, haveinaugurated a reign of Terror all through Southern Finland.   The &apos;Vice-President of the Diet, some Deputies, and numerous privateindividuals have been murdered.   The sailors of the Russian BalticFleet, whose oruelties at Cronstadt and elsewhere are fresh ineveryone&apos;s memory have again shown a total want of disciplineand in company with the &quot;Red Guards,; and the oriminal elements ofthe population are plundering, burning and murdering in all directionsAlthough the Liberal-Socialist Government now in power in Sweden havehitherto declined to interfere in the Civil Qar or to furnish theFinnish Government with arms and ammunition, they have sent reliefexpeditions to the mainland and to the Aland Islands where theRussian garrison, following the example of their masters at Petrojraclare engaged in terrorising the islanders.   It Is reported that anumber of Swedes and Alanders have taken refuge on the Island ofSignildskar, Vfest of the Aland, group.   The Swedish Ministry ofMarine has announced that an icebreaker and the S.&quot;. &quot;Runneberg,:have gone to take off these refugees.  A gun-boat accoi-panierl therelief-expedition.  The Socialists in Sweden have held meetingsprotesting against Swedish intervention in Finland, but recommendingmediation between the rival parties.   They have delegated &apos;r Bohmerto propose Swedish Socialist i-ediation to the Finnish Socialistsand Mr Holier,the Secretary of the Stockholm Socialists, willaccompany him to Helsingfor;i at an early date.   The DanishSocialists have offered to co-operate and Mr Branting has welcomedtheir proposal, but suggests the enquiry into the questions inFinland should be deferred until an armistice has been,  if possible,arranged.   The situation in the Aland Islands is now a very complicatedone.   The Swedish Government have suggested the removal of the
Russian garrison and it would appear that the Russians are inclinedto accept this proposal.   The S.S. &quot;Hcijndal&quot; with a guard onboard has left for the Islands in order, if the negotiations aresuccessful, to take off the Russian soldiery.   Meanwhile adetachment of Finnish Government troops has reached the Islandsand appear to be engaged in intermittent hostilities with theRussian garrison.   The Islanders are stated to resent this newinvasion and have requested the Finnish detachment to withdraw.   The situation on the mainland is at present so uncertain thatit would be premature to attempt to describe it.   Fighting, withvarious results, is proceeding in many directions.   It appears,as in most civil wars, to be ferocious in character, the Red Guardsconstantly murdering their prisoners.   In general all reports fromFinland Bhould at present be reoeived with caution.   It is interesting to watch the change of feeling which istaking place In Sweden.   Russia, the tradional bogey, hasgradually faded from sight, and Germany, which till lately hashad so many admirers, has now been discovered by the ConservativePress to be the real danger.   Even the Liberal &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;admits that German economic supremacy In the Baltic constitutes area3. peril in the future.   The Conservative Press is really in avery delicate position.   After glorifying Germany for the firstthree years of the war it will now be exceedingly difficult toveer round and tell the truth - a truth which is daily impressedon the man In the street.   The German Press - notably the Cologne .Gazette - has recently stated that England is trying to form aunion of the Scandinavian nations and Finland to counteract Germaninfluence in the Baltic,  That this idea should have been reproducedIn the Swedish Press (Stockholms Tidning Feb.4) Is significant.
                           - 4 -This is probably the first intimation that a strong and unitedScandinavia could be favourably regarded by England.    The generaltendency of the Swedish Press has been to suggest that GreatBritain&apos;s efforts are always directed towards frustratingScandinavian unity.    On the whole the present would seem to he agood moment for a great effort to push British propaganda.   TheGorman peril, which will probably take the form of a revival,more or less open, of the Hanseatic League, is a very real one,and there is every sign that there is a turn in public opinion inSweden.   In Denmark the German danger has long been realisedwhile in Norway the U-Boat outrages have br^rught-the--war home toevery finking hamlet in the country.
