US document is tne property ^&quot;TlXs-3*iteumixuife^Decypher off telegram received in,Irish Office, 11.88 a.m.27th February 1918., from Chief Secretary, Dublin Castle.&quot;Secretary,      War Cahinet.The necessity to remove lawbreakers from Ireland may becomeimperative.  In view of this fact the means must be arrangedbeforehand and must exclude possibility of easy evasion.  Thetwo possible courses are.- One, that of internment; the other,that of deportation after order under Defence of Realm Hegula-tions to reside elsewhere.  As to internment, Eome Office isnot ready to concur except on strict proof of association ofindividuals with foreign enemy.  Proof Qf association oforganization exists.  As to deportation after order of removalit is worthless and mischievous if enforcement cannot beensured.  Returned deportees are lionised, and as lawbreakerswill command general admiration, the possible modes of enforcement are either to limit residence of a deportee to an islandsuch as Isle of Man, or southern Scottish islands, or perhapsIsle cf Wight, or to limit cr^ss-channel passages from GreatBritain to persons identified by a permit or passport.C  R 3 T.WARCABINET.. 3751.REMOVAL OF SIM ESIK3RS FROM IKSLAJ8D.DUES&quot;.B Whitehall Gardens,  3.vv\,February 27th. 1918.
