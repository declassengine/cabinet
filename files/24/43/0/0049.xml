(THIS - DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY ^ HT^BJ^TAMIC JJIA JES^S GOVSRIWSHT)       q qgtogSIQI^INTERMTIDIALS DE MVITMLLEMEIjT.  \T    (Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction).d3S^^^ I desire to draw attention to C-.T.3430,  in which it  is     suggested that the British Executive  Staff  of the  C.I.K.  should be     made responsible to the Foreign Office,   It  is stated that  the     Director of tho C.I.Ro combines throe functions&apos;, namely:-     (A)   Agent or Advocate of the Allies 111  regard to  assistance           required from H.M,Government.     (B)   The mouth-piece of H.Mo Government in  expressing their           views and decisions on the supply of  materials  under           their control.     (C)   Repository of all information,  and  therefore, to a  certain           extent, Advisor of II,M&apos;.Government regarding Allied           requirements.          I am doubtful whether the C.I.R. should  be recognised     as  combining all the-se functions.  &apos;;&apos; That  organisation was, I     beliovc, intended to be, and should in my judgment  continue  to be,     a clearing house of the Allies1 war orders.    It should act  as     a liaison between the Supply and Finance.  Departments  of the     Allies and the Supply and Finance Departments of H.II.government     in  respect of war supplies.   -Ve should look  to it  to furnish     information, but not necessarily to advise; and still less should     the function of the C-I.R, be to press the  claims  of  the  Allies     as  their advocate, possibly to the detriment  of our own     requirements.          To place this organisation under the Foreign  Office  would     undoubtedly accentuate the tendency of the  0,1.R.  to  become  merely     the advocate of the requirements of the Allies, and I am  very     doubtful as to the desirability of this.          The Government ought I think to  be left  free to  decide  on     the advice of their responsible Supply Departments, and the     functions of the C.I.R, should be neutral.          For these reasons X should doprccato disturbing  the  present     arrangement under which the C.I.R, is loosely attached to the     Board of Trade.                                         Christopher Addison.                                               26th February 1913.
