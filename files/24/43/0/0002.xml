tem-BOcmrarcsL.mjf*omir-oF jra SRITAHNIC MAJESTIC GOVERMMBOT)SB CRBIg.    3702               WAR   CABINET                  NEED FOR INTELLIGENCE! DEPARTMENT Of  emprandum by the Minister of Information    In reorganising the Ministry of Information the first need is acompetently staffed Intelligence Department.  Without such a depart-ment the work of propaganda at home and abroad  is impossible, for itmust lack direction and material.    I understand that it was originally arranged that the Intelligencebranch of the former Department of Information  should be transferredto the Foreign Office,   I think this arrangement must be cancelled,for, as my duties cover both foreign and home propaganda, the col-leotion of intelligence must cover ft much wider area than that whichwould be dealt with by a Foreign Office department.   I suggest,therefore, that the only possible arrangement is that the Intelligencebranch should belong to my Ministry and should  be made the nucleus ofa much larger organisation for all political intelligence.    To organise this department properly we must coma to an understand-iag with the Intelligence branches of the Admiralty and the War Offiuoand of the various Civilian Sovernnent Departments.   By the courtesyof the Foreign Office all official telegrams and despatches wereavailable for the old Department of Information, and I trust thatthese facilities may be continued to the new Ministry.   These, however,do not cover the wbple ground, and with regard  to other departmentsI desire to submit to the War Cabinet the following proposal.    1.  All items of political information collected by the Admiraltyand War Office Intelligence branches should be  transmitted to myIntelligence Department.   As it may be difficult for the Admiraltyand War Offioe to meet exactly the requirements of this Ministry un-less they have special assistance, I would ask  that an officer ofsenior rank should be attached for the purpose  to the Intelligencestaffs of the Admiralty and War Office.   He would be the representa-tive of the Ministry of Information, and it would be his duty to seethat all political intelligence material was forwarded to it.                                                        %    2.  Some arrangement must be come to as to  the work of &quot;the SecretService.   I understand that the Secret Service is nominally underthe direction of the Foreign Office, who provide the funds for it;but that during the war it is in practice directed^he D.M.I. and theD.I.D.   It is admitted, however that the weakest side of the SecretServioe is its political side, and I think it a matter of great ur-gency at this period of the war to strengthen its work in this dir-ection,   I would ask, therefore, that, following the practice ofthe Admiralty and the War Office, a liaison officer of this Ministryshould be attaohed to the staff of the Secret Servioe, and that itshould be his business to arrange for the forwarding of all politicalinformation tc this Ministry, and to arrange for any necessary kcten-sion in political work.   I understand that political informationderived from this channel is in theory sent at  present to the ForeignOffice.   In that case a duplicate of all such  pepers should come tothis Ministry.   But frequently valuable political information may be
lost sight of because It haapeat te fee labelled I&amp;val or Militaryand is therefore not sent to the Department which can make properuse of it.   A liaison officer suoh as I suggest would preventthis loss of valuable material.    3.  With regard to home intelligence, I understand that valu-able reports on the Labour situation, on the growth of pacificism,etc., aro compiled by the Ministry of Labour, the Home Office andScotland Yard.   I would suggest that the material on which thesereports are based should ba put at the disposal of the IntelligenceDepartment of my Ministry, as, without a full knowledge of every  /change in the homo situation, a serious campaign of home propagan&amp;&amp;is impossible.    4.  As I conceive it, the functions of an Intelligence Depart-ment suoh as I havs outlined would not be confined merely to aoquir-ing the requisite knowledge for efficient propaganda at home andabroad.   It should include, as was the case in the former Depart-ment of Information, the issuing of reports on political matters tothe War Cabinet and the other Departments of Stats.   I would sug-gest that these reports be given a wider circulation, for the pol-itical problems which will oonfront us towards the end of the warwill have ramifications covering the work of almost every Ministry.2Por example,&apos; the Ministry of Labour would be much assisted in itswork if it received full details from the Ministry of Information ofthe Labour situation in enemy, neutral and Allied countries.    By Political Intelligence I mean all matters referring to socialand political movements and fluctuations of opinion.    I  exclude sucieconomio and commercial intelligence as is already provided for bythe War $rade Intelligence Department and the Department  of Overseas(Trade.                                        (Signed)   Beaverbrook.Ministry of Information.  20th February 1916.
