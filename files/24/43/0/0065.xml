1 --the  Property ofGovernment,)STRICTLY   PRIVATE  AND  COIMFlDENTi ALT/ /The:   Submarine:  Menace.     A review of the experience gained under the working of the Convoy System during the past six months emphasises the following points :      1.  In the Statement prepared by the Association on the 17th July, 1917 (copies of which were at the time placed before the War  Cabinet, the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller), it was insisted that :          &quot; There must he provided reasonable safety throughout the main approach routes, i.e, &apos;.          (A) From the entrance of the Channel to London.         (B) From Fastnet to Liverpool or Bristol Channel Ports.         (c) From Tory Island to Liverpool or Glasgow.         (D) From London up the East Coast.&quot; The Convoy System has helped, but the reasonable security asked for on these routes has not been provided, owing, it is understood, mainly to the Admiralty not having the necessary number of light ships for escort and patrol duties.     The enemy  submarine attack, without warning,  on British  shipping was started in February, 1915, and has continued ever since.     In September, 1916, the  Board of Trade increased the War Risk Insurance Rates by 30 per cent., and gave as its justification the information the Government then had in its possession as to the probable  increase in the severity of the submarine campaign.     In February, 1917, the unrestricted submarine campaign was started.     The Association has no information as to the number of light craft built by the Admiralty since the opening of the war, and more particularly since the enemy showed his determination to make the utmost possible  use of his submarines ; but it does know that the Admiralty has had at its disposal the shipbuilding facilities  of the country since the day war was declared.     If even now the necessary protection cannot  be provided owing to the continuing want of vessels of suitable type, the Association asks to  be assured that steps are now in fact being taken to make good the deficiency.     The warnings given by the Admiralty that the risks incident to the voyage to and from London are four times as great as those incident to and from a West Coast port, and the efforts that are being made to concentrate voyages on the West Coast ports, indicate a failure to grasp the perils of the situation.  Neither London, nor the population living on the eastern side of Great Britain, can be  fed or supplied through the  West Coast ports, and if the risks of the voyage to  the East Coast ports are in fact  four times as great, they must be met bypioviding four times the protection.
    In the opinion of the Association neither effort, ships, men, nor money must be sparedin protecting these  routes.  The  Air Services  should be  used to the  utmost.  Theirsafeguarding is of far greater importance to  the Nation  than  even the  protection ofLondon against Air Eaids.   If the vital points on the routes,  or if the ships whilst  onsuch routes, could be protected by a barrage  of  depth  bombs, as  London  is protectedagainst Air Raids, the submarine  should be driven from the narrow waters.   In the opensea the Convoy System should secure reasonable protection.    2.  The necessity  (pointed out by the Association in July, 1917) for  grouping thevessels to be convoyed according to speed, has been emphasized.  A  deplorable waste ofcarrying power and actual destruction of tonnage, has resulted through vessels of speedsvarying from 8 to 13 knots sea-going speed being included in the same convoy.    The Convoy System in so far as of necessity it throws the ships into the ports in groups,and the attempt that has been made to force East Coast cargoes throughWest Coast ports,have led to further loss of carrying power, as the ports used and the railway facilities fromthese ports have, as the rushes came, been blocked.    The following table shows the average  length of time occupied by a 10J knot carrgocarrier on the round voyage under (1) Peace conditions, (2) in the Autumn of 1916 underWar conditions, and (3) in the Autumn of 1917 under Convoy.

Forexample, the following statement shows the shortest and longest time occupied on a roundvoyage, in the New York Trade, by a vessel of 18 knots : Under Peace Conditions.	Under War Conditions, 1916.	Under Convoy, 1917.Shortest .. 27 days. Longest .. 34 days	35 days 52 days	36 days 52 days    It would appear that the following is the most effective grouping of vessels, at all events,for those engaged on the North Atlantic Trade :             Under 10 knots seagoing speed.            From 10 to 12 knots            Over 12    It is hoped that the North Atlantic Convoy Committee appointed by the Association,and which is acting with the full approval of the Admiralty and of the Shipping Controller,will succeed  in bringing about a better grouping of the ships, and better despatch in theports.
     4.  In July, 1917, tne Association pointed out the necessity for placing the relations between the officers of the Royal Navy and of the Merchant Service on a better footing. Something has been done, but there is still much to be done before really effective co-opera- tion will be secured.     It is of the first importance that the officer in charge of the escorting cruiser should be entitled to the full confidence of masters of the vessels forming the convoy.  In the North Atlantic convoys it is important that the  cruiser Captains should have knowledge of the North Atlantic.     The practice under which the officer in charge of the escorting cruiser meets in confer- ence, before the voyage is started, the Masters of the vessels which are to form the Convoy, is an excellent one.   But the success of these conferences depends in great measure on the spirit  in which both sides are ready to both give and receive information.  Both sides are becoming  more accustomed to the work and to one another, but there is a strong feeling amongst many of the officers of the Mercantile Marine that the conditions under which they have to navigate their ships are not taken into account by, or even known to, the Captain of the escorting  cruiser.  Owing to the war the number of officers available  for  watch- keeping duties are hrnited, the number of Engineers are limited, there are constant difficulties in providing satisfactory crews, there are constant difficulties in getting good coal, and the vessels are being loaded with a view to their bringing in the maximum of dead weight cargo and with little regard to the season of the year.  AH these factors make the duties of the Masters of the convoyed vessels exceedingly arduous.     If the Captains of all the escorting cruisers would, as some of them now do, endeavour to understand,  and to  allow  for  the  actual  conditions on each of  the  vessels they are convoying, much would be done.     On the other hand, there is urgent necessity for the Masters of the convoyed  vessels putting at the disposal of  the cruiser Captain, with the utmost frankness, the conditions on board their vessels.     At the present time, the two sides in too many instances do not understand one another. They seem to deal with one another at arm&apos;s length, instead ol putting their experiences and knowledge into the common stock.     If conferences could be held at the close, as well as at the start,  of the  voyage, it is thought that both the cruiser Captain and the Masters of the convoyed vessel would benefit from the experience gained on the voyage.  The difficulties encountered and the successes attained on the voyage could be reviewed, and both sides would be better prepared to benefit from the conference which preceded the next voyage.     In the opinion of the Association the Admiralty cannot keep itself in touch with the essentials of the Convoy System by merely sending for the officers of particular vessels,  which have met with disaster to attend to be examined in Whitehall.  There  must  be  a free exchange of experiences and opinions between those responsible for the protective force and those responsible  for the navigation of the convoyed vessels, and this can only be obtained ill the  principal ports to which the convoyed vessels are sent.  The experience gained in avoiding disaster is often of far greater value than that gained from disaster.  It is not only a few selected Masters who should be examined, every Master of the incoming ships should be seen by Officers in whom the Admiralty have absolute reliance, and Avho are able to  speak with full authority.    These  conferences should not be held on the day on which the  convoy arrives ; themen should be allowed, first, a reasonable rest.   If the cruiser proceeds to a  port other thanthat to which the majority of the convoyed vessels are sent, it should be an easier matter
to arrange for the cruiser Captain making a  journey to the port where the majority of thevessels are, than to arrange for the Masters of all those vessels going to Whitehall or to wherethe cruiser is lying.    The &quot; Chatham Courses &quot; have continued to work admirably,  and are an instance ofwhat can be done by the Royal Navy when once they have gained the full confidence of theofficers of the Merchant Service.    5.  The review of the experiences of the Convoy System raises the following points ofdetail:      (A) NAVIGATION IN NARROW WATERS.  Experience has  shown  that  in the narrow-        waters the  Convoy System is not an effective protection against very serious risk,        e.g., vessels going through the North Channel in Convoy formation must afford a        very easy mark to any submarine that has taken up  position in those waters.        The general opinion of the officers of the Mercantile Service would appear to be in        favour of breaking up the convoy, and of each vessel proceeding to its port at its        best speed, if submarines are encountered on the routes referred to in paragraph 1        of this Report, always on the assumption that these routes  are made reasonably        secure.   To attain such security the Air Services should be fully used.             In such event, and on such routes, the full strength of the firemen on board        can be employed to get the ship in at the highest possible speed.     (B) SALVAGE ASSISTANCE.  The provision now made for dealing with damaged vessels        is entirely inadequate.   Powerful tugs and salvage plant should be kept available,        at all times, at convenient centres on each of the routes referred to in paragraph 1        of this Report.  Such provision is needed, both to save the ships and to give con-        fidence to the crews whilst on the routes.     (c) ZIG-SAGGING.  The officers of  the Merchant Service have the greatest confidence        in this precaution.   The general opinion would appear to be that the more varia-        tions are introduced, the better.             Great importance is attached to strict observance of time when zig-zagging in        convoy formation, and it is suggested that in every convoy the cruiser Captain        should satisfy himself that there is a uniform time on board all vessels forming the         convoy.     (D) PAINTING.   The disadvantages of &quot; fancy painting &quot; should be weighed against        the advantages.  The use  of  white patches is strongly objected to.  Battleship        grey is considered the best colour for night work.     (E) STATIONS.  Great importance is attached by the officers of the Merchant  Service        to the keeping of stations in convoy.  There are many difficulties to  be overcome,        incident  to the conditions under which the vessels have to  be  sailed.  It would        help if the officers in charge were assured that they would not be held responsible        by their owners for collision which resulted from their efforts to keep  station.    (F) SIGNALLING.  The  practice  in  different convoys varies greatly.  In some  the        signalling is reduced  to a minimum without affecting the handling of the convoy.        In others signalling is used very freely.            The opinion of the officers of the Mercantile Marine is most strongly against all        avoidable signalling, both by day and night.  It occupies the time of men who can        be far better employed on watch-keeping duties.  At night  it gives information to        the submarines.
(G) SHORE LIGHTS.   This is a point which has already been raised by the Association.    The officers of the Merchant Service are most strongly of opinion that the risks are    greatly increased through their having to pass across the rays of shore lights thrown    on the water.  They urge that the lights (as in some French lights) should be thrown    upwards, and not on to the sea.        They further urge that some of the Lights should not be shown, except possibly    in foggy or misty weather.  For example, the Mull of Cantyre and the Altacarry    Lights afford the submarines fixed points on which to work the first might be    dispensed with and the second reduced.(H) FORMATION.   It is noted that the formation adopted varies a great deal between    Convoy and  Convoy.  The Association assume that  the question of the  most    effective grouping of the convoyed vessels, is carefully studied by the Admiralty    in the fight of experience gained.  Some of the formations adopted would appear    to offer a number of targets to a single torpedo.(i)  HIGH STERN  LIGHT.  Some of the Officers of the Merchant Service are of opinion    that the high  stern light used for Convoy purposes is a danger, as indicating to the    submarines the position of the Convoy.   It has been suggested that the fight should    be a blue light.   The advantages of the light for station keeping purposes is recog-    nised.   The Association assume that the Admiralty have weighed the disadvan-    tages as against the advantages.2UI FEBRUARY,  1918.
