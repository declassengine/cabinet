S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIg; HAJBSTYlS GQTi&amp;maf T,ORE?.  3703WARC. A B I HE T.            HOME  PROPAGANDA.Memorandum by the Minister of Bif on-iation.   I think it tt^por^iVm tho.t there  should  be- some definitionof my duties wl^nTegarcC&apos;to &quot;Home-Propaganda,    I would likef toask whether this work, which was under  the  general supervisionof Sir Edward Carsan,  is now included  in the scope of-theMinistry of Information,   So far as I  can judge,  the machinery for  Hone Propagandaconsists of the YJaz? Aims  Committee,, which settles- policy,  and,under it, an organisation for arranging meetings under Mr,Wallace Carter, aid a  Bureau for Press work  under Mra  GerardFiennes,   I see great difficulties  in  bringing a Committeecomposed of representatives of two political  parties  under  aGovernment Department,  and on this  matter  I  should like theruling of the   War  Cabinet,   I take it that the work of HomePropaganda,  whoever is put in charge of it,   requires aParliamentary vote.   Assuming that Home Propaganda is  part of my province, thereis another matter on which I wish a  decision.    I understandthat various  Government Deportments, such as  the Ministry ofFood and the Ministry of National  Service, have their ownPropaganda bureaus.   I am strongly  of  opinion that money wouldbe saved and efficiency increased if these were brought  underthe Ministry of Information^   Any Department which desiredspecial propaganda could apply to the&quot; Ministry,   which wouldarrange a plan  of campaign, and, with the assistance of  thatDepartment, provide material.  Unless some  such arrangement  ismade I can foresee a good deal of over-lapping,  especially inthe appeals made to the British press and the  British  Cinematrade, and a considerable waste of money,   I may mention thatso far as  Cinematograph work goes this co-ordination  has alreadybeen achieved,  and the  Cinematograph branch of  the Ministry                        *,nfrn1 HAfl &quot;hrr  t.V*A tra wT nna T\ar-a -wfmerit o  ameen achieved,  and the  Cinematograph branch of the Ministiof Information is now recognised by the various Departmentsthe proper machinery for all official propaganda by film.asnlstry of Information.&quot;-a2&quot; February, IdI5tfSgd)  BEAVERBROOK.
