&apos;This Document is the Property of55His Britannic Iv1ajesty&apos;s Government)Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information,SECRET.PIW/027.WEEKLY  REPORT  OJ  ITALY.  XXVII.(Feb.  22nd,  1918)   The movement set on foot originally by the Corriere della Serain favour of Italian solidarity with the insurgent subject-raw ofAustria-Hungary,  as a means (1) of attacking Austria from within and(2) of proving to the Western Allies that no half-measures can tsro-duce a lasting settlement,  continues to make remarkable progress inItalian public ooinion   \s regards the first part of the Coipriere&apos;s thesis there is nowsomething approaching unanimity,  though the motives for and the sin-cerity of its acceptance vary according to the attitude of thedifferent grouos rewards the second half of the thesis.   The groups represented by suoh papers as the Corriere della Bera ,the Seoolp,  and L^Unita - are, it should be remembered, those whichhave from the beginning been most sincerely in acoord with the demo-cratic principles of the Western peoples and which have just succeeded.after a difficult and courageous struggle with a ceraolex of adverseforces, in securing the triumph of these principles in their owncountry.   If these grouns were specially perturbed by the referencesmade to Italy and Austria in Kr,  Lloyd George&apos;s and President Wilson&apos;sNew Year speeches,  that is because the interpretation out uoon theformulae employed seamed to them to threaten with destruction notonly their own party as a force in Italian politics but the whole futureposition of Italy among the democratic nations.   Italy, they rightly or wrongly sunoosed, was to be asked to renounce not only Dalmatia but Pola and Western Istrla as well.   Againstthe former claim they have throughout protested in the teeth of violent
                             - 2 -attaoks from the Chauvinists;   hut the possession of Pola is regardedby all informed Italians as-absolutely indispensable to Italy1 ssecurity 4n the Adriatic.    If Italy comes out Of the war, they argue,without Western   Istyia,  we shall be held responsible for havingplunged our country into war and imposed upon it untold sacrificesfor something less than the &apos;pareo6hlQ.f *   We shall have to accept aGiolittian rigime under which Italy will be led back humbled and withan undying grudge against  the Western Powers into dependence on theCentral Empires.   With this prospect before them they naturally em-brace with enthusiasm and  with entirety the only policy which seems toto ooen a way of salvation.   The journals which are  held to reflect the views of the Consultanow do at least fcip-servioe to the theme of an Italo^ijiffv Entente,butstiil stick to the letter  of Italy&apos;s rights as guaranteed by the Treatyof April 1915, and will not hear of modifications or renunciations.These may come later, when a complete understanding has been reached,towards which it is for the Slavs to take the first step and to provetbsir sincerity in acts.   In this attitude, they are supported withquestionable sincerity by  ex-neutralist journals suspected of astrictly limited hostility to the Central Empires,   The weak plaoe in this  line of argument is obvious.   Completeunderstanding with the Jugoslavs can only be reached by renunciationof those claims which obviously run counter to the facts of popula-tion.   The end is willed, but the means to the end are rejected.Baron Sonnino is accordingly suspected of insincerity, of playingfor safety and of being hopelessly imprisoned in the circle of ideasof &quot;the old diplomacy&quot;, and an ememy of democracy.   The ConsultaTs opposition to the second half of the thesis - &quot;thedelenda Austria&quot; - is defended on the ground of Italy1s weakenedposition in the Alliance since the disaster of Caporetto,    The at-tempt to bring the Allies  over to the 1 dismemberment&apos;  ooint of viewwould create difficulties.
   That Signer Orlando favours at any rate the first pert of theCorriere&apos;3 plan is fairly inferred from the expressions he used inhis speech in the Chamber on Beb. 12th.   But he went:ho further than sympathy With the oppressed raced andgave no definite indication of his attitude either towards the  re-nunciation of Dalmatia or towards the  &quot;dismemberment&apos; polioy.   ItIs probable however that he is in sympathy with both, but isrestrained from making any open pronouncement by unwillingness toprecipitate a breaoh with Sonnino and perhaps of creating difficul-ties with Allied Governments.   The editor of the Tribuna stated ohFeb. 5th that he had reason to believe that the Italian - &quot;delendaest Aastria&quot;- standpoint had been accepted by the Allies in Conference,This was contradicted by the Deputy Signor Bevione of the Gaszettadel popolo, who is in close touch with the Giornaie and the Consult      Cn Feb. 13th the same Signor Bevione made a speeoh in theChamber in which he upheld the Consulta&apos;s point of view in regardto Austria-Hungary and definitely advocated a federal solution of thenationalities problem saying that this was the solution which foundfavour with the Czeohs - a statement which,  os the Corriere  pointed        in                                         - &apos;out, is/flagrant contradiction with the resolutions suppressed by theAustrian censor but kno&apos;,vn to have been adopted by the Czech &quot;Con-stituent Assembly&quot; early in January of  this year.   Signor 3evionesurprised the Chamber by reading .;loud the text Of various secretdocuments publiahed in  Petrograd,  including the Secret^Treaty ofApril 26th 1915, which though long since known fco the world has beenwithheld, from publication in Italy by the Censorship.    It marreasonably be suspected that Signor,Bevione,  who is  Liberal  in ten-dency, was chosen to exoound the foreign Office view as having forsome tire past advocated an I*&amp;lo-Slav entente,  ?.;nd so likely toconciliate opposition ^nd that the publishing of the Treaty xk-b notdone without the cognizance of Baron Sonnino.    The incident  may
therefore represent a certain unbending on the part oi the ForeignMinister - whose oosition in the Government is likely to he assailedfrom the &quot;Neutralist1 side,  ostensibly on the ground that he has weak-ly allowed ltalyrs claims to be curtailed, really beoause he is thedeadly enemy of Oiolitti;  by the Interventionist Democrats as main-taining a oolicy which they regard as fatal to Italy&apos;s future.   It is not,  however, do much a matter of attacks from this Aide orthat as of deep-seated incompatibility with the democratic pilicy andtemper of the present Government,   Practically theie are now onlythree parties in the Chamber - the Neutralist&apos; Parliamentary Union -which after the defeat it suffered in December is not likely to riskanother offensive at present, the league of National Pefenoe, oomoris-ing Interventionists from all groups, and the Official Socialists,who seem inclined to make the best of aJGovernment which is obviouslysincere in its efforts to establish national concord.   The absence ofany denunciation of &apos;traitorsT and defeatists&apos; and indeed of allreference to internal differences In Signor Orlando&apos;s speech in theChamber is noted with satisfaction by the party organ, Avantl;  andit is clear that the Chauvinist press no longer enjoys the orivilegedposition w ich it held until the other day.   It seems hardly nessiblethat, in view of the oresent teener of the Chamber and of the leadingmembers of the Oovernment,  so inflexible a character as Baron Sonninoshould long remain at the foreign Office.   Koreover the publicationof the text of the 1915 Treaty makes sufficientl  glaring thefundamental weakness in Italy&apos;a war-policy.   The great mistake madeby 3alandre&apos;s Government, as is pointed out by L15ooca in commentingon the Bevione incident,  was that it failed to see that the terms ofthe Treaty corrcnitted Italy to an offensive oclicy with regard ttAustria, who could not ^ossibly sit do**n under exclusion from theAdriatic.   Instead they;professed a defensive ooliey of &apos;no dismem-berment&apos; and were.so intention making-Italy&apos;a&apos; defensive position on
the Adriatic completely secure that they ignored the natural rightsof the Slavs and so antagonised their natural Allies.   Sonnino is held responsible for the action of the Censorship&apos; inrefusing all publicity to anything which might tend to show theJugoslavs in a favourable light or counter the wholesale imputationsof &quot;Austrafilla&quot; brought against them by the Nationalist andneutralist press end $sr the indignities to which H. Trumbio and M. Supilo were subjected by the police when they came to Rome to prt-mote an Lfcalo-Slav friendship.   The rather lengthy and confused reply given by Baron Sonnino inthe Chamber on ?eb, 16th to a Question regarding Article 15 of theLondon Treaty does not seem to have given much satisfaction to theVatican.   He said that the text,  read by Signer Bevione, had beenaltered;  but he did not give the correct version, merely denyingthat the existance of the clause had influenced the Allies in thequestion of their reply to the  Papajb Note and asserting that he hadalways been most careful to safeguard not, tnly the letter but thespirit of the Law of Guarantees.   No internationalisation, he added,could have given more effective protection to the rights and libertiesof the Papacy, than tto Law as guaranteed by the National Governmentof Ital .   The correct text of the clause in question (as appears &apos;from the answer given by Lord Robert Cecil in the House of jScmmoncon ?eb, 14th) was to the effect that if Italy objected to tho ?opesending ?: representative to the Peaoe Conference, t e &quot;Hies wouldsupport that objection.   Although there have been one o. two violent altercations in theChamber between the Official Socialists and the League of NationalDefence, a tendency is observable towards a sort of truce.    Thisfound definite expression at the end of Signer Bevione&apos;s speech onthe 13th, who went so far as to say that most of president  \&apos;ilson?sneace formulae &apos;-ere &apos;cure Zimmerwuld1 (i.c.  identical with  thoseadopted at the.International Socialist Congress held.at that place
 in 1916).   The olive branch thus held out seems to have been accepted by at least the right wing of the Official Socialist party, between whom and the extreme Revolutionary section (represented by Lazzari, the Secretary of the ;Pc.rty and Serrati, editor&quot;of Avantl) there  is a gradually widening breach.   As the right wing of the group con- tains some of the ablest speakers  and thinkers in the Italian Chamber this is so much to the good from- a parliamentary point of view.   It would be a misfortune for Italy if these men had been alienated permanently and excluded from all National&apos; oolitics, in which they are likely to play a useful part.   From this point of view it is well that If.  Clemenceau&apos;s objection to the granting i of oassoorts to the Official Socialists delegated to attend the International Allied Conference in London has been overcome.   The refusal, if maintained,  would have had the effect of checking the movement towards conciliation.    We gather that Baron Sonnino was by no means in favour of granting passoorts.   /:  detailed occnunt (summarised in the Konring post  of Feb. ISth)was lately sent to the Corrlere della Sera by its War Correspondent Banzini of the leaflets  which are being dropped from aeroplanes among the Italian troops at the front - crude but perhaps not altogether ineffective attempts to  sow distrust and jealousy;  the Italian soldiers are told that &quot;the oacifist demonstrations of their wivesand children are drowned in a sea of blood by British and French troons&quot;;  t--at the British in their brutality set fire to Salonika and will in like manner  -set fire to Ililan and Turin;   that British soldiers have come to Italy for a rest-cure.    On the cover of one oamphlet a British &quot;To Tiy&quot; is nictured in the act of bayoneting awoman who kneels on r. mac of Italy at the olece occupied by ITilan.While a British officer  is seated,  revolver in h,.hd,  u^on Rome,which is labelled &quot;kommandatura Inglesji&quot;.
J.         &apos;                             -7s   The deficiency af coal  is still heing very acutely felt in Italy -especially in the smaller  towns.-   Lignite,  charcoal and wood are beiugemployed as substitutes1 wherever it is possible with consequentlimitation and disorganisation of industries.   Lignite is being;extracted in larger quantities than formerly, but charcoal - theordinary fuel of the Italian kitchen - is sossoe owing to lacklabour In the country caused by the demands  of the army and ofagriculture.   But as regards demoralising effect on tho population and on thepoorer classes in particular the shortage of grain is even isore soriensand  erasing.   Imports of other food-stuffs havigg been severely outdown,  the p^or,  of whaoe diet cereals at all times form a large pro-portion,  are the less able to endure the deprivation.   Several oausefhave contributed to the deficiency?   Owing, it is 3aid, to an exag-geruted estimate of the Italian harvest of 1917, Italyfs requirementsfrom abroad were-understated.   The loss of army stores during the re-*treat has had to.be made good from oivilian supplies.   Lack of fuelhas produced groat disorganisation of transport, while Italy suffersmore severely from shipping losses by submarines owing to her greaterdistance from the sources  of supoly.   Italians feel that their destiny hangs on the amount the Alliescan give her in supplying  these needs.   The official communiques regarding Signor Crespirs activities inLondon and Pari3 are reassuring intone but too vague to do much torelieve the tension.
