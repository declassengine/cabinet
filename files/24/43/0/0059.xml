Received 2.55 p.m.   25/2/18,     1694.          Captain Macgrath who  has  just  returned from  Siberia  reports  as     follows               present  state  of affairs  in  Siberia.          The  Bolshevik   power  is confined  to  the railway line; up  to  the     present in the  villages  very little headway has been made.   Owing     to non-fulfilment  of land  ? divisions  the Bolsheviks are  distrusted     by the peasant,  who  is also fearful of a  further  sub-division  of  his     present holdings (1  group  apparently omitted)  new comers  from     Russian.   He  doe&apos;o  not bring his  produce to  the towns as  the Bolshevik     habitually seizes  it.    The Cossacks in the Yenisei Government,     (mobilized force of  400),  have fled south to await events.   They are     short of  money,  arms and ammunition.          The  Zabaikal  Cossacks are operating  as far as the  outskirts  of     Chita, General  Mil  and Chinese  troops are  controlling Harbin and     railway.          Leading  Siberians are repeateoly  asking for  allies  occupation;     estimated force necessary  15,000 mixed troops; request  for senior     officers  to be  Europeans.          German and Austrian prisoners; reported at Tomsk  that 20,000     are collected are  being  armed  but  doubtful  to  what extent arming     has been  completed.   The  Germans  would be  unable with this force     to cut Trans-Siberian railway  at Alexgb.   At  Krasnoyarsk 4000 to     5000 German ana Austrian officers  including 800 men; men of no use     but officors  disciplined.   They are lightly armed,(revolvers  and few     rifles).   In  the event  of  necessity they  threaten to disarm the Red     Guards  and so fully  arm  themselves.   Red Guards  have  6 machines-     guns and 3 eighteen  pounders.    It is  possible for the  Germans to     destroy  large bridge across Yenisei river.  German officers are     leaving Krasnoyarsk  at  the rate  of 40  to  GO daily.  Jew trad&apos;;  in     American and  otiur passports.  *                                 6.2.  Copies  to:-                                                 M.I.I.H.
