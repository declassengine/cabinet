S3CRBT.      -                 WAR OABIKBT&apos;     G.T. 3704*                            BOLSHEVIST PROPAGANDA.                      Memorandum by the Home Secretary*      The increasing activities of Finkelstein (alias Litvinoff)and his friends are causing some anxiety, and I should like theWar Cabinet to re-consider the position as to these persons.      Litvinoff addressed a meeting at the Central Hall, Westminster,on the l8th February.   As it was announced that he would speakabout the Bolshevist movement in Russia only, and as Mr.W,CAnderson, M.P. was to preside and no breach of the peace wasanticipated,  I did not prohibit the meeting, but I caused a short-hand note of the proceedings to be taken.   Litvinoff*s speech(which he read) was guarded in terms but was devoted to extollingthe acts of the Bolshevist Government in Russia.   Other speakersdrew the moral that their example should be followed in this country.Litvinoff is to address another meeting in London on Saturday orSunday next.      SomewhSt pore serious is the fact that Litvinoff is said tobe seeing a large number of men in khaki.   One correspondent saysthat Ma stream of men in khaki&quot; visit him at his effice inVictoria Street;   and Mr. Basil Thomson in the memorandum which Icirculated recently says that he has been trying with some successto induce British and American soldiers of Jewish descent to engagein propaganda in their regiments.   Apparently he furnishes themwith topics of the Bolshevist decree abolishing all ranks in theArmy, etc. of which a copy was annexed to that memorandum.      Litvinoff is about to establish an Information Bureau in theEast End, which will no doubt be used for purposes of propaganda.He is also believed to be party to a scheme for forming bandsof &quot;Red Guards&quot; and &quot;White Guards&quot; in London.      I^BIfieneff       appears to be in Sweden on his way to thiscountry, is ^ported from Petrograd as very dangerous, and personswho have travelled with him in the train say that he is coming herefor the purpose of spreading Bolshevism.   He is believed to havelarge funds and a supply of propagandist literature.      These people may not have much influence an the Britishworking man, who will judge Bolshevism by its results in Russia;but they may cause serious trouble among Russian and Jewish soldiersand munition workers and in the mixed population of the last End.      I recommend (l) that Kamenef^s sailing for this country beprevented or delayed aB much as possible; and that if he lands thePolice may be authorized to oondnct him directly from his port oflanding to the port from which he will sail for Prance.   He woul&apos;dbe discreetly searched.      I should like also (2)  to  be allowed to  deport  or  internLitvinoff at the appropriate  time,  provided that the difficultiescaused by his ambiguous diplomatic position can be set aside.
      1 think (3) that an Order in Council should be made underthe Aliens Restriction Act enabling a  Secretary of State toprohibit an alien from addrescing meetings or engaging inpropaganda^      An e&amp;rly decision is required, as General Page-Croft, M.P.appears to have become aware of the facts as to Litvinoff&apos;s past-and haa put down Questions on this subject for Monday next.                             G. CAVE.22nd February,  1918.
