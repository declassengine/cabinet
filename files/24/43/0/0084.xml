Garter, iU3.E.,Sir Frederick U.. Henderson,Mr. A.C.Ross.9.3.E. ,Sir Maurice Hankey, 2.0.3.,   The object of the discussion was to enable  the Prime Minister  todiscover what were the causes of tha fall in the output of  merchantshipbuilding, and what action could, be taken by the  Government  tostimulate it.  The principal points which emerged from  the  discussionwere as follows:-   fl) The shipowners present paid a warm tribute to the work of  Sir       Alan Anderson, the Controller of  the 3avy.  They compered  him       to a most efficient and tactful Chairman of a Board  of Diree-       tors:   (2] They also paid a tribute to the efficiency of tne man&amp;gement       of tha Warship Building Department of the Controller:   (d) It was generally agreed, however, th:-1  the outc-ut of raerofcant       shipbuilding would be improved if a practical shipbuilder  were       put at the Head of Sir Alan Anderson&apos;s  Merchant Shipbuilding       Department, instead of the present occupier of that  post:   (4) The Merchant Shipbuilding Department was criticised  as being       over-staffed and too large:   (5) It 7/as generally agreed that the  limiting factors in the output       of ships are material and labour:   (6) It was generally agreed that material&apos;&quot;supplies are now suffi-       oient.  The results of the increased supplies of material,  how-       ever, will not apoear until the returns of the next  few months;
 (1) The main difficulty at the present time is labour, and this was     criticised both from the point of view of its quality and quan-     tity: (8) Unskilled Shipyard labour is no--&apos; bein: suoplied by the Minister     of National - Service in sufficient quantities, but there is a     lack of skilled labour,  The men oeing released from- the .attay     are only beginning to appear in the woimcs, out as these come     along improvement is hoped, for.  Ic is also hoped to obtain S,.00C     Mm men from the            munitions factories *  Great stress,     however, was  laid cm the necessity for more&apos; aaiilod labour: (9) It was stated that the relations between  the masters and men     sre, on the whole, very good indeed, but a serious ground of     criticism was the number of Government Departments -vhich incer-     fere in labour disputes, end cause grer..t confusion.  Ilovvith-     stending the  directions vhich the Prime Minister ass given to     avoid  this, it was stated that tne following Departments are     constantly interfering in labour dispute-: before the shi&quot;build-     ers and the men have even been able to discuss matters among     themselves:-                        Ministry Of Labouri                        Ministry of Munitions Labour Department:                        Shipyard Labour Department:                        Ministry of National service:                        Deputy Controller of Morenant Shipping:     On this point the Prime Minister ashed for specific instances     during the last three weeks, in order that he might take the     matter up with tne&apos; Departments concerned.  Sir Jeorge Carver    -undertook to  supply such instances:(10) It was suggested that the agreed apportionment of labour between     naval  construction and mercantile construction, namely, 40 per     cent,  for the former, and 60 per cent, for tne latter, has not     been adhered  to, and that the Kavy is taking more than its share     of labour:(11) Great  stress  was laid on tne alleged fact that the sen are not     doing  their utmost in the shipyards.  Among the causes for this,     the unrest,caused by the \Z\ per cent.decision, was put first,     It was also urged that steps should be taken to corneat anti-     national propaganda, in the yards, and to ensure that workers     receive proper and regular supplies of food.   Another oa.uae men-     tioned for this unrest was in connection .vith the &quot;clean cut&quot; fox     recruiting-  Although it was understood that no men ware set-     ually to be taken from shipyards, since  0,000 men were repaired     in them, nevertheless, medical ehaminations were aeing regular!:;     carried out,  and this caused the men to thivni they would be tsfc-     on for military service and to rela:*: their efforts.  Above all,     however, it was urged that the men must; be told the truth about     the grave peril with which the nation is faced, and that for     this it is urgent that the actual figures of losses and output     should be revealed to them:  After tne Meeting, the Prime Minister          Approved the decision agreed to by his colleagues in the          *ver Cabinet, subject to his approval, that the Admiralty          should be authorised to publish the actual tonnage figures          of losses and shipbuilding:          The First Lord of the admiralty undertook to consult tha          Prime Minister further as to the actual wording of the                  announcement.,  Whitehall  Gardens,  3.IV.,     March 2,  1918.
