SECRET. SUMMARY  OF  INFORMATIONfor Month of January, 1918.GENERAL *     Salonika Defences.          On the representation of General Guillaumat a Commission     was formed on January 15th, for the purpose of considering     the system of defence of the Inner Line of Defence of Salonika.     The Commission is presided over by General Genin of the     French Army, and I have appointed Major-General Onslow, C.B.,     C.M.G., R.A., and Major-General Livingstone, C.B., R.E., to     act for me  upon it.    The whole organisation of the Inner     Line is now being reviewed.     The Goeben.          On the 21st January, I was requested by the Rear-Admiral     Cornmanding British Aegean Squadron to oo-operate with him in     aerial operations to be carried out against the Goeben, which     on return from her sortie from the Dardanelles was reported to     be beached at Nagara.    I accordingly sent ten bombing     machines to Mudros for this purpose, which carried out daily     raids in conjunction with the Naval machines J   High winds,     however, interfered with the operations, and on the 29th     January, I  received news that the Goo ben had goneo   This was     confirmed by an aerial reconnaissance, and my ten machines have     now all returned safely.     Army Training School0 .          The Army Training School for the training of Officers and     N .C .0s in their duties as Platoon Commanders, was opened on     January 7th and 50 officers and 100 N .C .0s will go through a     course there every montho     Base Training Camps0          Owing  to the transfer of a large number of men of the A.S.C     and R.A.M.C. to infantry? I have found it necessary to open     ,two camps for training theiru      Each of the camps will     eventually contain 1200 men undergoining seven weeks courses     of instruction in Infantry duties.BRITISH FRONT.     Operations.          The weather throughout the month has been fine with the     exception of a few days of rain and snow, and our patrols have     been  very active on both fronts causing loss to the - enemy on     many occasions *          On the morning of the 3rd January, a patrol of the 80th     Infantry Brigade successfully engaged a hostile patrol,     inflicting casualties on theme          On the 9th January, a patrol of the 84th Inf.Brigade     encountered a strong enemy party and killed at least five of     them.          On the 20th January, the 2nd Cheshire Regt., raided the     enemy outpost line near Butkova Dzuma with good results, hostile     casualties  being estimated at over 30-while our own were very     slight.          On the 29th January, entirely successful raids were carried     out by troops of the 79th Inf.Bde. in the neighbourhood of     Akindzali east of Lake Doiran.   All objectives were gained     and several enemy posts which offered resistance were/annihilated
     annihilated.  Wire and dugouts were demolished and many-     enemy dead were left on the ground^  Five prisoners were     brought back.    Our aeroplanes co-operated in this raid     and bombed hostile batteries in the neighbourhood of     Nikolic with good effect..          Hostile patrols have  been inactive during the month.AVIATION.          Local bombing raids have been carried out frequently     against enemy dumps and camps with good results.   Bulgarian     Army Headquarters at Kustendil was bombed on the  evening of the     18th instant,  but owing to delay caused by the strong wind,     which rose unexpectedly, results could not be observed,          The arrival of some S.E.5 machines has strengthened our     fighting power in the airs and three hostile machines have     been accounted for in the  course of the last few  days.OTHER FRONTS.  .          No operations of any  importance have been undertaken by     other Allied Forces,   On  the 21st January the enemy, after     a heavy bombardment, delivered a strong attack against the     Greek positions west of the Vardarc   The attack  was, however,     everywhere vigorously repulsed.  The enemy has continued     his attempts at fraternisation with the Serbs, without result.          The Russian troops have been withdrawn from  the line,ADMINISTRATIVE.          The Branch from the Sarigeul Snevce Decauville which runs     to Rajanovo from Gramatna  via Kurkut opens today; this will     greatly facilitate the maintenance of the Brigade holding high     ground west of Butkovo.          Good progress is being made with the Sarakli Stavros     Decauville,  Trouble v/as experienced with the Turkish     prisoners who are employed making the formation,  but steps have     been taken to cause them to resume work.          The formation of the  Agricultural Department as a branch     of the S.. &amp; T. Directorate has been completed and it is hoped     that good results will accrue, but it is important that outside     labour, preferably Egyptian, should be made available for     harvesting purposes in the Struma Valley during the summer.HEALTH of TROOPS.
