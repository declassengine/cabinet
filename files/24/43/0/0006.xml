STANLEY.
 THE  mmS OF JANUARY 1918. 1,         In January total  imports  into  the  United Kingdom amounted to 2,730,000  tons,  a decrease  of 19$ on January 1917, of 27$ on January 1916,  and  o-f-38$ on January 1913.    The reduction as-against  a  year ago was, however, less than  it was last month when the percentage fall was 27$. 2.         In January the percentage decrease on  1917 in the import of grain and flour was 33$, in  meat Q$9 in raw cotton 36$, in raw wool 53$,  in paper,58$,  in paper-making- materials 21$,  and in raw fruit  70$.   The import of wood, other than pit-props, was practically tho-same; as in January 1917.     For commodities  that are imported in substantial  quantities by Government Departments it must be borne in mind that comparisonswith 1917 arc likely to be misleading&quot;, because, whereas  .before June 1917 all imports  (except food) brought in on Government account were omitted from the trade  :. returns from June onwards they have boen included, 3*         While imports were down 38$ on 1913, the entrances of British and Foreign vessels (with cargo)wore down 53$;    and while imports were down 19$ on     tonnage  entrances  were down 22$.-    Thus,-&quot;as&apos; against 1913 the loading factor had improved by 32$, and as against  1917 by 4$.  :4*         In- January,  British entrances  with cargo (other than requisitioned&apos; vessels)  amounted  to1,429,000 tone  - 9$ less  than in January  1917.  -The                                       percentage
percentage, fall was the same as in the previous month 5British clearances (other than requisitioned vessels) were1,003,000  tons - 25)1 less than in January 1917,           Foreign entrances amounted to 314,000 tons, 52jlless than  in January 1917 - as against a decline of 59% inthe previous month - and foreign clearances to 619,000 tons,U% less than in January 1917,5.         In January the aggregate British losses of vesselsover 500 tons gross burden amounted to 234,000 tons of which188,,000 tons were due  to war risk.   Tho aggregate loss isthus some 65,000 tons  loss than the corresponding loss(299,000 tons) in December.          Taking December and January together the loss by  .enemy action has amounted to 426f000; and total loss to534,000 tons.   These  figures are about what was estimated.     The Watson-Elder ton report of October 30th,  1917estimated  that 155,000 tons of new shipping would becompleted in home yards or purchased abroad during January,The actual figures are, completed 64,000 tons:   purchasedabroad 7,000 tons:  total 71,000 fcons.  or less  than halloThis is the worst figure of construction for any month  sinceJune.   Including other gains,  the total gain in Januaryamounted to 73,000 tons against losses  of 234,000 tons,   Tnenet reduction of available tonnage was  therefore  161,000  tonsas against a similar reduction in  December of 172,000 tensand in November of 53,000 tons.   The tonnage  of Allies  otherthan Great Britain lost through enemy action  was  87,000  tons(the same figure as in December)&apos;,  and that of Neutrals34,000 tons (as against 49,000 tons in  December).6.      ^Qn December- 31st - the figure for  January 31st  isnot yet available - as compared with November 30th   theemployment of the British Mercantile steam fleet  over 500tons had changed as follow^:-                                                 Charge

This involved the large reduction of 160,000tons in the tonnage of vessels other than oilers availablefor British trade.   The tonnage in the service of Russia,which was 54,000 tons on November 30th., amounted onDecember 31st., to 34,000 tons, besides 33,000 tonsfetching flax and timber from theXiite-Gea.

The most striking feature of this Tablo is the enormousincrease that has taken place in the tonnage of vessels thatare out of use undergoing repair.  The largo increase invessels launched hut not completing is a more satisfactoryfeature.   for the rest it appears that owing to the with-drawal of veSSols in the service of Allies, Colonies and per-manent trade abroad, it has been found possible to keep downthe roduction in the tonnage available for British trade (otherthan oilers) to a figaro which is 200,000. tons less than halfthe reduction in vessels ready for uso..  Ilainly,  however, a17$ reduction on a total of vessels so employed already enor-mously diminished below the figure for. normal times is an ex-oeedingly serious matter.7.  The following Table shows the position of British shipbuild-ing as reported during tho week ending 7th February, 1918:                       Under Oon-    Launched   Total under                       struct ion     but not     construc-                       qjl stQ-CkSr   QWBte&amp;aJL.  -,-  tion. ,,Standard ships          445,000      23,000      468,000Other Merchant       vessels          573,000     370,000      943,000Oilers                  297,000      22,000      319,000                      17315,000     III&apos;000*   l;730^000The tonnage under construction on stocks includes  79 overseasbarges totalling nearly 22,000 tons.  Of the tonnage of Mothermerchant vessels1&apos;, 104,000 tons are ships for carrying meatand fruit.  The total tonnage under construction is some20,000 tons greater than a month before..     During tho last weak&apos;of January,  152 merchant vessels  of532,000 tons were being repaired in dry dock, and  273,  of932,000 tons in all were being repaired afloat.    Thus  thetotal tonnage undergoing repair approached l  million grosstons,..,
THE IMPORT SITUATION.          In 1913 some 54i million tons of goods of alldescriptions were imported into this country, and it isestimated that the total imports in 1917, including goodsimported by Government Departments amounted to some 37imillion tons.  The reduction was thus about 17-J milliontons or 32$.  Since a large part of the imports of 1917consisted of munitions and munition materials the reductionof import for ordinary use was necessarily much greaterthan this.          The most important items which the statisticsenable us to distinguish cut of the aggregate arc roughlyas follows:-                                 Million Tons.

The   large reduction in foodimports is in some degree offset by the diroct  importationto Prance, Salonika,  etc, of part of the food  requirementsof our forces.  About 200,000 tons of meat  were importeddirectly to the various fronts in 1917.          The reductions shown above,  totalling some  18.8million tons, are partly offset by increases in a  fewarticles of which petroleum  is the most considerable.                         (s)
          The reduction ia-imports might  be  distributedalong any of the following lines,  and,  no doubt,  has in factbeen distributed to some extent along all of them,          (a) reduction in the purchases  by consumer? of food          (b) reduction in the purchases  by users of more of               less durable articles of ordinary  use..          (c) diminished re-export and diminished.export of               goods made from native materials.          (d) the production at home of materials to takB the               place of reduced imports of materials,          (e) the letting down of stocks.          (f) the cessation of new capital constructions that               would normally have been undertaken, and the  .               letting down of plant and  equipment through               inability to carry out ordinary repairs and               renewals-,(a)  Purchases by consumers of articles of food can obviouslybe reduced up to a point without any serious after-effectand there is no evidence that up to the present the reductionin food consumption has been carried beyond this  point.(b)  Purchases of more or less durable articles of ordinaryuse aref in a different position.   These  can be reducedlargely for a time at the cost of allowing presentpossessions to deteriorate more than is usual and ofpostponing new purchases.   For instance, the generalreduction in the import of timber has involved thepractical shutting down of housebuilding and of house-repairing.  The reduction of purchases along these linesimplies a large volume of unfulfilled needs which will seeksatisfaction as soon as opportunity offers.   Moreover,though new purchases of consumable goods  of the type hereunder review may be postponed for a time   in a very largemeasure, they cannot be postponed indefinitely, because,after a point, a worn thing becomes worn, put  and cannotbe used any longerix  Hence,&apos; if the war goes  on long enough,it will eventually become impossible for  consumers to                                             postpone            :          &apos;    (?)               &apos;  &apos;.
postpone their requirements of many of the classes ofgoods here considered any longer, or to postpone withoutrunning the risk of the destruction of things which mi^ithave been preserved if repaired in time.(c)        Reductions in re-exports (which have fallen fromnearly If million tons in 1913 to about f million tons in1917) and in exports of British-made goods (which havefallen from over 12i million tons in 1913 to less than 7million in 1917), are obvious ways of meeting a shortagein the import of materials without injury in the homecountry at the time.         It must be remarked^ however,that a check on exports means having a debt abroad afterthe war correspondingly higher than it would otherwisehave been.     The physical structure of our industry is notdamaged but in effect a mortgage is placed upon it, anda portion of its future output will have to be absorbedin the payment of interest in this mortgage.(d)       The production at home of materials to take theplace of reduced imports of materials - as illustrated bythe development of home agriculture and Jiome felling of ,timber - has different effects according to the sourcefrom which the labour and capital devoted to the enlargedhome production are taken.  In so far as they are takenfrom the production of consumables the effects is the sameas described in sections (a) and (b), and in so far asthey are taken from the production of exports it is thesame as that described in Section (c).(e)       There is reason to believe that the restrictionof imports has been made to s considerable extent by theletting down of stocks which means inconvenience ratherthan injury, but it is a saving which cannot be repeated...(f)       The remaining ways of meeting the shortage ofimports have to do with capital equipment.  Eefraininefrom setting up mn capilal structures, swans that an
an advance which would otherwise have been made is not made.But, in so far as the restriction of imports is met by lettingdown plant and equipment, the effect may be very serious.   Upto a point, indeed, as with durable goods of ordinary consumptionthere will be no less but merely postponement.  It is obvious,however, that repairs and renewals, if neglected for two years,are likely to cost much more to make in the end than they wouldhave cost if made at the proper time.  Furthermore, there isdanger of a complete break-down.  Machinery may fail to workat all and railways may become unsafe for traffic.  This methodof meeting a shortage of imported material, may, therefore, wellspell disaster during the actual course of the war if it shouldbe sufficiently prolonged.     Prom the considerations advanced in the above sub-sectionsit follows that the minimum importation wi&apos;th which the essentialneeds of the country can be satisfied is not a fixed, and far lessa diminishing quantity, but rather a quantity which must inevitabllincrease with the passage of time.     These considerations serve to emphasise the extremeseriousness of the import situation for 1918.  Lord Milner&apos;sCommittee recommended various cuts which they estimated would in theaggregate save some 5i million tons of imports, but it subse-quently became apparent that, partly because many of these cutsaffect short voyages and so cannot have full effect in releasingships for other purposes, and partly for other reasons;  afurther reduction of some 2 to 2j million tons must in one wayor another be arranged for.  This further reduction will entaila further cut in the imports budgetted for by the &quot;Ministry ofMunitions, and substantial reductions in certain other things,including cotton.  In  the cotton industry the new scale ofimports will largely increase the number of operatives unemployed,and involve much greater payments for their maintenance.
     It would appear that, since such exports as we arestill able to make occupy much less cargo space than theimports we require, the shortage of tonnage is not likelyto interfere in any serious degree with ou2&apos; export trade.It has to he remarked,  however, that the concentrationof tonnage more and more upon the Atlantic routesis already causing Cifficulties in the matter of exportsalong certain other routes.
