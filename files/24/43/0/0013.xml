Intelligence Bureau,                                department of In/ormation.&apos;                                       C 20.MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATION IN FINLAND.General Situation.     T&apos;hile the number of countries formally recognising theindependence of Finland has been growing (France, Germany, Sweden,Norway, Denmark, Austria-Hungary, Switzerland and Spain) theinternal conditions of the country have become steadily worse.^As a result of the resolution of the Diet in the middle ofJanuary authorising the Government to take all necessary measuresto establish order, the Council of the Finnish Socialist Partyissued a manifesto calling upon the proletariat to unite againstthe Government under the leadership of a Delegation representingthe Socialists and Red Guards.  It further declared the maintenanceof the Red Guards to be necessary for the protection of the workingclasses.   A week later it became clear that the Finnish Red Guardsaided by the Russian Bolshevik soldiers and sailors in Finland andthe Bolshevik Government in Russia were planning a revolution tooverthrow the existing Government and Diet and establish adictatorship of the proletariat, possibly with the ultimateIntention of maintaining Federal Union with Russia,   A furthermanifesto was issued by the Socialists in the end of the nwnthdemanding the overthrow of the Senate and Administration, theabolition of landowners&apos;  rights over the crofters, the immediaterelief of unemployment and the Improvement of the food supply.At the same time the Diet appointed delegates to take part inthe negotiations at Brest Litovsk, three of whom were Bourgeoisrepresentatives and two members of the Socialist Party.     Open warfare commenced in the end of the month,  the WhiteGuard or Government forces (from eighty to one hundred thousand)
being under the command of General Mannerheim,  a FinnKwho hadformerly served    Commander of Cavalry  in  the  Russian army.    Theseat of the Bourgeois Government was  transferred to Vasa.  TheRed Guards &quot;seized the railway  station and telegraph at Helsingfors,andt proclaimed a BOl-shevite Republic.   A Socialist Labour PeasantGovernment inciting members Representative of  the Red Guards,^byjet and professional classes has been formed, assuming the name.&amp;f &quot;Finland1s Council of  the Peoplers Plenipotentiaries&quot;.   The,President is Kullervo Manner,  a journalist.     At first matters went distinctly in favour of the BourgeoisGovernment, whose strength is  principally in the North, while theRevolutionary Government  held  full control  in the South. This initial success stimulated the Bolshevik Government in Petrograd Into  sending more assistance In men and  munitions, and as thoTkhite Guards have been unable  to gain corresponding assistance from Sweden or elsewhere even  furtively to anything  like the same  extent, the  situation at the moment of writing Is inclining in favour of  theRevolutionary Government.      It would appear that there has been a  change in the Bourgeois Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  Mr  Sarrio now  holding that office.   It Is important to distinguish him from Hr Sirela whoholds the post of Foreign Commissary  in  the Revolutionary Government.Kr Sarrio wee a member of the  delegation that visited  Germany for the purpose of requesting recognition of  Finnish independence.  It is on record that that particular delegation stated that  &quot;the Finnish people expected much from recognition by Germany because they felt drawn to that country by  a strong oommunity of  culture and Interests&quot;.     The situation with regard to the Aland Islands has possiblybeen modified slightly In favour of Sweden.  The excesses of theRussian troops have naturally  strengthened  the  desire  of the inhabitants for union with Sweden, while the Swedish clement  in
Finland who wore most antagonistic to the acquisition of theislands by Sweden on the ground that it would reduce theirparticular electorate, are more Inclined to accept any t^rms In,return for Swedish intervention In the present crisis.Views of Member of Finnish Delegation.     The writer has had further opportunity of conversation withthe member of the Finnish Delegation referred to in previousMemoranda (C 16 2c 17), and the following represents the latter1sview with regard to the probable course of events under differingeventualities.     If the Red Guards Win. - The Delegate  in question fears thatin this eventuality matters will only reach a worse state of ,anarchy, since during the last 700 years the Finnish nation hasbeen educated in the highest respect for law.  &quot;If the Red Guardswin it means that they will abolish all fundamental criminal andcivil law, and will further substitute Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos;Soviets as in Russia, in place of the Diet.  The Soviet, however,is a political institution which never has been recognised orknown in Finland, the Finnish people having always looked on theDiet as the only true source of legislation.  The abolition ofcriminal law will mean that the commission of crime will beregarded from the anarchist point of view, i.e. as to whether ithas been done by the upper or the lower classes.  Crime whencommitted by the lower classes is the fault of the social order ofthings, according to Karl Marx;  that is to say, the Socialistswill look on crime in Finland as the result of conditions due tothe bourgeoisie;  and, further, the Socialists regard all thebourgeoisie as criminal in themselves as robbing the workers of thefruits of their labour.  This, of course, is simply the opinionalso of the Russian Bolsheviks, the extreme members of which
consider that all members of the bourgeoisie should be murdered orhanged.   On the other hand,  crimes committed by the Bolsheviksare no crimes.  Therefore, if the Red Guards win, it can only bea temporary success because  the majority of the Finnish peoplewill certainly continue a.stubborn fight to maintain their oldKest European civilisation,  based as it is on the respect for law.In this  case those Finns who belong to the upper classes will askfor the  interference of any foreign State which will be willing tohelp them&quot;.     If the White Guards lln. - &quot;Here there are two differentpossibilities:          (a) The n;hite Guards may win through the German move onPetrograd.  In the event of the Germans occupying or threatening tooccupy Petrograd, it may well happen that the Bolsheviks in Finlandwill withdraw before they find their lines of communication cut offwith Russia.  In that event it is most probable that the Finnishbourgeoisie will remain ,more or less neutral.          (b) On the other hand, if the Germans have to invadeFinland and there join the White Guards in their fight againstthe Bolsheviks, this will-undoubtedly greatly strengthen Germaninfluence in Finland.  That will be a natural result, because theFinns will more or less tend to look on the Germans as the savioursof their country from the Russian tyranny, and in particular thepeople who own anything will be tempted to look on Germany as thestrongest antagonist of Socialism in the interests of any bourgeoisregime.      &quot;fcith regard to the return of the Finns who have been trainedand on service in Germany, I consider that from the Finnish pointof view this  is of the greatest importance, because it means thatthey  will break direct relations with Germany, and look moreimmediately on things from a purely Finnish point of view.    They
Will no longer regard the German armies fighting in the Bastagainst their former oppressors with such interest.  (I may statethat Finns were actually fighting on the Eastern front in thevicinity of Riga).   When the Finnish army is mixed by theintroduction of the Finns who have returned after having foughtin the Russian army (mainly,  of course, officers), the Germaninfluence will be greatly reduced.   General Mannerheim fought forRussia and has not the Blightest touch of pro-Germanism about him.He will see that the Finns who return from Germany do not get theupper hand in his army.     &quot;Even if the. Germans go to ?etrdg?ad th&amp;re is much left forthe Western&apos;-Powers to do in the way of continuing a policy againstthe German de&apos;sire to make the Baltic a Gerjrtkn Sea.  In the firstplace, in all&apos;the Baltic provinces the majority of the people haveuntil about i860 looked on the German Borons as their real economicand political enemies.  Since that date the attempts atRussificatdon have somewhat changed the situation, and the Esthoniansand Letts have looked on the German Barohs as their economicoppressors, and on the Russians as their political oppressors.Now that they are free from the Russian rule, they will againconsider the German Barons not only as their economic oppressors,but as the representatives of the Germaia Imperialist policy,opposed to their local political interests.  -Therefore I considerthat the Germans cannot base their polioy on the sympathy of themajority of the people in the Baltic provinces, who ha^e alwa^been anti-German.   The Germans in Berlin will naturally do theirutmost to support the German Barons agalnsft the Baltic peoples.That will, however, be a failure, since from 1900 onwards thenative majority In Esthonia have in many instances sucoeeded indefeating the Germans in municipal elections.  Also, during therevolutionary movement of 1005-06 in Russia, the attitude of the
V54oeople towards the Germans in all the Baltic provinces wasextremely hostile.  The majority of the people in the Balticprovinces will look upon those Great Powers who oppose the Germanpolicy as their true friends, and if a referendum is made in theBaltic provinces, it will mean that the German interests,particularly the interests of the German Barons, will not prevail.Even if the Germans succeed in separating the Baltic provincesfrem Russia, the German interests need not necessarily gain.The class of the   nobility in the Baltic provinces may reckonon the support of the Swedish upper classes in Finland who aremore or less pro-Germans, but the influence of the Swedish upperclasses in Finland is continuously declining, so that the Germanscannot expect that their aims with regard to the Baltic willsucceed better in Finland than in the Baltic provinces;  in fact,the contrary will be the truth.  Finnish shipping circles aregrowing uncomfortable fearing German competition, and if theGermans try to exclude other nations from the freedom of the Balticports this feeling of discomfort will grow to latent hostility.The situation is peculiarly delicate just now because the Bolsheviksare in Finland and the white Guards are relying more than isdesirable on German support.  If the Finns succeed in getting ridof the Bolshevik tyranny aid the Baltic provinces gain a realindependence, within the next 10 fcr 20 years the old politicaltruth will held geod that the small nationalities have to lookon their strongest neighbour as their worst enemy&quot;.22.2.18.
