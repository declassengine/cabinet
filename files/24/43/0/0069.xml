[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]                 Printed for the War Cabinet.  March 1918.c\THE LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 27th February, 1918.                                  SUMMARY.Part I: General Remarks.    The present position of Labour is discussed with special reference to the Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference.Part II: Press Comments.    The opinion of the Labour press is summarised on the engineers and man-power,the Inter-Allied Conference, the Versailles Conference, Propaganda and the WarAims Committee, the Eussian Situation, &quot;War Aims,&quot; the Peace Debate, the FoodQuestion, and Soldiers and Politics.Part III:  District Reports.    On the whole  the situation is distinctly satisfactory, though in certain  areasdifficulty is still felt on the subject of the 12^ per cent, advance.  The food situationis  better, though, in the North-Western and Northern  Districts, it is still unsatis-factory, and also in Scotland.Part IV:  Disputes.    (a.) Involving stoppage of work. The only strikes of any serious importanceare those of the electricians at Glasgow and the joiners at Belfast.    (b.) Not involving stoppage of work. Apart from the dispute in the  woollenindustry to which  reference is made in Part III, the  only serious dispute is that.among the agricultural labourers in Norfolk on the question of wages.                            I. General Remarks.The Labour Situation.    Again abnormal quiet is reported from all parts of the country.  Opposition tothe man-power provisions has weakened everywhere, and on the Clyde, where  theopposition was in the first instance extreme,  it is  now reported  that  the ClydeWorkers&apos; Committee have resolved not to call a strike in protest against the arrange-ments.  As practically all the Workers&apos; Committees look to the Clyde for a lead inthe matter,  it is clear that no concerted action to &quot;down tools5&apos; need now  beexpected.    The week has been remarkable for the production of two  important documentson the part of organised  Labour.  Of these,  the first is the Memorandum issued bythe Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference, which was  held  in London fromthe 20th to the 23rd February, and the second, the new constitution of the  LabourParty ,^ which was passed at a meeting held in London on the 26th.    The former document may be  said to be of capital importance, as its tenordemonstrates that organised Labour, and  the Socialist Parties connected with it,have divorced themselves in an emphatic manner from the &quot;peace at any  price&quot;&apos;school, which had seemed to have gained so  much ground in Great Britain duringthe last few months.  There is indeed very little difference in principle between the      [1100-18]                                                     BSECRET.G.T.-3769.
war aims included in the Memorandum and those which have been officially statedby  the Prime Minister on behalf of Great Britain and by President Wilson  onbehalf of America.  The alterations made in the original draft presented by theBritish Labour Party are practically all in the direction of stiffening its demands.In certain instances the Memorandum is more precise than the official declarations,notably in its reference to  the Trentino and Italian interests on the shores of theAdriatic, and it is a  remarkable fact that a Memorandum containing such strongexpressions of opinion with regard to what should be demanded from Germany andits Allies at a peace conference, should have been accepted unanimously by a meetingat which the most pacifist  representatives of organisations  in Allied countries, asfor instance M. Longuet of France and  S. Mogliano of Italy  were present.  On theother hand, it should be noted that the British Section refused  the applicationmade by the Independent Labour Party for separate representation, on the groundthat they were already represented through the Labour Party,  to  which they areaffiliated.     It is interesting to speculate on the reasons which have  induced this apparenthardening of opinion.  There can be little doubt that the leaders  of  the  RussianRevolution have been thoroughly discredited in the minds of the British  workingclasses partly owing  to  the complete failure  of  their policy of negotiation afterdisarmament, but more largely  owing to their  evident disregard for the rights ofindividuals and of minorities and to their determination to compel acceptance oftheir principles at the expense  of personal liberty.   The  deliberate adoption  ofterrorism as a means  of  propaganda, the suppression  of  the  Constituent Assembly,which M. Litvinoff vainly attempted to justify at the Labour Party Conference inJanuary, the declaration of war  upon the Ukraine in order to compel that provinceto conform to the Bolshevik ideal of government,  the provision of armed assistanceto the revolutionary party in Finland, and finally, perhaps, the refusal on the partof the Bolshevik Government to issue passports for representatives  of the Revoiu-tionary Socialist Party, and the  suppression of all opposition papers, all these havecombined to discredit, among organised Labour in Britain,  Russian revolutionarymethods.  These facts coupled with the naked  demonstration of German aims andmethods  in Russia have undoubtedly opened the eyes of many and have stiffened theattitude  of the  Labour movement towards the war.     Another factor which has served to modify the war aims originally proposed,has  been the contact  gained at  the conference with  the views  of  the democraticparties from other countries.  The general result is that a conference, whose assemblywas undoubtedly anticipated with a certain  amount of  anxiety  among the publicgenerally, has resulted in a demonstration of national and inter-allied unity whichwill have all the more effect on the Central Empires owing to  its  obviously non-official, indeed to a certain extent anti-official character.   It is a practical reaffirma-tion of the union sacree of the early days of the war, and has again brought into theforefront of war aims the evacuation and rehabilitation of Belgium and the abroga-tion of the Treaty of  Frankfort.     Whether the Memorandum is or is not  succcessful in extracting a reply fromorganised Labour in Germany does not appear to be of very serious moment.  It canscarcely  be imagined  that the German  Government will permit representatives oforgaised  Labour in Germany to attend an International Conference on the  basis ofthis Memorandum.  It is, however, very important to notice  that, even should thiscourse be acceptable  to German Labour and allowed  by the  German Government,American Labour has refused in the most precise and  definite  terms  to take anypart in such an International Conference.  Meanwhile the results of  the  LondonConference may be stated to be entirely to the good.     As was expected the new Constitution of the Labour Party was accepted practi-cally as it stood when postponed  from the Nottingham Conference last month.  TheIndependent Labour Party  continued its efforts to obtain a preponderant influence,by amending the Constitution, but these efforts were emphatically rejected, and inthe Constitution as finally passed the ascendancy of organised  Labour  is finallvassured.   The Independent  Labour Party does not appear to be reconciled with thisstate of  affairs, and it will be interesting to see the effect of the new Constitutionupon the relations between the Labour Party aud  the Independent Labour Party atthe next  General Election.  It may be said that  in the result of the two  Conferencesheld this week the Independent Labour  Party has suffered a distinct set-back
                             IT. PRESS OPINIONS.The Engineers and Man-Power.     In spite of the important developments which took place last week in relationto this question somewhat less attention is devoted to it in the Labour and Socialist^  Most noteworthy perhaps, is  an article, in &quot; The Clarion&quot;  by the SheffieldDistrict  Secretary of the &quot; Toolmakers, Engineers and Machinists,&quot;  m  which thewriter expresses indignation  at the attempt to .cut the A.S.E. off from the rest ofLabour in order the better to revile its members, and asserts that the feelings ofthe members of that Society are shared by trade unionists as a whole.  He regardsthe dilutee question as camouflage, and says that the real reason for the trouble isthat Labour is now convinced that Prussianism is being set up in this country, andthat while &quot; the heart of the workers is just as sound on justice and the smashingof the German military menace in 1918 as.it was in 1914,&quot; it is not going to put upwith the establishment of the same menace in this country.     &quot; The New Witness &quot; continues to adopt an attitude somewhat favourable to theA.S.E. in spite of the ballot, and maintains that the &quot; root cause &quot; of the trouble isthe question of the dilutee.    The &quot;  Cotton  Factory  Times,&quot; however,  condemnsattempts to &quot;minimise the significance of the vote,&quot;  and says  that  &quot;the shortestway out of  the imbroglio would be for Sir Auckland Geddes to pocket his absurdscruples and give the engineers their  separate conference.     The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot;  and   &quot;Solidarity&quot; are  frankly in  favour of theengineers adopting an impossibilist attitude, the one holding that Bolshevism, whichis &quot;saying  what you mean and then doing it,&quot; is popular on the Clyde,  and thelatter declaring that the whole movement is simply part of a  &quot;great revolt&quot; ofLabour which is manifesting itself throughout  Europe.     The &quot;Herald&quot; is remarkably moderate, and, while asserting  that the morerecent resolutions from the Clyde must not be misunderstood, admits &quot; everyone onthe Labour side is anxious for a way out, if only the Government will find one.&quot;The London Conference.     The International Conference of Allied Socialist and Labour Parties was heldtoo late to receive proper treatment in the Labour press.     &quot; The New Statesman,&quot;  however, thought that the atmosphere surrounding theConference  had improved perceptibly since August  last,  and that the precedingConference  at Paris was an &quot; unqualified success.&quot;  Other papers, such as &quot; TheLabour Leader &quot; and &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; also anticipated good results.The Versailles Conference.    . Condemnation  of  the Versailles  note continues to be  a feature of the morepacifist section.  The &quot; Bradford Pioneer&quot; says it is a  &quot;bitter disappointment toall who wish to end the war as early as possible,&quot; while &quot; Common Sense &quot; thinks that. it destroyed &quot; at one fell stroke all the hopes of an early peace.&quot;  The &quot; WoolwichPioneer &quot; contrasts it with President Wilson&apos;s speech, which it regards as a greatutterance, putting not only the case  of America but that of all the Entente Powers&quot; with calm, reasoned expression, a sense of justice and strength of conviction.&quot;Propaganda and the War Aims Committee.     The reorganisation of the Department of Information meets with considerablecriticism, largely of a hostile nature.  The choice of Lord Beaverbrook as directoris condemned  by the &quot; Herald,&quot; which reserves its most bitter diatribes, however, forLord Northclifte,  whose  appointment is  declared to  be &quot;a stab in the back forGerman socialism, and the prostitution of  British  democracy.&quot;   The &quot;LabourLeader &quot; is less violent, but agrees  with the &quot;Herald &quot; that he cannot be trustedto issue &quot; full and accurate statements.&quot;   The &quot; Clarion&apos;s &quot; idea seems to be thathis efforts can have little result.     The actions of the War Aims Committee are also adversely criticised in certain quarters, notably by the  I.L.P. papers, such  as the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot;  and &quot;Forward.&quot;  The  former remarks significantly that Labour has withdrawn fromthe Committee, and proceeds to comment somewhat  caustically  on &quot; a suggested model speech  for National War Aims speakers &quot; which  is said  to have been circu-lated by the Committee.   This speech seems to have attracted some little attention.
The Russian Situation.    The absence of ah1 but bald reference to the Russian situation in the pacifistpapers is so marked as to deserve some mention.   The &quot; Call &quot; still defiantly main-tains that the attitude of the British Government is the cause of it all, but otherpapers such as the &quot; Clarion &quot; and the &quot; British Citizen &quot; seize the opportunity topoint the obvious moral.  The former is gloomy, and thinks that the German peopleare untouched by  &quot;no annexations and no indemnities propaganda,&quot; while  thelatter denounces Trotsky, and warns the nation  against such men.&quot; War Aims.&quot;    The &quot; New Age &quot; has a remarkably good article on the general question of waraims and methods.   It repeats its often laboured point of view that Germany&apos;s aimis  so to subject the Slavs, that  on them she can build up an impregnable CentralEmpire, and advocates the use in this country of President  Wilson&apos;s method ofcombining war with diplomacy, war on the  Prussian military power, and a diplo-matic appeal to the German democracy.  This article, though highly critical and out-spoken in places, might furnish the basis for a war aims leaflet.   The &quot; BradfordPioneer &quot; is discontented with the present situation as regards war aims, and thinksthat the Prime Minister&apos;s famous statement  was simply  intended to  hoodwinkLabour.The Peace Debate.    The debate in  the House of Commons on the 13th February meets with a some-what  disproportionate  share  of attention under the style of &quot; the Peace  Debate.&quot;&quot;Forward,&quot; the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot; and the &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; all  hold that itmarked a most significant  change in  the temper of the House, and  the  &quot;LabourLeader,&quot; if not the others,  is convinced that  the incidents  of that  week haveirreparably undermined the position of the  Government.Food.    The argument on the food question, though still voluminous, is not much to thepoint.   The writers like  the public generally are obviously waiting to  see how therationing scheme will work.  Meanwhile, with few exceptions they leave the subjectalone.   The &quot;Labour  Leader&quot; is on the whole optimistic, and compliments Mr.Clynes on the way he met his critics in the House.    The &quot; Clarion  &quot; heartily condemns those Radicals who desire to fling  off Statecontrol, and the &quot; British  Citizen&quot;  attacks Mr. Runciman,  whose  methods  ofdealing with the situation in its early stage are thought to be the cause of all thedifficulties which have since arisen.Soldiers and Politics.    The middle page article of  the &quot; Herald,&quot;  and also an article in another place,are devoted to a hotly written plea to the soldiers to support the Labour Party, whichis  said to be the only party  which has their interests  at heart.  It  condemns  theruling classes for the war and secret diplomacy, and asserts that the people need notfear to repudiate treaties which they have not made.                           III. District Reports.London and South-East em.    Slight unrest, mainly due to the question of wages, is reported from this area..    Thus, on the 19th, a meeting of  women railway workers was held at the EustonTheatre to consider the question of differences in the pay of men and women on therailways;  inflammatory speeches were made urging the women to strike for betterconditions, and alleging that the companies merely employed women in order tounder-cut  the men.   The meeting, however, does not seem &quot;to have  been very wellattended.   Again in the  Arsenal  and  at  Messrs. Cubitfs the wages question is-
 arousing some discontent.   In the former  case, the 1\ per cent  granted to piece- workers is causing unrest among the day  workers, who contend that the 12^ per cent, granted to themselves is now more than equalised by  the later grant to piece- workers.  In Messrs. Cubitfs the men are threatening to strike unless they hear shortly from the Ministry of Munitions with regard to the 12^ per cent.     The  position  as  regards man-power  seems on  the whole  improved.   The National Federation of Foundry Trades Unions has passed a resolution expressing strong  disapproval of  any stoppage of  work which would impede the output of munitions., but demanding facilities  for  an  International Workers&apos;  Conference. Again  at a  meeting of the  A.S.E.  on  the  18th, a delegate who had previously advocated a down tools policy now said that the men had lost their chance through not striking  months before.  The Branch Ballot of the British Houston Company was, however, opposed to the Bill.     The rationing scheme has not been in operation sufficiently long for any definite statement to be made as to its success. The food queues have, however, disappeared, and the indications are that matters are going smoothly and  to&apos; the satisfaction of the majority of the workers. South-Western.     The reports from this district are satisfactory.     Grievances of the Fratton Dockyard Branch of the Workers&apos; Union are under consideration by the Arbitration Board, but an  amicable decision is  expected.    At Southampton on the 17th, a meeting of General Workers was held, at which the chief speaker strongly condemned any strike policy, and stated  that it was the duty of the men to stick to the principles involved  in the present war to the best of their ability. V/est Midlands.    The situation in this area is much improved.    As regards the man-power proposals the feeling towards the Government seems distinctly better, and in Coventry in particular considerable enthusiasm  was  dis- played during Tank  Week.   The women in several munition  works have  passed resolutions in favour of the comb-out.    At a meeting of the A.S.E. at Dudley on the 17th, Mr. J. T. Brownlie defended the action of the A.S.E., and urged that the Government should respect the agreement of the 5th of May, and  demanded finally that all dilutees should be removed before skilled men.    The Ministry of Munitions reports that difficulties are still arising out of the bonuses.   Men who  have ha$ their piece-work prices or output bonuses adjusted in sympathy with the 121 Per ceit; bonus to time-workers are now claiming  in addition the right to participate in the *1\ per cent, bonus.    The National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Soldiers and Sailors are arranging demonstrations in every town where  branches of the Comrades of the Great War have been established, in order to expose what they term the real object of the latter organisation; namely, the exploitation of discharged men for political purposes.    The food situation seems to be still somewhat unsatisfactory in some parts, and a Food Protest meeting was to be arranged by the Birmingham Workers&apos;  Committee for the 24th.  The Walsall Food Committee  are trying the interesting experiment of increasing the  ration of meat  and margarine of ironworkers,  miners,  and others engaged on heavy work by 50 per cent. Yorkshire and East Midlands.    Some improvement  is reported in the situation in this area.  The man-powerproposals are meeting with less opposition, and it has again been reported that thereis little likelihood of a strike in Leeds or the surrounding districts.    The pacifists seem, however, to be still active both in Sheffield and Bradford. Inthe latter place, at a meeting of the I.L.P.,  Mr.  W. C. Anderson urged the workersto strive for peace, and as a first important step, to sweep  from power  Mr. LloydGeorge and the present corrupt Government.    Leicester also has been the scene of pacifist activity,  an important meeting of theUnion of Democratic Control having been held there on the 20th.      [1100-18]                                                     C
     The food situation shows a distinct improvement, and at Leeds it is said that supplies are quite plentiful, and that queues have disappeared.     At Nottingham, where an experimental communal kitchen has proved a great success, two  more are  to  be opened, and Derby is expected shortly to follow this example.     The most serious feature is the unrest  among the textile workers of the West Riding who, it is  feared, will strike unless the increase demanded is conceded to them.  The discharge of women from the munition works, is also likely to cause con- siderable  discontent  unless  some provision is made  for  their employment, or maintenance. North-Western.     Considerable unrest appears to prevail in this district, and the food situation is reported to have grown somewhat worse during the week.     As regards man-power, matters are at present fairly quiet, but it is feared that should  a single skilled man be called up before all dilutees have gone,  the men will immediately strike.  This view is supported by the Chief Investigation Officer of  the Ministry of Munitions, who thinks that feeling is tense.  A recurrence of hostility to dilution is also evident.     The Liverpool shop stewards, in view of  adverse reports from the Clyde and other districts, decided at a meeting on the 21st to take no further steps as regards a down tools policy, until the decisions of the International Socialist Conference were known.     The I.L.P. are at present showing decided activity at Barrow and Liverpool.     At Bootle, Seaforth, and Birkenhead the shortage of food is  said to be causing acute distress, while  the unrest among the coal-heavers at Liverpool  is apparently largely due to this. Northern.     Reports from this district are satisfactory, and  only a small proportion of  the workpeople are showing hostility  to the Man-Power Bill.   At  a meeting of  the Morpeth Borough Labour Committee, however, a resolution in favour of an Inter- national Workers&apos;  Conference was carried, and one speaker who  expressed himself in favour of the &quot; Knock-out Blow&quot; was subject to considerable interruption.     The chief grounds  for anxiety arise out  of  the  food situation, which is still acute in this  district.   Meat has been particularly short, and the men in the ship- yards are beginning to talk of downing tools. South Wales.     Slight unrest only is reported from this district.     The result of the A.S.E. ballot has been received  with some  misgivings  in South Wales, and the District Secretary of the Society has said that he fears trouble.     On the 17th a mass meeting of railway shopmen was held at Cardiff to con- sider the 121  Per cent-  award.    Considerable indignation was  expressed at the recent award, and a resolution was finally passed protesting  against the extension of the 121 Per cent- and 7^ per cent, to workers in the constructional  departments only, and giving the Government one month to bring all shopmen into line. Scotland.     The general situation in this  district appears to be  still quiet.  The  C.W.C. are attempting to recover their prestige, but their efforts are said to be making little headway.     Meetings of the War Aims Committee have been numerous and largely attended. At nearly all of them resolutions favouring the Governments war aims and pledgingsupport in carrying on the war, have been passed.     The District Committee of the Federated Trades have still further receded from their early  position, and their  national executive has repudiated their action  inthreatening to strike.     The discharge of men  in munition  works seems likely to cause some  trouble, more particularly at  Paisley, Where it is said that Irishmen have been taken oninstead.
     The food situation is still said to be acute^  more particularly in some of themining districts.  A demonstration is to be held shortly in Glasgow.     The shop stewards are much concerned  with the  action of Messrs. Beardmor-ein issuing cards to  all their employees at Parkhead, on which they are required toenter various particulars.   On enquiry the manager is stated to have informed one ofthe shop stewards that these particulars were required by the Ministry of Munitions.The shop steward accordingly called  at the local office  of  the Ministry and wasinformed that nothing was known of these cards.  A similar state of affairs is saidto exist in other shops, but the stewards have not yet decided on their  course ofaction.                                   IV. DISPUTES. (a.) Involving a stoppage of work.     The improvement in the general situation, which has been previously reported, still continues this week.     The Shipyard  Labour Department reports  eight new cases  of stoppage,  and nineteen which have been previously reported; in twenty-three cases, however, work has already been resumed.            Perhaps the most serious of these, a strike of  electricians at Glasgow, was caused by        non-payment of  the  12   per cent, bonus.   The men originally struck work in order  to        enforce a demand for the payment of arrears under the bonus to members engaged on        munitions.   When this was conceded they proceeded to demand an extension on behalf of        men not engaged on munitions work.  The men claim this bonus under an agreement with        the employers  that their wages should rise and fall with the engineering and shipbuilding        trades, including non-munition workers.  The employers refused this request,  and the union        called out their members on the 2nd February.  About 150 men are involved, and in some        cases the bonus has already been paid in full.           The riveters  at Glasgow resumed work on the 21st, on the  understanding that a  joint        conference of employers,  men&apos;s representatives, and, if requested, an  independent Govern-        ment official should investigate their grievance.           At Belfast 2,050 joiners employed at Messrs. Harland and Wolffs have ceased work        owing to dissatisfaction with the Committee on Production Award of the 12th.   The  men        claim a levelling  up  of their wages  to those of the highest paid skilled-time workers in the        local  shipyards.  A mass meeting held on the  19th decided not to resume work  until the.        claim was granted, but further meetings are being held,  and it is hoped to secure a speedy        resumption, though the result of the ballot of the 27th February is adA^erse.           At the Albert Docks, London, 110 shipwrights  ceased work on  Monday  last,  as  a        protest against the employment of non-unionist labour.  They threaten to call  out the whole        of the shipwrights if their grievance is not remedied.    The Ministry of Munitions reports the settlement of sixteen strikes,  which weremostly unimportant in character.  Five strikes in connection with the 12^ per cent.bonus award have also been settled  during the week.&apos;           The total  number of men affected is stated to have been about  2,500,  but,  with the        exception of the electricians on the Clyde, and less than a hundred workers  elsewhere, all        these have resumed.    The Coal Controller  reports only three  new cases of stoppages involving about2,500 men, in two of which work has already been  resumed.           The number  of men affected by the strikes which had originated previously was rather        under 3,000, but all except 170 of these are now back at work.           As regards the dispute of the Yorkshire  surfacemen, work has now been resumed at the        Monckton Main Colliery after meetings between the  management and the Yorkshire Miners&apos;        Association.    The dispute at the Wombwell Colliery over payment of  the  war wage for        overtime has been partially settled.    The War  Office  Contracts Department  has  only  one new  case involving  astoppage to report.           This is a small strike at Messrs. Dobbin and Ogilvie, Cork, with regard to a question of        wages and the discharge of some employees.  The matter is being dealt  with under the        Fair Wages Clause.           The dispute at Messrs. Hepburn, Gale, and Ross still continues. The firm  and the union        cannot agree upon a  form of tribunal acceptable to both.    The Chief Industrial Commissioner reports  two cases  involving a stoppage ofwork as having been referred to him.           One  of these  involved  about 200 women employed at Messrs. John Ireland and  Co.,        Dublin; the second  is a strike  of 150 enginemen  and  boiler tenters in cotton  mills in
         Blackburn, Darwen and Great Harwood, which has resulted in about 12,000 operatives         being out of employment.            All the members of the  Friendly Society of Ironfounders at West Bromwich are on         strike.  The trouble arose out of an application for an advance of 2/-, in order to bring the         rates  up to those of Birmingham.  It is said that  some of the employers are willing to-         grant the advance, but others  are determined to resist. (b.) Not involving a stoppage of work.      The Shipyard Labour Department has  only  twenty-nine  fresh  controversial cases to report.            Settlements have also been achieved in forty-three cases during the week.  The situation         in general,  as reported by this Department,  seems, indeed, to show distinct improvement,         although there are still outstanding a large number of contentious cases.      The Ministry of Munitions has still several disputes to record which have arisen out of the 12^ per cent, award,  and during the past  week settlements in six such cases have been effected.            At Messrs. Peter Pilkington, Preston, trouble was threatened on the score of Dilution,         the firm having dismissed two  skilled coremakers, and retained three women coremakers.  It         was finally agreed, however,  that one man  should be retained  and the other transferred         elsewhere.            A strike is also threatened at the Port Clarence Steel Works, Middlesborough, owing to         the refusal of some cranemen to abide by the award of the Committee on Production.            On the question of non-union labour, the  members of the Workers&apos; Union at the British         Dyes,  Ltd., Huddersfield, have threatened to strike unless all the unskilled and semi-skilled         men join the union.      The Coal  Controller reports  that a dispute at the Bedlay Colliery,  Lanarkshire, which was submitted to two  commissioners has again become acute.            A difference of opinion seems to exist  as to whether,  upon the appointment of  an         arbitrator, when the Commissioners disagree, all the evidence heard before them should be         once more investigated.   The  men object  to such procedure upon the ground of delay, and         the union have threatened to bring out all the men in the county to enforce their point.     The  War  Office  Contracts Department reports an application by the Birming- ham Curriers&apos;  Association for an advance  of 20 per cent, on current  rates.           Wages in this trade appear to be higher in this district than in others, and since the last         award output has been considerably decreased.  The policy of the Ministry of Labour is to        secure a revision of wages increases throughout the country, so as to obviate the necessity of        such isolated arbitrations as this.           The possibility of a serious strike among agricultural labourers  in Norfolk is reported.        An advance of wages was demanded, and owing to the refusal of the Farmers&apos; Federation to        concede the demand, the men in various districts are threatening to cease work.           Pi,eports of unrest among  bakers continue to be  received  from  various  districts.  The        trouble in most cases appears to be the old difficulty about Sunday baking.     Sixty-nine cases have  been  referred  to  the  Chief  Industrial  Commissioner during  the week.   A number of these have  been disposed of without recourse to arbitration.   A claim for the  12^  per  cent, by various departments of the Manchester Corporation  has been  referred for settlement  to the  Committee on Production.     The Committee on  Production  has heard thirty-six cases this week, of which the most important was a claim  by  the dock  labourers of the  Port of Liverpool for an increase of 2/- a day, a half-day on Saturday with  a full day&apos;s pay,  and doublepay for  Sunday labour on present day rates.
