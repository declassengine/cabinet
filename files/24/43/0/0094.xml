His Britannic ftflajestyfs GovernmentColonel JonesSECRET,Intelligence Bureau,Weekly Report on Auetria^ftim^ary. XXVIII.(2nd Karon,  1918.)Department of Information.BAV/028.     The most recent  events in Austria^hnngary are a practicalobject lesson of the  extent to whioh internal and foreign policyis intertwined in that country.   By a seeming contradiction theconclusion of the first peace treaty has provoked a violent in-tornal crisis in Austria.     The acute desire for  peace among all classes of the populationhas Ions been a matter of common knowledge: and it was being saidquite openly that Count Czernin dared not return from Brest withempty hands.   He has now returned with the Ukraine treaty inhis pocket, tactfully leaving the task of cleaning up in NorthernRussia tc his German colleagues, and preserving for himself thecamouflage cf &quot;No annexations&quot;.     The basis of agreement betv/een Vienna anJ Kiev is threefold -(a) a combination against the common enemy, Bolshevism, (b)  thedesire of Kiev to find customers  and an economio basiB for theexistence of the new State, and (c) the desire of Vienna to con-ciliate one of its own three hostile Slav groups7, the Ukrainians,and to exploit their dominant influence with their kinsmen in thenew Republic.   The action of the Rada is regarded by the averageRussian as gross treachery to Russia.   In View, however, of theabsolute atrophy of government throughout the rest of Russia, theimpossibility of finding any support or backing to the east andabove all the deliberate designs of the Petrograd Bolsheviks, notmerely to oust from power, but to annihilate politically even thevery advanced classes and parties on which the Rada&apos;s support
rests,  we have no right to &quot;be surprised at the action of Kiev inconcluding peace.   It is the action of men to whom the specialinterests and traditions of the Ukraine rightly or wrongly meanfar more than the general interests of what was Russia.   More-over it is important to remember that their action is bound tohave been influenced to a considerable extent by the Ukrainians ofGalicia, upon whom the Ukraine has been, and will be more thanever in the-: future dependent for its Intelligentsia and drivingforce.    The President of the Rada, Professfcr Hrusevsky, theleading Ukrainian historian and the man whose writings haveaffected most deeply the intellectual outlook of hie nation, hasfor years past, though a Russian subject and landed proprietor,been professor cf history at Lemberg University and in the closestpossible touch with political life in Austria: and several otherleaders of the new Republic hail from Galicia.   There is noreason to doubt the good faith of the Rada leaders in originallyputting forward the programme of a federal Russian Republic, ofwhich the Ukraine would form one independent unit.   But whenthey saw the flood of anarchy rising round them to the east, andwhen the Bolsheviks themselves by their policy of negotiationmade it finally  impossible for the Ukraine  to hold aloof, thelogioalslld inevitable consequences of the situation thus createdwere the Rada&apos;s  declaration of complete independence and itsconclusion of terms with the enemy.   The policy of Petrogradis  as directly responsible, though perhaps not in the same degree,for the action of the Ukraine, as it is for placing Roumaniain  an impossible position and driving Finland into anarchy anddespair *     Count Gzernin and his official organs have succeeded to someextent  in rehabilitating themselves with public opinion owing tothe mistakes  committed by Trotski towards the Rada.   Trotski&apos;sattitude  on  self-determination during the first two stages of tho
                            m 3 -Br*et negotiations was,  so far as theory gees,  both consistentand effective and undoubtedly exercised very great influenceamong the masses in Austria.    It remains to be seen whether hisinconsistencies towards Kiev, Jassy and Helsingfors and thelamentable figure which he Cut during the final stage at Brestwill efface the original impression in Austria, or whether hisfaults will be outweighed by the indignation which evidentlyprevails very widely in Austria-Hungary at Germanyfs policy atriding reugh-shod ever the Russian Revolution.     On ICth January Trotski recognised the Rada as the independentrepresentative of the Ukraine.   When the Rada, on the basis ofthat recognition, negotiated separately, he promptly withdrew itand invented a rival government at Kharkov just as he tried  \desperately to invent a rival government in Roumania (the so-called &quot;High Collegium&quot;).   In both cases these rival bodiesconsisted of Russian Bolsheviks and were in no way representativeof the Ukraine or Roumania.     The Ukraine and Food for Austria.  The Austrian press isalready full of calculations as to the economic effects of peacewith the Ukraine, though here end there caveats are enteredagainst the assumption that the food question is solved.   TheAustro-Hungarian authorities must be fully aware that the stocksavailable are by no means as great as is sometimes imagined, andthat the difficulties of transport are enormous.   But theyobviously finct it useful to exploit the. psychological effect ofpeace, which encouras&amp;s the under-fed and suffering populationto live in hope of the supplies coming from the east.   Kencepeace is treated as an undoing of the blockade, and a fatal blowto England&apos;s designs.     According to calculations in the Hove, ffreie Presse, Austria(not Austria-Hungary) needs to import 560 trucks of grain, dailyto meet the deficit.   The four railway connections between the
                             -  4  -Ukraine and Austria are distinctly  bad:  while  their uee  for theimport of food supplies is rendered difficult  by  the &quot;presence-  ofthe army (though of course in reduced numbers) in Galicia.   Hencetfca main route is the Danube waterway.   The Iron Gatos  can atbest let twenty tugs through daily.   This is  the equivalent of1,000 trucks of grain, and when shared between the Central Powers,would give to Aj^irla (after deducting the German, Hungarian andBulgarian shares) roughly 300 trucks per diem, or a  little more  thanhs,lf the deficit.   The tons in which this partial relief iswelcomed is the measure of the  desperate situation.    It is ad-mitted that even if the grain has once been brought  up the Danubethere will still be very great  difficulties of distribution intothe interior.   The Austrian railways are known to be  deterioratingv.ry seriously, thus oexplicating tenfold all  questions  of trans-port .     One serious difficulty is  the lack  of an  Ukrainian  currency.The Rada has issued new notes to the amount of ten million1^&amp; % ?J2L tc roubles): but these are not accepted by  thepopulation, which regards them with distrust.    Obviously theRada hopes to secure cash from the Central Powers in return for exports, but it is by no means  certain to obtain  it.    Owing tothe altogether exceptional conditions, there is likely to be atemporary return to primitive barter, the two  States conductingan exchange in kind without money passing.  The  Ukrainian govern-ment  is expected to maintain a kind of grain monopoly  and to act as. seller in all transactions,  recisving goods in return.  Thus in effect customs would be in abeyance between the two countries for the time being.     The economic sections of the peace  treaty are based upon  the commercial treaty of 1006 between Austria-Hungary and  Russia.    It is assumed that there will be three economic stages  -  (l) up to 1st August next, for the exchange of surplus products, (2) a
provisional period up to 30th Jwu 1919,  r- newable for six monthsat a time, curing which the new commercial treaty is to be arranged,and (3) th*  permanent settlement under that treaty.     Great attention ia bt.in.  devoted in  the preea to economicconditions in the Ukraine.    It ia pointed out that the eightGovernmente now definitely inoludeA in the new State accountedin 1911 for as much as 53 pi:r cent of tho whole harv; 8t of EuropeanRussia: and that the Ukraine includes five-sixths of the sugar beetarea and two-thirds of the tobacco area of Russia; while as regardsraw materials its output amounts to the following percentages efthe former Russian total - silver 90, lead 80, copper 31, manganese32, iron ore 74, coal 79* salt 53.     The official attitude is one of relief at the removal of the&quot;Russian danger&quot; anA the-: Pan-Slav bogey.    Great satisfaction isaffectoo at the fact that Russia is no longer a neighbour, but onlya distant Stati: separates by the wide Ukrainian and polish.territories.   Special emphasis is laid on the fact that Austria-Hungary dots not intend to continue military operations againstRussia, but at the vtry most to secure the various emporiums inthe Ukraine against Bolshevist attacks.   It is sought to palliateGermany1 s attitude in continuing the war by pointing out thatTrotski*s attitude left economic relations in an unregulatedand impossible condition, wnich the indescribable chaos in thegovernment  offices of Petrograd renders even more acute.   Thisis  of  course the  official way of saving that one of Germany*schit-f  underlying motives is the renewal of the old commercialtreaty with Russia on rwen more favourable terms.   This was oneof  Germany^ main objectives even on the eve of^war, and hasbecome so more than  ever to-day.     The Cholm Qtut ation.   The boundaries laid down by the treatyassign to the Ukraine the whole Government of Cholm, the westernportion  of  which  has a purt-ly Polish population:  ana this has
                           - 6 -arouse! intense indignation, not merely among tile Poles of Warsaw,where the Kucharzewski Cabinet has resigned as a protest, butequally among the Poles of America.   A curious feature: of thesituation is that the Cholm affair completely took by surprisenot only the Polish Club in Vienna, but Austrian public andParliamentary opinion generally.   Indeed on the Tery eve of theorisis one of the Polinh leaders, speaking for the Club, expressedfull confidence. in Count Czernin and his views upon Poland: and itwas expeoted to the very last that both Cholm and Podlaohia wouldbe assigned to Poland.   Everything suggesto that there was sometypically Austrian &quot;deal&quot;, by wMch the Poles were to be allowed toexpend their ra e upon the loss Of Cholm, oo that whenjLt wasrestored to them later,- they should be more ready to accept theeveritual loss of eastern G&amp;licia to the Ukraine.   Thi*) theory isconfirmed by study of the now frontier on the man: for as drawnat Brest it is wildly impossible from a strategic point of viewand can hardly have been intended a^ a permanenee.     The announcement of the treaty came in the very middle of apolitical crisis in Austria.   Dr. von Seidler, having failed toobtain a majority for the Budget, placed hi-? resignation in thehands of the Emperor, who declined to accept it.   The fiercestopposition to him oane from the Czechs, vho *,7ere inceno*c3 txt certainconcessions offered behind their back to the German Bohemdans: butthe Socialists and the Southern Slavs were not willing to go to thesame extremes as the Czechs, since they upheld publicly the doctrine,&quot;Better the worst Parliament than none at all&quot;.   The Czechs on theother hand openly challenge the jurisdiction of the ViennaParliament, and are no longer working to strengthen it.   Seidlerrscollapoe however was determined by the Poles, r.ho in committeedeliberately decided not to support the-Budget even for two months,owing to their intense dissatisfaction with political conditions.
                           - 7 -     The situation, is thus extraordinarily serious.    It is notmerely that the Austrian Parliament hao refused to the governmentthose necessities of State Which every Europe?an parliament hasgranted under stress of war.   If its action was merely due to adesire to replace a &quot;bureaucratic &quot;by a Parliamentary government, itcould he understood.   But none of the partieo want thio,  andtheir action - as is openly recognised by the Arbeiter Zeitungand such rare organs as are not afraidtb face the facts -  ianothing less than a vote against the State, a denial of theAustrian idea.   Only the day before, the Czech agrarian deputy.%r. Zahradnik, had declared in Parliament, &quot;for me there  is noAustrian fatherland, but only the fatherland where I wao born&quot;:and thio is thoroughly characteristic of the other Slavs.    Thus0X1 impasse,has been reached, which is recognised as no longer oneof the countless governmental or Parliamentary crises of the past,but as a &quot;State crisis&quot;.   It may be argued that Austria can begoverned without a Parliament, and that the undignified farce ofthe Heichsrat may safely be dispensed with.   But on the otherhand the ISnperor and his advisers dare not risk thio, not  only onaccount of Working-class  opinion, which before and especially sincethe great strike clings to Parliament as a vital necessity, but alsoon account of foreign opinion, since they oannot afford to risk suchan open confession of the impossibility of governing Austrir *raconstitutional lines.   Austria would then at once find herselfat a hopeless disadvantage as against the Western and Americandemocracies.     Reports from reliable sources in neutral countries confirmthe view that the internal situation of the Dual Monarchy  ishighly critical.   It is more than ever fortunate for Austria-Hungary that all immediate military menace has been removed ftfomh*r frontiers: for everything goes to suggest that she coull notresist prepare such as that with which Germany is confronted.                                            2.3.18.
