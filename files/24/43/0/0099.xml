                          2.                                   294      2 112-lb.,  2 25-lb. and 1 40-lb. (phos.) on objec-tlve-all burst in between hangars.   400 rounds into- hutments, hangars-and searchlights.      Just before dark three  machines went up to wait closeto the lines until Frescaty lit up, with orders to glide downand bomb them just before their machines took off.   On arrivalover the objective these 3 machines observed 16 pairs oflights all lined up, which, on decending lower they identifiedas machines.   One pilot dropped his bombs among them from1,000 feet and then put 30 rounds from his &quot;Pom-Pom&quot; rightalong the. line of machines.   The majority of the lights  .went out in pairs, but some of them still remained on.      The remaining machines  left in pairs at Intervals.Several observers are positive that they obtained direct hitson the hangars and hutments,      Practically all lights  were doused, by the time the laterpilots arrived at the objective, although several machineswere observed taking off, and one pilot was successful incausing one of these to crash.      A number of enemy aircraft were observed flying.   Oneof our machines on its&apos;homeward journey, at an altitude of4,000-ft. observed an enemy aircraft pass beneath them whenflying in the same direction and offering a very good target.The observer immediately fired 100 rounds at 50-ft. range intothe enemy aircraft which went down vertically out of control.He watched it almost down to  the ground, but lost sight of itbefore it actually reached the ground.      Three lighted aerodromes were observed:  one close toPagny and another near Thiancourt and a third, near Chambly.      Anti-aircraft fire was  considerable and machine gunswere very active,      The night was bright moonlight, calm, but misty.      Total weight of bombs dropped 4,432-lbs.
