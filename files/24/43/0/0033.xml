GHfc/008.WEEKLY REPORT ON HOLLAND. VIII.       (23 February, 1918)./d     The labour unrest which has, for some months past, been afeature in nearly all belligerent and neutral countries has nowappeared in Holland.   The Dutch Syndicalists proclaimed a generalstrike on February 4.  All the members of the moderate TradesUnions opposed the movement, and at least one of them - the Associationof Trades Unions of Amsterdam which is stated to count eight timesas many members as the Syndicalists vho were promoting the strike -issued a strongly worded proclamation appealing to its membersnot to participate.   There seems little doubt that the ideasspread broadcast in Russia by the Bolsheviks are being rapidlydisseminated in Western Europe and not least in Holland.  At presentthe moderate Party easily maintains the upper hand, end unlessthe food-problem becomes more acute than it is at present theywill probably continue to do so.  The average Dutchman is cool-headedand, in normal times, is about the last person in the world toshare the opinions of Lenin and Trotskyj  but hunger and discontentare certainly on the Increase in the Netherlands as indeed theyseem to be in most countries  and it is impossible to say whatpolitical disturbances famines might produce.  The strikes lasteda very short time, and nothing of importance seems to have happenedbeyond an attempt on the part of a few hooligans, unbalanced byanarchist literature, to blow up a powder-magazine at Amsterdam.According to the &quot;Volk&quot; (the Socialist newspaper) the leaders of  thestrike have no constructive programme and merely preach unreasonablehatred of everybody and everything.   Instead of organising thepover of the people in a sober way they prepare the way frr excessesof every kind.
     The sand and gravel controversy between the British andNetherlands Governments is still continuing, but the prohibitionto use British-controlled cables for Dutch commercial telegramshas been temporarily raised pending a settlement of the wholequestion.  This concession will remove a source of irritationwhich has of late hampered the progress of our propaganda inHolland,  The transit of sand and gravel is due to begin again onMarch 15 next.     The provisional Agreement between the United States of Americaand Holland regarding the 82 Dutch ships which have been for somemonths lying in American ports has given considerable offence InGermany, and some of the leading newspapers, such as the &quot;CologneGazette&quot;, pretend to consider it a violation of neutrality andthreaten, If it is carried out, to blaok list all Dutch shipping.The German reasoning is briefly this.  In the present war, underthe pressure of the Entente, shipping space has become aninstrument of wsr and whoever gives shipping space to Germany&apos;senemies violates neutrality.  The German threats do not appear tohave produced much effect in Holland.  Some of the German newe-papers take another line and try to persuade the Dutch thatRussian grain will soon be at the disposal of the Central Powersand that then the Netherlands will be independent of America.The grain-dealers in Holland are not much impressed vith thisargument, as they think that the anarchical f^tate of Russia willfor months prevent any large supply of grain from reaching Germany,not,to speak of the urgent demand for bread in many parts of thevast territory of Russia itself.  The food supply In Holland earlyin the month showed on the whole a tendency to decrease, fat,milk and meat being especially short.   Mr Posthuma, the ministerof Agriculture, who at present acts as Food Controller,  has issueda lengthy review of his policy past and present.  He insists

The Gorman threats do not appear tohave produced much effect in Holland.  Some of the German news-papers take another line and try to persuade the Dutch thatRussian grain will soon be at the disposal of the Central Powersand that then the Netherlands will be independent of America.The grain-dealers in Holland are not much impressed vith thisargument, as they think that the anarchical ^tate of Russia willfor months prevent any large supply of grain from reaching Germany,not,to ,speak of the urgent demand for bread In many parts of thevast territory of Russia itself.  The food supply In Holland earlyin the month showed on the whole a tendency to decrease, fat,milk and meat being especially short.   Mr Posthuma, the ministerof Agriculture, who at present acts as Food Controller, has issueda lengthy review of his policy past and present.  He insists
(contrary to S^r Treub, the Minister of Plnantt.) that the presentsystem of distribution must co ntinue, but raises no objection tothe establishment of a separate crisis Department under a separateMinister.  He suggests appointing a Committee to consider thedividing of the population into classes, the upper classes to bepartly excluded from the distribution of cheap food in order tosave expense.    The total stock of grain available for human foodIn Holland on January 1, 1918, was 96,643 tons.  According to theMinister&apos;e statement this amount is not sufficient to continuethe present ration of bread until March 1, if grain is usedexclusively.  A certain quantity of wheatand rye (about 46,500 tons(40q wheat and 40,000 tons of rye) are still expected from the homecrops.  If these are included the bread supply is secured till theend of April.    The 30,000 tons of potato flour will eke out thebread supply till Lay 15.  Beyond that time the supply Is notsecured, and unless foreign grain arrives the bread ration willhave to be reduced if Holland is to have bread until the next crop..     T&apos;ith regard to raw materials Mr ?osthuma thinks  that no con-corn need be felt in the near future.  There is enough sugar tillnext season.  The prospects of the egg production are unsatisfactory,                                                 of thethe lack of food having led to the killing of much/stock of poultry.                                   KAs regards meat, the supply of portf is poor, and the extensiveslaughtering of cattle has thinned the live-stock of the country.The upshot of the Minister&apos;s statement is that the people will,If the war continues o,ver next autumn, have to prepare for greatprivations.23.2.18.
