I am afraid there is not much cheerful news to give you from here. Our present masters, the Bolsheviks, are behaving is what is apparently a ? incomprehensible manner. One cannot credit them with being as completely foolish as they appear to be, and for ? time I was absolutely ? and could not make ? or ? of the ?, but lately I have had a clue, which seems to make everything clear and which I believe is the true explanation, as it seems to fit in so well with the facts, and with each successive step they take. It is that the Bolshevik leaders are nothing more or less than monarchist agents, and that they are preparing for a restoration of the monarchy. This is what I have heard from a fairly reliable source connected with the plat or movement, that Lenia and Trotsky are monarchist agents and are acting under directions received from Germany, who wishes to see the monarchy restored and has no use for a near neighbour like Russia as a social democracy and who is in mortal terror of the social democratic contagion spreading over her frontiers. She has therefore agreed to aid in restoring the monarchy and has come to an understanding with the supporters of the old regime in Russia that in doing so a separate peace or cessation of hostilities is to be arranged and that this is to be followed by an alliance or secret treaty, giving her great influence in Russia and great commercial advantages. The method of working is first to produce anarchy, chaos and terror and to bring things to such a pass that the country will cry out for any change from the horror in which it finds itself and will be ready to accept any Government, even the Monarchy, if it promises to restore order and tranquility.  Then when the moment is ripe they will make a coup d&apos;etat and proclaim a Restoration. Naturally I do not know all the details, but the main lines as given to me are as follows:-  First ultra-Socialist and Anarchist Decrees abolishing private property and confiscating all wealth are to come; all trade is to be paralysed; railways are to be made unworkable; agrarian crime is to be stimulated; and the estates are to be burnt and looted. Civil war is to be started whenever possible; the soldiers are to be divided up as much as possible, sent to fight civil wars in as many different districts and as far apart as possible, and at the same time the disbanding of the Army is to be proceeded with as rapidly as possible. This latter is not difficult
as the Amy is disbanding itself. Meanwhile out of the million or more German and Austrian prisoners a force of 200,000 to 300,000 is being armed and organised in the Volga districts, in the German colonist regions, under German office and when the moment comes they are to seize the two capitals, the railways (the principal railway officials and organisation are already in German pay), and all the military stores and arsenals. At the same time a German force will he held ready on the frontier at a spot selected, and from which all Russian troops will have been withdrawn, and no doubt all arrangements are made to throw it rapidly into Petrograd. But this force will only be employed if it is absolutely necessary, as the idea is to create the impression that the whole movement is engineered by the Russians themselves and that Germany has nothing to do with it. The date fixed is about a month hence. Now whether this is all bunkum and the product of an ingeni? imagination I can&apos;t say.  At first I thought it was nothing more, but the more one comes to piece things together the more, probable it appears to be. In the first place a very large number of the active members of the Bolsheviks are old "Achraniki", i,e, the former secret political police, and many more well known as members of the "Black Hundred", and a great many are former Police officials. Most of them have enrolled themselves as Bolsheviks quite recently. It may be that they are only swimming with the tide, but it seems improbable. It is said that the active Bolshevik organisation consists of an inner and outer ring.  The members of the inner ring are the adherents of the Monarchy and pull all the strings and are mostly "Achraniki". They are employing exactly their former methods as under the autocracy, i.e. bribery and terrorism to influence members of the outer ring, whose services they need. The members of the outer ring art genuine Bolsheviks, who believe in their peculiar social theories, and  who have no knowlege whatever of the plot of the inner ring, though some of them, as I have said, have been got at by the inner ring of conspirators, but do not themselves know which of their follow? is connected with the inner ring. This is an old trick of the "Achraniki", to have their own agents, spies or tools among the members of the Society they are watching without letting these know which among themselves are agents of the Police. The programme as outlined is being faithfully carried cut. A Decree confiscating all house property and land has just been promulgated; civil war is being started everywhere; financial Decrees have a made payments impossible; factories are everywhere closing; and all trade is coming to a standstill. But still the social machine is not to be allowed to stop entirely till the moment is ripe, when the intention is to pile ? on ? till the whole country cries out in agony. Of course the soldiers are Bolsheviks almost to a man, and they are being used as blind tools; both the genuine Bolsheviks and the conspirators are equally anxious to crush and suppress all moderate parties, whom they fear, and they therefore act in concert in trying to suppress the Cadets.

The overwhelming majority of the members elected to the Constituent Assembly are Social revolutionaries, whose doctrines are scarcely distinguishable from those of the Bolsheviks. Why then are the Bolsheviks so resolutely determined that the Constituent Assembly shall not meet? If there is any truth in the Story of the plot, it offers a reasonable explanation. The conspirators, it is said, know well that the soldiers will be furious when they find that they have been made dupes tools for restoring the Monarchy, but after  being used to terrorise the country and /
do what is required of them they will &quot;be dispersed and disarmedas far as possible, and they have no leaders and will themselvesbe worn out and have had enough of bloodshed.   A comparativelyemail number will be kept under aaiae, well paid and well fedand with plenty of promises, and it is expected that they willsupport any form of government which pays them well, feedsthem and promises them lavishly;  the rest won&apos;t count.It all sounds like a fairy story, but it may be true!   I doubt,however, myself whether such a plot will be successful.   Itmay have a temporary success, but it would certainly lead toprolonged&apos; civil war, for the Cossacks in the south and theUkraine districts would certainly not accept the position.   TheUkraine has already declared war upon the Bolsheviks *   Alsothe middle classes would refuse to accept it, and though theyare not active fighters they can wear out their opponents bypassive resistance and strikes.   It is suggested that thefirst act of the restored Monarchy would be to confiscateall proprietors1 land and give it to the peasants sacrificingthe aristocracy and landowners to buy the peasants&apos; support,and thus basing the restored Monarchy on peasant suffrage.This might have a very good effect and would be immenselypopular amongst the peasantry, who  hitherto have only beenfed with promises of land and see no immediate prospect oftheir fulfilment.   If the restored Monarchy gave the peasantsfreehold land, with the right of disposing of it as they chose,and at the same time allowed the dispossessed proprietors themonopoly of making and selling vodka, all parties would besatisfied and in a very few ye^rs the land would be again in thehands of the proprietors.         In spite of the enormous m&amp;a&amp; of paper currencyprinted and circulated (almost exactly tenfold what it was beforethe war) there is a famine of money;  there is non$ to ba had.The explanation is that everything is tenfold as dear andtherefore the parity of currency to needs remains unaltered,while the money is going to the villages to. buy grain andcotton etc., and is there being hoarded as there are no goodsfor the villages to buy.   It is an extraordinary position.The banks are talking of federating among themselves, andissuing their own notes, guaranteed by them all  jointly.Such notes would certainly be accepted anywhere very willingly,and I think necessity will force them to carry out some suchproject.   Otherwise all &quot;buying and selling must stop for wantof ourrency.         Three officers were killed here in Moscow lastnight.   They were walking in the street and a party ofsoldiers met them and wanted to tear off their epaulettes.  Theofficers resisted and were killed.   I hear that officers arecontinually being stopped by aoldiers and having theirepaulettes torn off.   One scarcely, however, ever sees anofficer nowadays.   Their pay has been reduced to S roubles amonth, the same as a common soldier, only the soldier getsclothed and fed and the officer does not.   we have now hiredthree officers as night watchmen for this house.   They arequite nice young men, though not very interesting.   Theytake turns of three hours each every night.   Fancy officersbeing willing to take jobs as night watchmen.   I haveto watch every five days, first from 10 to 2 a.m,, andthen frem 2 to 6 a.ro.   It is loathsome ttork and most dull,though we have a warm room to sit in and there is aselectric alarum to call us out if necessary.   Cne manonly keeps watch outside the gates and can call the othersby means of this alarum.   We were turned out once lastnight aa a lot of drunken men tried to get into the yard,but they were just roysterers and nothing else and soon wenten.   There are any number of robberies every day, and no
3ort of police, so these house guards are very accessary.  Inpetrcgrad the K--- -office was held up by a band of armed banditwho got away with 20,000 roubles, but one of the office boysmanaged to slip out of a window unobserved and gave the alarm tour workmen, who chased the brigands.  The latter, got away andgot into various trams, but our men stopped on; tram and hauledthree of the robbers out, killed them on the- spot, and recovereand brought back 11,800 roubles.  I hear that some telephonesare working again, but it will probably be a long time beforeours are connected, as they vere a/tiongst the lot that were badlydamaged during tha fighting last month.                                    Petrograd, December 25th.          I was at the Embassy, at a Conference of the Alliesyesterday, but-as the proceedings wore secret and confidential2 cannot tell you anything about it.  I was 23 hours on my wayfrom Moscow.  I got a berth in the &quot;International&quot;, but therewas no bedding, nor could I get anything to eat, but luckilyI had some sandwiches with me.  Here things seem to be quiet,though there is sporadic shouting in the streets in onequarter or another almost every night.  The feeling here iathat &amp; separate peace between Germany and Russia is inevitable,but that it is very doubtful whether South Russia and theUkraine will endorse it, and they will probably split off asseparate political entities and negotiate separate terms if theynegotiate at all.Tfaitehall Gardens,  S.W.     February 25th,  1918.
