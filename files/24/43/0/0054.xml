S. /L482,\                   War Cabinet*         Cessation .of jthe 3arodents Of Jute,     Memoranda by the Seore tary^of State for War*          I feel it  my duty to bring before the War Cabinet thesubjoined minute by the Surveyor General of Supply. Mr Andrew Weir,in order that the decision reached with regard&apos; to the total cessationof the importation of jute may be reconsidered^                                                 DERBY.2?th February,1918.Minute of the Surveyor General of Supply^          I learn that the&apos;War Cabinet and the Ministry of Shippinghave decided, for a period of six weeks ending on March 31st,, thatall shipments from Overseas of Wool, Jute, Flax, Hemp, Leather andTanning materials are to be absolutely cut off.          This Department has an Import programme of these articlesamounting in all to 74,000 tons per month, intended in much thelarger proportion to supply materials for manufacturing Army goods,a moderate surplus being available to keep the respective Tradesgoing on the reduced scale which War conditions allow.          The reasons on which the decision to cut off suppliesis based are so powerful that we had no difficulty, in our con-sultation this morning,  in agreeing that it would not be possibleto appeal for re-consideration, except in a case of the most vitalnecessity.   On a careful examination of all the available facts,I cannot recommend you to lodge any appeal in respect to wool,hides and tanning material or hemp,   Th question of flax scarcelyarises at this time of year.          We are left therefore to consider Jute, and I am sorryto have to say that in the opinion of this Department it isabsolutely impossible to acquiesce in the decision to cut offsupplies of Jute.   The position is as follows:   During 1917*the consumption of Jute was about 24,000 tons per month, of whichperhaps one-fifth served the Export Trade, while the remainder wasused in this country and by the Army abroad.   As it became evidenttowards the end of last year that supplies of raw Jute on an adequatescale could not be kept up,  steps were taken to prepare for the totalsuppression of the Export Trade at whatever sacrifice to Tradeconnections and to the requirements of Allied countries-   At thesame time, it was intimated that for all purposes except vitalNational necessities, a severe limitation of the use of Jute would beinstituted.   As a result of these measures, the consumption of Jutehas been brought down from 24,000 tons per month in 1917, to 16,000tons per month in January of this year, and it is intended not topermit any greater consumption than this reduoed figure.,          I am sorry to say that at the beginning of this monththe stock of Jute was only about 45,000 tons-.   Shipments on&apos;theway are very small, and it is calculated that on the present reducedscale of consumption, if the suspension of shipments for six weekstakes place, we shall, at the end of May, have in stock barelysufficient for one month1s consumption.
          I have to call your attention most earnestly to the factthat at least 13,000 tons of Jute per month is required for thesupply of sand-tag3 and of sacks for flour, oats,  and -otherindispensable food-stuffs without which the country cannot hecarried on even for a week.   $lie remaining quantity of 3,000 tonsis partly employed in the production of a large variety of articlesrequired for the Army and Navy and other indispensable purposes.A small portion continues to be employed in producing goods suchas carpets and floor cloth, which may be regarded as superfluousfrom one point of view, but which furnish almost the sole employmentof certain towns and Districts.   Kidderminster, for instance, wouldbe brought to an absolute standstill if we cut off its supply ofJute - its requirements are about 100 tons per month - and Kirkcaldywould be in a somewhat similar position.   In both cases Jute is arelatively small but absolutely irreplaceable constituent in thestaple product of the District.   A similar remark applies to theJute supply of Manchester, Leeds,  Bradford, ete* for packing textilegoodi.          To sum up,  the stocks of Jute in this country are whollyinsufficient to meet any period of suspended shipments.    The supplyof sand-bags, and therefore the safety of the British Army, would beimperilled.   The food-stuffs, which it is proposed to import inincreased supplies,  could not be distributed for want of sacking.Compared to these two vital considerations, it. is. relativelyunimportant that  several manufacturing districts would be broughtto an absolute standstill, men, women and children being thrown intothe street in thousands for want of a relatively small quantity ofJute material.          I represent to you with the utmost urgency that you shouldappeal to the v/ar Cabinet to continue the shipments of Jute fromIndia to this country on the agreed scale of 16,000 tons per month,which is the bare minimum necessary if any margin -of safety, howeversmall, is to be retained.i
