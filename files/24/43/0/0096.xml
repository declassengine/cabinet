iIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVIKNI-^NT.)iCRlT..T.3796.WAR  CABINET.REPORT BY THE WAR CABINET Q3N THE YEAR, 1917.       (Re-port &quot;by Lord Curs on) ,          The War Cabinet having entrusted me with the taskof going through-the proposed Report on the year 1917 , anddeciding upon the form of its ultimate publication, I make this &apos;report.          Suspicions had .been expressed in the course of thediscussion in Cabinet that the Report might be exposed tocriticism.     (a) as belittling the-work-of the previous Government or         Governments,;     (b) as claiming undue credit for -the present Government;     (c) as partaking of the nature of advertisement rather         than of history , and sacrificing substance to         literary form;     (d) as giving information that ought to be withheld-.          Very careful revision has , I think /effectuallyremoved the last named risk.          Having read through the Report from beginning to end,I have been relieved to find that there was little or noground for any of the three former apprehensions.          On the contrary the Report is a dispassionate, solid,and well balanced compilation., which will be of great interestto the country,  and value to the historical student of thefuture.  It is the record of a year oi very remarkable work;not a eulogy, except of the classes and forces who performed it.It contains no disparagement of the efforts of earlier Governments,          I have carefully eliminated ovOTy paragraph or phrasethat might savour of self-laudation of the present Government; theppssagessuggested by the Prime Minister have been inserted; andwe may now , in my opinion , authorise the Immediate publicationof the Report not only with equanimity ,  but with an expressionof sincere gratitude to the officials who have so conscientiouslyand ably compiled it.(Intd.)  C.  of K.March 2nd , 1918.
