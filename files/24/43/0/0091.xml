SiWMv V  mIsm26:HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS 3HITAFNIC- MAJSSTY*3 GQ^HK^IUHT) .,i in n T3 Tf TIJ.T, 3791,WAR CABINETCOAL  FOR  ITALY.   Copy of letter dated 1st 2-Iarch,  1916 from Fir3t j;qrj^cf      the Admiralty to the Secretary,  War Cabinet.(circulated with reference to War Cabinet 355j  Minute 7).Dear Kankey,          I see in the Minutes of War Cabinet 355 of the 27thFebruary, an item on the supply of coal to Italy.          As ycu knew,  I have recently returned from Italy, andhave given considerable attention to investigating and discussingthis coal question.  I am perfectly clear that unless Italy issupplied with coal, it is not a question of whether she gees onwith the war, it is a certainty that she will be unable to go onwith the war.          My interest in Italy is, of oourse, both specific andgeneral.  The supply cf coal to Italy .is one problem,  but thesupply of coal for the Italian Navy is the part of it whichinterests me most.  Their stocks have been steadily diminishing,and they have had to give some 180,000 odd tons of coal (which isthree months&apos; supply for their Navy) to railway and other services.The Naval stocks are now very low, and the other stocks arepractically non-existent.  Unless the coal situation is savedotherwise, there can be no doubt that, temporarily,  they will haveto draw upon their very much depleted Naval stock of coal.  Thisis a very dangerous thing from a Naval point ,of view,  and unless&apos;the Naval situation is going to collapse entirely out there,must be prevented.  It is also uneconomical,  because the Navalcoal is special Cardiff coal,  and is being used for purposes forwhich lower grade coal from France could be used.          I am,  in a way,  outside the discussion c.f this subject,and was not present at it,  but I should be obliged if ycu wouldkindly tell the Prime Minister that I would like to attend thenext time it is discussed,  and the situation does not brook delay.          I am sending a copy of this letter to Sir JosephMac lay, Lord Robert Cecil,&apos;  and Lord Derby.          Perhaps the Prime Minister may think it worth whileto let the ether Members of the War Cabinet know my very strong&quot;views on the subject.                           ,                                Yours sincerely,(Sgdi)   S.
