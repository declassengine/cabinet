He also asked thatthe number of horses might  itself  be reduced.    On February14th tha War Cabinet referred the  forrasr  matter for deoisios tome,   lord Serby undertook  $rtfets ** iAT*tUga*e  Wm  latter.     Part of the Shipping Controller*&amp;  case  had been that the eatsallowance for French/horses was said to be 7 lbs and of Italianhorses 3 lbs.      ^      I at once made &amp;^xti^f tnts these  allegations sad foundthat vkile there are, of  course, different rations for heavy-draught and light draught animals, the  average  oats rationis not 8 lbs, ^s state ds  but 11*OS lbs* in France,     As regards Italy a telegram to Rome  brought the reply-that the normal average war ration is 11,26  lbs.  per animal.     I then encjuiped into the scales in force at home  andfound that for horses engaged in trade  fttther  than agriculture fin Great Britain the cereal ration now  stands st 14 lb8*  perday for heavy horses and  8 lbs, per day for  light  horses,but that it is proposed to reduce  this  scale, except forcolliery horses, by 2 lbs* per day from 15th April next.Even so the ration allowsd for a horse  such  as  wuld be in umin the Army8  will still be higher  than  the allowance made  toan Army horse, although the latter has  to live  under muchharder and more trying conditions.     As regards horses engaged in  agricultural  work in EnglandfI ascertained that a very common daily  ration for  a fana horseis 14 lbs of oats and  0 lbs, of hay.     An average worked out from the returns  submitted  by anumber of farmers showed an allowance per horse  of  lO-Jr lbs,oats and 15 lbse haye   A large farm horse receives  a  gooddeal morea     These enquiries have led me to the conclusion that it  is notdesirable to reduce the  proposed average ration     10  lbs,  ofoats per day for Army Horses without impairing  seriously theirefficiency and working capacity,                              &apos;  -     The position might  be different if it were posaij8i$-^fefe&amp;^:ito increase the hay ration,  or to  substitute other cereal grains,or pulse, or their equivalent in other foodstuffs,,   But thisdoes not appear to be feasible under present ^onditions^,. and asregards hay,  it is the  fact that the Army buyers are ea^e riencdnggreat difficulty in obtaining the supplies they require foroverseas, and it has been found necessary to purchasetons of oat straw in partial substitution for&quot;hay.It
      It should further &quot;be borne in mind that Army Horses haveto exist on oats and hay almost entirely; and ^tliat the 10 lbs9average allowance of hay often consists of 20$ of oat straw,      I therefore advise against further reduction of the ArmyHorse ration,     There is good reason,  however,  to hope that the objectdesired by the Shipping Controller will be materially assistedby the great reductions in horses, used for every variety ofmilitary purpose,  both in Prance and the United kingdom, that hrecently been effected by the War  Office.   These reductionswhich already amount to 57.500 animals, and are Intended to becarried further,  have enabled the shipping of horses from Amerito be stopped altogether thereby freeing a very &quot;large &quot;amount :%of tonnage for other and more immediately necessary purposes,&quot;                              (Signal).
