S.W.li.                                          1st March, 1918.Dear.Colonel Hankey,          Sir Norman Hill has sent me a copy of his letter  toyou of the 26th February, covering a Memorandum by the LiverpoolSteamship Owners1 Association, headed &quot;The Submarine Menace&quot;.The subject of this Memorandum is mainly a matter for theAdmiralty, but I should like to offer a few observations in regardto the second section.          In the first and penultimate paragraphs of this section,the impression is conveyed that ships BXQ thrown together in convoyswith no discrimination as to speed,, whereas for many months  past(ever since the system passed the- experimental stago) the followingservice has been run ovary eight days from North America.             2 Convoys for ships 8 knots to 9i knots.             2    &quot;     &quot;    &quot;   9i  &quot;    &quot; 1Z\ &quot;             1    &quot;     W    H       W       QyQt^          It will be seen that this    only varies as to half a knotfrom the recommendation set forth as something quite new, and in  thisconnection it may be stated that a 10 knot convoy was run for abouta month and was only reduced reluctantly to 9-^ knots because there?/ere not enough reliable 10 knotters to keep it going.          The Inference in the middle of,the section that.an 18 knotship takes 36 days&apos; on the round if she is lucky ih catching  a convoybut 52 days, that is to say, 16 days more., If she is? unlucky,is not correct inasmuch as / these fast homeward.convoys run  everyeight days, and ships of this speed are not: convoyed oiitwards,Moreover with proper supervision by the owners.;the element  of luck -should be practically eliminated.Yours-, very truly,  (Sgd)   J.P.,MACLAY.
