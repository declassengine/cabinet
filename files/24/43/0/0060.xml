Situation at front still rather obscure.Disorders and small massacres have started at Er^erum betweenArmenians and Mahometans.   Similar collisions have taken placeat UlukhanlU; Karlu Norsheri and in Elizvetopol Government (sic).It is noteworthy that Turkish advance on February 13th breakingoff Tartar Armenian negotiation here, closing of Persian frontierat Maku, outbreak of disorders south of Erivan, threateningattitude of Sirdar Maku, and change of Tartar attitude towards ushere, all occurred about same time and practically coincided.Armenian negotiation with Derreu Kurds also stopped on Erzinjanfront.
