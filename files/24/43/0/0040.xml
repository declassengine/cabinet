I circulate to the War Cabinet  a  Memorandumproposing the appointment of a Paper Controller.    Thishas already been submitted to the Minister of Munitionsand to the Chairman of the Rcyal Commission on Paper,both of whom concur in the proposals.     As the matter is an urgent one,  I  hope the proposalsmay be considered at an early date.                                A. H. STANLEY.25th February,  1918.
MBM0BANDDM.B3T THE BOARD OP /BADE PROPOSINGHIS APPOINTMENT OF A PAPllR COMROLLER.      The Board of  Trade are  advised  and convinced that,  in view of the  further re&amp;uction*in  the  imports of paper  and  paper-making materials,  there is  a  fear1 of dislocation and  oreakdown  in the services dependent upon the  use  of paper, if Government  control isrhot strengthensd.lt  is therefore, recommended strongly that a Paper Controller-should be appointed,  and that  the existing Paper Commission, with any necessary modifications,  should  become anjAdvisory Council,  or be incorporated in a system  of Advisory Committees.      Figures of import and use will  at once suggest the  need for this&apos; step.  Imports  have been, and are to be as follows               1913    -   1;900;000  tons.               1916    -   1,300,000   &apos;*               1917    -      600,000   &quot;               1918    -      350,000   &quot;      In 1917 distribution as between the several  uses was  as follows:-                 ,  .                N           txma weight      government  (special allocation)            100,000      Daily  Press.  Sunday Press,  &amp;        Provincial  weeklies (excluding        all  Periodicals, Magazines ana        illustrated papers).                     350,000      Board  and Flapping Papers     &quot;               90,000           ,      All other purposes (including        Magazines)                               160,000- Total       600,000     Imports are to: be les;s than/one-fifth of the pre-warlevel, and it^must b6 remembered that the possibilitiesof depending on waste- contract with restricted use.   Tosecure the reduction of 250,000 tons, on 1917,  little can be takenfrom Commercial users .ancL-the Government, and it  will be seenthat the consumption by the Press is no more than the saving to.be effected on 1917.     It is evident that the difficulties ahead in the matter ofsupplies of paper can only be-surmounted by enforcement of themost rigid economy in use, and strict curtailment of unessentialuse (irvolving detailed scrutiny of depjands);  by  stringent control
over the distribution of all paper, whether produced from importedor home materials; and &quot;by- the energetic-organisation of the col-.lection and distribution of waste, together with some supervisionof producers.  Moreover, as shortage in every direction will be atonce reflected in enhanced prices, problems of price regulation  *will become more urgent.    - Up to the present, apart from action taken by the Ministry ofMunitions, control has been exercised by a Commission, and thisproved adequate so long as it was possible to proceed on generallines and avoid detailed administration to a large extent.   TheChairman has actod in some ways as a Controller; but a Chairmanmerely has not enough of a free hand nor sufficient authority toperform the magnified tasks with which the Control is now faced.The present Chairman is strongly of opinion that there is no safealternative to the appointment of a Controller.     As the Board of Trade is more largely responsible than anyother Ministry for the interests connected with the use of paper,it would seem desirable that the Controller suggested should beattached to tho Board of Trade.  The constitution of&quot;the AdvisoryCommit toe o  Committees and the mana/?ement under the Controllerneed not be discussed at this juncture,  but it should be pointedout that, war uses being so vital, and the Ministry of Munitionsbeing so deeply interested, it is essential that strong represent-atives of the Ministry of Munitions should be effectively, incor-porated in the new organisation.     Some timo ago,  when the cuts on imports  began to  be excopt ion-ally drastic, the Ministry of Munitions becTaio anxious about itsown supplies (particularly as paper and cardboard were increasing-ly displacing--wood and tin for packing),  and  felt compelled  toorganise the collection of waste and declare  cert-in paper-millscontrolled establishments.,  Thus.a higher degree of Governmentaction than is implied by a Boyal Commission  has already appeared
in connection with .a part of the trade.  The further cur-tailment of imports by 250,000 tons just imposed renders theadoption of the higher degree    Control ovon more urgentin connection with the rest of the trade; and it isapparent that ono Control will he hotter than two,     For those reasons the -Board of Trado desire to omphas-ise the importance of: appointing at once, under the.Boardof Trado* a Paper Controller with comprehensive powers,appropriate advisory assistance and an adequate staff,to doal with tho whola problem, of papar supplies andtheir distribution.February 20th 1918
