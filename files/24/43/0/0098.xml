bid  DOCUMENT  ID THE PROPERTY  OF His  BRITAHHIC  IJkJ^TVS GOVERNMENT)C R E T.3798.WAR   CABINET.OpJDITIOH   OF   IREM&amp;Memorandum by the Chief Secretary.    &apos; On my return to Dublin on February 23rd I conferred with  SirBryan Mahon the Chief of Police; the Attorney General, and the  UnderSecretary, as to the special measures to be forthwith taken fordealing with the marked increase of lawlessness which I had reportedto the Cabinet.   The disturbances to be dealt with were undoubtedlydue to the Working of the Sinn Fein movement and were most seriouswhere that movement has been most active.   They were of three kinds,cattle driving and forcible entry on land, nightly visits of maskedand armed men to houses in lonely districts In search of arms, andattacks upon isolated parties of police.   The last mentionedpractice was of new occurrence and was limited to Clare.   The otheroffences were moat marked in Clare and in Roeconznon, bligo, part ofGalway and part of Tipperary, with some scattered instances in Mayoand Kerry,   All were evidently organised and incited by a centraldirectorate as well as controlled by agencies existing in theseveral areas concerned.   In a country where criminal law operatesby normal means it would probably have been possible to bring  homeresponsibility to the persons who devised the misohief, though thatcannot be done here in the impossibility that exists of gettingjuries to convict of crimes where any anti-British political motiveexists.   The raids for arms were designed as work for the moredaring of the &quot;Volunteers&quot;.   The attacks on land were popularisedby an outcry of impending famine and carried out by very cleverlyorganised bands of man usually numbering hundreds,  descending  sudden-ly upon grazing lands or farms of well to do persons with large areasof fertile pasture, with a pretence of occupying and distributingland for necessary tillage.   The time was well chosen as tho Depart-mont of Agriculture had organised what was called a &quot;Tillage Week&quot;in response to the appeal of the Government for Increased cultivation     The combination of this seditious movement with this-agrarianconspiracy gave the whole business more seriousness than the previousoperations of oinn Fein have lately had.     The display by the participants in the various demonstrations ofviolent resistance to the police appeared also to have been pre-arranged.   It was necessary therefore to direct systematic policeaction in the several areas affected and to provide for militarysupport to be given to the constabulary where there was a markedtendency to violence; to arrange for reinforcements of the police invarious quarters; to prepare means of putting Clare and perhaps oneor two other counties under a strict control with the use of therepressive machinery of the Defence of the Realm Regulations;  tosanction certain arrests of ringleaders in the  inn Fein movement whomre active in the several counties and to make known the intentionsof the Government.   The various preliminaries were resolved uponwithout delay, as the steps to be taken in such circumstances hadbeen discussed on previous occasions4,  by means of a letter to a land-owner in the West, I gave an assurance of the use of all possiblemeans for suppressing agrarian disorder and by a letter to the LordMayor of Cork I declared the intention of the Government not to allowthe hunger strike to be used by offenders against public order, orthose engaged in crimes against persons or property as a means ofavoiding the penalty of imprisonment.    Both letters were publishedthroughout the Country.Sunday
      Sunday last was a very disturbed time in County.Clare,  There were  serious attacks on the police in various quarters,   Riotous crowds assembled.    Police  barracks were threatened.    No restrain- ing influence was to be looked for from any local authority.  The Bishop of  illaloe has been the one declared patron of militant Sinn  Pein among the Irish Roman Catholic bishops.   On Sunday evening after consulting with Sir Bryan Manon and the  Inspector General of the  Constabulary I approved of the despatch of a force of  about 8,300  troops to Clare,  under command of a Brigadier,  who was empowered to act as a competent military authority and who was fully instructed in advance as to the measures needed  for placing the county under discipline.    The powers of the censorship were used  to prevent any public  commotion elsewhere than in Clare over the unusual proceedings whioh were being taken and before there ms any general appreciation in the country at large of the action whioh had been  determined upon,Clara was effectually occupied and a code  of restrictive regulations   was in use,,   There  is good promise of wholesome results.      In Sligo under the direction of a Deputy Inspector General and in Rosoorcsaon and elsewhere under the County Inspectors,  and with  the  aid of Constabulary reinforcements and a good backing of troops  in case  of  need,  the police have,  during the past week prevented by precautionary  measures many threatened raids on farms;  have  broken up by baton charges numerous unlawful assemblies and have  arrested  and brought  before  magistrates or held for later trial  many scores  of offenders.    Complete  prevention  of cleverly arranged agrarian  disorder  la  widespread and often mountainous areas  where  roads  are  few and  bad, is  difficult, if not  impossible. The Inspector General  has hope,  however,  of effectually suppress- ing the epidemic of illicit ploughing and in the process he  is gathering up  sundry disturbars  of  the peace who  in the  public interest  are  better in prison  than at  large.     The  practice  of raiding houses at  night  for arms  I hope to seo abated by s  system of patrols  which has  been organised.     The  criminal  character of this new development of  Sinn  Fein, the occurrence  of  some  very shameful  and  cowardly  incidents  in connection with raids  on dwellings  the  evident design to use revolutionary agencies  to promote agrarian  disorder, and  a recent avowal  of  Bolshevism by  a section of the  iiinn Pein Directorate brought the country at large to a state of evident readiness for vigorous  repressive measures.    If these measures are carefullyused,  and no exaggerated political complexion is given to themf Ihave hope of a considerable  improvement  in general conditions as a sequel to the present trouble.   .Vhat is most striking^ I thi&amp;k, is that many people who were lately violent censors of prison discipline appear to be ready to see imprisonment rigorouslyenforced against persons engaged in the violent practices, whichwe have now to combat.     Prom the time of the publication of my letter to the LordMayor of Cork no prisoner has boon released because of  conditionsproduced by &quot;hunger strike&quot;.     The decision not to feed prisoners who starve themselves andnot to release them la their starved condition, though  they maydie in prison has been rendered difficult to carry into effect bythe emotional conditions so  easily produced in this country.  The determination of same of the lawbreakers is undoubted.    Severalhave
 have been reported as at the point of death and  in one  instance a man who appeared to be dying received &quot;extreme unction&quot;, or as is said here &quot;was anointed&quot;.  Happily as yet no hungerstriker has in fact died.      Several have given in at a perilously late stage in the struggle.   Hunger strike is going on in prisons  in Dublin, Dundalk, Cork,  Limerick and Sligc   I fear it cannot be reason- ably hoped that this crisis will pass without loss of life, and*two or three deaths of prisoners imprisoned for apparently slight offences might alter the attitude of the community,   There is, however, nothing for it that I can see but to maintain fcr the present a definite rule that all prisoners in Ireland shall undergo their sentences notvrithstanding the unfortunate existence of the Prisoners (Temporary Release), Act 1913.      In the immediate future it may be necessary to apply in two or three areas which are under observation the special means of enforcing order which are being used in Clare.   The means are available  if the need becomes clear.      Precautionary arrests of various leaders of disaffection may also have  to be made and orders for their deportation issued. I am trying to  avoid arrests in cases where there is no provable offence,  and may succeed.    As yet the leaders of the insurreet- ionary movement are rather less noisy than usual.  They may even shew caution enough to discredit themselves with their more violent followers.    The pressing requests I have made  for the provision of means  of dealing with them promptly have been dictated by the knowledge  that repressive  action on a large scale may drive some  professed revolutionists into courses which they would themselves wish to avoid.   .(Signed),  H,E.DUKE,Dublin.
