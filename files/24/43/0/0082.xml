During the week 23 large enemy submarines have been located, six of them being Submarinesof the converted &quot; Deutschland &quot;  type.   Of the latter, two were outward bound, two operating.were to the westward of the Bay of Biscay (probably homeward bound), one was workingin the vicinity of the  Canary Islands, and one was last  reported north-west of SierraLeone.  Of the remaining large boats nine to twelve were  operating in Home Waters,as- many as five being at one time in the Irish Sea, where great activity  was experiencedat the end of the week.

The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage  of sailings andof losses by enemy action, and the percentage  of losses to sailings of British merchantsteamships of over 500 tons gross register;  and  the table  in Appendix&apos; II  shows bytrades as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by enemy action to tonnagesailing to  and from United Kingdom ports during the last  four weeks..    The percentage of losses to sailings this week as regards British tonnage employedin overseas trades is 3.60 as against 1.14 last week.  The tonnage  losses  in these trades
are considerably greater than last week but the large increase in the percentage resultsmainly  from the  fact that  the  total  tonnage afloat is  this week unusually low andless  than half  the figure for the  previous  week, when  it was  unusually high. . Thepercentage  as  regards  coastal  and  cross-channel  traffic   has   also  risen,  almostentirely owing to  heavier losses,  and is .88  as against .36 last week, while the totalpercentage of losses to sailings as regards all United Kingdom trades is 1.62 as against.69 the  previous week.    The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British merchant vessels Areas insunk, damaged or molested, and of  all Allied and Neutral  merchant vessels sunk in the wnic^last two weeks by enemy craft  and by mine classified according to areas.    The feature of this week  is  the  largely increased activity in the Irish Sea, followinga week of comparative immunity in that area, and there are also increased  losses  inboth of the Atlantic  areas.   On  the other hand, the losses  and  damage inflicted  inthe North Sea area are considerably less than in the previous  week.vessels lost,,                                ENEMY  MINES.    There has been a considerable increase in enemy minelaying during this week, mines Minelaying.having been laid in the Harwich, Nore, Dover, and Clyde areas ; and also, after an intervalof many weeks, in the Tyne area.  The submarine that was operating in the Clyde areashowed great enterprise, as mines were laid considerably further up the estuary than onany previous occasion.                                                   .    No vessel has this week been mined in Home Waters, but a fishing trawler  and aNorwegian  steamship were torpedoed by a U.C.-boat after she had  laid mines  off theTyne, and  a  minesweeping trawler was sunk by mine of! Malta.    The following table shows the number of  enemy mines destroyed  and British vessels Casualties.sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.	Number of Enemy Mines Destroyed.

Defensive       During the week 33 merchant  vessels  were fitted to take  primary armament,  andarmament.  36 merchant  vessels to  take supplementary armament.              The number of howitzers and bomb-throwers delivered to date is 734.Mine pro-tectiongeax.1,344 merchant vessels have been fitted with Otter equipment.Merchant-men.                       MOVEMENTS OF  ENEMY  SHIPS.    Twelve enemy merchant ships have this  week arrived at,  and six have sailed from,Norwegian ports outside the Cattegat.  None  have entered or left Rotterdam.    Ten vessels are reported as having left Delfzyl with enemy coal for Sweden.Raiders.        As stated in the press, a Berlin official telegram reports that the auxiliary cruiser          &quot; Wolf &quot; has  returned  after a 15 months&apos;  cruise in the  Atlantic, Pacific and  Indian          Oceans.   There seems no reason to doubt this report,  and the only enemy raider now          believed to be  at large is  the sailing vessel  &quot; Lutece,&quot;  which  was captured by  the          &quot; Seeadler,&quot; and was last reported in October to be in the South Pacific.                      FOREIGN  NAVAL  INTELLIGENCE.                                     FRANCE. -    The French submarine &quot; Bernouilli,&quot; based on Brindisi, has been reported missingsince  14th  February, and it is  feared has -been lost.    The &quot; Vaillante,&quot;  gunboat  with two  4-inch  guns,  has been  completed.   All the35 vessels of this class (war programme 1916-1917) are now in commission and employedon anti-submarine patrols.                                      SPAIN.    As anticipated, the German reply to the Spanish Note on the sinking of the &quot; Giralda &quot;has been of an evasive character, and does not promise non-interference with  Spanishcoasting trade in the future, except under guarantees that vessels are not trading directlyor indirectly  with the  Allies.    It remains to be seen whether the new Spanish Government will accept this limitationof Spanish trading rights, or will take more energetic action.  The latter course wouldprobably have the support of almost the whole of the Spanish press.                                      ITALY.    On the night of the 11th February four Italian motor-launches carried out a raid intothe Bay of Buccari, near Fiume, where a  number of merchant  vessels are laid up, thelaunches being towed by torpedo boats to within 25 miles of the entrance  to the bay.Four  torpedoes were fired -at four merchant vessels lying at anchor,  and one of them,believed to be a large Austrian Lloyd vessel, was sunk.                                     AUSTRIA.    With reference to the naval mutiny at Cattaro, referred to in last week&apos;s Appreciation,it is evident  from reports which have since been received, that the disturbance did notassume any serious proportions, and may be regarded chiefly as a demonstration againstthe officers and as a sign of war weariness.    There  appears to have been no pre-conceived plan of action, neither were there manyacts of violence, in spite of the fact that the malcontents are reported to have been in themajority.  The deserters were not,  as they originally stated, the ringleaders, but joinedthe movement later in the day.   Little action seems to have been taken by the officersto restrain the  mutineers in fact the captain of the  &quot; Novara &quot; even allowed themalcontents,  who  were in a minority in that ship, to go ashore to join the revolt.    The disaffection does not appear to have spread to  the  fortress artillery regimentsas was previously reported, but was merely confined to the naval personnel in Cattaro.
$AVAL STAFF,      28th February, 1918.^APPENDICES.                                                                             !                                     RUSSIA.    Oux present policy with regard to the war stores now accumulated at Archangel is,if possible, to arrange  a barter, H.M.  Government offering foodstuffs  in exchange forthem.  Three store ships are being loaded in England to be sent to Murmansk forthwith,and the Archangel authorities are being requested to send out four ice-breakers with themore important stores.    The naval authority at Murmansk  is now vested in a triumvirate (with the formerChief of Staff as secretary) representing the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Union, the CentroMot and the Railway Union.    Pack ice has been set up  towards the head of the Gulf of Finland,  and  will preventany immediate movement  of ships  from Reval and Helsingfors  to  Kronstadt.   TheRussian ships  at Helsingfors  are now almost without crews, and the provision supplyis very short.  All signs of effective control in the Baltic Fleet have disappeared.
