No.  17879BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND,       29 St. Andrew Square,    EDINBURGH? 22nd February, 1918. Sir,                         -WILD -BIRDS I EGGS.          I am directed by  the Board  of  Agriculture for Scotland to refer to  their circular  letter  of  24th  April,  1917,  oh the  subject of the collection of Wild  Birds.1 Eggs,  and  to  state  that, with the object of augmenting the existing  supply of staple foods, it  Is hoped that further efforts will be made to  collect and market such eggs this year.          In view of the  fact that  the circular in question  was issued somewhat  late in tho season, the practical  results were comparatively small, but the experiment  made  last  year  justified the belief that it may be posolblo by systematic gathering  and regular dispatch to the large consuming oentreat to put  the matter on a  commercial basis, and thus make such a material contribution  to  the existing  egg supplies as will tend to minimise the present scarcity.         jUrraJigemants^ are  now under- c^jnedd^ration-^or this  purpose - and it. JLs dooired to &quot;obtain the assistance  of  the. AgrdculiruraX Exea- lutive Committees to organise the  scheme  locally.          After oonsultation with  experts  on the subject, the Board are of opinion that the  eggs which, would ,be most useful for food pur- jposes, and  the  collection of which would not  interfere with agrl- :cultural intorooto, are those  of  tho  common species of gull.  Ex- rception  must however be taken  to  those of  the Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus) which,  the Board are advised, in view Of its pre- :dominantly  insectivorous  diet, should  not  be  molested.  The birds whose eggs it is proposed  to gather are:- Greater B&amp;ok-backed Gull, -  Eggs (2 or  3), large  olay-brown  with scattered dark reddish-brown   or black  spots. Lesser Black-backed Gull,  (breeds  in closely packed settlements,  especially  on West  Coast) -  Eggs (3 or 4), rather  like Black-baoked but  smaller and darker   varying to dark chocolate. Herring Gull, (ooaet  species) -  Eggs \2 or  3)  like Lesser black-backed, but  greater variation.   Almost impossible  to  distinguish from  the fbrmer. CosBfflo:: Gull  (breeda on  inland lochs  as  well as sea-shore)  Eggs  (3; clay  or olive-brown  to  cjhooolate with reddish-brown or   black  spots and streaks.          The  Board are  advised  that the taking of Gulls&apos; Eggs should not  continue  later than June  lBt,  as,  if  oollected after that date, incubated eggs,  which would be  useless  as food, would probably be obtained.          They are  further informed that the only Gull whose eggs are directly  protected in Scotland  io  the  Common Gull (Larus Qanus) but as  the  eggs  of  this  species are only protected in the Southern group of  counties,  where it nests  in  few places,  and in very small numbers and  that  mainly  in the  west,  it would  appear unneoessary to apply for the/cretary,  . -TJ^i AgriculturalExecutive  Committee,
the withdrawal of this protection.   The -Board will beprepared, however, to make representations to the ScottishOffioe in order to obtain the removal of, these restrictions,should euoh a domand arise in the southern Counties.         It is now proposed that your Committee  should  takegeneral charge of the carrying out  of a scheme In their area,organising and supervising arrangements for the  regular andsystematic collection of the eggs under such directions  asmay be necessary.   Tho Board on their part are  ready to as-: sist on lines similar to those of last year, i.e. -(l) by co-operating with proprietors and shooting tenants in    securing suoh additional labour as may be available or    required to undertake the collection and despatch of the    eggs.  -(?) by arranging for the supply of suitable egg-boxes at    centres, when the eggs have been gathered in numbers suf-    rfieient to justify this oouroe.(Sl^by taJkJjag. stops^to,.aaoertain the most suitable markets    for the eggs.         In order to profit by the experience gained in asmall way last year, the following suggestions are submittedfor the ccnsjjderation of your Committee.   A large proportionof breakages oo^urr^d during transit, and in order to preventthis wastage, it is suggwrted that, whenever possible, the eggsshould be sold near their source of collection,  e.g. to armycamps or to tho Navy, or that they should be boiled beforebeing packed.   it is further suggee-ted that arrangementsmight be made for the immediate preservation of  tho eggs,for their utllloation in some form of egg material.         Tho Board will be glad to receive an early replyintimating that your Committee are prepared to carry out asoheme and stating in general terms the nature of the arranger:ments which it would propose to make.                         I am, Sir,                            Your obedient servant,CHAS. WEATHERILL,      seoretary.
