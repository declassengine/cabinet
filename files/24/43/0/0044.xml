3 B C H B   -&apos;.......&apos;.......,in &quot;V A li   C A B 111 HiPROPOSED EXCHANGE Off BRITISH AND GERMAN                  Memorandum by Itord, Newton t(Set also Memorandum by Secretary of State for War,  &amp;*T*Z131)*      The time lias arrived when it seemf advisable te reiossi&amp;srthe question e  the exchange of such British and Scrman internedcivilians as dtsira to fee repatriated o? whom it     bs a&amp;visahlto deport*      When ell existing agreements have been carried out,them will reisain in the United Kingdom about 21,000 Serm&amp;nginterned in the Unitad Kingdom and about 3,000 British inGeraaijy.  Th&amp;m men have, for the most part9 been confinedfor over three years;  there its no prospect e  providing forintcrmssnt in a neutral country of such large numbers;  and th$case for th^ir repatriation from the humanitarian point of rimis so ebvie&amp;s as to require no ol&amp;beratioa.   Ap&amp;rt howovorfrom the humanitarian aspect, there are practical considerationswhich deserve attention      The two sain reckons for a general exchange arc: -1,  The desirability of getting rid of a mnsbar of Germans asquickly as possible.  It is evident that if we wait nstll thoend of the war it id 11 be extremely difficult, if not impossiblete deport thea against their will.  The Ministry of NationalServieo are strongly in favour of acting at onoe*2.  The fact that an agreement to exchange civilians, whilst itwould be widely popular, would in reality exercise no realinfluence upon the war.   Owing to difficulties of transport,the repatriation of a considerable number of men would occupyso much time that tsany months would elapse before any seriouseffect was produced*      The German civilians interned here represent nothing hutan expensive incubus.   Owing to various causes, amongst Ihemthe action of the German Government, It has boon found impossiblte amply them except to a very limited extent.   Loss t&amp;an10 per cent are employed in any capacity whatever, and only &amp;very few hundreds are engaged upon work of any real value.  Theyconsume our food;  increase the demands upon our transport, andnecessitate the employment of the sands of guards etc, who sightbe utilised otherwise with advantage.      Of the 3,000 British civilians who will still be loftin Germany, more than  ,000 consist of merchant seamen, andthere are two strong reasons In favour of recovering these nanas soon as possible.      First;   the Board of  Trade  attach much  importance  to  saenring their services at  sea,  which  are  urgently required,  quiteapart from war work.
Secondly: The Admiralty have for a long time been anxious to establish the status of these men as civilians, whereas the German Government claim them as combatants. The opportunity of an exchange could therefore be utilised to insist upon their inclusion in the former class.

It is suggested that, as a condition of the exchange, and with the view of redressing the adverse balance against us, it should be stipulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government that a certain number of British privates captured in 1914 (say a minimum of 5,000) should be interned in Holland. A great deal of ill feeling has been created by the fact that hitherto it has not been possible to do anything for these men, whereas both officers and non-commissioned officers have benefited considerably under a recent agreement. Action of the kind suggested would be generally popular and would partially allay widespread dissatisfaction.

Hitherto the proposal of a general exchange of British and German civilians has been justifiably resisted on the ground that the Germans would gain considerably in man power. It is submitted however that the situation in this respect has completely changed. On Government authority it has recently been stated that in consequence of the Russian collapse, 1,600,000 soldiers have been liberated for use on the Western Front. There can therefore scarcely be a shortage of men in Germany, and it seems more probable that there is a shortage of food. But, in any case, the disparity in numbers involved in the suggested exchange is considerably less than would appear.

Amongst the interned Germans are a large number of men who for various reasons would desire to remain in this country, and whom it would be almost impossible to deport against their will. It may be estimated that at least one third would elect to remain here if offered the alternative between national work and repatriation without the option of return. The approximate number to be exchanged would therefore be 14,000 Germans and 3,000 British. To the latter should be added 5,000 British privates interned in Holland whose labour would be lost to Germany, so that the actual gain in man power by the latter is not very serious.

It may be urged with some force that an exchange of this nature might be seized upon by our Allies as a pretext for carrying out exchanges upon a much wider scale. It is the case that we have consistently refused to exchange able bodied combatants and have deprecated such proposals on the part of others;  but in this case it is not suggested that combatants should be exchanged and there is no convincing evidence that any Government would be sufficiently swayed by argument to study anything beyond its own interest in this connection.
