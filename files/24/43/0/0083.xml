? dear Prime Minister,

The London and Provincial newspapers are anxious to see ? or some other member of the War Cabinet, and the  President of ? Board of Trade regarding, paper supplies. The position is set ? in the accompanying memorandum.  As you will see the news?pers consider that they are entitled to preferential treatment, ? will enable them to continue to publish matter, the publica?on of which the Government regard as essential for the conduct the war.

The Newspaper Conference will be glad if you will make early appointment at which a deputation can be received.

I enclose five other copies of the memorandum for the ? of the War Cabinet.

Very faithfully yours,

(Sgd.) GEORGE A. RIDDELL.
         PROPOSED PURTHER REDUCTION OP PAPER SUPPLIES.,   Statement submitted for the consideration of the War Cabinet            by the Newspaper Conference representing the                 London and Provincial Press.         The newspaper trade is faced with a serious crisis.Por the year commencing 1st Inarch 1910 the imports of paper andpaper-making materials&apos;are to.be reduced from 640,000 tons to550,000 tons, which represents only about 30 per cent of the pre-war imports.   Of the 350,000 tons, the Government require145,000, thus leaving available for all consumers of paper only205,000 tons or sone 17 per cent of the quantity consumed in1913-1914,  as against 33V3 per ,cent of the pre-war consumptionallowed under the Royal Paper Commission scale for the year end-ing 1st March, 1918.   To give a concrete example.   A news-paper which before the war used 100 tons x^er week to produce a10 page paper will now be entitled to 17 tons only, which willnot suffice for the production of two pages, or, in other words,a complete single sheet.   It is true that the imports will besupplemented by the collection of waste paper, but here againthe Government require 78,000 tons of the total quantity collectedestimated at 234,000 tons, a large proportion of which can only beused for the manufacture of boards and paper for general purposes.Prom these figures it will be^ seen that in^default of some adequaterelief  the newspapers cannot be effectively maintained.   Mostlarge newspaper offices have been in the habit of holding stocksof paper available for emergencies.   These have been largelydrawn upon during the war in order to supplement the suppliesto which tne proprietors were entitled under the Commission ..,egu-lations, and will speedily be exhausted if tne&apos;periodical supplierare reduced as contemplated.   The Prime minister, Mr. Bonar Law,
                          -2-and other Ministers have frequently stated that the Press is anessential part of the organization for carrying on the war.  Itis, however,  desirable tj refer in some detail to the serviceswhich the newspapers are called upon to perform.   They may besummarised as f o11owa:-      The publication of -         (l)  Hows concerning ITaval and military operations, in-             cluding official communiques, correspondents5.des-             patches, and special articles;         (2)  Foreign intelligence;         (3)  Parliamentary reports and public speeches;         (4)  Abstracts *f Government Reports and Pluc Lochs;         (5)  Departmental notices conoerning recruiting, gcod             supplies, Government loans, and a host cf other             oubj ects;         (5)  Naval and Military casualties, promotions and re-             wards;         (7)  Information relative to Naval and Military pay,             pensions, and allowances.   -  A superficial examination of the enormous amount of matterissued for publication by the Press lureau during the lasttwelve months would prove, if proof were necessary, the magnitudeof the demands made by the Government upon the Press.     Much space is alst occupied by Government Advertising re-gar ding loans, labour,and other matters.   Manifestly it will beimpossible to continue to publiassh this information unless thenewspapers are able to obtain sufficient paper on wnich to printit.  The \7ar Cabinet will have to decide which alternative theywill adopt.  Either the papers must be provided with the necessaigmaterial, or the publication tf matter relating tc the war mustbe greatly curtailed^      The Gerloans appreciate the importance cf the Press as an
instrument of war and every effort is roade by the German Govern-ment to maintain facilities for newspaper production-   The sizesof British newspapers have already &quot;been greatly reduced and apartfrom other considerations, a further substantial reduction in sisis certain to create an unfavourable impression in foreigncountries.         The newspapers fully realise the grave character of theshipping situation but they desire to make the following repre-sentations.         First,  they consider that the consumption of paper andpaper-making materials by Government Departments might be sub-stantially reduced.   Serious waste is talcing place in many directions,  and no effective measures have been adopted to ensureeconomy.  Government Departments should be rationed-  The Govern-ment indent should be reduced by a specified figure, and the sav-ing appropriated to newspaper production.          Second, immediate steps should he taken to re-open theSwe di sh mar kg t^, anjd^ a cr edit should be arranged with Swedish -ftankwhich will obviate the effeet of the unfavourable exchange.   Asthe Swedish supplies would be carried in Swedish bottoms whicn itis understood would not be available for other purposes of theAllies, the transport of such supplier would not divert tonnagefrom the transport of food and munitions.           Third, Norwegian imports should be ^reconsidered with aview to increasing the permitted tonnage available for newspaperproduction,  and a credit should be established with KorwoKian ban];in order to avoid the operation of the existing rate of exchange.           3?ourth, immediate steps should be taken to ration thewaste collected-           Fifth, unless the imports available for newspaper pro-duction can be maintained at two-thirds of the tonnage for thetwelve months ending 1st March 1918 many newspapers will have tostop publication,and the remainder will be compelled to reduce the sizes  to  such an extent  that  the  publication  of an  adequate war
6 Bouverie Street,    Pleat Street,  E.C.4.      20 Pebruary,  1918.service will be impossible.   The prevision of the two-thirdswould involve the importation of an additional 50,000 tons  orthereabouts over and above tne tonnage recently specified by thePresident of the Board of Trade.      Lastly,  the newspapers submit that they are justified inaskirmv for preferential treatment as compared with other users  ofpaper and paper-making materials &quot;both as regards imports and theappropriation tf waste.  As conceded by the Government, newspapersrender services which are essential for the conduct of the  war.These services differentiate their requirements from those  ofother consumers,  and unless a reasonable supply cf material isassured they cannot be adequately performed.   The figures  quotedspeak for themselves.  Ueodzkfetis to say, newspapers cannot beprinted wihtout paper.   This memorandum is submitted not only  inthe interests  of the Press,  but in those of the Nation.
