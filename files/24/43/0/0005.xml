[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANfllC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT), E C R E T.f.T*-3705,WAR   C A BIOT,          POLICY OF THE V/AR -CABINET RELATIVE TO          REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENTS AT PETROGRAD. .                  Mote by the Secretary.     With o view to the discussion on the subject of RussiaI thought it would bo useful to the War Cobiiict to have asurvey of the more recent decisions on policy in relrtion tothe Revolutionary Governments in Potrograd.     I have 2skod Captain E*Abraham to prepare n note ofthis kind end to begin his summary from the period of thebreach between Korniloff end Kcrenski.                          M. P. A.HAWKEY.8,  Whit oho 11 Gardens,  S.W.1,     23rd February,  1918.
s u :.; a A K Y.     The British Government maintained diplomatic relationswith the Keroneki Provisional Government and continued theshipment of supplies to Run:si? according to prorrammc,     Nevertheless the rrowinf indiscipline in the RussianArmy, the disorganisation of the railways one the expectationof civil anarchy benvan, in September 1917, to disturb the mindsof the Cabinet and to affect their decisions concerning thecontinurnco of supplies.     Ri-&apos;*r fell on September 3rd.     The War Cabinet was considering the advisability of aJoint Note from the Western Allies to the Hirenski Governmentto urge the restoration of the military forces of Russia andof qucstionlnf General ICorniloff on the military aspect ofJapanese help, when the breach between Korniloff and Keronskioccurred.     On September 8th General Kerniloff sent his ultimatumto Kcrcnski demanding a dictatorship for himself.   Kcrenskiretorted by  deposing him from his command and declaring him atraitor.     At this juncture the Krar Cabinet decided that Sir GeorgeBuchanan should use his discretion to appeal to Monsieur Xcronskito come to terms with General Korniloff and avert civil war inthe interest of Russia and the Alliance.   The French Governmentwas informed and ur/rod to act in the same sense.     General Korniloff1s movement failed and M.Kcronski asCommandor-in-Chiof promised the Allied Military representativesto restore discipline in the Amy and stop the interference ofthe Soviots at the Front.     Ho failed, to fulfil these promises; but the Russian Armywas still considered a potential fighting force and an Allied.asset.   However, at the formation of the Inter-Allied SupremeWar Council no arrangement for Russian partnership was made.     The Kcronski Government, though steadfast against aseparate peace between Russia and the Central Powers, wasanxious to obtain a frencral peace.  It discarded the acquisitivoWar aims of Imperial Russia, notably in respect to Constantinopleand tho Straits, and invited the Allied Powers to moot inconference to revise and state their common demands.     This invitation the Postern Allies were slow to respondto.   The Koron3ki Government was a provisional Government.   Itssuccessor, responsible to a constitutional assembly mipht, it wasthought, take another view of the proper national policy,     A projected meeting of Socialists from bellirorent andneutral countries in Stockholm was also vetoed by the WesternAllies.     The Kercnski Government succumbed in the first fortnightof November to the attacks of the Maximalists who are still atthe, present time in power in the bulk of European Russia.  Theimmediate offer of a democratic peace was the Foreirn Policyof this party.                                                         On
     On November Slot the War Cabinet was urged to get intotouch with General Kaledin and M. Savinkoff with a view to thaformation of a nucleus of poles. Cossacks.. Roumanians andArmenians , determined to fight on against the Central powersand resist any attempt at a separate peace &quot;by ?:.is3ia.  Itwas decided that the Chief of ths Imperial General Staffshould select an individual to be sent to get into touch withGeneral Kaledin.     Por this was substituted on the following day a decisionto obtain advice from the military missions in Roomania as tothe best means of approaching Genexal Kaledin in order tosecure military assistance for the Roumanian Army.     The Maximalist a had issued a w?.reZeag message to theworld announcing that they were determined on an immediatearmistice.     The ALlied governments deolined to recognise anyGovernment which officially put forward to the Enemy proposalsfor peace.   But it was not considered advisacl*?v&amp;* the momentto back any party in Russia.   The best plan seemed to be forthe Roumanians to get into touch with General Kaledin on purelymilitary grounds.     Meanwhile the military representatives of Great Britain,France, Italy, Roumania and Japan handed the Russian Commander-in-Chief, General Dukhonen, a formal and strongly-woodedprotest against any infraction of the Treaty of London ofSeptember 5th, 1914.     The War Cabinet on November 26th approved this action,     On November 28th the War Cabinet vetoed the despatch toArchangel of a relief ship with 4,000 tons of staple suppliesrequired for distribution to the population.     Meanwhile Lieutenant Krilenko was placed by the MaximalistGovernment in supreme command of the Army , for the Expose ofarrang&amp;ng an armistice with.the enemy.             y*     On the 27th ,M. Trotoki had addressed a note to theMilitary Attaches of the Allied Powers  stating that hisendeavour&apos;*ras to bring about a general armistice.  but thathis Government might be driven ro a separate acmistice if theAllies refused to negotiate: if they refused to lecognise theBolsheviks , the latter would appeal to the peoples as againsttheir Governments.     The British Ambassador in petrograd advised the releaseof Russia from her agreement of September 1914.   Russia couldnot be restrained and it was best to put the whole onus ofchoice on her.     The War Cabinet was undecided and on November 29threferred the matter to the Prime Minister, Lord Eilner andMr . Balfour then at an Inter-Allied Council  in Paris.
      fhe publication of Bolsheviic messages  to the British Press j*tas- stopped and it was  decided  that  no  notice should be taken of M. (ErertsJtirs demand  for the  release  of Messrs. Chicherin andJfrrtro^f,  ijrtgraed...jLu-,fing 1 and.      *9n November 30th,  the War  Cabinet  decided that the manufaet- ure of all  munitions for Russia sM  the machinery for making munitions should be suspended until  further orders and that all warlike stores  for Russia  then  in the United  Kingdom or manu- factured  in the  U.S*Ac  en  British credits might  be converted to the use of  the  British  and Allied Governments.   The despatch of clothing, boots  and equipment of  a non-warlike  character far Russia should,  however,  be continued.      On December  3rd, the  War Cabinet decided to meet any reasonable  demands for  money made by the  Russian Caucasus Army and the Persian  Cossacks Division, represented  as loyal to the late Provisional Government of  Russia and anxious to continue fighting.   (289  (9)  ).      It was  also decided that an  effort should  be made to maintain South Russia  on the  Allied side by means  of financial assistance  to the Oossacks  and Ukrainians and to inform the British Ambassador  in Petrograd that  the  policy  of the  British Government was to support any responsible  body in  Russia  that  would actively oppose theMaximalist movement  and  to   ive money freely  to  such bodies aswere prepared to  help the Allied  cause.      The  detailed arrangements  for establishing  Ukrainian,  Cossack,Armenian  and Polish  Banks were  left  to  Sir  G.Buchanan.      These decisions inaugurated  the policy of secret support  topartisans in the  political strife  in Russia.      On December  7th, in accordance  with  a  resolution of the  ParisConference of December 3rd, the War  Cabinet decided  that theGovernments of the United. States  of  America and *Japan should  beasked whether they considered the  conditions  favourable  for  thedespatch of a police force  to Vladivostock to protect  the  storesat  that pert and  the Trans-Siberian Railway.      The question of recalling the Smbassy was discussed,  on thesame  day and Sir George Buchanan was invited  to give his  opinionafter consulting his Allied colleagues.      On December 10th the War Cabinet reversed its decision ofNovember 30th and ordered the stoopage   of further orders, involvingTreasury credits, for equipment of a non-warlike nature forRussia.  The stoopage was to be effected as quietly as possible qndwithout publication.     The Secretary of State for Foreign  Affairs was given discretionto  deal with the case of Messrs. Chicherin and .?etroff inconsultation with Sir G. Buchanan and the Home Secretary.  Thisquestion had become important as K Trotski had prohibited Britishsubjects from leaving Russia and was ready to withdraw thisprohibition if the British  Government agreed lo reconsider the caseof  the  interned Russians.      The policy of seeking a modus Vivendi with the BolshevikGovernment began to gain ground.  Messrs. Chicherin and :.-etroffwere repatriated.
at *4* 4*      On   comber 14th, however, the War Cabinet decided th*t &quot;Any sum of money required for the purpose of maintaining alive in South East Russia the resistance to the Central Powers, con* sidered necessary by the War Office in consultation with the Foreign Office, should be furnished; the monsy to be paid in nstalments BO long as the recipients continued the struggle.&quot; 298 (10)).      The advance of  10,000,000 had already been approved to the Ukraine and General Kaledin.   It was decided that Sir C. Marling should be authasdsed to open a credit at once to&apos;help the Armenians.      On Decemoer 21st kWar Cabinet 304.10) after a discussion on the alternative policies of backing the centrifugal elements in South Russia or of making friends with the Bolsheviks, policies $iich were being followed concurrently with obvious inconsistency, difficulty and danger, the War Cabinet decided that a special mission oomposed of Lord Milner, Lord Robert Cecil and General Maodonogh should proceed to Paris to confer with Monsieur Clemenceau, and on their return submit recommen- datione to the War Cabinet.   The question was meanwhile to be studied from the military side at &quot;Versailles.   On December 26th the War Cabinet considered a Memo: prepared by the mission with the agreement of K. Clemenceau.(306 (13) Appendix.)      The War Cabinet approved the policy proposed whioh was to support the tJkraine and other dissident Governments in South Russia, while maintaining unofficial slants at Petrograd in continuous relations with the Bolsheviks.  The Armenian,  Cossack and Caucasus countries were to be the sphere of British activi- ties:  the French were to operate in the Ukraine.      Sir G. Buchanan was to come home on leave, but a charge d&apos;affairee was to remain in his place.      The Bolsheviks would be told that we had no intention of furthering a counter-revolution in Russia,  but that  we found it necessary to, keap in touch with the various semi autonomous provinces of the old Russian Empire;   the Ukraine,  the Cossacks, Finland, Siberia,  the Caucasus etc.  - especially the first,  as the feeding of the Roumanians to whom we were bound by every obligation of honour depended on the Ukraine.    We  were  not  ableto condone separate peace negotiations,, but accepted the prineipj Of self determination and,  subject to that,  of no annexations and no indemnities.      The Bolsheviks conducted Peace negotiations with the Central Powers at  Brest.      No response  was made  by the Western Allies to  the summons to participate and the offers made by the Central Powers with a view to a general peace were modified when they found their only concern was a separate  peace with Russia.
     In his statement of War Aims the prime Minister , enJanuary 5th, said &quot;If the present rulers of Russia take actionwhich is independent of their Allies we have no means ofintervening to arrest the catastrophe which is assuredlybefalling their country.&quot;     Mr. Lockhart , late British Consul General in Moscow, wasappointed to act as unofficial channel of communication withthe Bolsheviks in Petrograd and a similar liaison was effectedwith M .Litvinoff the Bolshevik representative in London,The funds of the Russian Embassy, however, were not handedover to K , Litvinoff. (316 (16))     The propagandist activities of H, Litvinoff in favour ofMaximalist ideas began before long to cause anxiety.  Beforetaking action against him, it was deeidedl  (382 (18) Jan. 15th)to consult the Allies and the British charge d&apos;affaires inPetrograd,     A Japanese and a British warBhip were sent to Vladivostockat the beginning of January to protest the stores,, we/fceh oneanother, and help to establish a focus of resistance to Germanand pacifist influences in Siberia.     The problem of further interference in Siberia with a viewto obtaining control of the Railway across the Continent assumedgreater importance for the Allies , with the approach of avictorious peace for the Central Powers in Russia.  Japan isgeographically the best placed power to take action, but it isfeared that tho Japanese would  so antagonise the Russians asto drive them into welcoming tho Germans as a lesser evil.This riew is strongest in America.  Prance is indifferent tothe risk and presses for Japanese intervention as the onlymeans of denying Russia and Northern Asia to Germany and ofassisting Roumania,  since the defection of the Ukraine Rada,to continue the struggle.     The difficulties of our relations with the Bolshevikswere increased by their falling out with Roumania in January.The Roumanian Minister in petrograd was arrested and onlyreleased as a result of a combined protest by the corpsdiplomatique.     The Bolshevik Government addressed an ultimatum toRoumania and there is now, despite an attempt to come to terms,a technical state of war bet^rson our Ally an4 the CentralGovernment of Russia,     On January 8 nd, Sir G,  Buchanan attondod a War Cabinet     It was then expected that  difficulty  would  arise  overthe recruitment of Russian subjects  in Upland into  theBritish Army ,  in accordance with a reciprocal arrangementmade with the  previous ftussi an  Government , !  eiysista&amp;ce  inenforcing  their enlistment-would probably c^use a completebreach with the Bolsheviks ,  It did  not  seem opportune tobring this about,                          T     It was also  decided  on  this  date that no action shouldfor the present be taken  re  Mon.  Litvinoff,
     Qs Jaauary  3rd it was icei&amp;tc t* oentisue tko ealistaent &amp;esend such residue of Russians as could not be reesuited intocaap8, pending deportation without faculty of return (341 (11) ).     On February 8th the Foreign Office received from H.Iitvinefia formal pretest against further enlistment of Russian subjectsin the British Army.     On February 13th the War Cabinet decided &quot;to stop th* reoruiing of Russians for the moment, but not to return those who hadalready joined the Army&quot;.     Another controversial question arose from the dosire of thePetrograd Government to send Bolshevik emissaries to the West.Mr. Lockhar^ strongly advocated the granting of a visa to theirpassports.  One of the emissaries was M.J?otroff, above mentioned,who had been interned in tnis country for an offence under theDefence of the Realm Regulations.     It was decided on February 11th that there was sufficientreason to refuse permission for li,  Petroffs visit.  Permissionwas granted, however, to another envoy,  M.Kameneff, who is aleete visit France, and who will be kept under close observation.      A Manifesto by IvLLitvinoff inciting the Woolwich MunitionWorkers to revolution and hi3 reported endeavours to tamperwith the discipline of Russian-Canadian troops have egain broughthis position under consideration.  (W.8.  342 (14) ).     This and the larger  Issue of Japanese (or conbined)intervention in Liberia await decision.
