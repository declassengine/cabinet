BPW/025.                 Weekly Report on Poland.  XXV&quot;.                    (22nd February, 1918.)     Events with, regard to Poland are moving at  such a pace thatknowledge is obsolete and chiefly of historic value by the time  itreaches us.   It is therefore necessary to limit oneself to thebarest outlines in any analysis of recent events.     1.   It has beenf ever since December 20. 1917. the main  con-cern of the Polish government to obtain admission for its represent-atives to the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk.   $hie seemsto have been the chief objeot of the journey to Berlin and Viennawhioh the three Regents undertook in the beginning of January.It ended in failure, and on January 17 the Polish Premier, K.Kucbarzewski, addressed a wire to Counts Hertling and Czemin&quot;categorically&quot; demanding that Polish representatives should beadmitted because &quot;the Polish nation has an undeniable right todefend its vital interests at the peace negotiations&quot;.   OnJanuary 30 the Polish gov/erniaent, having obviously given up allhope, addressed a public declaration to the Central Powers.    Itrepeated the demand for a Polish delegation and  declared that thePoles will not acknowledge any decisions arrived at in the absenceof representatives Of the Polish St.--.te.   It further demands theintegrity of the Kingdom of Poland as constituted in lol5 and, ina much more moderate and modest form tiioa it has ever done before,that the occupied/Lithuanian, White Russian and Ukrainian territories                  I                  tshould be allowed to unite to Poland, &quot;by a mutual and free agree-ment and on terms1&apos;of complete equality&quot;; and ends by demanding thatPoland should now be allowed to summon a national Diet, froely
elected, and to form a national army,  and that the administrationof the country Should be handed over to the Poles themselves.     2.   The demand for the integrity of Poland as constitutedin 1815 is obviously based on no reasonable principle.    If in thename of nationality the Poles demand that Posnania and  Vest Galiciashould be reunited to Russian Poland,  they cannot deny  the rightof the Ukrainians to eastern Cholm or of the Lithuanians to northernSuvalki.   The same act of 1615 has sanctioned the inclusion ofPosnania in Prussia, of Galicia in Austria, and of the  whole ofSuvalki and Cholm in Poland.--  The demand for the other occupieddistricts cannot be takeh seriously in its present form, because itis out of the question that the Ukrainians. White Russians orLithuanians should ever agree to being united to Poland..- The demandsof the Diet, army and administration are a pointed protest againstthe r-Agimo of the Central Powers in Poland.     3.   It is obvious that well-informed circles in Poland fore-saw that concessions would be made to the Ukrainians.   Yet the newsthat the entire Government of Cholm, including its western and north-ern predominantly Polish distriots, has been included in the Ukrainecame like a thunderbolt.   It revealed the fact to which practicallyall the Poles have been resolutely closing their eyes for the lastyear, that if there is no nowerful, united Russia, Poland is nowhere.Different Polish politicians by their anti-Russian intrigues whichculminated in the attack of the Polish Army Corps against Bolshevikheadquarters, were cutting the branch on which they sa,t themselves.     4.   There can hardly be any doubt that the cession of CholmWas made under German pressure-   For the Austrian government itcreated a most difficult position.   The Poles in the ViennaParliament ha,.&apos; any how been getting restless during recent weeks;  fornone of the promises concerning Kae economic reconstruction of Galiciahave been redeemed by the Austrian government. When the news arrived
                            m 3 -of the cession of Cholm the entire Polish Club passed over to theopposition,  which raised the strength of those who refused to votefor any Austrian government whatsoever to more than 200 members.Obviously in order to break the point of the Polish opposition, theAustrian government has now concluded a new agreement with theUkraine.   Cholm ie not to revert to the Ukraine, and the Austriangovernment provides &quot;for the appointment of a mixed commission todecide later as to its fate on race principles and with due regardto the wishes of the population^.   Eerr von KJU&amp;niann went stillfurther and ctatcd that wif nocessary the boundary would be movedconsiderably further eastwards&quot;.   The Central  ewers have obtainedail they needed from the Ukraine; they will recommence their gamewith the Poles.   New possibilities of bargaining open beforeP uOjLsh. Jrrper ial i em.     5.   vrnen. the news of the cession of Cholm reached V/arsawonly the Cabinet resigned, out the Regency Council limited itselfto publishing a proclamation to the nation, very strongly protestingagainst the terms of the Ukrainian treaty.   Until we receivefuller information no opinion can be formed concerning the actionof the Polish authorities in Warsaw-   But on the whole, judgingfrom their political past and from their present interests, onecannot expect from the Regents any very strong action.   They aremen trained&apos; to be conciliatory in relation to superior powers andalways afraid of the revolutionary Socialist forces in their ownnation.      6*   The Polish Army in Russia.     The Times of February 16 published the follo\7ing Reuter wiredated Amsterdam, February 15:-          &quot;V/ith reference to the report in the Warsaw Kurjer     Warszawski that three delegates from General Dowbor-&amp;uinicki%     the commander of the Polish troops in Russia which recently     conquered the Government of Mohileff for Poland, have arrived     in Warsaw o-i a special mission to the Regency Council, the     Vossische Zeitung learns that &quot;the present negotiations aim     at the union of the Polish Legions with General Dowbor-     Musnicki&apos;s troops, which recognise the Regency Council ae the     legitimate government of Poland.M
     In other words the only result that  the Polish Army (inRussia) whioh was to fight  for Poanania has aohieved has been  to&quot;conquer&quot; the White Russian Government  of Mohileff,  in  which thePoles form one per dent of  the population;  and it  now proposesto unite with the Remnants  of the Austro-Polish Legions.    It  willbe remembered that in July  1917 four-fifts of the  Russian Polesserving in them refused to  take the oath  prescribed by  the  Germanswhich promised &quot;faithful brotherhood in arms&quot; to the armies of theCentral Pewers;  ihat they were thereupon  interned  by the Germansiand their leader, General Pilsudskl,  imprisoned and deported toGermany.   It is tbviously  a union with those who  have  acceptedevery condition imposed by  the Germans  which is now bei&amp;gnegotiated.    As these Legions remain under the command of  Generalvon Beseler,  and the Regency Council has  practically no authorityover them, it is with the Germans that  the delegates of the PolishArmy in Russia must negotiate.    The Bolsheviks report  that theyhave intercepted a radiotelegram from General Dowbor-Musnicki,the commander of the Polish Army in Russia,  to German Headquarters&quot;ayeo proposition Boumission obdissanoe oontre autorita Sovyet&quot;.     The Vienna press is overjoyed at the exploits of the PolishArmy.                                    22.2.13.,t
