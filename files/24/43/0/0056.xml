the country, and that a very considerable extension of the area under farm crops in general may be anticipated. Complaints, however,continue to be made that recent announcements as to prices for the 1918 Potato Crop will tend to discourage farmers from sowing increased areas under this crop.

Good progress is being made with tillage operations, although the weather conditions prevailing in some districts during the past week have not been favourable for cultivation.

FLAX

During the week ended 23rd inst. 39 markets were attended by representatives acting on behalf of the Department for the purchase of home saved flaxseed, and purchases of seed were made from farmers.

Inspectors&apos; reports indicate that many farmers have not yet deseeded their flax.  As the last official flaxseed market has been arranged for the 2nd March, facilities will probably have to be offered to farmers to dispose of their surplus seed through merchants.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVE STOCK.

During the period from 19th to 25th inst, inclusive, 650 applications for licences to slaughter or export animals under the Order relating to breeding sows were received and 497 licences were issued. During the same period 140 applications for licences to export milch cows and 98 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, under the Maintenance of Live Stock (Ireland)(Temporary) Order, 1917, were received. Twenty-six applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks under the Maintenance of Live Stock (Ireland) Order, of 1910, No.2.  were received.
