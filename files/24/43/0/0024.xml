RURAL  HOUSING.   Memorandum by the President  of the  Bnard  of Agriculture,                   I  submit  tiu.it the problem  of housing men  engaged in         tne  cultivation of  agricultural lond must be dealt  with by         itself.                   Methods euitable  to  Urban  areas,  including County         boroughs,  are  inapplicable  to  strictly agricultural districts.         In those Rural Districts  which are classed as Rural under the         Public Health  Acts, but are so highly  industrialised as not         to be predominantly rural in thoir conditions,  the  housing         problem  is rather urban than agricultural in character.                   It is in  urban  areas (including county boroughs,)         and  in industrialised rural areas  that the problem  is most         pressing.    It is here  that the erection of new houses has been         most strikingly arrested, that tho shortage of accommodation         is most pressings and ihat  the overcrowding is most intense.                   In the Census Report for lingl**nd and Wales, 1911,         it is stated that the proportion  of  houses &quot;being built&quot; to         the  increased  population  was less  than it had been  for a         century.   In  the intercensal  period 1901-1911,  population         increased  10.9 pur  cent:  but  in  1911,  as compared  with 1901,         the number of  houses enumerated as &quot;being built&quot; decreased         38 per cent  -  from  61,909 in 1901  to 38,178 in 1911.    The         decrease was greatest in  urban districts where the  number fell         from 51,523  in 1901 to  28,319  in  1911;  in rural districts the         number fell  from 10,386 in  1901 to 9,859 in 1911.    Tnus the         decrease in building was  45 per cent in urban districts against         5 per cent in  rural districts.   fhere wages were highest,  the         decrease was greatest:  wnere  wages  were lowest,  the decrease         was  least.   In otner words, rates of  wages and the ability .         or inability to pay commercial rents do not explain a shortage         which is more marked where  wages  are high than where wages are         low.                   The 657 Rural Districts  of England and Wales,  though         classed as rural under  the  Public  Health Acts,  are  not         necessarily rural in conditions:   still less are they of         necessity  predominantly agricultural in character.   If in         Rural Districts houses  are  required  for a residential or         industrial population,  the  satisfaction of that  demand cannot  be         treated, and ought  not  to be treated,  as a supply of         agricultural cottages.    The two different  needs should be         clearly and sharply distinguished, just as  in  the past the         needs have been almost  entirely met  from two different         souccee.   Speculative  builders have supplied  the one;         agricultural landowners have supplied  the  other.    Ho builder         provides for the needs  of agricultural labour  in the  shape         of cottages on f-mns.
          That tnere is a shortage of cottages for labourersemployed in the cultivation of tne land is true:  that it hasbeen greatly exaggerated is also certain.    By far the greaterpart, if not the whole, of tne existing shortage would besatisfactorily met,  &apos;lfpossession of cottages built byagricultural landlords for agricultural labourers was resumed.          In 1914 a Report on Agricultural Cottages waspublished by the Land Agents1 Society.   Their enquiryrelated to 265 estates scattered over England and Wales,comprising A total agricultural acreage of 1,497,813 acres.Excluding&apos; cottages occupied by the staffs of the estates,there were 22,727 cottages built by the landowners andsuitable for housing the agricultural labourers working  on  theland.   Of these 22,727 cottages, only 13,200 were actuallyoccupied by men employed upon the land.   Tne remaining  9,527were thus occupied:-          Pensioners,  )......................t 3,137          Widows, etc. )-&apos;          Employees of the Government)    ..... 1,061          and Local Authorities      )          Railway and Canal men...............   355          Employees of Trades and           V,, 4,974          Industries other than agricultural) *                                                9,527          Assuming that these proportions werefairly representative,  it would mean that the agriculturallandowners of England and Wales, without building additionalcottages, and merely by resuming possession of the housesbuilt and suitable for housing labour on the farms,  couldprovide accommodation for 16 0,000 additional agriculturalworkers.   Making deductions for estates of smaller acreage,and less well equipped, than those dealt with in the Report,the figure of 120, 000 cottages might be taken.    Such adisplacement of population would not of course solve thetotal problem.   Tho existing occupants must be housedelsewhere.   But it would and does solve tho problem,  so faras it affects agricultural landowners,  and the labour theyemploy.    To appropriate to residential, industrial orofficial purposes cottages owned by agricultural landowners,and built by them for the occupation of men employed on theland, and at the seme time to force upon them any compulsoryscheme for the additional housing of agricultural labour,appears to me to be inequitable.          The provision of houses for sailors and soldiersPlaced on the land after the War will necessarily be to alarge extent a State obligation.   But tne provision ofaccommodation for the increased number of labourers requiredby the extension of the arable a^raage should in my opinionbe met by offering to landowners the same advantages as areoffered to Public Utility Societies and under tne someconditions.
          If my contention i3 adopted that the problemof housing agricultural labour differs materially from thatof housing the labour employed in ot:-ier industries, it isperhaps Immaterial whether the policy of the President ofthe Local Government Board or that of the iiinister ofReconstruction is accepted.   But I may say that I supportthe policy of the President of the Local Government Board.R.E. PROTHERO.25th February,  1918.
