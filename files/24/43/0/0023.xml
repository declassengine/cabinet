Colonel JONES92THIS DOCULIEHT IS THE HiOHSRT.TY OJ? HIS BBITAHITIC i^JI0bTxLSSECRET.M A R  C A B I IT&quot;E &quot;T     On Friday last I received a visit  rom a Russian officer named Captain  oschkoff,  who served for s&amp;me time in the Hfts- sian army under Generals. Brusiloff  -*nd ICorniloff,  and-is-now se\-ving in the ITencH army,   captain Pesehkoff is an intimate frie&amp;d of Korniloff and knows Kerensky intimately;  I think my colleagues would he interested in the following sundry of the information which he gave me.        **************************      Patriotism,  as it is understood in Eastern Europe bag nevor existed in Russia.   Allegiance to the Czar existed;  but in the c^se of the mass of the population,  it was merely docile obedience and in no 3ense patriotism.    The loyal supporters of the Czar &amp;ave leaned since the revolution towards the Central Powers, who,  alone of the belligerents are governed on non- democratic lines.      Pull use of the absence of patriotism was made &quot;by the Germans working through prepay nda issued from Petrograd.   At the time of the Brusiloff offensive,  the trencnes waee filled with lenf- lets,  mostly issued from Petrograd  *nd no attempt by Xerensky wag made to stop this propaganda,   2he result was that before every attack meetings were held amongst  the r*nk and file  to decide whether they should obey their orders or follow  the ap- po*ls made in the  leaflets - which,  being printed, were implic- itly believed.      The success of the Bolsheviks  was largely&apos;due  to  the  factthat recruiting was  carried on in the most wholesale  manner atthe beginning of the war,   Whole factories  were denuded of their workmen whose places were taken by  ignorant peasants.   The latter became utterly demoralised by the enormous  wages which they earned ind the attractions of the city to which they had moved. The re^l working men of Russia  have  been in the trenches,  whilst the peasantry who  have taken their  places have  been  only too ready to f^ll in with the wishes of  the: Bolsheviks.   -The  latter have given them everything they desired,  allowing them  to  raid shops, banks  and estates  for the purposes of obtaining  food, clothing,  money or land.     So  soon  as the  German invasion or the lack of necessaries cuts of supplies, the position  of  the Bolsheviks is likely to be overthrown.      In Captain Peschkoffs  view It  was  really  impossible  to SAY with whom the  power would  rest once  the  Bolsheviks have been dethroned.   He thought it  probable  th*t a  coalitionnight take place between the  Social  democrats in the  towns  andthe Social revolutionaries in the country districts,  with per- haps a sprinkling  of Cadets.  But it was  really impossible to prophecy.   He regarded it  ^s certain that the Bolsheviks will verynshortly  be displaced.The/
The Germans now command the junction of Orsha (due north of ?ohil?v), and will shortly be in possession certainly of Moscow and probably of Petrograd as well. The survivors of the genuine working classes will be returning to their homes in consequence of the demobilisation of the army. These two facts taken together point to the  likelihood of the Bolsheviks being no longer able to give ?eps to their supporters, and when that happens they  will be swept from power.

It is mistake to suppose that vast quantities of grain are likely to fill into the hands of the Germans  through the occupation of Ukraine. The district has been drawn upon for the south and south-western fronts, and there is little, if any grain remaining. There are no facilities in that district for storing grain, and the  difficulties of transport are intense. It was these difficulties which brought the Brusiloff offensive to an end; his men had neither ammunition nor rifles, and the General himself could obtain no food for two days owing to the total breakdown of supplies.

On the other hand, the occupation of Siberia would provide the Germans with large quantities of grain, and  it is  earnestly to be hoped that this occupation may be prevented. Captain Peshkoff  was strongly in favour, on military grounds, of encouraging intervention by the Japanese, with a view to securing control of the trans-Siberian railway. And preventing the Germans from obtaining access to supplies in Siberia. He felt that it would be advisable to lay down conditions, so far as possible, to prevent be? Japanese from securing a  permanent lodgment in Siberia; but at the same time, he felt confident that whatever the other members of the Entente might desire, the Japanese intend to take possession of Siberia, and it would be  better for the other Allied Powers to encourage them to do so. With a view to preventing the supplies from falling into the hands  of the enemy, rather than to raise objection now which would not deter the Japanese from carrying out their project.
