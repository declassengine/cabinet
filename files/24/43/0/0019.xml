121/ Railways/3 3 4.      From Major-General Sir P. A. M. Nash, K.C.M.G., C.B., to the Secretary,                             War Office, London, S.W. 1.                                                          London,   Sir,                                                       20th February, 1918.     In  their letter, 12l/Railways/313, dated  10th January,  1918,  addressed to the Field  Marshal Commanding-hvChief, the Army Council  caused to be transmitted  to me certain instructions to  cover the scope of an investigation which was required to  be carried out with a view to  further co-Ordination of Allied  transportation requirements on the Western front.     I have the  honour to  enclose a copy of these instructions for ready reference, and to submit my report in accordance therewith.     The scope of investigation under Section I. of the instructions is very great, and IAshave not attempted in my report to. deal with  the question more than in general terms, avoiding detail as much as possible.     As  explained in the  body of the report, I have considered it necessary to expose the  situation as  regards coal stocks  and supplies, both in France  and Italy, as being a matter of great seriousness affecting very particularly transportation, although enquiries into the coal position was not specifically laid down in my  instructions.     In Section III, of my report, I have omitted reference to the necessity or otherwise of Belgian  Government representation on  the proposed  Inter-Allied Transportation Council.   The Belgian Government have been  good enough to depute a representative to give me the necessary information as to resources of railway material and personnel at their  disposal, but I have  not as yet received these particulars.  If it is found that the  Belgian Government  can place  any resources of  this nature at the disposal of the Allies on the Continent, it will be necessary to include Belgian representation on the Inter-Allied Transportation Council.     Under Section II.  of the  instructions transmitted to  me by the  Army Council,  as to the functions  of the suggested Inter-Allied Transportation  Council, mention  was made of the necessity for dealing with requirements of shipping for military purposes. Time has not  permitted  me to investigate this  important  matter, and I have therefore omitted  all reference to  it in my report, but I  regard it as certain that the scope of the Inter-Allied Transportation Council will require to be developed in this direction.   For this purpose, the organization proposed will require to be extended to deal with shipping and port matters.     In submitting my report, I feel sure the Army Council would desire me to bring to their notice the cordial  co-operation which I have received from Colonel  Maurier, Chef du 4eme Bureau ; General Atterbury, Director-General of Transportation of the American Expeditionary Force ; Signor Berrini, Deputy Director-General of State Railways in Italy, and Lieut. Lazzerini, one of the representatives of the Italian War Office in Paris.     I also  wish to acknowledge the assistance  which I have received from Colonel H. W. Thornton,  R.E., Assistant Director-General of Movements and  Railways  in Paris, and  Lieut.-Colonel  P.  C.  Young,  R.E.,  Deputy  Chief Railway  Construction Engineer, General Headquarters, France.                                     I &quot;have the honour to be,                                                   Sir, m                                              Your obedient Servant,                                                        P.  A.  M.  NASH,                                                                Major-Genera I.
                INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO GENERAL NASH.     1. To investigate and report on the existing transportation facilities by railway ofthe Allies on the Western front as a whole, that is, between  the North Sea and theAdriatic, involving enquiry as to :     (a.)  The capacity and use of Trans-Continental main railway systems.    (6.)  The resources  of the  Allies  on the Continent in locomotives, rolling  stock,           railway material generally, and railway personnel.    (c.)  The extent to which existing facilities can deal with movements of troops           from one point to another  on the Western front, and the  manner in which           they can be improved.    2. To make a recommendation as to the constitution of an Inter-Allied Co-ordinatingAuthority to deal with  questions of Military Transport by rail on  the Western front,including the following functions :     (a.)  To advise on the transportation aspect of any strategical proposals which are           under consideration.    (b.)  To  study in advance and prepare for the carrying out of movements which           may be decided upon.    (c.)  To  formulate  special shipping requirements  involved  in  any  contemplated           policy.    3. To indicate the extent to which  the existing British organization for Transporta-tion in the Field may require  to  be modified or altered in the event  of the constitutionof an Inter-Allied Transportation Authority.                                 By Command of the Army Council,                                                        R.  EL  BRADE.     10th January, 1918.

I. HISTORICAL.     1. In concerting  plans for the despatch of the  British Expeditionary Force toFrance, it was decided that the French  Railway Administration would be responsiblefor the maintenance and operation of all railway lines of communication.  This decision,however, was based on a force of very limited size, and took no account  of the verygreat strength to which the British Force in France has ultimately attained, nor of theenormous  quantities of  material required  in trench  warfare as it has developed inFrance, particularly during the progress of  an offensive.     2. As early as March, 1915, the French Transportation Authorities recognized thatit would  be impossible for  the French railways  to discharge, without assistance, theobligations which  the  pre-war agreement imposed upon them.   Help in the matter ofwagons was  asked for, at first on a comparatively small scale.   The  great increase ofthe British Army during the  year 1916, and the strain thrown upon transportationresources  by the  Somme offensive in the  autumn of that year, showed conclusivelythat more substantial help would  be  required.   The whole  matter was  carefullyreviewed and agreements were concluded at the end of 1916, under which  the  BritishArmy undertook to import the number of wagons calculated to be sufficient to dealwith all British Army traffic other than troop movement, also a number of  locomotiveswith their crews.

The question of suppressing  unnecessary  goods traffic and arranging  that whattraffic is necessary shall be carried  in a manner  which throws the least possible strainon railway resources has already been  thoroughly dealt with by  the French Govern-ment.   In these circumstances, the only safe assumption to  make is, I think, that thevolume of civil traffic in France will remain constant.    4. As regards the traffic necessary for the maintenance  of the French and BritishArmies  on their present front, it may be assumed that the volume of such  traffic hasalready reached its maximum height, so far  as  the British Army is  concerned.   I aminformed that a similar assumption is justifiable as to  the volume of  French militarytraffic.  For purposes  of an estimate of future traffic therefore, while it is unsafe  tocount upon any reduction, it  may  be assumed  that, apart from large strategic niove-ments, the quantities of material and numbers of personnel which will have to be carriedby railway for the French and British Armies are not likely to increase.     5.^  I am informed that  plans  in connection  with the operation  of the AmericanArmj in France have not yet proceeded far enough to make it possible to  frame any     3. This agreement was carried out by the British Army, and in July, 1917, Frenchand  British representatives in conference again reviewed  the  matter, and  agreements-were reached as to the extent of the British assistance required, which made the prospect,of transportation requirements  being  met, secure.    Had  it not been  for  furtherdevelopments, which could not  have been  foreseen,  the French  railways  could  havecarried  out, without serious difficulty or further help, all French  and British  militarytraffic, and did actually do all that was required of them during the year 1917. Otherevents have, however, occurred which call for the review of the situation at the presenttime.  Is is in consequence of new requirements, attributable to these events, that it isnecessary now to consider the  sufficiency of  available resources.                             II. VOLUME  OF TRAFFIC.     1. In the first place, the American Army has to be maintained  on  a front remotefrom the Western ports on which it is based, and it  is served  therefore by a  limitednumber  of railway lines  of communication of great length.  A French  and  Britishforce has to be maintained in  Italy, based on &quot; stations-magasins &quot; situated in France,and  chiefly on  French ports used by the British, involving the use of a  long line ofrailway  communication of limited capacity.  To relieve the shipping position it hasbeen necessary to carry from  French  ports  to Italy much of the  coal that wastransported from  Great Britain by  sea, and  to carry from  Cherbourg  to  Tarantomaterial and  personnel which formerly passed by sea from Great  Britain to Salonikaand  Egypt.  Finally, the withdrawal of Russia from the war has  made it possible forthe  enemy  to  concentrate large  forces  on  the  Western front,  and  to  assume theoffensive.  There is an imminent probability therefore that large troop  movements willbe required from one sector to another behind the Allied front.     2. In considering whether the Allied transportation resources are, or can be made,equal to the drain which these  new demands&apos;  will make, the  first  question to  beconsidered is  whether further restrictions  of civil traffic  cannot  be made  in  order toincrease  the facilities available for purely military traffic. This is a political rather  thana railway question.  All that I have been able to learn of the situation  in France  leadsme to think, however, that further curtailment of civil traffic, on a scale likely to affectthe position materially, is impossible.     3. The following figures indicate in a striking  manner the restrictions which theFrench Government  have already  imposed  on passenger  traffic,  and suggest at  oncethat further restriction in this direction is impracticable : 
-exact estimate of the aggregate volume of railway traffic incidental to the  maintenanceof that Army in France.                                         .  .     6. Traffic for  the maintenance  of the present French and British forces on theItalian front is  a  known quantity and  has definitely been  provided for.  The fact,however, that large troop movements between France and Italy have to be taken intoaccount indicates that the maintenance of a larger French and British  force in Italy is:a future possibility which has  to be  reckoned with.  In fact, it may be taken that thecapacity of the railways  between  France and  Italy is the factor which places a limitupon the size of the  French and British forces  which may have to  be maintained  byrailway on the Italian front.     7. The  desirability of relieving shipping by carrying as large a volume of traffic aspossible across France and, when need  arises, across  Italy, is  obvious.  On the otherhand, unlike the maintenance  of the civil population  in France and  in Italy,  and themaintenance and the movement of the military forces operating there, the  relief of  sealines of communication by rail lines of communication  cannot be considered  to be  anabsolutely paramount necessity, and to be without an alternative.   Important as thistraffic is, it must necessarily be relegated to the last place and avail itself only of suchcapacity as remains after other essential needs have been provided for, which  permit ofno alternative.                               III. LINE CAPACITY.     1.  The first question  which arises in considering whether it  will be possible tocater for the several traffics mentioned above is, whether the number of tracks, passingfacilities, and  so forth,  render the railway systems  as  they stand  to-day  capable ofcarrying the volume of traffie with which they may possibly have to deal.     2.  As I have  said, traffic for the maintenance of the American Army is confinedto certain definite lines of communication.   The American  Director-General  of Trans-port ation has already in hand, or in contemplation, numerous works which are requiredin order to  increase the capacity of these routes  to the extent  which is likely to berequired.   It is the intention that America should ultimately  provide all the materialrequired for these  works.   Meanwhile, though  the  American Director-General ofTransportation is carrying out with his own material the construction of depdts andother works for the  exclusive use of the American Army, the French are  carrying outthe necessary improvements in, and additions to, the main  lines and  stations used forgeneral purposes.  The French material used for such works is  to be repaid in kind bythe American Army.     3,  Although line capacity  for the maintenance of an  American force on  theChampagne or  Verdun front has thus been  provided for, one important point has beenbrought prominently to my  notice in  the  course of my  enquiry.   If it were  foundexpedient to move any considerable American  force to  operate  upon a more  northerlyfront-say in  prolongation of the British  line southwards the American lines ofcommunication would have, to be altered, and all  the traffic from American bases forthe maintenance of this force  would have to pass  through the neighbourhood of Paris,or, to avoid this neighbourhood by a wide detour  over lines of limited capacity.   Thiswould involve  passing a considerable traffic over the  Ceinture  Railways,  a systemwhich is already  much congested by military and other traffic, and it seems extremelydoubtful whether any considerable  addition to this  traffic would be  practicable.   Itdoes not seem  safe to say  that the  necessity for any such  move  cannot arise, and theproblem of increasing the  capacity  of the Ceinture Railways is one which should beconsidered  by  the  Inter-Allied Transportation Council, the constitution of  which isrecommended in Section III. of this report.     4.  Large movements of troops, making a temporary call upon the mobile resourcesof railways, must naturally have the first call  upon those  resources.  If rolling stock,for^ example, is  insufficient  to carry out these  movements and, at the  same time,maintain the traffic connected with war  industries, and the maintenance of the civilpopulation, the latter must wait.   Investigation of the possibilities in the way of troopmovement resolves itself, therefore, into an examination of the capacity of the availableroutes.     5.  Troop  movements may be either  of two kinds-(1) Tactical movements, and(2) Strategic movements.   Tactical movements involve the carrying  of troops for shortdistances with the greatest possibly rapidity to  detraining points as near to the fightingline as the nature of the fighting permits.  So far as transportation is concerned,  thelimiting factor  in  the  case of  such movement will invariably  be the facilities for
 detrainment available.   To ascertain what tactical movement towards any particular section of front is possible, it is necessary  to study in detail the detrainment facilities available.   Strategic movements involve the carrying  of large numbers of troops  over considerable distances  into a defined area.  In  the case of such movements, it will not be necessary that all of the troops moved should immediately on detrainment be pushed into the fighting line.   Detrainment need not be confined to a small number of points in immediate proximity to the front, but  a number  of  stations over a considerable depth from the front can be used.  Line capacity in the rear, therefore, becomes the controlling factor.     6. Behind ths whole of the British and French fronts from St. Pol southwards to the  Swiss  frontier, three  independent  double  fines of railway are available for the lateral movement  of  troops.   North of St. Pol  to  the coast,  two such  lines are available.   In addition, another independent double line railway is available for  moves between Peronne and Reims.     7. The number of troop trains which can be moved between points on the British front and points on the French front is ordinarily 66 per  day, involving a certain amount of suspension or displacement of other trffic.  To  move a larger number  of trains than this, all that is necessary is further to  suspend other traffic.  The  extent to which  other traffic will be  shut down will depend  upon the urgency of the troop movement.  As a limit,  if the emergency is sufficienly great, the whole of the capacity of three double lines of railway could be used for lateral troop movement.  As, however the routes  used ordinarily carry a heavy and important, traffic, resort to any drastic curtailment would  only be had in  case  of grave necessity.  The worst feature  in this- connection is that each of the three routes mentioned  above  includes a section of the Ceinture  railway system encircling Paris.  This is unavoidable as all the main lines centre on Paris   It is recognized, however, that continued restrictions on this railway would have wide reaching effects in retarding industrial and other important traffic.     8. Strategic movement  between  France and Italy  presents much more serious. difficulty.   Two routes are available-the  coast route via Ventimiglia, and the Mont Cenis Tunnel route via Modane.   The capacity of  the coast  route is limited by the Ventimiglia Savona  single  line  section.   The  Italian  Railway Administration has prepared  a time-table for working 32  trains in each  direction  by this route.    The French railway authorities state, however, that  in actual  practice, when  an attempt is  - made to work more than 20 trains in  each direction, this section is liable to become blocked.   The  Modane route from Modane to  Bussoleno  is worked electrically by the Italian railways.    The capacity of this route is limited  by the Chambery Modane section, on the French  side, where the severe  gradient of  l-in-33  has to be dealt with by steam  locomotives.  The French railway  administration  place the maximum capacity of this section  at 20  trains  a day in each  direction,  with the proviso  that customs examination shall not be allowed to interfere with  the free  circulution of trains.  At the present time,  the  customs  examination,  to which  all public  trains are  liable at Modane, has the effect ef reducing  the total number of trains  which can be worked by over two, and nearly three, trains for every public train so  examined.     9. It  may be  taken that  practically no strategic troop traffic can be  worked by either  of these routes without the suppression of other traffic.  The  extent  to  which other traffic will be suppressed will depend upon the rapidity with which any particular troop movement has to be effected.   The scheme prepared by the French transportation authorities  for a  strategic mpvement  from France to  Italy involves  the  running of 24 troop  trains a  day. each  of  40 vehicles maximum 14 via Ventimiglia, 10  via Modane    An additional six trains can be run if  the  troops are marched over the Pass. In order to make way  for these trains, coal traffic vid  the  Modane route is  entirely suppressed, and only eight trains a day are retained on the Ventimiglia route.     10.  It is of the greatest importance that it should be definitely established what is the maximum number of trains which either route is capable of carrying, and that  any unnecessary restrictions which at present limit the volume of traffic should be removed. I  consider, therefore, that  one of  the first duties  of  the  Inter Allied Transportation Council, proposed in another section of this report, should be to examine thoroughly the situation on each of these two  through  routes, and  to  arrange with the  Governments. concerned the measures necessary to ameliorate the position.     11.  As I have already pointed out, the through traffic  passing between France  and Italy for the relief of the sea route must be  considered as  second in importance to military  traffic immediately connected with the Western  front.   If, therefore, troop movements on  a large scale had  to be carried out between France  and Italy,  this&quot;Trans-Continental traffic would, perforce, have temporarily to give way.  It is imperative,.

360,000
therefore, that arrangements  for  any supply which is  being carried  out in part byTrans-Continental rail route should be such, that the stoppage of this route to Trans-Continental  traffic at  short  notice should  be possible.  This point  is ol particularimportance in connection with coal supply, and has been  dealt with at greater length inthe special section which I have devoted to that subject.                        IV. PERMANENT WAR MATERIAL.     1.  The rails, fastenings and sleepers at present with the various  French railwaysand the French Army, and available for issue, are equivalent  to 607 miles of track.  Inaddition a  strategic  reserve of 300  kilometres (187  miles) of track  is  constantlymaintained for use in the event of an enemy retirement.   A  large number of works arein view, and the deliveries  up to the end  of May are expected  to amount  to theequivalent of 775 miles.  The net  result is estimated to be that at the  end of May theexisting stocks will have been used up, leaving only  the strategic reserve.   In order tomeet  requirements, of permanent way. 800 miles of track have already  been dismantled,and little more can be done in this direction  without serious  interference  with  trans-portation.  It is necessary, therefore, that arrangements should be made for supplies tocontinue after May.     2.  As I have said, the American Army  is providing all the material required forthe betterment of routes, upon which American traffic is to be carried,  and, pending thereceipt  of their own supplies, have borrowed  from the French.  The transport  of thismaterial from America is subject, of course, to all the difficulties which attend&apos; trans-Atlantic transport at the present time.   No  difficulty is, however,  anticipated inconnection with the  supply in America of permanent way material  required  by theAmerican Director-General of Transportation.    3.  The British Army is, at the moment, well provided with reserves of  permanentway material.  870 miles of rails and  fastenings are in stock, and,  besides a  largeaccumulation of sleepers, the Director of Forestry is able at short notice to turn outsleepers at the rate of 200 miles per month.    4.  Looking at the position as a whole, and  having regard  to  the possibility of&quot;pooling permanent way resources,  we may take it that there is adequate material for anywork  which may immediately  have to be  undertaken. . In  saying  this I neglect tiiepossibility  of any general retreat of the  enemy forces.  Although  this  is not  animmediate probability, it has to be kept in view as a remote probability in consideringfuture policy regarding permanent way&apos;reserves.                                 V. PERSONNEL.     1.  The diagram attached shows the total  staff employed  by the principal French Railway Companies from the beginning of 1914 up to the present  time.     2.  Certain measures  taken by  the French  Government  and by the  companies themselves  have materially strengthened  the  position during  the  last year.   17,000 railway employees mobilized in 1914 have been combed out of  the army.   Troops and French Colonials to the extent of 15,000 men have been  lent to the companies, as well as  nearly  10,000 prisoners  of war.   The  companies  themselves   have recalled  to employment 14,000 of their pensioners, while over 19,000 women and 15,000 unskilled men have been recruited since war began.  Notwithstanding these measures, to make good the losses in personnel sustained through  enemy  invasion  and through  mobili- zatiou during 1914, the French railway systems are still  short  of certain classes of skilled  labour.   The  American Army is,  however, already making  arrangements to assist in this matter.   It is proposed to employ  6,000 American artisans on the repair of French locomotives and rolling stock.  Possibly it may be found that help in other directions is also called for, and having regard to  the strength of America in  men, such help can no doubt be arranged for if necessary.     3.  The British Army has barely a sufficient  number of railway personnel of all classes  to  discharge  the obligations  devolving  on  the British  Director-General  of Transportation.  British resources are insufficient  to afford any further help, and it does not seem possible to increase these resources.   There is particularly a  shortage  of railway operating troops including engine drivers, workshop  staff, as also platelayers.                      &apos;    -    VI.-ROLLING  STOCK.            1  . - -      -     1- Turning to the  question  of rolling stock,  my enquiries have convinced methat at the present time it constitutes the most pressing need&apos; in  connection  with    (5535)                                         &quot;                          B
transportation on the Western front.   This matter is of such importance that a  verygreat part of my enquiry has been directed towards ascertaining whether any  reliefcould be afforded by securing a better use of such  rolling stock  as is available.   Frominformation   supplied  to me  by  the Quatrieme  Bureau, the following figures inconnection with the use of locomotives and wagons have been compiled.All railways except the Nord.	1913.	1917.(Loaded kilometrage per wagon per day In calculating these figures 1 Empty lulometrage per wagon per day the total number of \ Total kilometrage per wagon per day wagons has been taken. 1 Percentage of empty wagon kilometrag-e to total ^ wagon kilometrage Number of times each wagon in service was loaded Tonne-kilometres per wagon in service .. ..

It is  noticeable that the percentage both  of wagons  and  locomotives  underrepair  has increased  substantially since the war  began.  This, as  I have  alreadyindicated, must be attributed largely to lack of skilled personnel, and certain measuresto relieve  the situation  have  been  taken.  Looking,   however,   to   the use  thatis being made of the wagons  actually in service, I find that notwithstanding  the-very  large  increase  in  the  percentage   of  empty running,  attributable  to  theexigencies of military traffic, French  railways  have actually carried in 1917 54  percent, more tonne-kilometres of freight  than were carried during  1913.   This is aremarkable figure,  and, taken in conjunction with the several figures recorded above, maybe taken as conclusive evidence that,  generally  speaking,  the fullest  possible use  ismade of the wagon stock available.     3. The figures in regard to locomotive user are not perhaps equally striking.  It mustbe remembered, however, that up to now, want of engine crews has been at least as greata difficulty as want of locomotives.  It is possible that if a larger number of drivers andfiremen had been  available, French railways  would  have been  able to get an evenlarger mileage out of their locomotives.   Be that as it may, there is no question thatvery good use is  being made  of locomotives, especially when we remember the verylarge number of engines which have to be set aside for work in the immediate neigh-bourhood of the front, carried on under  circumstances of exceptional difficulty, and thelarge number of engines exclusively  devoted to  shunting in the  numerous yards inwhich military traffic is marshalled for the front.     4. It is the intention that the American Army  should provide all the rolling stocknecessary for dealing with its own traffic other than personnel  traffic, in the same wayas the British Army has already done.  It is unfortunate that a precise estimate cannotbe given at  present of the increase and ultimate extent  of American requirements inthis direction.  The  volume of American traffic is, however, already considerable, and itis obvious that it must rapidly increase.  Up to the present time, the American Armyhave actually imported into France 149  locomotives.   No wagons have  so  far arrived.The following statement shows the  probable arrivals of the locomotives and wagons onorder: 	Up to 1st May.	1st May to 1st August.	After 1st August.Locomotives Wagons (30-ton capacity)	108 3,150	142 4,550	631 11,300* I think this figure, given to me as an estimate, is too low.  Actual figures are not available.f Computed by the 4me Bureau.
     300 of these locomotives  have been  ordered  for  use on  the French railwaysgenerally, and not for American traffic specially.  In addition the American  Director-General  of  Transportation  has arranged  to procure from the Belgians  immediately91 locomotives which are ready for service, and to procure later 334  locomotives, whichhave to be repaired.  It is obvious from these figures that the American provision of rollingstock is going to lag far behind the American requirement, and that during  the nextsix months or more the needs of the American Army will throw a serious strain  uponFrench resources.  In order to determine exactly how much stock will be  required  forAmerican traffic,  it is very  desirable  that  at the earliest possible opportunity  anestimate should be framed of the volume  of American  traffic  from  month to  month.The  necessity for providing stock for American demands from other  Allied sources willunquestionably cause serious interference with other traffic, and will  have the effect oflimiting the scope of the Allies&apos; military strategy.     5. Unlike the American traffic, traffic between France and Italy, whether  for theItalian front or beyond, must make a permanent drain  on French resources  in  wagonsand  locomotives, and, as I shall show, it is impossible to hope for any great  help fromItaly.  Placing: the volume of this traffic at 37 trains per day, and assuming an averageturn round of 16 days and it will not on the average be less than this the aggregaterequirement of rolling-stock for traffic  between France  and Italy may be  placed- inround numbers at: WagonsLocomotives...26,000 1,400     6. It is unnecessary, I consider, to ear-mark  any rolling-stock specially  for  troopmovement.   I consider,  however,  that  the  figures  which  I  have  already  citedafford convincing evidence that a substantial increase  of the wagons and  locomotivesavailable in  France,  apart  from those  specially  imported  for British and Americantraffic,  is  essential.    If  the   German  newspapers  are  correct,   Prussia  in  thepast  year added .to her rolling-stock  no  less  than  100,000  wagons,  and unlessthe Allies  are to be outmatched  in  the  matter of  transportation, it  is essentialthat no  stone should be left unturned  to  accelerate the manufacture and delivery inFrance both of wagons and of engines.   It is obvious,  I may add,  that, as rail communi-cation can be used for the relief of  sea communication, the manufacture of rolling  stockis as important as the construction  of ships.     7. In  order  to show what are the aggregate present and prospective  resources ofthe Allies in France  in the matter of wagons, in comparison with what were previouslyavailable, I have prepared the following table :                            Number of wagons in France.1st January,   1914.1st January,   1915.1st December,    1917.FRANCE.Effective..ImmobilisedHired from Belgians ..

     8. It will be noticed that at the end of 1917 the number of wagons in France wasnot quite        more  than at the beginning of  1914, and that even this small increasewas  discounted  to  the extent of nearly 13,000  by the greater number of vehiclesimmobilised at the later date.   The wagons available for service are in point of factapproximately equal  to the number  available in pre-war  days,  whereas the  grosston-mileage to be handled on  French railways has increased by 41 per cent.  ^ All thetransport on British military railways has to be provided for over and above this.     9. The figures for  1917, moreover, only reflect in a very small degree the increasein business attributable to the several  new  classes of traffic which, as I have shown,recent events have brought about.  The figures for 1918 must necessarily show a verylarge percentage of increase over those for the previous year.     10. There is a general shortage of wagons in France, and great difficulty is atpresent experienced.   The expedition of the supply of wagons on  order is imperative asaffording the only remedy,  and  every possible assistance should be given to the Frenchin obtaining the  41,000 wagons which they have on order, or propose to order, and thecompletion  of outstanding British  orders  should be  vigorously  pushed  on.   TheAmericans on their  part should, in my  opinion, give  a high degree of  priority to theimportation of the wagons which they have ordered in the United States.     11.

On paper, there are 1,680 more locomotives than there were at the beginningof 1914.   This apparent increase is entirely discounted when it is remembered (a) thatnearly 600 more engines are now under repair;  (6) that the  600  Belgian engines onhire are mainly of small power;  and (c) that the whole French  stock  has depreciatedby 3i years of most arduous service.     13. Here again, in comparing available resources with the greatly increased volumeof work to be undertaken, the  requirements  in  the immediate neighbourhood  of thefront for  the movement of guns on railway  mountings, for railway construction andmaintenance in  the forward  area, and&apos; for the numerous other services incidental tomodern trench ^ warfare, must be kept in mind.   I consider  that, as in the case ofwagons, immediate and strong action is essential.   Every possible means for acceleratingcompliance with French, American and British orders should be adopted.
                                      ITALY.                            VII. VOLUME  OE BUSINESS.     1.  The position in Italy is considerably less complex than the position in France,-and may be dealt with more shortly.     2.  The figures of Italian train mileage afford, at first sight, less striking evidenceof the rigorous suppression of civil traffic than do the similar figures in regard to Frenchrailways.

In interpreting  these  figures it must  be noticed, however, that the figures  of passenger train kilometrage include troop trains, whereas in France all military traffic, whether troops or material, is  included with goods traffic.  Unfortunately, the amount of the troop traffic in Italy is not precisely ascertainable.   Another circumstance which has tended to increase the figure of Italian passenger train kilometrage is that, in Italy, all  parcels and small consignments of goods are carried by passenger and not by goods train.   So called passenger trains are in many cases what would usually be described as mixed and not as ordinary passenger trains.  The actual daily service of public passenger trains in July, 1914, aggregated 206,000 kilometres.  The public service in force to-day involves a kilometrage of but 70,000 daily ; a reduction of 61 per cent.  Further reduction seems, in all the circumstances, impossible.     4.  From what I was able  to learn of the measures adopted to restrict goods  traffic to what was essentially necessary for military purposes and the maintenance of the civil population,  it appears  equally certain that it will be impracticable  to increase  the resources  available  for  purely military traffic by a  further  suppression  of ordinary industrial goods  traffic.   Many  industries which  are  really essential  have  been temporarily closed for the want of an adequate supply of coal,  and there is therefore a probability that some increase  in goods traffic will take place.                            VIII. CAPACITY OF LINES.     1.  Except as regards the railway routes between France and  Italy, which I have^already dealt with in a previous section of this report, and  the lines in the immediate neighbourhood  of the front, which are outside the scope  of the  present enquiry, no-question of the inadequacy of line capacity has been brought to my notice in connection with transportation  in Italy.   Additional yard accommodation  is required in connection with British  traffic, and this is being provided.    A large amount of work is also  to be &apos; done, I am informed, to  make good the railhead facilities which were lost to the Italian Army in the late retreat.     2.  1 understand also that there is no special shortage of railway personnel to contend with in Italy.   All the difficulties encountered in connection with railway transport  in that country are in fact attributable to shortage of rolling stock, of material generally, and of coal in particular.  The shortage of coal, increasing as  it does  the shortage  of rolling  stock  and being the main  cause of much of the shortage of material through the suppression of essential industries, is a matter of such first-rate  importance that I have devoted a special section of this report to the subject.                                  IX. MATERIAL.    As regards material generally, the present shortages are  mainly in the matter of sleepers, spares for  the  repair of locomotives and rolling stock, and material for the construction  of new wagons.   There  are  in  stock  395  kilometres  of new rails  and   * The financial year  runs in Italy from 1st July to  30th June.  All annual statistics are given for financial years.
fastenings, and 500 kilometres of old rails and fastenings.   Two million sleepers are said .to be required urgently, while the stock of points and crossings, amounting to 224 ofall sorts, is obviously inadequate in proportion to the rails on hand.                               X. ROLLING STOCK.     1.  As in the case of France, I have devoted a considerable time to ascertaining, inso far as statistics can show this, whether adequate use is being made of existing Italianresources in engines and wagons.  The following  figures have been compiled  from theinformation furnished to me : 	1913/14.	1916/17.Loaded kilometrage per wagon per day.......... Empty kilometrage per wagon per day Total kilometrage per wagon per day Percentage of empty wagon kilometrage to total Average number of times each wagon in service was loaded Tonne-kilometres per wagon.. Average distance each tonne of goods was carried .. .. ..	23-2 6-3 29-5 21-4 61-2 84,500 8-60 15-39 172-0	31-6 10-9 &quot; 42-5 25-7 48-0 122,300 9-91 15-77* 270-0    2. These figures show, I think, very clearly that  the existing shortage of wagonswas not due to any defect in the working of the Italian railway system up to the timewhen shortage of coal and the general disorganization, caused by the retreat, threw thewhole railway system partially out of gear.    3. The shortage  of  wagons in Italy  is  no new  development.    It  had beenexperienced periodically before the present war  began.  Unlike  France, Italy haslost no considerable number of wagons  through enemy action, and, on balance, gainedmore  enemy rolling stock than was lost in enemy countries  on entering  the war.2,700 wagons have been imported from America since Italy joined the  Allies, so thatat present 108,858 wagons are in the country against 101,244 in 1913/14.  t7 per cent.of the total wagon stock is at present  under repair or awaiting repair, which is veryhigh,  but compares favourably with pre-war figures.    4. What  I have written regarding the  necessity  for importing additional wagonsinto France, in connection with  the traffic between France  and Italy, applies equallyto the latter country.  At present, as  I have mentioned  elsewhere, coal traffic betweenFrance and Italy cannot be  fully developed, as neither country is able to spare therolling stock required&apos;for  dealing  with it.   Furthermore, although a  central systemof control enables the  Director-General of State  Railways  in  Italy to divert  allavailable rolling stocks to the  points at which the need is at each moment the  greatest,the absolute shortage of wagons has  been  a frequent  and  serious cause of delay inclearing ships  in Italian ports.     5. A programme for the construction of 4,500 wagons  is at present entirely  inabeyance for want of the requisite raw  material, although I  understand that workshopcapacity and personnel are available if the material could be found.     6. It is, from the point of view of the Allied cause, immaterial  by which Allywagons are made available behind the  Western front, provided the  distribution isunder some competent central control.   What is essential is that every  possible  meansof adding to the available  stock  should be  adopted.   One of these   means  is theprovision to Italy of the raw material, particularly coal, required for manufacture, and,in my opinion, every possible assistance should be given her in regard to this matter.     7. The general locomotive position in Italy is given by the following figures :               In  service   .........     ...      .....   4,321              Under repair or awaiting repair   ...     ...    ...    854                      Total on Italian railways...     ...    ...  .5,175              Kilometres per locomotive  in service  per day,                1916/17   ..................     101* Figure for 1915/16.
     Some shortage  of spares  for engine repairs has been experienced and an effortrshould  be made to  supply them and to reduce the percentage of ineffective engines.Apart from this the locomotive position does not appear to be serious.  The engines aregenerally of high power and  the maintenance is said  to be  good.  Italy  has  onelocomotive for every 20*5 wagons, whereas France has only one for every 25&apos;5 wagons.Deductions can only be drawn from these  figures with great caution,  as passengerlocomotives should obviously be excluded  in  any such comparison,  while numerousfactors such as the size of the wagons and the  gradients of the various lines have to betaken into account; nevertheless, all that I have learnt points to the fact  that coal andraw material  for wagon construction and repairs generally  are Italy&apos;s serious needsrather than new locomotives.
              SECTION II. COAL RESERVES AND SUPPLIES.     1. Throughout my enquiry  it has continuously been made evident to me that the-critical situation in regard  to coal supply is at the present  time the  most importantquestion  affecting railway transportation  on the  Western  front.   Italy is partiallyparalysed for want of coal.   The development of railway transport to the maximum isrequired  to assist in affording relief, yet  by reason of the fact that this paralysis hasaffected  Italian railways, as  well  as the industries of  the country, free movement isimpossible.   Immediate action is called for, and no excuse is required, therefore, for myexplaining the situation so far as my investigations have enabled me to  understand it.     2. It is necessary to consider the position in France and  in Italy separately.     3. I can best explain  what has occurred in  France during the last two years bygiving her receipts and expenditure of coal in the form of a statement of account.                Receipts.Reserves on 1st January, 1916  ...Production in France     ...   18&apos;2Imports    ...     ...     ...   18&apos;8Total received in 1916     1916.

At  the beginning of 1916 France  had stocks  equal  to  over three months&apos;requirements of coal.  By the end of that year these stocks had been reduced by half.In 1917 great efforts to increase production led to an increase of raisings by 36 per cent.as compared with the preceding year.  Increased consumption  and decreased imports,as well as the lower calorific value of French coal, however, went far to counterbalancethis gain, with the result that at the beginning of 1918 the  stocks in hand representbut a 12 days&apos; supply.  The stocks available on railways amount  in  the aggregate to15 days&apos; supply,  but these stocks are of course  distributed  over the whole Frenchrailway system, and in many cases the available  stock is much below this average.  Atthe present time the reserves on the Est and the P.L.M. are not sufficient to sustain aheavy military movement, and the French Government  are aware of this.    5. The increase in raisings  from French mines of 61- million tons in 1917 as against1916 was mainly due to greater output in the second half of 1917.   This greater rate ofoutput  it is  hoped to maintain, and  unless  unforseen circumstances intervene, theraisings of 1918 are likely to aggregate 31 millions of tons, but it does not seem possiblethat any great increase over this figure could be  obtained.  Consumption in  1918 willcertainly not be less than in 1917, but may be greater due  to increased rail traffic andthe lower calorific value of coal  raised in France.     6.  Obviously, a full supply of coal in France is essential if that country is to takeher full part  in the prosecution  of the war.   The  reserves of coal are for  practicalpurposes exhausted, and the internal resources, on which the country  is dependent to agreatly increased extent,  are being developed to the full.  In such  circumstances,  it isa matter of the gravest concern that the  chief source of supply is what remains in Frenchhands of the  northern coalfield,  and that most of the  mines there are within range of theenemy&apos;s guns, and all of them liable to be thrown out of use by an  enemy  advance of a

 few miles in the neighbourhood of Bethune.   The loss of these coalfields would not only reduce most seriously the war industry in France,  it would add  .tb the difficulties of transportation of all the Allies on the Western front to an extent which is^ incalculable ; in fact, from the point of view of transportation and war industry generally, no graver danger exists.  It is not surprising then that the French Government  are reluctant to make any contribution to Italy  from their depleted reserves, and  have demanded that any coal which they send to Italy from  the French  mines  in the south should be made good by an increase in the exports from England to France.   .     7. In  Italy the position  is still   more serious.   Italy itself produces  no coal whatever ;  it is 2,000  miles  distant from its  base as regards coal supply.  At  the present moment stocks have been reduced to an average of 12 days&apos;  supply, while, over a large area, stocks  are  less than this.  Consumption has already  been  cut down to below  the  minimum required  if transportation and industrial  resources   are  to  be developed  to their full extent.  During my visit to  Italy, instances  were  cited  of essential industries stopped for want of coal and of the exhaustion of the reserves of the products of those industries.   I can speak, however, with greater authority upon the effect of the coal shortage upon the railway transportation position.     8. It  is  unquestionable  that  trains  have  been reduced  to below the  number necessary to ensure the free circulation  of even the  limited traffic  considered necessary for military purposes and the  maintenance of the civil population.  Further, in order to eke  out the available  supply of coal, it has been  mixed on occasion  with  lignite, resulting in a  reduction of  speed.  When  I examined  the Italian  State Railway statistics with Signor Berrini, Deputy Director-General,  I found  that since the last and most drastic curtailment of train services  took  place  in November,  1917, the  average time taken by  a  wagon to  complete  its outward and  return journey  was  9 days, against a previous  average  of less than  7j? days.   That  is to  say, the  restrictions introduced  in an attempt to economise coal have  reduced by  over 20  per cent,  the effectiveness of the wagon stock available.  Italy was  short of wagons before the war began.   The demands for wagons for special military purposes and the increase in goods traffic  generally, which has  resulted from  the closing of the Adriatic and  the partial stoppage  of seaborne and coastwise traffic, have  aggravated this shortage of rolling stock.   This great shortage of rolling stock has in turn hindered the transport of coal. The &quot; vicious circle &quot; has thus been completed:  want of coal, bad  circulation, of stock, shortage of rolling stock, hindrance of coal traffic; and a situation  has  been  created in which  absolute collapse has narrowly been avoided.     9. It was outside the scope of my  present enquiry to investigate the causes of the delays to shipping  in  Italian  ports which are  undoubtedly taking  place.    It was prominently brought to my notice, however, that one of the causes of these delays, and I venture to think a very important cause, is the lack of rolling stock which, as I have shown, is in turn due in a  large measure to the shortage  of coal.  It may be  safely asserted, therefore, that a proportion of the  shipping given for the transport  of coal to Italy would, in effect,  be returned by securing  a more rapid unloading  of ships in Italian harbours.     10.  So  serious has  been the  curtailment  of imports  of coal into Italy that, notwithstanding the restriction  of consumption which, as  I  have shown, has been excessive, it has been necessary to eat up  the reserves of coal.  The diagram attached gives the actual monthly importation  by sea and  land for the last five years, apart. from imports on naval account.     Over and above these reductions of reserves, 185,000  tons  of  coal  were taken out of naval reserves during  1917, and used for railway and munition purposes.     11.  As recent consumption give&apos;; no true criterion of the real requirements, I obtained from Signor Bianchi, Minister  of Transport, an  estimate of the minimum quantity required monthly to ensure the  essential development of transportation and industryin Italy, as well  as meeting necessary civil requirements.   His  estimate is  given below: -                                                                Tons.              State railways     ...      ...     ...     ...      ...   230,000              Gas companies     ...      ...     ...     ...      ...    70,000              Armaments and munitions      .........   200,000             Various industries.........     ......   100,000             Mercantile marine...      ...     ...     ...      ...    30,000Total    ...     ............   630,000
     This excludes the requirements of the Italian Royal Navy.  The estimated 1 equire-ments of gas companies may at first sight appear large.  The average monthly consumptionof coal in gas works in peace time was 101,000 tons, and I am informed that restrictionbelow 70,000 tons per month cannot be enforced without real hardship, as gas has beeninstalled very widely for cooking purposes, and other means  of cooking are not nowavailable.   The  requirements for  armaments  and  munitions show an  increase of30,000  tons, as compared with  peace time consumption of  steel manufacturers andengineering  works.    The demand  for &quot;various industries&quot;  and  mercantile marine,aggregating 130,000 tons per month, shows, however, a  very  great reduction on the355,000 tons per month required for similar purposes  in  time  of peace.   The estimatehas been framed in terms of British  coal, and  makes no allowance for building up areserve.  If  coal  of  a lower calorific value  is substituted   the  estimate must  beproportionately increased.     12. I  understand that it has  been agreed in principle  that  for  the  future thetransport of coal into Italy should be effected in the following way :      (a.) From England direct by sea, 5,000 tons daily.     [b,j  From England  via the ports of Blaye and  Bordeaux, and thence by rail to           Italy, 3,000 tons daily.     (c.)  From the southern French coalfields by rail to Italy, 6,000 tons daily.     (a.) From  the  southern French  coalfields to  the Bouches du Rhone ports, and           thence by sea to Italian ports, 6,000 tons  daily.     The French insist that the 12,000 tons sent from French  coalfields  must be madegood by an equal increase in imports from England.     I presume  that  the  importation by the all  sea route  can  be  arranged.   Linecapacity is available for  the transport by rail to  Italy of 9,000  tons daily, but anysubstantial increase  in  the other  traffic moving between France and Italy  wouldnecessitate a curtailment of the quantity of coal being conveyed by the rail route.  Itfollows that if troop movements on any large scale have at any time to be effected betweenthe Italian and the other Allied Western fronts, this means  of  supplying coal to  Italymust stop, or troop movements  must be retarded.   Furthermore, this stoppage mayhave to take place without previous notice.     13.  The French railways have demanded  the whole of the rolling  stock requiredfor the transport of coal by  rail route should be supplied by the Italian railways.   TheItalian railways urge that it is impossible for them in present  circumstances to supplyall  the  stock required for  this  purpose.  It appears  likely,  therefore, that the fullquantity of 9,000 tons to. be sent daily in this way will not be worked up to.     14.  Whether it is possible to transport daily 6,000 tons of coal between Bouchesdu Rhone  ports and  the Italian ports  it is not  possible  for me to say.  The  trans-portation authorities  in  Italy emphasise, however, that  at  present they have not hadthe capacity required to handle this quantity made available to them in French  ports.Here again, moreover, further progress appears likely to be stopped until an agreementis come to regarding the supply of rolling stock.  The French urge, I understand, thatItaly must supply what is required, while the  Italian Government maintain that it isutterly  impossible for them to do so.     15.  I  am aware  that  it is  outside  the scope  of my instructions  to  make  anysuggestion regarding the arrangement of coal supplies for Italy.   It has, however, beenso strongly brought home to me  during  the  course of my enquiry that the  question ofItalian coal supply is the most pressing transportation question calling for settlement onthe Western front, and that an early decision is of paramount importance if Italy is toplay  her proper part among the Allies, that I make  no further excuse for urging thatimmediate steps should be taken  to effect a settlement.   I venture the opinion that anearly settlement  cannot be  effected by negotiations  between  the Allied Governmentsmade independently.  To decide the matter  quickly it is essential that representativesof each Government  should meet in conference,  empowered to come to a final decisionon behalf  of the Government whom they represent.  If such  a conference is convened,it should first settle the various points at issue in connection with  ensuring  a minimumsupply  of  20,000 tons a day.  There are  two separate questions  involved, viz., thesources of  supply  of the coal and the transport either by sea  or rail from the mines todestination.  It should  also, however,  consider,  I  venture  to think, whether thisminimum has not  been placed at too low a figure, and if so what further importation isrequired.  My reason for  saying  this  is that as  reserves in  Italy  are  practicallyexhausted, and the daily importation of  20,000  tons  may at  any time  be  interruptedby the necessity for troop movement, it appears to  me  essential to accumulate in Italya reasonable reserve against possible contingencies.

SECTION III -CONSTITUTION  OF  AN  INTER-ALLIED  CO-ORDINATING                                 AUTHORITY.EXTRACT FROM INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE WAR COUNCIL TO MAJOR-GENERAL NASH..    &quot; To make a recommendation as to the constitution of an Inter-Allied Co-ordinatingAuthority to deal with questions of military  transport by rail on the Western Front,including the following functions :     &quot; (a.) To advise on the transportation aspect of any strategical proposals which are           under consideration.    &quot; (b.) To study in advance and prepare for the carrying out of movements which           may  be decided upon.    &quot; (c.) To formulate special shipping  requirements  involved in  any contemplated           policy.&quot;             AN INTER-ALLIED CO-ORDINATING  AUTHORITY.     1. It is now generally recognized that for strategic purposes the whole front fromthe North Sea to the Adriatic must be considered as one.   The railways serving thatfront in France and  in Italy are physically continuous, but are  under the control ofdistinct and independent railway administrations.   The first broad division is betweena French and an Italian system.   What is  left of the Belgiau system and the Britishmilitary railways in the immediate vicinity  of&apos;the front are a negligible quantity if  theproblem is to be  considered on broad lines.                        :     2. In France, all rail movements, whether for military or  civil purposes, are underthe  direction of the Minister of  Public  Works, who has absolute power over  thedistribution of railway personnel and material;  he has also control over the ports.   Heexercises his control  through the Direction des Transports Militaires aux Armeos  atFrench  General  Headquarters, for military movement in  the  army  areas, or throughthe Quatrieme Bureau at Paris for military or civil movement in the interior, or directlyhimself.     3. In Italy, the problem of control has been an easier one, as  all  the  main-linerailways in that  country are  operated by direct State agency, instead of by a numberof independent companies, as in France.  The operation of these lines is co-ordinatedunder the technical  control of the Director-General of State Railways at Rome, whilemilitary transportation is under  the  control of. the  Director of Transport  with  theSupreme Command.     4. Apart from  the necessity imposed  upon the  British and American Armies oflooking after their own military transportation, it has proved necessary for both Britishand Americans  to assist the French railways by. the provision. of  rolling, stock  andpersonnel to take over all or part of the operation on certain sections.   British militarytransportation in France and British operation  in France are under the control of theDirector-General of Transportation, France. The extraordinary position has thus beenbrought about that in France, in  addition to six  principal French companies workingindependently, we  have the  British and  the American  Army each  operating   inconsultation with the French, but under no joint control whatever.  This is illustratedin the attached diagram.     5. Over and above  the difficulty of  co-ordinating the requirements of militarytransportation, it is necessary, both in France and in Italy, to ensure  that the needs  ofsuch civil traffic as is essential to the economic life of the country should be adequatelysafeguarded.   The  Quatrieme Bureau in  France  and the  Director-General of StateRailways  in Italy are responsible for ensuring in each country that essential traffic iscarried, and that any attempt to make use of railways unnecessarily is checked.     6. This state of affairs may be contrasted with that obtaining on the enemy&apos;s sideof the front,   There, through a complete  and  centralized  control  of transportationfacilities, the operation of both military and civil  traffic can be effected to the greatestadvantage, and a maximum efficiency secured from a minimum  of resources.    7. Such cursory  examination as I  have been able to make of the operation ofFrench and Italian railways goes to show that, speaking broadly, each operating agencyis, within its own province, carrying out the work allotted to it in an  efficient manner.These investigations have, however, convinced me that by a freer interchange of ideasand experiences drawn from  the different agencies concerned, highly important resultsin the direction of expediting movement might be obtained.  At the present time, the    1.5585)                              .                                     j)
authorities responsible  for operation are not brought into conference and there is noopportunity for an exchange of views on these important matters.     8.  The primary difficulties of the situation are, however, twofold.   First, there isthe necessity for grafting into the working of the railways in France by  the  French ofBritish and American  assistance.   Every country developes its railways in a mannersuitable to the economic conditions of that country and in accordance with the peculiargenius of its people.   It is  not surprising,  therefore, that the introduction of Britishand  American railway  men and railway material into France has produced difficulty inadapting them to the conditions and methods met  with in France.  Second, there is nocentral body  co-ordinating  military movement over  the whole system of railwaysbehind  the Western Front.     9.  These  considerations lead inevitably to the  conclusion that  improvement canonly be effected as a result of co-ordination under some central body.     10. To obtain co-ordination of military transportation  services on the WesternFront as a whole, it is necessary to bring together the following separate interests:                     (a.) French Army Transportation in France.                    (6.) French Army Transportation in Italy.                    (c.) British Army Transportation in France.                    (d.) British Army Transportation in Italy.                    (e.) American Army Transportation in France.                    (f.) Italian Army Transportation in Italy.     French interests  (a) and (b)   are already  co-ordinated in  the  Direction  desTransports Militaires aux Armees, and the  Quatrieme Bureau under the Minister ofPublic Works.  British interests (c) and  (d) are  not  at  present co-ordinated  on theContinent.  British interests might be brought together, if that  only were  necessary,by  the appointment of an Inspector-General of Transportation  to control  Britishmilitary traffic  in both theatres, but  it  is  not merely the co-ordination of  Britishtransportation that is necessary ; transportation for the  Allies must be  co-ordinatedunder  one body.   Further  than this,  military transportation cannot  be adequatelyconsidered apart from industrial and other civil transportation.     11. I recommend that an Inter-Allied Transportation  Council should be created atParis under the Supreme War  Council,  consisting of a representative of each of the fourAllied  Governments.  This  Council should  be charged with  fulfilling the  followingmain functions :       (i.) (a) To advise  the  Supreme War Council at Versailles of the  transportation           aspect of all plans of campaign on the Western Front.        (b) To negotiate with the Allied Governments concerned as to the provision of           such additional railway facilities as are necessary to give effect to any accepted           plan of campaign, or to relieve the general position, and to arrange for any           extraneous assistance required in men or material.    (ii.) (a) To prepare, when called upon to do so,  schemes for the  consideration of           the  Supreme War Council for all large movements of troops between  one           section of the front and another.        (b) To make, when instructed to do so, necessary preparation with the Inter-           Allied Governments concerned for the carrying out of such movements,           including when  necessary a redistribution  of  mobile  resources of railway           material and personnel.   (iii.) To study the   enemy position  regarding transportation  facilities  of every           kind and advise the Supreme War Council as to the enemy&apos;s  capabilities of           concentrating and maintaining their forces on any particular sector of their           front, and as to the points at  which and methods  by  which the enernys           railway communications  can be attacked from the air with greatest effect.   (iv.) To prepare schemes  to develop Continental railway lines  of communication so           as to relieve sea lines of communication, and to negotiate  with the Govern-           ments concerned regarding  the best  utilization  of the Allied  railway           resources to economize sea transport.    (v.) To watch the  performance of  the different agencies operating the lines of           communication on the Western Front, brinsrinp; to the  notice of the Govern-           ments or armies concerned cases in which the fullest use  does  not appear to           be made of available resources, and suggesting  remedies.     12. In order to discharge the duties  assigned to them, the  Transportation Councilmust keep themselves  well informed of  the  general  situation as affecting not onlymilitary strategy but also civil  and economic interests on the Continent.   This can only
 be done by obtaining adequate statistical and other information regarding the business,^the resources and the performance of each agency operating the railways on the Western Front.  To collate this information and to assist the Transportation Council in applying it to the solution of the various problems which  will present  themselves, an adequate -staff must be provided.  This staff should be drawn from the Transportation or Technical Offices of each of the Allies interested, and  might well  be  organized  in the following way :      Ally Sections. The representative of each Ally would have a small staff responsible for the collection and compilation of all  information required  regarding the business, performance, resources and requirements of that Ally, and for carrying on correspondence with  the army  and railway administrations of  that  Ally on ail questions particular to it.     The constitution of the staff of  each  Allied representative  must be  left to the representative to decide, but it is considered that a sub-division into      (1.)  A Military Section, to study requirements of military transportation;     (2.)  A Technical Section, to study resources, performance and  civil requirements, will ordinarily be desirable.      General Section. A General  Section is required  to co-ordinate  the work of the -other sections and to study specially problems connected with the enemy&apos;s transportation resources and  possible performance.   The General Section should  be subdivided in the same way into Military  and Technical Sections,  with  a General  Secretary.   To this General Section should  be attached a small number of technical experts whom the Council could send  out to study  on the ground, in consultation  with the operating agency concerned,  problems  presenting  special difficulty or  cases in which available resources did not appear to be utilized to the full.     13. Whereas each Allied Government will nominate their  own representative and his staff  on  the  Council, it  is suggested that the Council  itself should appoint the General Secretary,  as also nominate the technical and  military experts  on its staff, asking the Governments concerned for the services of the men required.  The diagram shows the organization proposed.   FrenchRepresentative.    ItalianRepresentative.  AmericanRepresentative.   BritishRepresentative.General Secretary.Military  TechnicalSection.

No change is necessary in the present arrangements by which the transportationorganizations of the various Allied  Governments or Armies on  the Western Front areresponsible for executive control.     15. I have discussed the constitution of the Inter-Allied  Transportation Counciland the proposed organization with  Monsieur Cleveille, the Minister of Public Works inFrance, and he has  pronounced his  concurrence therein.   Likewise, Signor Bianchi, theMinister of Transport, and General Alfieri, the Minister of War, in Italy have informedme of their cordial agreement.   General Atterbury, the Director-General of  Trans-portation with the American Expeditionary Force, has conveyed to me  the approval ofGeneral Pershmg, the Commander-in-Chief, to the proposals.
SECTION  IV.-BRITISH   ORGANIZATION  FOR  TRANSPORTATION &apos; IN                                 THE  FIELD.                     V&apos;EXTRACT FROM INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN BY THE WAR COUNCIL TO MAJOR-QE^RAL NASH.     &quot; To indicate the extent to which the existing British Organizatiori^or^fansporta--tion in the  Field may require to be modified or altered in  the  event of the .coiistitut&quot;roiTof an Inter-Allied Transportation Authority.&quot;                          BRITISH  ORGANIZATION.     1. In the proposals made under Item (2) of my Instructions, I have shown that, inmy opinion, no  change  is  necessary  in the  present arrangements by  which  thetransportation organizations of the Allied Armies on the Western Front are responsiblefor executive  control.   The constitution of the  Inter-Allied  Transportation Council,therefore, will in no way modify the arrangement by which  the Director-General ofTransportation, General Headquarters, or the Assistant Director-General of Transport-ation,  British   Expeditionary  Force,   Italy,  are  responsible  to  their  respectiveCommanders-in-Chief for meeting the transportation requirements  of the Armies, butthese officers must be authorized to  supply  direct to  the  British representative on theInter-Allied Transportation  Council whatever information may be asked FOR regardingthe provision, stocks, utilization, distribution, maintenance, &amp;c, of all  railway materialand  personnel, also  port equipment and personnel,  under their charge.   It is alsonecessary that the British representative on the  Inter-Allied Transportation Councilshould be consulted by the  Director-General of Transportation, British ExpeditionaryForce, France, or  the  Assistant Director-General of  Transportation, British Expedi-tionary  Force, Italy, on all  important  developments under  consideration  affectingmilitary traffic in France or Italy other  than those which are to serve local require-ments only,  since any extensions or alterations in  the  main railway lines of communi-cation connecting ports and bases with army  areas will require  to be considered as partof a general  military transportation scheme for the whole front, and not only to  servethe individual needs of a particular army.     2. The  functions of the Inter-Allied Transportation  Council under its proposedconstitution  have been confined to the Western Front, but it is necessary for it to havea close liaison with the Director-General of Movements and Railways at the War Office,to enable it to obtain knowledge  of the transportation developments and requirementsin other theatres of war.     3. I therefore recommend that a  Deputy-Director  General of  Movements  andRailways should be attached  to the Inter-Allied Transportation  Council.   By  thismeans, the Director-General  of Movements and Railways  could  ensure that the Inter-Allied Transportation Council would  be kept informed of  the views and, if necessary,the instructions of the Army Council.  Similarly, by this means, the Army Council canbe kept informed of matters  of interest to them, which  have been  dealt with by theInter-Allied  Transportation  Council.   This officer would also  be the means throughwhich the   Inter-Allied  Transportation Council  could obtain information as to theprospects of supply of railway material, personnel,  &amp;c.                                                       F. A. M.  NASH,   20th February, 1918.                                        Major-General.
