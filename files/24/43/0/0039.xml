C R E&quot; irv3739,WAR 1 CABINET *        00$&apos; 8UBPLIBSJFRQM TRBIAND.ivxemorandum by the Chief Secretary for Ireland,(Circulated with reference to Memorandum, by-Mr. Bong on the Food Situation. G.T., 3710.)                                                 , Colosel Jones   .,BOCUMENT 15 THE PROPERTY OF K3&amp; BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)1I1     So far as my information goes the observations  on foodsupplies from Ireland which have been suggested to Mr.  Longby certain correspondents are not in the main well founded.More is being eaten of the focd produced on the land than  inthe English towns, but not more, I think, than in Englishcountry districts,,.  Bacon and butter and milk are, I believesin most parts of the country as scarce as. in England,   There  isscarcity of other food in some districts.     As yet there has been no substantial interference  with thetransport of available supplies to England and I have isseson   v-to expect that public opinion in Ireland will support theGovernment in suppressing any obstruction of exports which isprompted merely by revolutionary motives.  Such public  opinion ,must however be fostered by judicious action and any appearance^of compulsory exportation might bring about, a disaster.     The curtailment of supplies of Irish meat and butter  inthe English markets is. due not to Sinn Fein&apos; interference oradministrative laxity but to just the same causes as haveled to the sudden diminution of home grown supplies  in  Englandduring this winter,  I was discussingthe questions raised  byMr, Long&apos;s infomantswith the Chairman of the Irish  Food ControlCommittee (Mr,- Wrench) to-day and he expressed to me  the viewthat the food exports from Ireland to Great Britain  in  recentmonths have been excessive rather than deficient having regardto the supplies available.
