Mr.&apos; Hilton has been- employed by the GartonFoundation, working in co-operation with the HistoricalSection of the Committee of Imperial Defence, since  the be-pinning of the War, in studying food conditions in Germany.His Memorandum is characterised by a great independence ofview, and I strongly recommend Members of the War Cabinetto read it.;                       (Signed) ..M.P..A.HAMEY.2, Whitehall Gardens, .S.VM&apos;,.
MEMORANDUM BY MR, JOHN HILTON,     In the Reports written for the C.I.D. during thefirst two years of the war on &quot;The Forking of Food Legislationin Germany&quot; I expressed the belief that the Maximum-Pricepolicy hod been a blunder and that the German food situationwould hsve been much better if prices had been allowed to taketh e 1 r own c our s e.     The reasons given for this belief were that compulsorylow prices (a) had checked produvt&amp;on, encouraged lavishconsumption, and promoted waste: (b) had put the money-reralat-or of demand to supply out of cction, (c) had necessitated,for that reason, the introduction of a costly labour-absorbingdistribution and rationing system, (d) had probably not, in thelonp run, kept prices much below v/h&amp;t they would have been hadthe markets been left &quot;free&quot;, (e) had certainly not securedshare-and-share-alike as between rich and poor, town andcountry.     The Reports sought to demonstrate by actual instancesand general deductions drawn therefrom that the fixing ofprices for one article of food irresistibly compels thefixing of prices for another and yet another until eventuallythe prices of all foods are rerulated; that if prices arefixed at all they must be fixed for every stage In the gacoapefrom producer to consumer; that price-fixing entails ofnecessity the control of production and of distribution; andconsequently that, once embarked on a policy of price-controlthere is no stopping short of the entire food industry andtrade coming under official direction and regulation.   Further,,fixed prices, by makinp evasions and infractions of the la?/profitable to both buyer and seller, put a double premium onlaw-breaking; and since they often patently operate againstthe public interest their effect is to create a distinctionbetween law-breaking and wronp-doing&apos; which is thoroughly badfor the public morale.     These facts and the generalisations drawn from themled me to urjre that the British Government should not embarkupon a policy of price control.   It seemed highly jrobabiethat if prices were left alone supplies would be bettermaintained, economy more effectively promoted, the introductionof rationing rendered unnecessary, and the creation of a vastadministrative machine avoided.     The subsequent course of events in Germany has gonefar to confirm the view that the Maximum-Price policy wasa mistake.  It is impossible of course to dormatise asto what would have happened had a different policy been adopted,but there is  rood reason to think that if the price-incentiveto increased production and economy had been left in operation,reinforced by positive measures, food would have been moreplentiful and distribution more equal.   The latest reportsindicate that the system is breaking down.   The illicit trafficin food appears to be greater in volume than the lerral-pricetrade: the authorities have had to wink &quot;t munition firmsbuying food for their employees without record for the lepalprices; the municipalities hsve had no option but to followsuit.   The custodians of the law have thus become themselvesbreakers of the law.   Bad feelinf between the well-fedcountryside and the Ill-fed towns is rrowinrr,   Share-and-share-alike has not been secured.Prom
     From the time last year wnen price control was definitelyadopted as the food policy of the British Government, the histof German food legislation has almost exactly repeated itself.have made the same moves and the came mistakes in the some ordwith the same results, and there is ample reason for believingthat we are heading for the same breakdown.  It will no doubtoccur in Germany before here, for their food situation is worsfand their fixed-price policy, having hod three years longer ruiis so much nearer the jamming pointj but the very ability andfirmness of Lord Hhondda will moke our run towards deadlockshorter than theirs.     It is not denied by anyone competent to speak upon thesubject that the fluctuotion of &quot;free&quot; prices performs anindispensable function which, If prices are fixed has to beotherwise elaborately and clumsily provided-for,  Prices equateeffective demand to available suppliesj and, more, curb demandsby leaving it to each housewife to ask herself how much or howlittle of this or that will best serve her needs at the price;they increase supplies by making each producer (or1 TmpoTterTfurnish what he con furnish most cheaply to meet the prospectivgreatest need.  They make, therefore, for the most advantageousconsumption and production.   Just as the governor of a steamengine adjusts the power to the load, so price in the economicmachine adjusts the demand to the supply.  If the governor isheld fixed the engine will; either race or slow down * unless thepower or the load or both: are also controlled.  In the some wayif prices are held fast the economic machine will race or rundown - unless production or consumption or both are also controlFixed prices lead to chaotic low-pressure production and queuepurchasing, and these in turn necessitate controlled productionand general, rationing.     This is understood and accepted by those in authority; butit is reluctantly wgved aside on two pleas: (1) that this is anemergency short-term situation only to be met by violent short-term measures and (2) that the problem is not merely one of doirwhat Is best but even more of doing what the public thinks is beI will take these in order.     (1) It is always wiser to legislate on the long view than cthe short view.  If the food available were an unincreassblescanty stock and we knew for certain that the emergency would boover in sTjTmonths I would certainly confiscate and ration.  Butour food is a flow and we do not know when the end will be (orWhat the relief prospects will be at the end), and in such casewe hove to consider what the effect of confiscation (or fixedprices) will be on the output and inflow and use of food over anindeterminate period.  In the latter cose free prices with theirincentive to production and check to consumption are unquestion-ably to be preferred.     (2) It is true that public feeling has to be humoured, evenperhaps at the expense of sound policy.  But popular demand isto a large extent a manufactured product.   The cries of&apos;\down with profiteering&quot; and &quot;the high prices scandal&quot; and &quot;ratimust come&quot; cun be and are worked up, if not originated,  by the&quot;stunt&quot; press, prompted by gallery instinct or adopted from sh.eeignorance of the subject.  They come also, of course, moregenuinely from labour leaders who have not thought the matter  ouThe Government of the day. if it Is clear that the coursosadvocated are wrong, ought to use its influence with the Pressand go to some pains to inform the public as to the  facts  of thecase, and the reasons why these courses are inadvisable,Our
     Our Food Controllers have also been influenced by the fearthat if prices were not controlled they would soar to extravagantheights  Certainly o small shortage in a primary necessity likefood can lead to a large price increase! but there is no warrantfor the assumption that, in r-ny circumstances which would permitof Great Britain continuing the war, food prices left to them-selves would become impossibly inflated.  If there were a 50per cent shortage prices might rise 1000 per cent; but longbefore that  condition of scarcity were reached the war would beover.  The extreme limit of our problem is a shortape of 10or perhaps 15 per cent, on present supplies.  Touch that limitand the wor is over- within that limit food prices would notrise fantastically high.  Step by step as they rise (disproport-lonately to other commodities) tho stimulation of supplies and theenforcement of economy in use would put.the brake on their ascent.     Much mischief has been done by unqualified statements frompress and platform that &quot;food prices have risen by 140 per cent&quot;.The Herald asks this week &quot;Who has pot tho profits ?&quot;,  Theimplication is entirely false, but the Government has taken noeffective steps to counter this kind of suggestion by publicity.The level of food prices cannot be considered apart from thegeneral price-level of all commodities.  Regarded thus, foodprices arc seen to have risen relatively very little.  Theywore at their highest, relatively, in June 1917.  In that month,according to the &quot;Economist&quot; Index Table food prices had risen by124 per cent over July 1914; but prices of all commodities hadrisen by 120 per cent: thus food prices had relatively hardlyadvanced at all.  Since th^t date the control prices have comeincreasingly into operation.  The Index figures for last month(January 1918) show that while food is up 105 per cent commoditiesgenerally are up 126 per cent.  This means that the foodproducer Is at the present time under the present Control regime,having his prices held down something like 20 per cent bolow thegeneral level.  The corn, potato, and other bounties make good thegreater part of this difference, but the net effect of all themeasures is not merely to destroy the special incentive to foodproduction and import but to Impose an actual deterrent upon it.It is a condition of things which can only lead to a seriouslyworsened food situation.     The general rise in prices, which has affected food equallywith other commodities, is duo mainly to the policy of financingthe ?/ar by loan, which has diminished the volume of civilsupplies much more than it has reduced effective purchasing poweroxerelsed by the general public.  The rise in the level of pricescould only be checked, during the further progress of the war, byincreased taxation of Incomes.     The contention that prices must be kept down to placate thepublic is of little weight while no steps are taken to acquaintthe public with these facts.  It is obliviousness to them &quot;whichallows the widespread belief (countenanced by nearly everynewspaper and fostered by every  labour organisation), that everyincrease in food prices is due to &quot;profiteering&quot;.  Wo definitionis riven of &quot;profiteer&quot;: if it were it would be seen that thegreater part of the so-called ^profiteering is salutary and onlya very small part baneful.  The farmer who*&quot;&quot;clamped&quot; his potatoeslast winter against the shortage and high prices which he couldforesee for the spring might have been ^profiteering&quot; but he wasalso carrying over the produce of the fat months against thefamine of the lean months.  Maximum prices were fixed ahead;  thepotatoes came out of the clamps, and during the four lean monthsof last spring and early summer there were no potatoes to be had,Much of the withholding by middlemen serves the same purpose oflevelling the curve of supplies.   Even the pure gambler whoby plunging into the food market tries to turn a speculativepenny out of the prospective need has his uses and losses as wellas his gains.  The.Pood Ministry has been too much concernedwith motives and too little with effects.  The game of &quot;hunt the profiteer&quot; is exciting; but it does not increase or economisethe food supply.
m 4 m     The enly sound feed policy Is one that stakes for increasedsupplies, diminished waste, and economy in use.   Free priceswould have served these needs;  controlled prices aye defeat-ing them.   Bounties, orders, appeals, assistance with manures,labour, and machinery, as also rationing, are doing much tooffset the injury;  &quot;faut a good deal of this positive actionoould have been taken under a free-price rfegime and would havereinforced the effect of free prices *   But it would be diffiouto reverse the policy now;  it could not be done at a stroke,,     An essential preliminary to any even gradual reversal ofpolicy is the education of the public in regard to the facts ofthe matter, the principles underlying sound policy, and theserious reactions of unsound measures.   Even as a means offorestalling agitation for further extensions of control this^ould be worth while,   It can be done most readily through thenewspapers.   One of the Government publiaity departments mightarrange for the publication of articles by oompetent writers,discussing in popular style the considerations touched uponabove.   They would, of course, have to be free from anysuggestion of &quot;white-washing the profiteer&quot;.   Professor BdwinCannan is the sort of writer who would do such articles toperfections   It would ee well worth while to arrange for suchhe to dieousa food policy with gatherings of newspaper prfprie-tors, editors and leader writers, and with Labour Leaders.     If the gradual release of pr cos were determined on, revisions would have to be made to pretect the public against he small number of real &quot;profiteers6 whose operations, thoughtrifling in comparison with the total volume of food traffic,oause suoh indignation among the public, and especifelly^amongthe organised workers, V&amp;IQ regard them aa &quot;typical of all oommerBy ^real profiteers&quot; I mean such as by deliberate manipulationof markets and supplies make private gain by exploiting ratherthan seizing public needs.   Inspection, publicity, and pelf,ceaction would serve as antiseptics and deterrents and would nothave the injurious reactions of prevention fcy control.     -Among the objects which the control of prices is de-signedto serve is that of preventing the special hardship theyooeasioihto people of small means and particularly to the verypoor.   It is undeniable that they do operate with cruelinequality;  but the remedy for that as regards food is not tomake food disproportionately cheap at the expense of the foodproducer, but to abolish or relieve penury. -  If the prise offood is te &quot;be kept down for charitable reasons below its realexchange value then  the food-producer must either be subsidisedor remain at a disadvantage as compared with the producer of otfcthings.   Subsidisation has been adopted in the case of bread.It is an easier and less objectionable way of keeping bread wit):the reach of the poorest than minimum wages and pour relief; butthe cheaperl.ig of bread to the few is a costly device which willfurther increase purchasing power in relation t* supplies and BOsend the level of other prices higher still.     The working of food-control in Great Britain is rendered issome ways more complex and in other ways more simple by the faotof our normally deriving two-thirds of our food-stuffs fromabroad.   The purchase of grain, sugar, and other staples fromabroad is ti the hands of Government Commissions and shippingfreights are under official regulation, so that these articlesare already in the ownership and control of the Government whenthey arrive in port.   If the Government hands over theseimportB to the merchants at a cost-plus-expenses prices itnot unnaturally inclines to control their selling prices downthe distributing channels to theproducer.   Thus,  as regardsimported foods, the Government controls the supply and makesthe prioe, and this in turn makes the psiee of the correspondinghome
hems product.   If the imported foods have been bought cheaplyend are Sold here at a price which makes the corresponding homeproduct unprofitable to produce the home production of thatarticle will fall off *   This can be prevented by fixing theprice of the imported article at a level consonant with thegeneral level of home prices - with allowance for degree ofscarcity - the Goveriiment taking the profit.   In the caee ofarticles not produced at home, such as sugar, the complicationsof rationing might h&amp;ve been avoided had the selling pricebeen been raised until the demand conformed to the supply.   Thegain to the revenue from this procedure would have served byso much to diminish borrowing and check the upward trend cfprieee generally.      In view of the amount of Irrii&amp;tien caused and regulationnecessitated by a shortage in materials such as tea, sugar, butterand margarine, which comprise in the aggregate but a triflingpercentage of the total volume and cost of imports, it would beimmensely worth while to give financial and cargo-spacefacilities for the importation of the full amount of the goodsrequired.   It is not a matter of impossibility:  merely offriority.   The cost and trouble entailed by the shortage in hese articles is out of all proportion to the saving effected.The man-power that is beiag and is going te be absorbed iscemtrolling and rationing them would corns near sufficing tt bringthem in and pay for them.  (All energy cornss out of one pool.If the pool is drawn on for one purpose  it is so far exhaustedfor another)*      Importation is at present impeded and production for theBritish market in neutral countries discouraged by the compulsorylow prices in force here.   The release of prices would domuch to augment our supplies from without.          supreme concern of the Government in regard to PoodPolicy should be to increase and maintain supplies.   Labouris sestet,and it id important to determine how effort shall bedirected in order to yeild the mmimM amount of food per unitof labour employed.      The food-provision services fall into three categories;home, production. Including agriculture and sea-fishing; ship-building to replace tonnage sunk; andtraneport, including bethsea transport and the conveyance of goods from docks to theconsumer.   To which of these services should priority of claimbe given on the ground of greatest productivity per unit of labourapplied?   The data necessary for the calculation are scrappyand many assumptions have to be made, but the following figurescan be taken as broadly correct.   (For details of calculationaee Edinburgh Review July 1917 page 35 et seq.):*  Inw^&amp;iculture one person produces about six tons of food for humanconsumption per year.   In sea-fishing one person producessixteen tons in a year - nearly three times the weight producedby the agricultural worker.   In shipbuilding the labour of oneperson is calculated to furnish per year 30 tons of food,  orunder the conditions immediately in prospect,  about five timesas much food as a corresponding unit devoted to agriculturalproduction at home.   Shipbuilding is therefore the best labour-investment fer the nation at the present time;   sea-fishingthe next; and agriculture the last.      The importance of keeping shipping well  served by ourdoeke and railways so that it can make the largest  possiblenumber of voyages in e given tine cannot be overrated.    In thisrespect there is still boopu for improvement.    The food-oostof congestion at the docks and on the railways  Is immssgaair&amp;blygreater than the labour required to  relieve it.
m. Q m     The further allocation of labour-power should be asfollows .  First, the shipbuilding yards should be keptsupplied with the requisite number of skilled workersand with as much suitable unskilled labour as can bespared, and a sufficient number of men should be allottedto the docks and railways to ensure the quickest possibleunloading and distribution of cargoes; second, everyeffort should be made to keep the sea. fisheries at thehighest level of productivity by retaining skilled fisher.men, by diluting their labour with supplementary untraineojlabour, and by replacing the losses of fishing-craft oradding to the number afloat; third, while it is mostdesirable to retain skilled agricultural workers uponthe land,  additional labour for agriculture should comefrom those classes of workers who are unsuitable for, ornot required in, the previously mentioned occupations.     I have said above that rationing In Germany has notsecured share-and-share-alike and thot it will not do sohere.  The reason is that rationing cannot be applied toall foods (that would be Impossibly complicated) but onlyto certain staple foods.  There is thus always c marginof nan-rationed special and luxurious foods which therich are oble to buy to supplement their rations, andwhich the poor cannot buy. , (In the ca^e of sugar at pre-sent the well-to-do can buy honey, syrups, preserves etcRationing in practice does not satisfy the working-classdemand for &quot;equal portions&quot;.  The tendency with rationingas with price-control is to spread over one article afteranother until the system becomes too unwieldy to work.&quot;oreover,  nothing can prevent in practice the food pro-ducers from esting as much as they like and &quot;accommodatintheir friends and relatives.  They moy conform for awhilebut neither patriorism nor respect for the law, nor fearof penalties can maintain conformity for long.Rationing is comparatively easy in the case of articleswholly Imported (tea, sugar, etc); it is immensely moredifficult with articles purchased at home.  Rationingdoes not,  of course, ensure that the very poorest willget their portions, for the purchase money has still tobe found.  Finally, rationing makes for waste in that itprompts people who would otherwise do with less, to takeand use the portion prescribed.     Practically every unsound notion in regard to foodpolicy comes from regarding, food as a stock to be appor-tioned instead of a flow to be maintaineoT&quot;&quot; An exampleof this is the advice gfven to wealthy people to buyexpensive foods and op leave the cheap foods to the poor.Expensive foods ere foods that have absorbed much labourin proportion to their nutriment value.  If the wealthyfollow this edvice, they will create a demand for theselabour-wasting foods, and labour which ought to be devoteto producing food whici%. gives most nutriment for lesseffort, will be diverted to the production of foods 7/hichgive minimum nutriment for maximum effort.   All people,whatever their means, should be encouraged to buy so asto get the best nutriment value for their money.  Onlyso will nationally-advantageous production be maintained.Rationing makes for  alee economy by setting up a demandfor non-rationed expensively-produced articles.If
     If supplies could be temporarily increased by thecomparatively small amount necessary to make good thepresent shortages the abandonment of price-control andrationing would be much facilitated.  The /linistrieswould still have planty to &quot;do in helping out themachinery of production and distribution by acting asintelligence, cdvice, and assistance bureaux.   The localfood committees, with power to demand information fromproducers and sellers, and in communication with a centralintelligence department would still have important func-tions.   A rapid and sure ^Intelligence&quot; system with&quot;publicity&quot; arrangements would serve to cure most of theevils who are apt to arise in times of dislocation andrapid change such as the ^present.
