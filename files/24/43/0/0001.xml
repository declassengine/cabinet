Mr. Arthur Samuels,  K.C.,H.P,,  Solicitor General for Irelandtook BO prominent and able a part In the Home Rule controversybefore the War that I think it advisable to circulate the followingmemorandum which he has given me  .an the subject of the degree offiscal control which ought in existing ciicuinstances to be grantedto anylrieh Parliament which may be  established.Irish Office.  8.W.   February 22nd,  1918.(Signed)    Hi 1. DUKEMemorandum of the Solicitor General for Ireland.Chief Secretary,      With regard to the fiscal powers which should be entrustedto an Irish Parliament in the event  of the Convention agreeingUpon a Constitution which may be found acceptable in other respects,I am of opinion that the wisest course would i$e to entrust thebroadest possible powers to Ireland both ag to Cuatoms and Excise.      The effect  of imposing limitations on Irish financial powerswill be to give opportunities which will unquestionably be takenfor renewed agitation against England and English Commercial Policyand to reintroduce the bitter l8th Century Controversies which ledto the Renunciation Act of 1782.      Arrangements should be made as a basis of settlement to securea substantial Imperial Contribution from Ireland in men and money,and for free trade between Great Britain and Ireland.      These arrangements would be difficult but ought not to beinsoluble and probably the whole matter in its Imperial aspects willhave to be considered in relation to the Colonies after the War.      The Irish &quot;Question&quot; is - as apart from its Revolutionary andhostile aspects - a question of sentiment - and if legislation isundertaken to satisfy sentiment the inure fully it is satisfied thebetter the chance of harmonious relatione in the future.(Initialled)    A. W. S.21st February,  1918.
