The Cabinet decided on 3rd August, 1926 (Cabinet 50 (26) ), that the question of . Chemical Warfare Policy should be reserved for discussion at the forthcoming Imperial Conference. I am accordingly circulating a fresh memorandum on this subject which is in amplification of the one already prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and circulated by me to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 29th July, 1926 (C.I.D. Paper 709-B). It deals chiefly with a comparison of the statistics of casualties caused by gas and of those caused by other weapons, which goes to prove the contention already made-that &quot; gas is not less humane than are other recognized weapons of war.&quot;2. I suggest that copies of both these memoranda be laid before the Imperial Conference.01534964L. W.-E.The War office,8th October, 1926.Chemical Wabeare Policy.1. In paragraph 3 of the General Staff Memorandum on Chemical Warfare Policy which was circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 29th July, 1926 (C.I.D. Paper 709-B), it was stated that &quot; gas is not less humane than are other recognized weapons of war.&quot; In the following note statistics of, and effects on, casualties are reviewed in some detail, and the results of the comparison of gas with other forms of casualties prove the truth of the above contention.2. The following figures show the percentages of deaths to total casualties evacuated from the battlefield, and to gas casualties evacuated, for the British forces in France and Belgium : War Office Statistical Abstract.Period.		Number of total 3asualties evacuated.	Deaths.	Percentage of deaths.August, 1914, to June, 1918         ......		1,698,521	126,746	per cent. 7-5(b26/18)   50   10/26   w.o.p.   2843......... - ,-, ...
Ministry of Pensions Statistics.Period.	Number of gas casualties evacuated.	Deaths.	Percentage of deaths.April, 1915, to November, 1918    ......	180,983	6,062	per cent. 3-if those killed outright on the battlefield are included, the percentage of deaths to total casualties due to all weapons works out at 37 per cent.3. It is not possible, owing to lack of records, to compare the namber of men killed outright by gas and those killed by shot or shell on the battlefield. It is known, however, that of 150,000 cases admitted to hospital suffering- from mustard gas, less than 4,000 or 2&apos;7 per cent. died. As the number of men who were killed outright by mustard gas was almost infinitesimal, it may be assumed that not more than 3 per cent, of the total of those gassed by mustard gas lost their lives.It is similarly impossible with absolute accuracy to state the percentage of deaths due to weapons other than gas in the Great War. It is known, however, that in the Franco-German War of 1870-71&apos;, this percentage for the German Army was 18*8, and in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05) the percentage of deaths to total casualties in the Japanese Army was 34 per cent. Such figures as are available tend to show that for the Great War (1914-18) the percentage was considerably higher.4. The above statistics prove conclusively that gas, as used in the last war, was far less destructive of human life than shot and shell.5. The consensus of medical opinion in Great Britain, France, Italy, Germany and America appears to be in agreement with the following tabular statement of the comparative effects of gas and gun shot (or shell) wounds : 	Gun shot (or shell).	Gas.	(a) Pain   ... (6) Death. ...      ............ (c) Mutilation (d) Detention in hospital * Permanent disability (e) Degree of such permanent disability when present.	Much............ Frequent Not infrequent Months... Common Often severe   ...	Little. Unusual. Never. Weeks. Rare. Practically always very-slight.	* Of the total disabilities caused by the war to British troops, approximately 2 per cent, were due to gas, 34 per cent, were classified as due to wounds and 64 per cent, due to disease.^All except (a) above are based on statistics which cannot be refuted.6. The question of relative pain must necessarily be a difficult one to decide, but such -evidence as is available bears out the above statement. For instance, Professor Haldane writing in &quot; Callinicus&quot; states, &quot;I regard the type of wound produced by the average shell as, on the whole, more distressing than the pneumonia caused by chlorine or phosgene. Besides being wounded, I have been, buried alive, and on several occasions in peace time I have been asphyxiated to the point of unconsciousness. The pain and discomfort arising from the other experiences were utterly negligible compared with those produced by a good septic shell wound &quot;. This statement is endorsed by those members of the Chemical Warfare Research staff who have been both wounded and gassed.7. The difference in psychological effect between gas and other weapons is more difficult to gauge ; but, even if in human beings of low intelligence and education gas induces more terror than do bullets or shell, this can hardly counter-balance the comparative humaneness of the former as shown in the above comparison of effects.8. It is possible that some critics, while agreeing that gas warfare as hitherto practised is not unduly inhumane, may base their advocacy of abolition on the fear that some gases at present unknown may suddenly be found and employed in war with -overwhelmingly disastrous effect. Such an argument, it is submitted, is not one on which a decision to relinquish a useful and practical weapon of war should be based. Discovery of such a gas will not be prevented by signature of an international convention. There can never be any certainty that all signatories will observe the convention even if
mo new gases are discovered, and there must inevitably be a danger chat if we proclaim -our readiness to abstain from using gas, our research work and general preparedness for gas warfare will suffer.9. It has been suggested that ratification of the Geneva Protocol is of slight importance, since it would only bind us to refrain from using gas against those signatories who also abstain from its use, and that our bands would be free in regard to non-signatories and those nations which infringe the Convention. It is a little difficult to sustain the logic of this contention. Besides the danger of unpreparedness which has been referred to above, it is hardly to be expected that public opinion would countenance our using even non-lethal gas in small wai&apos;s, where it might be of immense value, when we have publicly proclaimed that its use against Great Powers, who are in a position largely to protect themselves, is barbarous.
