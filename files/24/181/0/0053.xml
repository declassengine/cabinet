S POCUMEIIT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BHITAHNIC MAJESTYrS. GOVEMMEHT)SI.COPY NO.  /X553(86)CABINET. CHEMICAL WARFARE POLICY. HOTS BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR WAR,I circulate for the information of the Cabinet a memorandum by Lord Onslow on Chemical Gas Warfare.(intaj L.W.E.OFFICE, S,W.l. October 18th, 1926.
Article 5 of the Treaty signed at Washington on February 6th, 1922, runs as follows:-&quot;The use in war of asphyxiating,    poisonous or other gases....... having been justly condemned by the general opinionof the civilised world, and a prohibition of such use having bean declared in treaties to which a majority of the civilised Powers are parties:The Signatory Powers, to the and that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as part of international law binding alike the conscience and practice of nations, declare their assent to such prohibition, agree to be bound thereby as between themselves and invite all other civilised nations to adhere thereto&quot;.This Article forms part of a treaty which also regulates&apos; therules adopted by civilised nations for the protection of lives of neutrals and non-combatants at saa in time of war.    Tkere-fore, the Treaty of Washington does not exclusively provide forthe regulation of the use of gas in war.     It was signed by therepresentatives of Great Britain, America,- France, Italy and japan and all the Dominions except Ii^eland.    (Ireland, ofcourse, at that time had&apos; not Dominion status).    In Article 6 itis laid down that the Treaty should take effect when all the ratifications had been deposited, and Article 7 provides forthe adhesion of non-signatory powers.The Protocol signed at Geneva in June, 1925, states that:-&quot;Wheraas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous orother gases,....... has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world.; andWhereas the prohibition ox such use has been declared in Treaties to which,the majority of powers of the world are Parties; and.Declare:That the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already
already Parties to treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration&quot;.This Protocol was signed by Germany, America, Brazil, the British Empire, Canada, India, Chile, Denmark, Spain, esthonia, Abyssinia, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Luxemburg, Nicaragua, Holland, Poland, Portugal, Boumania, Salvador, Switzerland, Servia, ifturkey and Uruguay.   It provides that it shall become operative between all States who have deposited their ratifications.    It thus differs from the Washington treaty in that while reaffirming the principle of the non-use of chemicals in war it also includes the Prohibition of the use of bacteria.   Also, while the Washington Treaty deals with other subjeets, this Protocol only deals with chemical and bacteriological warfare.     Further, while the Washington Treaty is lnopera-tive until all the Signatory Powers have deposited ratificationa the Geneva protocol becomes operative betwaen any Powers who may deposit ratifications.As regards the Signatories of the two instruments, the whole of the British Empire has signed the Washington, Treaty, v^heraas of the Dominions Ireland, South Africa, Australia and Hew Zealand have not signed the Geneva Protocol.     Both these instruments are liable to- thesame
same criticism that whilst operative between the Powers who have ratified them they arc not operative between a Power that has ratified and a Powar that has not, consequently a Power that has ratified at war with two allies, one of whom has ratified and the other who has not, would be at an obvious disadvantage     Ihe Geneva Protocol was sprung upon the Arms Traffio Conference by the American representative.     Originally this question of gas warfare was not- in the terms of reference of the Arms Traffic Conference.     When, however * lln Burton brought the matter forward, and agreed to a draft simply reaffirming the 7/ashington Treaty and adding bacteriological warfare thereto, it was impossible to refuse to accept it without denouncing our signature of the Washington treat     The incident of the Geneva Protocol, is, however, a valuable instance of the manner in which we as a Signatory Power of the Washington Treaty must become further and furthercommitted
committed towards an anti-chemical warfare policy so long aswe remain under the moral,  though not legal obligation, entailed by our signature of the Washington Treaty.In vie.:&apos; of the memorandum circulated to the Cabinet on the 8th October  (723&apos;3)  It seems to me that we must arrive at a definite decision of policy on this question at an early dale, because  in every discussion at Geneva on the question of disarmament and kindred subjects we shall be pushed further and further in the direction of the  policy laid down at Washington, which is now shown to be directly contrary to the policy advocated by tho General Staff,.      It seems to me that we have two alternatives before us   (a)  to state quite plainly that we have  reconsidered our attitude,  and that we have adopted the attitude advocated by the General Staff.    In such a course it seems we should be in accord with the American Legion who are opposing the ratification of the Geneva    Protocol on the ground of the humanitarianism of gas as compared with other weapons..    On the other hand it would be a very considerable volte-face,  and the political and diplomatic difficulties  in such a course are too obvious to need emphasis.    The  (b) alternative course, would be to say that we are unable to ratify the Geneva Protocol or the Washington Treaty (at any rate so far as Article 5 is concerned) until all countries have accepted the Geneva Protocol, and it seems to me that we should have very good grounds  for such a course  in view of the advantage which a Power allied with a nen-adtie r ing Power would have over an adhering Power alone.    Thus supposing Prance and Germany were at &quot;war and both of them had ratified the Geneva Protocol,  one or the other would only have to obtain the alliance of Luxemburg  (provided Luxemburg were a non-adhering Power)  to be able  to use gas whenever they liked.It is urged,  and urged with a great leal of truth, that even if all the States of the world were to ratify the Geneva Protocol It would be very little guarantee against/the&apos;
the use of gas in war, and indeed it ig rather peculiar to see that many of those who profess their belief in the good faith of belligerent States towards one another in regard to the prohibition of gas in war are also advocates of the international control or supervision of armaments in peace.   Undoubtedly, from the memorandum of the General Staff  they would prefer that we should denounce our Washington attitude, but this is a very considerable step to take,  and I think that If we were to state openly that we do not intend to ratify either instrument until all Powers have done so we should be perfectly safe.    It is outside the range of practical politics that all Powers will ratify.    One thing I feel we must avoid, and that is any ambiguity as to our attitude and which would lay us open to a charge of duplicity in this matter. &apos; It must be remembered that the discussions at Geneva are open debates, and that the representatives there make use of all the usual methods of press campaigns and political intrigue to further their views.    Also our delegates very often have to make up their minds on the spot during the course of a debate as to any answer which they must give.    We may be represented at Geneva conferences by those who conscientiously and firmly believe in the principles of the Washing&apos;, on Treaty,  and therefore so long as we maintain those principles in public we are bound to be committed more and more thereto,  and to be driven away from the attitude advocated by the General Staff.      If, however, we adopt  (a) a policy of denunciation, or  (b) say that we consider ourselves perfectly free to use gas until all Powers have agreed to accept the Geneva Protocol, our attitude would be perfectly logical, but if we follow  (bl  I think that so far as practical politics are concerned we should be able to meet the views of the General Staff.12/10/26.
