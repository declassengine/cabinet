This document is the property of Hi3 Britannic \Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government.)CABINET. E C R E T. _   :1,P.  558 (26) .POLICE  (APPEALS) BILL. 7Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1 wish to bring before my Colleagues the attached draft Bill to give an appeal to any member of a Police Force who is dismissed or required to resign as an alternative to dismissal.The following are, briefly, the circumstances in which the Bill has been prepared.    In the Metropolitan Police the Commissioner of Police is the disciplinary authority and dismisses as well as appoints members of the,Force.    The investigation of any serious disciplinary charge is conducted by a Discipline Board,  consisting of three Superior Officers of the Force.    Their finding is subject to confirmation by the Commissioner,  and the defaulter may appeal to the Commissioner if he wishes so to do.In the County Forces the Chief Constable,  like the Commissioner in the Metropolitan Police,  is the disciplinary authority.    He conducts any disciplinary inquiries, hears the witnesses,  etc., and his decision,  like the Commissioner^, is final.In the Borough Forces the disciplinary authority is the Watch Committee.    The form of the disciplinary inquiry varies? in some forces it is left entirely to the Chief Constable and the Watch Committee does little more than confirm the Chief Constable&apos;s finding, while in other forces the Watch Committee themselves conduct the inquiry throughout.While the primary responsibility for the administration of discipline thus rests with the Chief Officer of Police or the Watch Committee,  as the case may be, the Secretary of State also has important responsibilities of a supervisory nature.    Thus, under Section 16 of the County and Borough
Police Act,  in56,  the payment of the statutory Exchequer subvention to any force is contingent on the issue of the Secretary of State&apos;s certificate that the force has been maintained in a state of efficiency in point of numbers and discipline, and the payment of the Supplementary Exchequer Grant is also contingent on the Secretary of State being satisfied that the force has been fully and efficiently administered-The question of the institution of an appeal has been discussed for a good many years,  more particularly since the issue of the Report of the Dosborough Committee, who recommended that an appeal should be given to a tribunal consisting in England of a Barrister appointed by the Secretary of State, with one of H.M.  Inspectors of Constabulary as assessor on technical matters and in Scotland, the Sheriff, with H.M.  Inspector as assessor-This recommendation has not been acted upon-    I have now, however,   come to the conclusion that an appeal should be given not to a tribunal such as the i^esborough Committee indicated, but to the Secretary of State himself.On the main question,  I feel that there is much force in the arguments for giving an appeal,  especially in the County Forces - not because there is any reason to think that Chief Constables do not administer justice fairly and considerately, but because there is a possibility of bias or caprice affecting their decisions in individual cases,  and it is repugnant to current ideas that a constable&apos;s whole career should be at the absolute determination of any individual officer,  without . reference or appeal to any other authority.    In this I am representing primarily the point of view of the lower ranks, but several recent incidents have indicated the desirability of an appeal for the protection of superior officers of Police  (Chief Constables or Superintendents) who may be serving under a Standing Joint Committee or Watch Committee with a Labbur majority and whose conception of their duty may,
in certain circumstances, differ widely from that of their Police Authority *The representatives of the lower ranks have been pressing for effect to be given to the D3sborough Committee&apos;s recommendation,  and Chief Officers of Police have also been pressing upon me the difficulties of their position.    I think it is clear that sooner or later an appeal of some kind must be given and that it is desirable to deal with the matter now and establish an appeal on sound lines.As to the form of the tribunal, I unhesitatingly reject the recommendation of the Desborough Committee.    It is essential,  in my view, that the tribunal, whatever it may be, should be one that is definitely associated with the Police Service, understanding the nature of Police discipline and the essential importance of safeguarding the reputation of the Service.    I reject also the suggestion that in the County Forces an appeal might be given from the Chief Constable to the Standing Joint Committee, because it would,  in my opinion, be a retrograde step to introduce in the County Forces the administration of discipline by Committee, especially by Committees whose decisions are so frequently based on political considerations as are those of the Standing Joint Committees to-day,    The course I propose is to extend the Secretary of State&apos;s present functions and to give an appeal to him,  after inquiry by one of H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary or such other tribunal as he may find it expedient to appoint for the purpose.I do not pretend that a measure of this kind will be wholly uncontrovsrsial.    The spokesmen for the Police will press for the Dssborough Committee&apos;s recommendation:    the representatives of the Police Authorities on the other hand would oppose such a proposal with all the weight    they could bring to bear.    I am satisfied, however,  that the proposal embodied in the Bill is not only right on the merits but is
25th October,  1926.much more likely to afford a basis for fairly general agreement than any other alternative that could be suggested. I should like to have an oarly decision so that I may be able to prepare the way for having the Bill passed next Session.I understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland is in accord with the proposal to provide an appeal but is of opinion that the principle of an appeal to a Minister is essentially unsatisfactory.W.J.H.
