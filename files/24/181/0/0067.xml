Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I desire to submit, for tho consideration of my colleagues the following programme of legislation to be introduced by the Board of Trade in the Session of 1927:-(1) Sale of Food (Weights and Measures).This Bill - which carries out the recommendations of the Food Council with regard to short weight and measure in the sale of food - passed the House of Lords last summer,  and may I hope be got through the House of Commons this autumn. If not, however,  I should ask for its early re-introduction in the Lords next session.    It is a measure for which there is a strong demand.(2), The Cinema Industry.If,  as the result of discussions at the Imperial Conference the Government decide to legislate for &quot;blind booking&quot; or a quota, or both , such legislation should be passed as early as possible in the session.-(3) Company Law Amendment.A measure Is being prepared to give effect to the recommendations of the Committee which reported in May last. The Committee was strong, and its work thorough,  and there is a wide demand for legislation.    The Bill could conveniently be introduced in the Lords. (4) Food in Cold 3tore.The Imperial Conference are considering the question ofthe introduction of legislation to provide for the compulsoryreturn and publication of particulars as to stocks of foodstuffsin cold storage in those countries of the Empire which are-I-DOCUMENT 13 THS PROPERTY OF HI    BRITANNIC MAJB3TY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.C R S T. . -CABINET.

concerned.    If the Conference recommends that such legislation should be introduced wherever needed,  it will be incumbent upon u3 to bri ng in a 3111 In this country, but it may be that the best course will be to try to get international agreement first.    This is a matter on which the Imperial Conference will express an opinion.(5)_International Maritime Conventions.Legislation may be required to effect some alterations in our law before the following International Conventions are ratified,  i.e.,  the Conventions on (a) Limitation of Shipowners&apos; Liability,  (b) Maritime Mortgages and Liens, (c) Immunity of State-owned Ships,  and (d) Oil Pollution of Navigable Waters.    The Bill for this purpose could be introduced in the House of Lords. ( 6 ) Mar chand i se Mark s (Ko. 2) Bill.The main Merchandise Marks Bill has passed its Committee stage in the Commons,  and will,  it is anticipated, be put through its remaining stages before Christmas. But, as I have said on other occasions,  it will be    desirable to bring in another Merchandise Marks Bill  also,  containing a number of useful amendments of the existing law which have been recommended from time to time and are long overdue.  It would not be of a controversial character,  though it would no doubt involve a good deal of discussion. (7) Coast Protection.A number of agricultural Members and local authorities on the sea coast have been pressing for a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the Roj^al Commission on Coast Erosion. A Bill has been prepared, and might be introduced in the House of Lords.(8) Assurance Comnany Amendment*There is a Committee still considering- amendments to the Assurance Company Law,   and it will probably report fairly early n-3xt ?year.  I will in due course ask for my colleagues&apos;
assent to the introduction of a measure to give effect to the Committee&apos;3 recommendations in so far as they may seem to be des irable 0I would accordingly request the Cabinet to give its approval in principle to Bills on the subjects indicated above, subject to their submission, when the proper time comes in each case,  to the Home Affairs Committee as usual. The only Bill which has already been approved, bot h by that Committee and the Cabinet,  is No.  (1), the Sale of Pood (Weights and Measures) Bill. In this case, I ask for its early re-introduction next Session, if it does not become law this Session.(Intld).    P.C-L.Board of Trade.1st November, 1926.
