t(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY \ SGOVERNMENT).CABIN E T.BROADCASTING OF CONTROVERSY .(Memorandum by the Postmaster General).355(26).1.I am anxious to get on with preparation of theDraft Charter and Licence for the new Broadcasting Corporation, and accordingly I desire a decision as to whether the Corporation shall be prohibited from broadcasting matters of political,  religious or industrial controversy. The B.B.C. as it at present exists has, from the  beginning, been debarred from broadcasting controversial matter of any kind save upon certain exceptional occasions  (such as the last General Election and the General Strike)j    border line cases are submitted by the E.B.C. to the Post Office and, in effect,  the Postmaster General&apos;s function is confined to deciding whether the matter proposed to be broadcasted is &quot;controversial&quot;  or not;    if he considers that it is, he prohibits its issue or requires an undertaking that the controversial element shall be excised.2. Lord Crawford&apos;s Committee recommended that &quot;a moderate amount of controversial matter should be broadcast provided the material is of high quality and distributed with scrupulous fairness, and that the discretion of the Commissioners in this connection should be upheld&quot;.5. The broadcasting of controversial matter seems to fall into two categories:-(a) The broadcasting of 1 editorials&apos;, equivalent to leading articles, produced by and on the authority of the Corporation itself and presumably representing their own views.(b)
(b) The broadcasting of speeches, lectures cr debates by prominent men upon controversial topics.As regards (a),  it appears to me thn t a Corporation which is vested with the monopoly of this powerful instrument of propaganda should be definitely debarred from using it to disseminate its own views upon controversial subjects;  other-wise the Corporation would, be in a unique position to mould public opinion without any external control and free from the check whioh,  in the case of the Press,  is provided by unrestricted competition.(\) The broadcasting of speeches,  etc.,   stands on a different footing, as the speakers themselves are responsible for the opinions expressed, and the audience can form their own judgment upon the authority behind them.    Further,  if impartiality is preserved both sides of every question will normally be presented.4. I am convinced that if the Postmaster General or any other Minister is required to exercise any kind of censorship, he can only do it on the rigid line of vetoing all controversy as is done at present.    He would be placed in an intolerable position if he were required to determine upon his own judgment which controversial broadcasts were to be admitted and whioh were to be barred.    If,  on the other hand,  the determination is left to the discretion of the Corporation, it is evident that the practical difficulties of giving equal opportunities to both sides of a controversial question will be considerable.    A speech by one political leader may be broadcast and a rejoinder may be given in several speeches from the  other side,  among which a selection must be made; particular speeches may be crowded out by other more attractive items and,  in spite of all attempts to preserve impartiality,
a section of the public will certainly repent the wide publicity which would be given to doctrines whioh they dislike.5. At the same time,  it is indisputable that a large section of the public would welcome the inclusion in the programmes of matters of current interest and political importance, and would be attracted by the opportunity of hearing protagonists in various controversies.    It seems a drastic curtailment of the potentialities, educative and otherwise,  of broadcasting if all matters of controversy, which necessarily cover nearly all the important questions of the day, are rigorously barred,  and it will tend to accentuate the complaints, which are growing., that the non-musical portions of the programmes are too colourless and insipid.6. So long as the broadcasting service was controlled by the wireless manufacturers, the ban upon the controversial matter was justifiable and necessary.    But the establishment of a new Corporation of a quasi-public character and independent of commercial interests affords an opportunity for giving the programmes a wider scope in accordance with the Crawford recommendations.    There will no doubt be occasions on which, the action of the Corporation in admitting or rejectingparticular speeches will arouse criticism, but I think that the new body may be trusted to proceed with discretion,  to feel their way gradually and to keep in step with public opinion.7. If the proposals of the preceding paragraphs be accepted, I propose to include in the Licence under the Charter -(a) A general power to the Postmaster General to prohibit by notice to the Corporation the broadcast of any matter(either
(either particular &quot;or general) specified in such notice, e.g., &quot;Editorials&quot;).(b) A clause on the following model:-&quot;It is hereby declared by the Postmaster General and agreed by the Corporation that in permitting the broadcasting of natters of controversy the Corporation shall be guided by the governing principle of impartiality and shall ensure that adequate opportunity is given for the presentation of oonflioting views&quot;.(Intld) W. M-T.GENERAL POST OFFICE, 18th October,  1926.
