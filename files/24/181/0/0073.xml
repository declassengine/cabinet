J (jC.B.-575  (26) .CABINET.THE POSITION CP GOVERNORS-GENERAL ANDTHE REPRESENTATION ^F GREAT britain in THE DOMINIONS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.As the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs warned the Cabinet at their last meeting was likely to occur,  the Prime Minister ofthe Dominion of CanadaConference on Inter-Imperial Relations the question of the position of Governors-General and the connected question of the representation of the British Govern-ment in the Dominions.Mr Mackenzie King&apos;s first point was that the Governors-General should cease to be the channel of communication between the Dominion Governments and ourselves.    He apprehends that,if this is not done, the Grown may sooner or-.later becoi.ce involved in Parlia-mentary and other controversies in a Dominion.    He points out that in former times the Governor-General was not only the representative of the King but was also the agent of the British Government, through whom . riego t iatlons with the Government of the Dominion, (or  &quot;Colony&quot; as it was&apos; then called) were conducted.has brought before the Committee of the Imperial
How, however,  that the Governor-General has practically ceased to be in any sense an agent of the British Government, be thinks  that even the channel of oora-nrunication through him should cease, and that his future status should be solely that of representative of the King,    Mr Mackenzie King then developed his proposal a stage further by suggesting that the British Government should in future have a represent4 ative, other than the Governor-General,  in theDominion, through whom communications between the two Governments could pass.    He pointed out that at present, when he received a communication from the British Government, whether direct or through their High Commissioner in London, it was necessarily surrounded by the atmosphere of London.    If a cormrru-communication were sent through a British High Commissioner in Canada, the message would be presented with regard to the atmosphere of Ottawa, since the High Commission-er would be free to. state the matter in his own language.    Another advantage which Mr Mackenzie King claimed for his proposal was that messages transmitted through the channel of a British representative in Ottawa would not be liable to publication,    At present all communications  arrive in the form of despatches, either telegraphic or written,  and the Prime Minister of Canada is under constant pressure from his Farlia-ment to publish such despatches.  That difficulty would be met by the adoption of the new means of communication which he proposes, sinoe the Parliament of the Dominion, would, have no right to demand messages sent through a British agent.    Mr Mackenzie King added that he often finds it difficult to reply to the communications he receives.    The formulation of ideas
in tlie fore of despatches, every word of which has to be weighed:, requires precision,  and with his many preoccupations as Prime Minister of a Dominion he finds it difficult to give the necessary time to tha matter.    He made a strong plea,  therefore, for the partial substitution,  at any rate,  of a personal for a written channel of communication.    In personal conversation Mr Mackenzie King ercpba- siaes, even more than he did in Committee, the advantages to the British (government from his proposal.   At the present time, he points out, the British Government has no-one in a Dominion to press their point of view.    In Canada the Governor-General naturally identifies himself as much as possible with the Dominion,  and refers r. a inly to Canada in his speeches.    The United States of America, have an admirable Consul-General, who is constantly advertising &quot;Old Glory&quot; .    The Mother-country, however, has no public advocate, and no-one on the spot to support the representations to the Canadian Govern-ment of Trades Commissioners or other British officials of secondary status.    To sum up Mr Mackenzie King&apos;s statement, his view is that the Governor-General has ceased, to act as a personal agent to represent the views of the British Government,  and remains only as a c ha an el for wr i 11 e n bpmmu ni catio ns .The Governor-General no longer ought to be used as a channel of personal communica-ti on, and some substitute ought to be found.   ,
Mr Bruce, perhaps, emphasized more strongly than Mr Mackenzie King that in fact the Governor-General has in all respects ceased already to be an agent for the British Government, and that already he in fact only represents the King.    He also laid stress on the point that the Dominions receive the point of view of the British Government only through the medium of despatches,  and attached great importance to some method of personal communication, although I do not think he made it quite clear as to whether he would prefer the personal communication to be in London or in the Dominion,,or both.General Hertzog stated clearly that he shared the view of Mr Mackenzie King, and emphasized his opinion that the position of the Governor-General should be solely that of the King&apos;s representative. He also favoured the plan of conferring on the High Commissioner of the Dominion in London what he described as  &quot;something more of a diplomatic status&quot;.Mr Ooates, while supporting the general principle of personal communication., did not support, as suited to present conditions, the idea either of a British High Commissioner in the Dominion or of an addition to the functions of the High Commissioner in London. He wanted to proceed more gradually.    His idea appears to be rather that a British official, preferably a junior officer of the Foreign Office, should always be attached,, for periods of two or three years, to the staff of the Prime Minister of a Dominion, to assist him in elucidating the information he receives from London,.and that he should be supplemented in London by a representative of the office of the Prime Minister of the Dominion as a liaison officer, presumably on
the lines of Mr Casey.    Mr Coatas has undertaker to develop his idea in a separate Memorandum,The representatives  of the Irish Free State supported Mr Mackenzie King&apos;s proposals in the main, and favoured a plan by which Dominions High Gowmis-sioners in london should have an extension of direct access to British Ministers in london.Mr Monroe,  on behalf of Newfoundland, did not want any further channel of comtrrunie a t ion, but only direct communication with the British Government,. Generally speaking, his position was similar to that of Mr Coates&apos; .In view of the desire expressed at the Cabinet for further consideration of this matter if it, should arise, my colleagues and I reserved our opinion,  and the matter was adjourned to enable- us to consult the Prime Minister and the Cabinet,    I think we all felt that there was a good deal to be  said, in principle in favour of Mr Mackenzie King&apos;s proposal.    Evidently, however,  the matter requires very careful consideration The cost of maintaining a High Commissioner and his office in a single Dominion would perhaps not be large, but by the time it was multiplied by six it might become considerable.    The effect on the Governors-General also requires careful consideration.    It is true that the change in function would perhaps be more apparent than real, but we ought to consider carefully whether even this would add to our diffi-culties in obtaining representatives of the highest status and authority in order worthily to maintain the position of the King&apos;s representative in a Dominion.    I understand that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs is communicating personally with
the Governors-General on this subject, but I presume it would be regarded as essential that any such change would have to be accompanied by some definite under-standing as to the Governor-General being kept fully informed on Cabinet business and public affairs gener-ally, as His Majesty the King is here.I am by no means sure myself that at first,  at any rate, it would be necessary to establish identical means of communication between the British Government and each Dominion,    There may be room j;&quot;or more than one method of communication, according to the circum-stances, which differ in degree in each case.    I ought to mention, however,  that some of my colleagues  on the Committee took the view that if a change were made in the case of one Dominion all the others would have to come into line.Several of the speakers suggested that, whatever progress it might be possible to make in the direction of greater facilities for personal communication, they should not supersede the present system of direct communication, but that the latter should continue, whether conducted through the medium of the Governor-General or otherwise.(intd.)
