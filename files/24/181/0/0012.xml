[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1926.EARLY in 1924 a Convention was signed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government dealing with questions arising out of the liquor smuggling traffic. Briefly, it (1) specifically upholds the principle of the 3-mile limit; (2) allows the United States preventive authorities to board vessels flying the British flag up to a distance from the shore which they (or, if they turn out to be liquor traders, the vessel in which the liquor is to be conveyed ashore) can cover in one hour, for the purpose of seeing whether  hey are smuggling vessels and, if so, of seizing them and taking them to the United States for adjudication- (3) permits British vessels trading to United States ports to carry liquor into United States territorial waters, provided that it is kept under seal while the vessels are in United States territorial waters.The conditions out of which the conclusion of this Convention arose were as follows : &apos;The prohibition law had been enacted in the United States, and therefore it was profitable to smuggle in liquor. The British flag was used as a cover for the operations of the smugglers. This led (a) to incidents in which British vessels were seized, often apparently in violation of international law; (b) to irritation against this country on the part of United States public opinion. Later, in 1923, the Supreme Court found that it was illegal for foreign vessels t&quot;o carry liquor within the territorial waters of the United States. This would have been most hampering to bond fide British shipping. The United States Government asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to do what they could to prevent the use of the British flag for smuggling operations, and suggested the conclusion of a treaty conferring on each Government the right to search vessels suspected of attempts to violate the law of the respective countries up to a distance of 12 miles from the shore. This proposal was rejected as endangering the principle of the 3-mile limit. Furthermore, it was felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not need the proposed extension of territorial waters for the prevention of breaches of British law.Instructions were meanwhile issued to the British authorities concerned to see that liquor traders did not profit by lax enforcement of existing British law in the matter of ships&apos; clearances, securing of British registration, &amp;c, in order to carry on their activities.The finding of the Supreme Court, above referred to, introduced a new element into the matter, and, as a result, the Liquor Convention was concluded. The policy underlying the Convention was, without endangering the principle of the 3-mile limit, to do what was possible to help the United States Government to enforce their own law and to obtain in return permission for bond fide British vessels to carry liquor into United States territorial waters under seal.The Convention did much to assist the United States Government, especially when they provided themselves with the means to use the rights conferred by it to the full. Yet it gradually became clear that the liquor traders were able in many cases to evade the British Merchant Shipping Act and Customs laws in such a way as greatly to facilitate their activities. This being so the preventive authorities found considerable difficulty in dealing with the &quot; rum-runners,&quot; and made, on several occasions, seizures of vessels which appeared to be contrary to international law and the terms of the Liquor Convention. Though in most cases the vessels so seized were almost certainly rum-runners, yet His Majesty&apos;s Government found themselves under the necessity of questioning in a friendly manner the action of the United States Government. This was an undesirable state of affairs, and as the question of prohibition enforcement became in the United States ever more acute, the possibility of eventual friction between the two Governments had to be considered.3560a   [14889]
2As a result, in March of this year His Majesty&apos;s Government made a voluntary offer of further assistance to the United States Government. But this offer was strictly limited; the assistance was to be given not by any fresh legislation or concessions going beyond the policy of the Liquor Convention, but strictly by means of administrative measures. That is to say, all those provisions of existing British legislation, such as the laws regarding the grant of British registry, customs clearances, &amp;c, which might hamper the movements of the liquor traders would be strictly enforced. Furthermore, in the case of United States patrol vessels operating in the neighbourhood of the Bahamas, which was the chief base for the liquor traders&apos; activities, strict compliance with the Admiralty regulations regarding notice of visits by foreign warships to overseas ports would be waived, e.g., seven days&apos; notice of intended visits would not in every case be necessary.The United States Government were invited to send over officials to London to discuss with the competent British officials the ways and means of giving&apos; practical effect to this offer, since they would learn our difficulties and the limitations within which we must act, also the sort of information we should need from them in order, effectively to carry out our administrative measures; and we should learn from them what were their special difficulties and be able to see in what way we could by administrative measures render the most useful assistance.A party of American officials has just been in London and has held conferences with the British officials. A number of definite suggestions of an administrative nature have resulted from these conferences, and they are now being considered by the two Governments. There has been no question whatever of interfering in any way with legitimate trade; no measures are contemplated which would go beyond the scope of the Liquor Convention or of the offer made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in March; nor have the United States officials asked for any such thing.I circulate a copy of the Joint Report of the discussions between the officials of the two Governments, together with a copy of the White Paper containing the text of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s offer.Foreign Office, July 27, 1926.

Correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government regarding Administra-tive Measures to be taken by British Authorities in order to assist the United States Government in the prevention of Liquor Smuggling from the Sea.[Washington, March 27/April 26, 1926.]No. 1.Aide-memoire handed to Mr. Kellogg by Sir Esme Howard.His Majesty &apos;s Government had already for some months been devoting the most careful consideration to the question of adopting active administrative measures to assist the United States Govern-ment in their efforts to prevent the smuggling of liquor into the United States from the sea, and the suggestions put forward by the United States Government as a result of the conference between His Majesty &apos;s Ambassador and representatives of the United States Department of State, the United States Treasury and the Depart-ment of Justice, which took place on the 2nd December last, later received sympathetic attention.2. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has now been instructed to notify the Secretary of State of the decisions arrived at by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter, which include the adoption of the following administrative measures : -3. In the first place, in order to co-operate with the United States Government in the prevention of liquor smuggling from the Bahamas, His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, on account of the nature of the duties of the United States Coast-Guard and the difficulties in the way of giving notice, through the usual official channels, of the intended visits of revenue patrol vessels to Gun Cay and the adjacent islands, to permit specified United States cutters to enter British territorial waters at Gun Cay and the islands contiguous thereto without strict compliance with the Admiralty regulations governing visits of foreign armed vessels to British overseas ports. The only formality which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment desire to see observed in this connection is that the cutters in question should first call at Bimini to inform the Bahamas Commissioner of their intentions, and that it should be understood that they will thereafter maintain a correct attitude and not use their lights to the danger of navigation. This concession is furthermore made on the condition that it be confined as to area to the Bahamas, and that it be limited in duration to a period of one year, at the end of which time His Majesty&apos;s Government will be(14509)
6prepared to entertain a request for the continuance of the arrangement, should the United States Government then deem this necessary.4. Secondly, as regards administrative measures of more general application, His Majesty&apos;s Government have called upon Registrars of Shipping in the West Indies to take especial care to prevent transfers to the British flag of vessels intended for the smuggling trade, instructing them to make the most searching enquiries before permitting any vessel to be placed on the British register, and to refuse to register a vessel unless they are completely satisfied as to the bona fides of the application. The attention of the Overseas Governments concerned has been drawn to the above-mentioned instructions, and they have been requested to accord to the local Registrars concerned the fullest measure of support which the law allows in the event of the latter&apos;s action being-challenged in any individual case.5. As an instance of the helpful and correct attitude of the Colonial Governments concerned, which it is felt will be as welcome to the United States Government as it is to His Majesty&apos;s Government, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to bring to the notice of the Secretary of State two cases of recent occurrence in the Bahamas where the British-registered owners of rum-schooners seized by the United States preventive authorities refused to provide bail for the crews on the ground that they had previously sold their vessels to United States citizens. When requested by the Bahamian authorities to explain why they had failed to record the ^sale of their vessels, the owners in question pleaded ignorance of the law, notwithstanding which fact, and although both men are prominent Nassau merchants, the Governor of the Colony has ordered legal proceedings to be instituted against them for an infraction of the Merchant Shipping Act.6. The recent ease of the &quot;General Serret&quot; provides another instance of the methods employed by the administrative officers of His Majesty&apos;s Government to hamper vessels engaged in liquor smuggling. Reports having been received that this vessel, whose provisional certificate was due to expire in four days, had loaded a cargo of whisky at Antwerp and was bound for Halifax for orders, the competent authorities of His Majesty&apos;s Government, upon her arrival at Dover, insisted upon compliance with the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Acts before the voyage could be continued. These requirements included dry docking for inspection of draught  a formality normally postponed in the case of vessels with cargo on board; no such postponement was permitted the &apos;&apos; General Serret,&quot; and there being no dry dock at Dover the vessel was brought to London and there detained, her cargo of whisky being landed.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government are also prepared to take administrative action to prosecute masters for infraction of the Customs Act when reasonable grounds of suspicion are available to believe them guilty of making false declarations in regard to their destinations.   In this connection, His Majesty&apos;s Government rely3429 Wt. - 2250 5/26 F.O.P. (14509) li 2
upon the United States Government to co-operate by supplying them, in any individual case, with sufficient incriminating evidence to enable legal proceedings to be instituted with a reasonable prospect of conviction; so, too, His Majesty&apos;s Government are willing to take steps to remove liquor smugglers from the British register upon production by the United States authorities of reasonably good evidence that the vessel concerned is really owned or controlled in America.8. In approaching the Secretary of State on this subject, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to explain that the measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to adopt do not constitute a binding engagement, but represent a spontaneous and voluntary offer of assistance on their part which is subject to withdrawal if not found to work satisfactorily in practice.9. Finally, in the interest of closer co-operation, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to extend an invitation to the United States Government to send a representative or representatives to London for discussion with the competent British authorities, to learn what are the latter&apos;s powers and limitations and to acquaint them with the nature of the information and assistance which the United States authorities are in a position to supply. It is felt that such a visit will materially contribute towards a full understanding and the efficient execution of this offer of co-operation, which it is hoped that the United States Government will accept as proof of the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to render such assistance as it lies within their power to give.British Embassy, Washington, March 27, 1926.No. 2.Mr. Kellogg to Sir Esme Howard.Department of State, Excellency, Washington, April 26, 1926.I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your aide-memoire of the 27th March, 1926, setting forth the administra-tive measures which your Government is prepared to adopt to assist the United States in its effort&apos; to prevent the smuggling of liquor into the United States from the sea. In the last paragraph of this communication you said that in the interest of closer co-operation His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to extend an invitation to the United States to send a representative or representatives to London for a discussion with the competent British authorities to learnf what are the latter&apos;s powers and limitations and to acquaint them; with the nature of the information and assistance which the Uni States authorities are in a position to supply. It is stated that your] Government is of opinion that such a visit would materially] contribute towards a full understanding and efficient execution of &quot;
5offer of co-operation which you request this Government to accept as proof of the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give such assistance as it is possible to give in the circumstances.I desire to express the deep appreciation of this Government for the offer of co-operation contained in the aide-memoire in question. I feel certain that the administrative measures which you set forth will aid greatly in bringing about better enforcement of the laws of the United States prohibiting the importation of intoxicating liquors for beverage use. I have transmitted copies of the aide-memoire to the interested authorities of this Government, and I can assure you that this Government will co-operate fully in assisting your Government in obtaining the necessary evidence on which to prosecute persons who violate British laws on the subjects mentioned. I also accept, on behalf of this Government, the invitation to send representatives to London, and shall at a later date advise you of the names of the persons who will be sent. It would be convenient for the representatives to leave the United States about the 22nd May, which would make it possible to arrive in London on the 28th May. I should be pleased to &quot;be informed whether this would be satisfactory to the British authorities.Accept, &amp;c.FRANK B. KELLOGG.
[This Documenl isJiheJPropj^ 8 printed for the Cabinet.   July 1926.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.   32Joint Report of Discussion between British and American Officials with regard to Liquor Smuggling.AS vessels engaged in liquor smuggling frequently make use of the British flag and proceed from ports and places within British jurisdiction, questions have from time to time arisen between the Government of the United States and His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to this traffic, and it was decided that a meeting should take place in London between officials of the two Governments to go fully into the matter. Meetings took place in London in July 1926, and the following officials took part in the discussion: United States.Brigadier-General L. C. Andrews    ....   Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.Rear-Admiral F. C. Billard.... ....   Commandant of the Coastguard, TreasuryDepartment.Mr. W. R. Vallance .... ....   Assistant  to the   Solicitor, Departmentof State.Mr. Anslinger.Mr. A. W. Henderson        .... ....   Special Assistant to the Attorney-General,Department of Justice.Mr. H. Keith Weeks .... ....   Treasury Department.Great Britain.Foreign Office      .... .... ....   Mr. R. G. Vansittart, C.M.G., M.V.O.Mr. R. I. Campbell.Admiralty .... .... ....   Captain   H.  P.  Douglas,   C.M.G.,   R.N.(Hydrographer of the Navy). Mr. W. H. Hancock.Board of Trade    .... .... ....   Sir Charles Hipwood, K.B.E., OB.Mr. N. A. Guttery. Mr. W. J.

S. Bertenshaw.As the discussion was one between officials, no question of policy or politics could arise, nor was any past practice or incident called in question save with a view to avoiding future difficulties. The first object of those present was to ascertain all the facts so that both sides could understand clearly and fully exactly what was taking place. It was felt that if this were done with goodwill and in a scientific spirit it should be possible to devise means for meeting the difficulties that had been encountered in the respective countries in administering the law. The discussion was, therefore, of a very frank nature, every fact or difficulty in the minds of either side being brought forward and discussed without reserve. 3560 [14888]
The information in the possession of each side supplemented that possessed by the other, and attention was concentrated on the infringements of the law that have been, and are being, committed by the persons engaged in this traffic. In many cases the vessels have been placed on the British register illegally, and in certain cases where they use ports or places within British colonies there appears to be a failure to comply with definite provisions of the law relating to clearances, quarantine and other matters. The object of the officials was to secure that these infractions of the law shall be dealt with and shall cease. There is no question whatever of interfering in any way with legitimate trade, which should have no difficulty in distinguishing itself from the illicit traffic.If the information possessed by both sides is pooled, and a close working liaison is established between the officers engaged in dealing with the traffic, so that each side knows what the other is doing and can render any proper and requisite assistance to the other, and if any additional force that may be necessary to secure the strict observance of the law is supplied, it should be possible to reduce very materially the causes for complaint or misunderstanding.With this object the officials have formulated the following suggestions for the consideration of the Governments, but they consider that these suggestions should not be made public in any case until they have been adopted and have become effective : Suggestions.1. / intelligence^As complete a record as possible of the ships engaged in the illicit traffic of importing liquor into the United States and of the persons engaged in this traffic should be prepared at some convenient centre. To this centre the British and American officials concerned could communicate, either direct or through such channels as might be most convenient, any facts which may become known to them in regard to these ships and persons. It would be convenient if this record were prepared and kept in Washington, and it has been suggested that the Treasury Department would be the most suitable Department.Copies of this record should be transmitted from time to time to all the officers directly or indirectly concerned, including the British Embassy at Washington, so that each officer may have, in as convenient a form as possible, the fullest information in regard to the suspect ships and the suspect persons.2. Liaison.Arrangements have already been made by the United States Government and the Government of. Canada for co-operation as regards the suppression of smuggling operations. It is desirable that a close working liaison should be established between the United States authorities and the proper officers in the Bahamas and any other British colonies which may be concerned. In the case of the Bahamas, the officer concerned would be the Colonial Secretary, and the liaison should be established between this officer and the local American Consul. A similar liaison should be established in any other British colony in which this is necessary; and a liaison should also be established between the American and British Consular representatives at such ports as Hamburg, Antwerp and Havana. In every case the officers concerned should consult one another freely, and inform one another at once of any matter of interest.3.   Special Liaison in London.The United States Consul-General in London should keep in touch with the Registrar-General of Shipping and Seamen and other British Government officers, so that he may obtain on request on the usual terms (a.) Information as to whether a vessel flying the British flag has been given a provisional or permanent British Register.(b.) Information as to whether the name of a vessel flying the Briti&amp;h flag has been changed lawfully.(c.) Information as to the names and addresses of the registered owner or owners and mortgagees of a vessel under the British flag, and, if a company or corporation, the registered office of that company or corporation, as well as any information that can be given as to the shareholders.
(d.) The Mercantile Navy List and monthly supplements, (e.) Certified copies of registers and of all documents relating thereto. (/.) Any information that can be given, by reference to Lloyd&apos;s publications ox-otherwise, as to the movements of suspect vessels or cargoes.4.   Prosecutions.Wherever there appears to be sufficient evidence to justify prosecution, either by the British authorities for infringement of the British law, or by the United States authorities for an infringement of the United States law, proceedings should be instituted.Arrangements should be made under which the United States authorities furnish to the British authorities any evidence they may have tending to show that any British vessel concerned in the traffic has infringed the British law in regard to registration, Customs clearances, quarantine, &amp;c, or any evidence tending to show that any person engaged on any such ship is using a forged or false certificate of competency, &amp;c. Similarly, the British and American officials concerned should be instructed, upon request, to arrange for the attendance of witnesses and the production of such records, or certified copies thereof, as may be considered necessary in cases of prosecution, on the understanding that the cost of any transcripts of such records, &amp;c, and the expense involved in the attendance of witnesses to be paid by the Government responsible for the prose-cution. In this connection, an attempt should at once be made to secure, if possible, the necessary evidence to enable proceedings to be instituted in the case of vessels known to be engaged in the traffic.5.   British Patrol Vessel.The Colonial Secretary of the Bahamas stated that the provision of a suitable vessel would be of very material assistance in securing the strict observance of all the local laws relating to customs, clearances, quarantine, &amp;c. The provision of such a vessel should be considered.i6.   United States Patrol Vessels.With a view to enabling the United States authorities to secure, evidence of the presence in the Bahamas of suspect United States vessels, it has already been agreed that, while, so far as may be&apos; possible, a report will be made to the Government of the Bahamas whenever the United States Coastguard desire to send a patrol vessel to the Bahamas, such a vessel may, for a period of twelve months, enter British territorial waters in the Bahamas without the usual advance notice of visit, on the understanding that the vessel in question will first call at Bimini and report to the Commissioner at that port. It was represented that if the United States patrol vessel were to be required to call first at Bimini on the occasion of each visit, the object of the visit would be defeated. It is therefore proposed that each vessel should, on. the occasion of its first visit, call on and report to the local Commissioner, and that on each subsequent visit it will be sufficient if information of the intention to pay the visit should be telegraphed beforehand by the United States authorities to the American Consul at Nassau, who would immediately notify the Colonial Secretary. It is understood that the United States Coastguard patrol vessels will limit their activities whilst in British territorial waters to observation and that these activities will not be extended to the waters of New Providence, where satisfactory facilities for observation already exist.7.   Entry from the High Seas.In the case of United Kingdom ports, all vessels other than coasting vessels and fishing boats are required on arrival to make a statement as to the port or place from which they have arrived, and this requirement would not be fulfilled by an indefinite statement that they came &quot; from the High Seas.&quot;It is understood that the local law of the Bahamas permits of the entry of vessels as &quot; from the High Seas,&quot; but that the master of a vessel so entering sufficiently often as to cause suspicion and with such regularity as to show system might be prosecuted under the law relating to false declarations. The Governor of the Bahamas should be requested to ensure that a, prosecution should be instituted in any case where the evidence appeared to justify this course.
8.   Diplomatic Support.When any complaint in connection with liquor smuggling, or suspected liquor smuggling, operations is made to one side against the officers of the other, the present practice might be continued of examining the record of the complainant and any other information that may be available before deciding whether under the terms of the existing Liquor Convention or on other grounds the case is one in which enquiry or eventual representations should be made.
