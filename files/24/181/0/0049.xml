[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926.&quot;................................... .&apos;iTjtaq^pa .......CRET. &apos;:5 Copy No.REPORT.To the Cabinet,1. On the 23rd December, 1920, the Wireless Telegraphy Commission was summoned under the following letter of appoint-ment :-The Cabinet have decided to appoint a Wireless Telegraphy-Commission as follows : The Right Hon.  Viscount  Milner,  G.C.B., G.C.M.G.(Chairman),W. H. Eccles, Esq., D.Sc, F.R.S. (Vice-Chairman),L. B. Turner, Esq., M.A., M.I.E.E.,E. H. Shaughnessy, Esq., O.B.E., M.I.E.E.,Lieutenant-Colonel C. G. Crawley, R.M.A., M.I.E.E.(Secretary),with the following terms of reference : (i.) To decide upon the wireless plant most suitable for carrying out the scheme of Imperial wireless communi-cations recommended by the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, bearing in mind the necessity for the co-ordination of the Chain with existing telegraph services, and to design the necessary stations, (ii.) To make recommendations regarding the actual sites for the stations proposed by the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, (hi.) To advise generally upon the preparation of specifications for machinery and apparatus, the making of contracts and the construction of the stations.2. A first report was submitted to the Cabinet on the 5th December, 1921, and was printed as Command Paper No. 1572. It contained plans for the erection in England of a wireless station having eight masts 820 feet high on a site 1 mile long by -J mile wide, and equipped with power plant of 600 kilowatts capacity with a reserve of 300 kilowatts. The report also contained general specifications for stations of about half that size suitable for erection at other points of the Empire as recommended by the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, 1920.3. During the year 1922 the Commission was consulted by the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India, and collected information about the radio-telegraphic features of various Empire sites. Meanwhile, as the proposed stations were the first of their kind and size, practical trials of designs were inaugurated by the Commissioners and carried out in collaboration with the Admiralty and the Post Office engineers. Many large-scale tests were undertaken in the wireless stations already operated by the Post Office. The Commissioners also made a detailed study of newly-constructed large wireless stations in America, France, Italy, Holland and Germany.4. In February 1923 the Cabinet decided to proceed with the construction of a powerful station.in England pending the result ,of the discussions regarding the proposed stations in the Dominions and India, and Mr. Amery, in his capacity as Chairman of the Imperial Communications Committee, requested the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry to send each a representative to the Commission to advise on the needs of the Services as regards the range and situation of the English station and to help in deciding the power and type of the station. The Commission with the Service representatives concluded unanimously that the station[15124] b
shouldtwelve or sixteen steel masts each 800 feet high, and that tiie prime movers should have a capacity of 1,000 kilowatts for delivering 500 kilowatts to the antenna. A site near Rugby was agreed to be the best of those available. It was decided that &apos;the wavelength should not be greater than 20,000 metres. The use of water-cooled thermionic valves was approved.5. In accordance with the recommendation of the Imperial Communications Committee, the original Commissioners were to be held solely responsible for all plans and calculations and for all advisory work during the construction of the Rugby station. They therefore determined the general design of the station, and at their instruction all detailed plans and specifications were prepared by the Wireless Section of the Post Office Engineering Department to meet their requirements. This involved the preparation of 559 drawings and 109 specifications. These drawings and specifications were examined and approved by the Commission and the principal tenders obtained were scrutinised before contracts were placed. The buildings were erected by the Office of Works and the whole of the plant was installed by the Wireless Section of the Post Office Engineering Department in close co-operation with the Commission.6. In April 1924 the Vice-Chairman represented the Commission at the meetings of the Cabinet Committee appointed to expedite the arrangements for wireless communication with the Dominions. The result of these meetings was that an indenture was made on the 28th July, 1924, between the Postmaster-General and Marconi&apos;s Wireless Telegraph Company for the construction of wireless beam stations for sending and receiving telegrams between England and Canada, with possible extensions giving similar duplex communication with Australia, South Africa and India. The stations are guaranteed to give daily average communication of 18 hours with Canada, 12 hours with India, 11 hours with South Africa and 7 hours with Australia. In each of these countries the work on corresponding stations is well advanced.7. The site for the Rugby station is about 900 acres in extent and is situated at Hillmorton, about 4 miles south-east of Rugby. The land is approximately 340 feet above sea level, and the maximum variation in level on the site is 30 feet. The site was chosen to accommodate sixteen masts each 820 feet high placed J mile apart. For reasons of economy it was decided to erect only twelve masts in the first instance. Each mast contains about 200 tons of steel and is designed to withstand a high wind pressure with an adequate factor of safety and also to support an aerial which exerts a horizontal pull of 10 tons at the top of the mast.8. The aerial is constructed in two sections consisting of one large octagonal cage aerial 2 miles long supported on eight masts and another shorter cage aerial 1  miles long supported on six masts, two of the masts being used in common by both sections of the aerial. In all, about 27 miles of copper cable are used in forming the aerial. The arrangement is such that the two sections can be connected together inside the station buildings to form one large aerial for extreme power, or can be used separately for two transmissions on high power. The earth system consists of an open network containing about 120 miles of copper wire buried a few inches in the ground and occupying a space about 1,600 feet wide under the whole length of the aerial.9. The station buildings are situated at about the centre of the site and comprise a machinery hall 185 feet long by 47 feet wide by 32 feet high for housing the power plant, and a three-storey building 103 feet long by 42 feet wide by 60 feet high for housing the wireless plant. The power is obtained from a public supply Company, and the power plant installed at the wireless station is capable of converting about 1,800 kilowatts into power suitable for use in the wireless plant. The power is taken by cables from the machinery hall to the wireless building. The high-frequency generator is of the water-cooled valve type. It consists of two exciting units in duplicate and a main power amplifier. The latter consists of five similar power valve panels, each panel   containing   eighteen   valves   and   capable   of   giving   a
high-frequency output of 180 kilowatts at a frequency of 16,000 cycles per second. By using three panels a total output capacity of about 500 kilowatts is available for use on the whole aerial, leaving two panels in reserve. Alternatively, the two sections of the aerial, each working with two power panels, can deal with about 300 kilowatts and 200 kilowatts respectively, leaving one power panel in reserve. Two primary oscillating circuits are provided, one to deal with full power and the full aerial, and the other to deal with smaller power and the smaller section of the aerial. Up to the present the smaller section of the aerial has been reserved for use with an experimental telephony transmitter, and good and reliable two-day conversation across the Atlantic to New York has been obtained repeatedly for many hours of the day.10. The telegraphy installation has, up to the present date, only been worked on the eight-mast aerial and with about two-thirds power. Even so, the signals have been heard all over the globe. A summary of the reports on the signals received at different distant places is appended. Further experience during bad atmospheric periods will determine to what extent, if any, it will be necessary to extend the aerial by the erection of additional masts.11. With a view to the most economical and efficient utilisation of the whole of the plant at the station the lay-out was designed to provide for simultaneous use of two transmitters during the most favourable atmospheric periods. Experiments will shortly be made on the main telegraph transmitter and the transatlantic telephony transmitter to determine whether simultaneous operation is feasible.12. In addition to the main telegraph transmitter and the transatlantic telephony transmitter, further installations are in contemplation, namely, a short-wave plant and a medium-wave plant, utilising the existing masts for supporting ,the additional aerials. The development of this multi-way working of the Rugby station can be confidently left in the hands of the Post Office Wireless Engineers.13. The Commission desires to place on record its cordial thanks for the helpful co-operation unsparingly given by the Admiralty, the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Post Office and the Radio Research Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. All these Departments have placed at the disposal of the Commission their technical records, their accumulated experience and material facilities for undertaking practical trials of methods and apparatus.The Commission wishes also to express its deep appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Lieutenant-Colonel Crawley, who has acted as Secretary to the Commission from the beginning of its work.W.
