[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1926.CONFIDENTIAL.[C 8751/7660/18]Viscount D&apos;Abernon to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received August 6.) (No. 529.)HIS Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin presents his compliments to His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to report that it was stated in the &quot;Volkswacht&quot; of the 29th July that the Berlin Police President had forbidden the public collections for the English miners which had been planned to take place from the 30th July to the 1st August. The following letter in this connection was addressed, on the 28th July, by the Police President to the Communist party : &quot; It has come to my notice that the district organisation intends making collections in factories, houses, businesses, railway stations and the suburbs particularly visited by trippers on Friday, the 30th July, Saturday, the 31st July and Sunday, the 1st August, and that the proceeds of these collections are intended for the English miners at present on strike. Such collections are subject to permission.&quot; I would point out that the intended collections are inadmissible and punishable, since no permission has been given, and I have given instructions to stop any such attempts to collect, to confiscate the proceedings of the collection and to institute proceedings against the collectors.&quot;Berlin, August 3, 1.926.3581 [14955]
