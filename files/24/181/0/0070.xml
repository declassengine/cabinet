DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).I circulate herewith a memorandum on the Reports presented &quot;by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Agricultural Unemployment Insurance (recently published as a Stationery Office publication).     Briefly, the position is as follows: -(1)     The Committee was practically evenly divided in its conclusions,  six members recommending that unemployment insurance be applied, to agriculture in England and Wales  (but not to Scotland) by means of a special scheme (requiring new legislation) and the other five reporting that no necessity exists or is likely to exist for unemployment insurance in agriculture. (2)     The case for insurance submitted by the majority is extremely weak;    no statistics are available as to the existence of unemployment in agriculture and the estimates of the majority are merely conjecture. Such information&apos;as is available points to the fact that practically no unemployment exists amongst regular farm hands;    seasonal workers cannot of course be regarded as shelly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. (3)     The .majority&apos;s suggestion for a special scheme would make the State responsible for half the contributions (3d, per week from the State and 1-jjd. each for employer and worker) as against less than one-third in the case of the general scheme (6d. from the State and 8d. and 7d. from employer and worker respectively).0 RET.570 (26)CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS,.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.
(4)    The Council of Agriculture for England, considered the Committee&apos;s Reports and decided (by a majority) that no case had been made out for the application of any scheme of unemployment insurance to agriculture.(5)    The employers in agriculture are wholly opposed to insuranoe and, although the leaders of the workers&apos; organisations are insistent, there is no evidence that the workers themselves attach any great Importance to the matter.      In fact many of the regular hands would probably resent being called upon to pay contributions, however small, from which they would not expect to derive any personal benefit.For these reasons I should like to have the authority&apos; of the Cabinet to make an announcement that the Government consider that no case has been made out for the application of unemployment insurance to agriculture at the present time.W.

UNEMPLOYMENT  INSURANCE FOE AGKIGULTURAL WORKERS. Memorandum by Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Arising partly out of agitation by the leaders of theunions catering for agricultural workers and finally at theInstigation of the Council of Agriculture for Hhgland, an Inter-Departmental Committee was set up jointly by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotlandla Lay, 1925.:.-&quot;to consider and report whether it Is desirable that &quot;workers in agriculture should be compulsorily insured against &quot;the risk of unemployment, and if so, on what terms and &quot;conditions and in what manner the insurance of agricultural &quot;workers can be most effectively provided either by the &quot;inclusion of agriculture within the scope of existing &quot;legislation or by means of new legislation.&quot;No demand had arisen for examination of the matter as regards Scotland but it was considered advisable to include that country in the enquiry and three of the eleven members constituting the Committee were nominated by the Secretary of State for Scotland.The Committee have presented two reports signed by six and five members respectively.    The members Signing the Majority Report were Sir Henry Rew (Chairman), Mrs, Deane Streatfield (an Impartial Member of an Agricultural Wages Committee), Mr. Lenton Hoodhead (Secretary of the Yorkshire Union of Rural Friendly Societies), Mr. Beard (Workers&apos; Union), Mr. Walker (National Union of Agricultural Workers), and Mr. Denholia (Scottish Farm Servants7 Union), and those signing the Minority Report, Sir Thomas Davies, M.P., Mr. Falconer (President of the Scottish Rural Workers1 Friendly Society), Mr. Black and Mr. Eyland (National Farmers&apos; Union) and Mr, Gardner (Scottish Farmers 1 Union).The majority consider that unemployment insurance should now be applied to agricultural workers in England and voiles, but by means of a separate scheme (involving special legislation) providing for lower rates of contribution. &apos;  They suggest that, on the assumption that a total contribution of &apos;6d, per week per insurable^perscn would be adequate, 3d. should be provided by the
State and lfd. by employers, and workers respectively.     It is-, recommended, however, that unemployment insurance should-not. Jjo-applied, to Scotland as the risk of unemployment-appears to be less in that country than in England and Wales and there Is a concensus of opinion between the organisations of agricultural employers and workers in Scotland against any form of insurance being applied to that country.     The minority members of the Committee take the view that no necessity exists or is likely to exist for unemployment insurance in agriculture in any part of Great Britain.The majority give as their principal reasons for the extension of the principle of unemployment insurance to agri-culture in England and Wales(i) That although the incidence of unemployment in agriculture may be low, the risk cannot be ignored; that It exists even under the present unusually favourable conditions and that It may at any time reach more serious dimensions.(ii) That there Is no just cause for excluding agricultural workers from the economic security provided for wage-earners generally.     (The majority report adds that the low wages paid in agriculture afford the worker little opportunity for providing against the contingency of unemployment and that it is Impossible to disregard the evidence the Committee have received that the lack of any such provision is a deterrent to workers seeking agricultural employment.)The minority on the other hand take the view that the immunity from the risk of unemployment which workers in agriculture enjoyed in 1D20P when cmParliaraent excepted the industry from the general provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act, continues in no lessened degree and they believe that the existing shortage of labour will be accentuated in future .Some of the principal points which emerge from the reports are: -
(1)   Views of the Industry.     The Committee of the Agricultural Wages Board which considered the question in 1921 reported that there ms general opposition both by employers and workers to the inclusion of agriculture under the general provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act; that there was no evidence as to whether a special scheme would be acceptable to either employers or workers and that in any case the information as to the incidence of unemployment was insufficient to enable such a scheme to be prepared.It seams clear from the present Reports that farmers generally are still strongly opposed to inclusion in the general insurance scheme.     Although no evidence was taken as to whether farmers individually would seriously object to a scheme with the comparatively low rates of contribution suggested in the majority report it is not to be expected that they would view it with other than hostility.It seems equally clear that the workers&apos; representatives have abandoned any idea of demanding the inclusion of agriculture in the general scheme of insurance and that they are now urging their followers to support a special scheme.     It can hardly be claimed that there is evidence of any intense desire amongst the workers generally for any scheme whatever, although it may be true to say that a number of thara would now welcome a special scheme with the low rates of contribution suggested by the Committee.The only spokesmen of workers who were examined by the Committee were nominated by the Trade Unions and they possibly stated the case more on political grounds than as a reflection of the actual views of agricultural workers.It will also be remembered in estimating the weight to.be attached to the views of the agricultural organisations that where-as the National Partners&apos; Union does probably voice the views of farmers generally, the Workers1 Unions by reason of their comparatively small membership have no very strong claim to be
taken as really representative of the feelings of individual workers *(2)   BxJLst en.ce jof ^Ifi6mploy;neut.     As regards the majority of the Committee !s view as to the exist6iioe of unemployment at the present tine, the figures of 0.5 per cent, and 3 per cent, which they put forward as representing the measure of unemployment amongst regular and casual workers respectively have no statistical basl3 and it ?;ould be fallacious to found any argument on thenu     The position seems to be that whatever the theoretical liability of the regular farm-hand to suffer periods of unemployment, the supply of experienced hands has not been equal to the demand for some time past,The position In regard to casual workers is still left obscure.     The difficulty is to ascertain to what extent the temporary or seasonal workers employed by farmers are wholly dependent upon their agricultural earnings for their maintenance during the period of the year when no farm employment Is available for them,     Numbers of thes6 workers probably secure other employ-ment during the slack farming season but there must be many who have no such opportunity.    Many agricultural operations are only economically possible by the existence of a supply of casual workers available at the farmer&apos;s call, but the problem is how far the industry can fairly be held responsible for their maintenance when not employed on the farms.     To ascertain the position of the casual worker at all accurately would have involved a series of local investigations somewhat beyond the Committee1 s scope,(3)   Absence of Insurance as a deterrent to worker entering agriculture .     This point to which the Majority Report calls attention is a somewhat new feature of discussions on the subject. The absence of Insurance would seem to be a very small consideration to the potential recruit compared with the serious factors of the smell wage and the lack of prospects in the Industry/ but it probably carries a certain amount of weight particularly amongst&apos;
ex land-workers new living on unemployment benefit in the towns.The exclusion of agriculture from unemployment benefit has been a great advantage to the industry as a whole, which has thereby been saved from the demoralising side of the operation of the &quot;dole.&quot;     It would have been particularly serious in agri-culture where the unemployment benefit&apos;&apos; would so closely approst-mate to the normal wage.    The extension of unemployment benefit to agriculture, would be detrimental to the workers, as it would deprive them of continuous employment in slack seasons and when old age approaches.     Up to the present, farmers have in the main felt an obligation to keep on their men even when there was not enough work for them.     If the men could go on the dole far-mars would not be human if they.did not take advantage of it and tr&amp;as-fer to the unemployment fund a liability which hitherto they have shouldered themselves ,It is true that the suggested payment by the employer of l-jtd. per week per worker cannot be regarded as a serious burden. But the psychological effect on the farmer would be very great. He is constantly complaining, often with reason, that financial burdens are imposed on him by legislation passed, not for the benefit of agriculture, but in the interests of the urban community, and it is partly on this ground that agriculturists have in the past asked for State help.     To impose a scheme of unemployment&apos; insurance on the industry in its present condition would inevitably renew the demand for State help for the industry and would undo much of the effort which, has been made during the last few years to persuade agriculturists that they must solve their own problems without looking to the Government for subsidies or artificial aids of that kind.inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 29th October, 1926.
