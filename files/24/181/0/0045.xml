IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS G0V3RKMEMT.M COPY HO .80p. 145 (26). cabinet trade    OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the President of the Board of   Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the last monthly review of trade prospects which I have received from my Advisory Council.Although there has been a decrease in the unemployment figures, there appears to be the risk of a serious closing down in industry, unless coal is available at a reasonable price.     There is some interesting evidence of the turnover of industrial plant from coal to   oil, which is a further example of the folly of the strike.Manufacturers are beginning to be anxious about their financial position when the strike ends. Many firms,particularly in the he.-.vy trades,, will need large advances to pay wages and other costs for some weeks, pending a return on contracts put in hand when the strike ends.The position of the woollen and worsted trade in women1s dress fabrics is bad.       The specific evidence given at the Council bears out the general reports which I have had of greatly increased competition from Prance, and latterly from Germany also.     The deterioration in the trade will not be shown in import figures for some time to come,  as contracts are placed several months ahead; but there seems no doubt that the trade is securing far fewer orders than it was receiving when the Safeguarding Inquiry was held and the Committee made its report.
Board of Trade,It is interesting to note the extraordinary position in China, where, in spite of wars and boycotts, trade is steadily increasing.      It is plain that an enormous trade could be done with China,  if it ever becomes peaceful.(Intld.)     P. C-L.12th October, 1926.

C ONF ID HNT IA L . mOH AND&apos; STxSiSL.&apos;MR.BORMAN stated that in the heavy iron and steel there was practically no production,     A few mills were running for odd weeks on foreign coal.The wire trade was a little better,- especially in the Australian market,     We were getting the benefit of the increase in the tariffs which are placed on foreign steel products.The   galvanised sheet trade was fairly satisfactory. Prices were firmer, but it was entirely run on foreign sheet bars, which had gone up considerably in price.       They 7/ere now about  5,10,0 f,o,b Continental port.     They were fairly easy to get, but it was not very eesy to get enough to keep going all the time.Constructional engineering was quiet.     There again there was a great shortage of the van materials, which were joists and plates, ohiefly joists, and great difficulty in getting steel joists from the Continent, where they were quoting for eight to ten weeks delivery ahead.Generally, the stocks of the iron and steel makers were down to nothing, and on resumption of operations it was felt that for a time the industry nould be somewhat firmer in regard to prices;  but there again they had to be careful to consider the position of the customer.     They were very anxious about the financial position, because hn re-starting there would clearly be from six to eight weeks of outgoings and practically nothing coining in.As to the niuropean steel cartels, the firms concerned were all working together regarding steel rails,     The British makers were considering very carefully what action they ought to take,  if any, regarding the main cartel for all products of steel.      It was not quite right to say that they had had an invitation to join.      On the other hand, they knew that the Germans especially, and the French also, were anxious for them to join,&apos;        Most likely they would go quietly and not get involved deeply in any arrangement just at the present time.Mr. Dorraaihad visited America this summer, and spent a month going round American iron, and steel works. Greatprosperity was apparent, but the rolling mills did not impress him as being much superior to the bast mills in this country. They were laid out for big outputs, but quite clearly there would be no use in putting mills down in this country which would roll 2,000 tons of rails in 12 hours, such as he saw in the United States; there would be no market for the products. He did not think that the steel furnaces and rolling mills were much better than one could see in quite a number of cases in this country.He wanted valso to observe that makers were having great trouble in getting enough-coke te keep the coke ovens in such a condition as to enable them to start at full operation straight away, and that&quot; was &quot;a poini; which was of the greatest
CONFIDENTIAL. IRON AMD STE*lL (CONTD).importance. If coke ovens wars allowed to get cold it might take many weeks before any iron could be made at all.     They had good orders booked for steel.      If they could get the finance - and they thought they could, - they would be able to jump up straight away into considerable output, greater than they had had for several years, for a period of three to six months at any rate.     But on the other hand if they could get no iron owing to the coke ovens failing them, it was difficult to see how they were going to operate.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said it had been found that since last the Council met at the beginning of August, and since he eent in a written report at the end of that month, the general trade in steel had been falling off very considerably.     The turnovers for September were much lower, and unless some improve-ment occurred soon there would be a heavy falling off in October and November also.     Those were two of the biggest months last year, but this ye?-.r they were likely to show a very bad effect on the profits of the industry.      Orders \ ere not coming in at the same rate as before.     The Sheffield rolling mills depended very largely on an immense quantity of steel billets being rolled;    but they could not now get them.   The German billets they had got were not of as good quality, nor were the American billets of as good quality,  a3 they were accustomed to make in Sheffield; and that had interfered very much with the rolling trade and the forging trade.As regards coal, they had not had any trouble; they got plenty of outcrop and foreign coal, but at a price of about 60/- to 66/- a ton, according to the quality; and the quality   -&apos;&apos; of some of it was quite fair.      Coke was a great difficulty; but they had found some Westphalian coke which was pretty hard arid with which they could manage.      Curiously enough they were turning out a considerable  amount of crucible steel, chiefly perhaps because cheaper steels were not obtainable.Japanese business was very slow indeed.     That country seemed to be   trying to restrict its imports in every way possible.      On the other hand, the yen had gone nearer to par, and that was helping trade a little.     China was quite good; Sheffield traders were having a little difficulty in getting their money, but they were doing a fair- trade.      Canada had gone down very heavily during the last 8 weeks.     The elections had perhaps something to do with it. The australian and New Zealand trade was quite good;      India was only.fair; South America was decidedly good, and Sheffield was still able to compete there quite easily with the Germans.     The falling off was now mainly found in the home trade.,     There was a tremendous under-consumption in all classes of tools, drills, saws and hack-saws.European trade was only very moderate.     The French trade had stopped altogether;    the Spanish was affected by the decrees/    The pressure which the British Government had brought to bear in Spain must be kept up; it had had some effect already; there had been some modifying decrees, and that decree which
CONFIDENTIAL. STEEL (contd.).allowed of the appointment of one agent with a stock of certain quantities and sizes of steel might be worked under with a little care, but the situation was somewhat delicate. The United States trade In Sheffield goods wa3 very poor. A few special orders were being executed but the heavy high speed steel trade was impossible. The big American crucible firms were fighting amongst themselves, and were actually selling high speed steel in America to-day at below the price which existed before the pordney Tariff came in.Sir Arthur feared that when the coal strike ended there would be a big rush for steel, with a rise in price. If there was a rise it would be awkward, We could not,  at least,  put up our prices to our customers abroad - that was absolutely certain;    if we did,  the trade would immediately go to the French and Germans.NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD said that on the whole,  there appeared to have been a considerable slowing down during the last two months. There were one or two exceptions, but he thought there was no doubt whatever that this was the case,  taking the industry as a whole.   Difficulties of manufacturers in obtaining supplies of coal had been reported, but the redeeming feature of the situation was that stocks of non-ferrous metals were very light everywhere, so that when the coal strike came to an end and confidence was re-established,  the conditions looked to be favourable for a considerable increase in trade.Tin was in very short supply. Unfortunately, the manufacture of tin plates, etc, was mostly proceeding in foreign countries, particularly in the United States at present; but it had been evident for some long time past that an acute position was going to  arise in tin unless either the consumption could fall off, which did not seem likely, or some unknown new field of production were discovered.    Expansion in the production of tin had been very disappointing. It was produced in very small units; Sir Cecil thought that the largest mine in the world did not produce 6,000 tons of tin in a &quot;year.Oil appeared to be capable of more extensive use in the metal industries than at present. Sir C. Budd had put up an oil plant for tin smelting,  and had brought it into operation during the last fortnight in one furnace. It was too early yet to make a definite comparison as to the relative merits of coal and oil as a fuel in this case, but the figures so far available tended to show that he had cut his costs by three,  taking coal at normal prices,  not at to-day&apos;s prices;    and,  of course,  there were incidental advantages in handling an oil plant,
CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING.SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT said that as to the work on ships under construction, generally the position was about as bad as it oould be;    and three of the leading firms in the last few weeks, having six ships under construction, had suspended work.    This might not be entirely due to the strike-.    With regard to ship repairing work, there was no doubt that the yards were&apos; reaping an advantage now;  they were as full as they could be with repair work.With regard to motor vehicles, of course the imminence of the Motor Show made it unwise to pronounce what the general condition of the trade was until the Show itself revealed it; but motor manufacturers had not been altogether pleased during the last few months with the state of the industry.    There had been a considerable falling off in the demand for commercial vehicles, though not for pa-passenger vehicles.    The latter were being bought as freely as. ever, particularly by the Ilunicipalities.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES. SIR PHILIP NASH wrote: -&quot;I have nothing particular to report affecting the electrical manufacturing interests.    The Home market continues to show the very severe depression into which it has fallen as a result of the strike and the effect of the Electricity Bill which is still before Parliament.    The prolongation of the strike has caused severe difficulty in obtaining special materials on which the electrical industry depends.&quot;The Export market for heavy electrical plant appears to remain unaffected by the prolonged coal strike, i.e. the volume of business coming to this country appears to be at much the same level as at the beginning of the year, and overseas buyers have not refrained from placing orders on the grounds of uncertain deliveries&quot;.COTTON.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE    said -&quot;I am very sorry to have to report that since we last met the death has occurred of one of the most respected members of our Council, our old friend Mr. Judson.    He has done a great work for the cotton industry and I know that especially those who come from Lancashire appreciate how long and faithful his service has been.      I am sure you will wish that there should go from the Advisory council of the Board of Trade to his relatives a letter of sincere sympathy at the loss which they and the industry, and the country have sustained&quot;.The Council concurred - and a letter has since been sent on their behalf.
CONFIDENTIAL. COTTON (contd..).SIR W.  CLARE LEES thought that the coal position had hardened very much against British traders - at least in LancaslhLre.    There was a marked deterioration in the quality -so marked that some cargoes had had to be rejected on inspection as being almost unburnable,  and this was so general that there almost appeared to be an organised effort to give the worst coal to this country and the best to those countries whioh would be our competitors when the strike was settled. There had also been a greatly increased difficulty in actually buying the coal.As to foreign markets, China had bought more cotton goods during the last seven months than in the same time in the previous year.    That was true of British productions and was more true of Japanese products; but it was satisfactory also that the clearances from her stocks had been much greater. The Java trade had been less; India had been doing well and orders were running out there.    They were ready to buy,  and would buy better because cotton was coming down in price. The position in Egypt was similar to that in China.    About twice as much was passing out into the country from the Customs depots in Alexandria as wa3 going into them at the present time,  and although stocks were still a little larger than they had been twelve months ago,  they were diminishing, and there were distinct signs that Egypt was getting ready too, for a larger consumption of cotton goods.    The   broad position was that in yarn ten countries had taken less and eighteen countries had taken more; the net result was that they had taken lOf0 less altogether.    In cloth the position was the reverse - only eleven countries had taken more and forty-two countries had taken less.      But the net result there was that the total was about 10^ down.    The extra imports into India were overdue and were more than cancelled out by the general diminution in most of the markets of the world.    Sir William preferred, indeed,  to soe a general deoline because he thought it was due to a lack of confidence in the cotton market which had been fujly justified by facts,  and he did not believe that the whole of the world would refrain indefinitely from using cotton goods.There was one further point in connexion with Japanese-competition.    Only the previous day Sir W. Clare Lees had had some samples sent to him from a party of eighty Chinese who had gone from Shanghai to Japan a few months ago.    They went on a journey of inquiry and brought back from Japan a great roynypatterns,  of whioh he had a collection,  and it had been disturbing him a good deal.    The quality of the cloth was better and lighter In texture than anything he had seen before, and the finishes upon it were quite good.    He did not know the prices,  so that a comparison of values could not be made.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN stated that in the American section of the ootton spinning trade conditions were very bad,   and, indeed,  critical.    It was fearod that many mills were finding it very difficult to weather the storm.    In the Egyptian section also the mills were running short time, with some employees stopped,owing to the shortage of coal. There was still some profit &quot;on Egyptian spinning, but not very much.    The weaving industry was completely demoralised.
WOOL.MR. ANDREWS wrote:-&quot;In order to understand tho present position in the, Wool Trade it is necessary to go back something like 12 months. At that time the enquiry into tho application of tho Dress Goods Manufacturers for the application of a Safeguarding of Industry duty was taking place.    There was a considerable difference of opinion as to whether this application would go through, but in the meantime it created a doubt amongst importers of foreign manufactured goods and prevented them from placing orders abroad.      Their orders were consequently placed in Bradford and led to a considerable increa.se in the amount of machinery employed, and generally gave a stimulusCOTTON (OOHTD.).A large number of small weaving mills wore entirely stopped. It was much more difficult for those mills to buy coal than for the spinning mills,  because they did not use it in such large quantities, and it was difficult to buy small lots of coaia    The large spinning mills could arra-nge for largo shipments, and were not in the sa,me difficulty.In addition to the coal troubles there had been an enormous slump in the price of American cotton.    It had fallen over twopence a pound in the last few weeks, and until some stability was established in tho price of cotton, we could not hope for much improvement.    It was to be feared that the severe drop in the price of American cotton would cause a great deal of trouble with regard to Empire grown cotton.    Many parts of the Empire which had established cotton growing successfully could not now produce it within pence a pound of the American price.    It seemed as if tho British cotton growing Associations would have to find a good deal of money to encourage the natives to grow it If we were to hold the position we had now&quot;got to.    Colonel Seddon Brown was personally of the opinion that the end of the coal stoppage would probably synchronise with the time when we ought to be knowing something about the price ruling in cotton.    Cotton would then come down to the cheapest price, and there would be improvement.    He   ,thought therefore that there were some better prospects for the cotton trade, but at present It was so depressed that one hardly knew what to anticipate.As regards a restriction on the output of cotton in Texas, so much cotton was raised throughout Southern America by small holders that, whatever the industry might try to do, they could not restrict it to any great extent.    Probably more than half the crop was raised on small farms by a coloured man and his family with one mule and plough.    He had no tools, finance or education for planting wheat or rice or anything else, He will only plant cotton, and any propaganda there may be would only affect the large farmer.
** 3 0WOOL    (CONTD.)to trade.   This improvement continued until the introduction of the Budget, when it became known that the application had failed, and that distributing houses were perfectly  safe in continuing to make purchases of foreign goods.    At that time very large orders for dress goods were placed abroad which would have been placed, here had a Safeguarding of Industries duty been imposed.    Since April the position here has gradually become worae   and worse.    The importations of cloth from France have not been so heavy this year as last, on account of the importations being small in the first three months.   We regret however to say that manufacturers here report that they have now not only strong competition from France, but also very strong competition from Germany in securing orders not only for dress goods but also for cloths which are tabulated under the heading of woollens, and this competition appears to be growing.&quot;The unfavourable position of the Wool Textile Trade has been accentuated by the coal strike.    Producers are now paying 70s.0d. per ton for coal as against less than 20s.Od. before the strike.    This adds very considerably to the cost of-production, and the keen competition to secure orders makes it quite impossible for either the Comber, the Spinner or the Manufacturer to pass on the extra cost.&quot;There is one branch of the Trade that is fairly good, and that is the better class of men&apos;s wear, a considerable portion of which is exported to the Dominions and South America. This portion of the trade Is on the whole fairly satisfactory as it is not nearly so much dependent on the Home Trade.&quot;There is one portion of the trade which has been probably more adversely affected by the coal strike than any other, and that is the Hosiery Trade.    The decreased purchasing power of Home trade consumers during the summer has had a very adverse effect upon the demand for Hosiery produced in Nottingham and Leicester during the summer months, and this trade has had to depend very largely upon exports to keep going at all.   At the moment there is a slight Improvement in the Hosiery trade common at this time of the year on account of distributors stocking up goods for the Winter trade.&quot;One other point might be noted and that is the increasing number of cloths into which Artificial Silk has been introduced, and the increasing popularity of goods of bright colour, for which Artificial Silk is peculiarly adapted for producing when blended with wool&quot; .COLONEL WILLEY wrote:-&quot;Employment in the Wool Textile trade as a whole has improved in the last few weeks.    It is, however,  in the main, in the Raw material   end and the semi-manufactured products -Tops and Yarns.    There has on balance probably been little improvement In the Weaving end.      The Men1s Wear Weaving trade shows improvement but there has been a marked falling off in the Dress Goods Women1s wear end.      It is reported that there is only moderate activity In the Hosiery end,
WOOL (CONTD).which in turn reflects itself in a restricted demand for Hosiery yarns.&quot;Exports in all Departments have been rather larger the last few weeks. This probably reflects the discharge of delayed particulars against old contracts.    There is little disposition to enter into &quot;forward commitments&apos;.    The position indeed in the Dress Goods&apos; Women&apos;s Wear Fabric end is very disquieting.    This is the season of the year when substantial bookings should he taking place to be manufactured in succeeding months for the subsequent season&apos;s business; these are failing to materialise,    The impression exists that the trade has been booked by French Manufacturers. This foreshadows   very much increased imports of Foreign Fabrics with resulting bad employment for Domestic mills. There appears little doubt  that the European depreciated currency Countries are profiting      materially at British Manufacturers&apos; expense.    Production costs abroad have failed to rise substantially towards a Gold basis&quot;.ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON reported that in the artificial silk trade, in spite of the disorganisation by the coal stoppage,  the home market during the past month had been reasonably good. There was still a steady demand in Lancashire, but the conditions in Yorkshire were dull,  especially in the Bradford market.    In Leicester and Nottingham the trade demand was steady both for hosiery and lace..    In overseas markets foreign competition was still very keen,  and very low prices were being taken.   With regard to the Italian spinners In the Indian market,  in particular,  it was a question how long they would he able to sell at prices which were certainly below the cost of production.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY stated that there were no important changes of late in the chemical industry.  It had held its own only by the use of large quantities of foreign coal.    The chemical manufacturers had not so far made any advance in their selling prices to meet their obviously heavily increased cost of production, but recently there were clear indications that this policy would have to be changed,  and in a very few weeks now the manufacturers would either have to close down, or advance those prices,  if they could. One new difficulty which was beginning to affect the chemical trade,  due to the -coal situation,  was that they found it very difficult to get steamers to bring in the necessary raw materials. In some cases it had been impossible for as long as six weeks to get a steamer for this purpose.  If that went on the stocks of these materials would vanish.    Comparing this year with last year,  it was found that our chemical exports were only about 1% less in 1926 than in 1925, whereas chemical imports showed an increase of only 3^. These figures compared favourably with those of other industries.
POTTERY.mr. hollins wrotej-&quot;With regard to the present position of the Pottery Industry, during the last two months, there has been a surprising recovery of employment.    This is due to a larger supply of out-cropped and imported coal, and to some of the early difficulties which the foreign coal presented in firing having been overcome.    The unemployment figures at the end of September were much lower than for the preceding month, but were still considerably in excess of the pre-ooal ^stoppage figures.&quot;Naturally,  just at this time of the year Pottery Manufacturers will make every effort to fulfil orders which are due for the Christmas trade,  but although this is so, it is a very serious position confronting the Pottery Trade, in so far as quite a number of first class houses are very much behind their orders, and there is every possibility that unless orders can be more promptly executed, they will be placed to other foreign competitors.&quot;The future outlook of the trade is very good, and if there is an early settlement of the coal dispute, there is every possibility of a recovery of much of the ground which has been lost.    The shortage of coal has brought about experimental work in the direction of oil fuel for the firing of ovens, and with a very great degree of success; and the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation are.still pursuing investigations in this direction with a view to seeing if it is a scientific succe33, and economically sound on a commercial basis&quot;.rubber.MR. JOHNSTON observed that the rubber manufacturing industry had, up to the present, kept up wonderfully well during the strike period, and had managed to employ the same number of people as before the strike.    In the last few weeks strong competition had developed from abroad, and several of the staple lines appeared to be rather threatened by very cut quotations. In the case of tyres there had been :a very severe cut during the last few days, as would have been noticed, brought about by more or less international conditions, with very heavy stocks held by certain Continental stores.    These reductions were considerably greater than was justified by the fall in costs.    In the rubber shoe and footwear section, very great competition had developed from France and Germany during the last few weeks, and the prices quoted were so low as to leave no profit.    The British manufacturers were meeting that competition and,  therefore, it was unlikely that there would be any serious effect on employment, although the position was not so healthy as it should be.    Continental business was very bad owing to the exchanges, but exports to the Dominions were keeping up very well indeed - in fact they were constantly growing.    Generally speaking, most of the rubber concerns in the country were managing to get supplies of coal and to run more or less normally.
CONFIDENTIAL. FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR STANLEY MACHIN remarked that it was one of the busiest times of the year for the food distributing trade, but there seemed undoubtedly to be a general lassitude and depression in the home market.    At the same time, trade was no doubt being done,  and people were saying &quot;We are doing a trade;    we might be doing worse&quot; .    As an example of the want of confidence that existed reference might be made to what was said by one of the biggest food distributors in Wales, who came to place his season&apos;s order.    He ordered one quarter of his usual amount, and said,  &quot;I may want more;    I do not expect to find this small parcel sufficient, but in the present state of affairs I will not venture on more than a fraction of my usual requirements&quot;. Sir Stanley thought that might be taken as typical of the position in trade generally in this country.    Sir Arthur Balfour had indicated that there might be disturbing results when confidence was restored, because there was no doubt that retailers were carrying very much smaller stocks than they did in normal times, and when the present trouble was settled there-might be a demand which would unsettle markets and prices, and cause trouble in other directions.    In London (contrary to what appeared to be the case in Sheffield) difficulty was being experienced in regard to coal.    The rationing of coke had. added to that difficulty;    foreign coal was not obtainable nearly so easily as it had been, and firms were finding it difficult to keep up their full steam pressure, on account of the shortage of coal.In the overseas markets, there was not much to complain about.    Orders were coming in from Canada and the other Dominions;    in China the trade was better than it was this time last year.    So far as Europe was concerned, however, the trade position was not improving - trade with France, Italy and Belgium had practically ceased to exist.    The tariffs   had made it almost impossible.    It was not that there was no demand for British goods, because an English company which was manu-facturing in France had reported that the demand for these goods had enormously increased and was greater than ever.SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE YUiOLESALB SOCIETY.MR. GALLACHER wrote:-&quot;For the week ending 25th September the sales were  424,441, as compared with  446,641 for the corresponding week of last year, showing a decrease of  22,200,     For the 13 weeks ending 25th September the  sales were  3,751,968 as compared with  4,115,141 for the corresponding quarter of last year.

Our productive works are very quiet, particularly our clothing factories., We cannot hope for any real improvement until the general resumption of work among the miners takes place.&quot;GENERAL___TRADE.MR. GILBERT VYLE, referring to the position of trade In this country since the reports were  sent in to the Board at the end of August,  said that, generally speaking, his impression was that this position had grown a little worse. Aberdeen reported, however, curiously enough,  that their granite Industry was fully employed, probably as the result of 3ome of the large buildings that are being put up now. At Leicester conditions were quiet, and they were hoping there that when the stoppage was over there would be an improvement in trade. They complained of the invasion of the mercerised silk trade from Germany having an adverse effect upon the manufacture of ladies&apos; hosiery.    In Greenock there were sugar- refineries in trouble owing to the coal position, especially owing to difficulties in obtaining foreign coal.    One of them had closed down and the other expected to have to  suspend operations shortly.     The President said he would have further enquiries made into this case; but it would be interesting to know what efforts large concerns like these had made to buy forward foreign coal.Mr. Vyle continued that at Newcastle the shipbuilding and engineering trades were very optimistic, knowing that orders were likely to be placed when the coal strike was over. Wolverhampton had a very dismal report and stated that difficulty was experienced in securing raw materials and fuel. In the Midlands generally the last instruction of the Minister of Mines, to the effect that the priority arrangements were to be stringently applied was causing alarm, because after supplies had been allocated for public utility services and for householders it appeared there would be no coal left for industry.   The consequence was that very large firms there which had been carrying on in spite of the enormous prices to be paid for coal,  were closing down altogether.    The President pointed out that the Midlands was the only area producing coal on a large scale and that therefore coal must be diverted from the Midlands   for essential services and domestic supply.The Middlesbrough timber trade was very optimistic. They went so far  as to say that before the end of the year the demand for timber of all kinds would be greater than had been experienced during the last three years.    In Edinburgh printing and bookbinding were full with employment; and paper manufacturers were also working full time, but the output was not so good  as It ought to be, owing to the inferior quality of the foreign coal which wa3 being used.
GENERAL THADE AND FINANCE.SIR MAX MUSPRATT thought that the position in the last two Or three weeks as regards coal had completely changed, and that it was now a difficult,  and even a critical position. Broadly speaking, the quantity of foreign coal coming in Beemed to have reached its maximum, whereas in spite of the continued warm weather the amount for industry had not increased; in fact, the amount available for industry had been reduced, and the difficulty of taking the fuel at the increased price would bring many works to a point at which they could not go on.     At present they had faced the position and difficulty courageously, but if there was to be no relief in some few weeks&apos; time,  a wholesale stoppage might be anticipated.    This brought up the question of domestic supply. The breakaway of miners was becoming fairly rapid,  and a considerable amount of fuel was being raised which was not available in August.    The output was increasing rapidly, but it would be a long time before this would reach the normal. Sir M. Muspratt thought that pressure should be brought to bear upon the Mines Department to revise their list of priorities.    Everybody seemed to come in before the Industrialists,  and it seemed impossible even for these to get coal unless it was for purposes of food.    Industry had completed six months of oarrying redundant staffs,  etc. rather than close down and create unemployment and possibly other serious troubles, and tho point had been reached when they were at the end of their tether.    At the present time the bulk of the coal being raised was understood to be &quot;through and through&quot;.    The slack of that coal was practically useless to the domestic consumer,  and it was suggested that a certain amount of that slack might be released for industry.The coal stoppage had had one rather awkward effect upon industrial finance.    On the one hand it had made industrial finance much easier.    There had been a considerable reduction in working capital owing to the fact that there was nothing like the same turnover.    A large manufacturer had said recently that he had been hampered by reduced trade and business, but for the first time for years he had a handsome bank balance.    On the other hand,  coal had now to be paid for in cash,  and that came in on the other side of the accounts and how the debit and credit were working out it was difficult to say; but if there was an appreciable increase of industry after the coal stoppage, the demand for industrial finance for building up stocks and working up capital would be considerable.    It looked as if everything was tending towards an awkward position for financing industry.    It might be debatable whether there would be a partial boom or not after the ooal stoppage was over.    In the view of Sir M. Muspratt the spending power of the people had been so reduced by the six months&apos; stoppage that they would not have the resources to make large purchases,  and unless there was to be an entirely unexpected increase in exports, we might reasonably&quot;have to expect an extremely bad winter.    Even if the coal stoppage came to an    end in three or four weeks, it was to be feared that there would be a bad winter,  except possibly in the export trade;  and there might not be much improvement in any of these trades whioh were now shut down.
CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE (iCONTD.)COL. WILLEY wrote, on 28th September:-&quot;I have just returned from the United States;    two matters of general interest might be worth referring to. Firstly, there is evidently a more widely dispersed European interest.    This is partly in industrial issues, mainly on the part of residents of foreign origin or their recent descendants.    In the case of Bonds, the readiness to invest is more widespread, and results partly from the wider belief that European conditions as a whole are improved, and partly from the relative attractiveness of the Interest rates by comparison with high grade Domestic Bonds.&quot;The other point is the marked change of feeling towards France.    The former traditional republican and general sentimental sympathy towards France,  though beginning to wane a year ago, has in the past twelve months undergone a great diminution.    General sentiment in business and financial circles may now indeed be described as one of great impatience with, if not actual hostility towards, France.      It is the change in sentiment which is so perceptible.      Certainly there will be little chance of a French issue going in New York&apos;&apos;&apos; .SIR FELIX SCHUSTER considered that the reports from the branches of the National Provincial Bank in various industrial districts showed very poor trade and little activity. That was particularly the case in Lancashire.     Trade in both Liverpool and Manchester was very poor and people     were much depressed at the general lack of business.    Pottery.seemed to be slightly better.    It appeared that coal could be obtained and that manufacturers were comparatively busy executing an accumulation of orders.    The shoe and. leather trade in Northampton seemed to be a little better, but manufacturers were adopting a cautious attitude.As regards wool, .the position in Bradford, so far as yarn was concerned, was more satisfactory;    there had been large purchases for Russia.    It was quite the reverse as regards cloth. In agriculture, reports on the whole did not bear out the sanguine anticipations that had previously been formed. Crops had been good on the whole, but from various sources it was reported that the yield of the corn crop was disappointing.As to the monetary situation,  that was very complex at the present moment.    It would be seen from the returns that the proportion of bank advances to deposits was still rising, and had almost risen to a point at which there must be a stop.    Sir F. Schuster thought it must be admitted that this was not to finance new business - there was- no new business, or very little of it, - but it was to enable industries to carry on, and that was certainly not a satisfactory reason for an increase in banking advances.There was a scarcity of money in America.    Even now after the payment of dividends, money was scarce, and it
GENERAL TRADE   AND    FINANCE (CONTD).would continue so for some time to come.    It would probably-come to an apex during this month, which was generally the dearest month.      Perhaps there would be a&apos; little easing off in the American money market afterwards.     At present there was very little American   money in this country.   There had been a large amount but it had gradually been drawn army, and American banks had now no more in this market than was absolutely required for their real demands.      On the other hand the situation hore was very much obscured by other foreign currencies.   . There was a good deal of other foreign money employed in this market, and it had probably contributed to the apparent uase with which we had been carrying on. France, Italy and other countries were investing their money over here.      Germany was now drawing gold from us, and that ought to make the operations of the Transfer Committee much easier than we had thought possible at one time.      Of course, however, there was no real &quot; need for Germany to have gold from here.The issues which had been made lately had been successful in certain directions, particularly those bearing a high rate of interest, but we ought not to be misled by that into thinking that our own investing power was large.     A great deal of these investments might come from foreign sources. On the whole it did not appear that we could look forward to any easy, in the money market, certainly during the next few months, but rather to continued stringency and scarcity.     And, of course, when the coal strike came to an end requirements would be very much greater than they were now.MR. GURRIE remarked that tha discount rates had been very well maintained during September,   and were much higher than was usual at this time of the year.      One looked for easy money at this time.     He quite agreed with what Sir Felix Schuster said about new issues not being a good guide as to the amount of money available for investment.     One saw this in the failure of gilt edged securities like those of the New South Wales and Corporation Stocks.     When there was a high yield, there was always a scramble to invest.      It was certainly not by any means a true test of the country&apos;s savings. Mr. Currie also agreed with sir Felix that the outlook was not very promising.     The demand for accommodation seemed to have increased, but it had not been a legitimate demand for assisting trade, but rather to carry industries on during a difficult time.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON observed that the tramp ship had received a remarkable impetus from the coal stoppage; rates had gone up sharply everywhere, and there had been a great demand for longer voyages than was customary.     The increased receipts, however, did not all go in to the pocket of the tramp ship-owner because, where possible, he bunkered at a foreign port for the round voyage, and had to
SHIPPING  (CONTD. ) .reduce his carrying power to that extent. The liner ship-owner, on the other hand, was badly hit by the cost of his fuel and by the stagnation of general trade.The freight index for August 1926 was 21% of 1920, and if one compared it with the 1913 level it was 117 per cent.    The freight figure for August, 1925, was almost exactly the same as that for August, 1913.    The ship-building figure was rather interesting;    the tonnage commenced in Great Britain and Ireland was more than that commenced in the rest of the world, in the quarter ended June this year.    It was because the rest of the world was coming do?m faster than we were, and not that we were going up:- 168,000 tons were commenced in Great Britain and Ireland, and 163,000 tons abroad.   As to tonnage launched, the rest of the world were still considerably ahead of us.Turning to other points, it would be remembered that the Brazilians were going to put on import and export cargo taxes without any notice, and to make the shipowner liable to pay. The British Government intervened and secured, at least, the postponement of the imposition of the duties and the shipowners were very grateful.    In connection with the Anglo-Greek Commercial Treaty, which had recently been concluded, the attention of British shipowners had been drawn to the fact that the model form of commercial treaty presented by the British Government to foreign governments as a draft permitted the exclusion of British shipping from the coasting trade; and tho shipowners thought that this was open to some objection as boing likely to suggest to foreign governments that it would be well to Insist upon this exclusion.Sir A. Anderson further observed that in Italy,  the Captain of the Port of Genoa had notified the foreign Consuls that he would not give pratique to steamers until the captain had given him written information as to the number of crew and their ratings, the  daily coal or oil consumption, the number of furnaces and boilers, etc.   What good it would do him or harm it would do the ship it was impossible to tell, but a letter had been received from the Norwegian shipowners saying that they had asked their Government to instruct the Norwegian Consul at Genoa to reply to this demand of the Port Captain in the  same sense as the Swedish and Danish Consuls had replied, namely, that they were not in a position to approve of such a claim.    The Norwegians also said they understood the British Consul to have replied that while British ship-captains could not be compelled to give the information demanded, he saw no objection to their doing so.    The Port Captain had therefore sent a notice to all ship-captains saying the questions were
SHIPPING  (CCNTD.).issued with the approval of the foreign Consuls at the port. The British shipowners suggested that the Government might make representations to Italy to dissuade her from calling for such information.    The President said that the matter would be taken up.Sir A. Anderson added that the WireleBs Telegraphy Conference in Washington in 1927 would,  of course, be a very technical one,  and that the question had been raised by shipowners whether the safety of life at sea in connection with wireless telegraphy might not better be discussed on this side before the participating countries sent their delegates to Washington.    It was Germany,  apparently, who had suggested that this question of wireless on ships should be raised at Washington; but now the Scandinavian Governments, it was reported, had come to an agreement on the subject, and let it be known that they thought it would be well to have a meeting on this side fir6t.    British shipowners thought that this would perhaps be.wise.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR HERBERT WALKER wrote:-&quot;General merchandise traffic,  apart from coal,  coke and patent fuel, but including building material, has certainly been on the down grade during the last few weeks,  the only bright spot being that in many of the districts traffic conveyed at C.  and D. rates has maintained its position extraordinarily well,&quot;The return of large numbers of men in the Coal Industry has naturally had its reflex on the larger increase of home-produced coal carried by the Railway Companies.    For the week ended 85th September the London and North Eastern Railway Company conveyed over their line 312,733 tons of coal The London Midland and Scottish Company during the week ended September 26th, conveyed 631,837 tons of coal,  of which 423,500 tons was home produced.    During the same period tho Great Western Company oonveyed 181,000 tons from and to stations on their line,  of thi3 29,110 tons is home produced&quot;,MR. HILL said that the returns as to railway receipts up to the first 38 weeks of the year - to the 26th September -were now available.    They showed a reduction, first of all in the reeeipts from traffic of over 22-g- million pounds, which was about 16 per cent.    This was divided between &quot;goods&quot;, which showed a reduction of 15ijf million sterling, and &quot;passengers&quot;, where the reduction amounted to about 7jg millions sterling.    About a third of the reduction had occurred during the last nine weeks up to the 26th September. There was certainly no sign of improvement there.    The latest detailed figures were for the month of July,  and they showed that at that time,  compared with July,  192 5, general merchandise was down by 20.6 per cent;  coal, coke and patent fuel by 85.7 per cent.,  and other minerals by 39=6 per cent. The biggest reduction was in coal,  in iron and steel and in timber.
EMPLOYMENT.MR. PRICE said that the figures of unemployment had taken a somewhat remarkable course having regard to the circumstances of the last few weeks. The peak of unemployment was reached about the beginning of July with a total of 1,645,000. There had been a continuous fall every week 3ince then, with the exception of two weeks at the beginning of August and September, respectively, and the reduction from the peak figure amounted to now very nearly 120,000.    The register on the 20th September showed a total of 1,530,000 and it might be    seen in this morning&apos;s paper that there was a further decrease of 3,000.    Of the total register nearly a million were classed as wholly unemployed - that is, without situation, and 560,000 as temporarily stopped.    The increase in the register that had taken place since the end of April represented a 56 per cent, increase over the country as a whole, but it was unevenly spread.    The percentage Increase in London was only Q% while in the Midlands it was over 100 per cent; in the North Eastern and North Western Divisions the increase was  about 70 per cent, and in Scotland about 30 per cent. The greatest increase in the register was under the head of &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; people, as one would expect, -where they had been told they must work short time or lay off for the time being,  and come back, say, when the coal stoppage was over. The increase there was nearly 400,000 which represented more than 220 per cent, over the corresponding &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; figure for the end of April.    The increase in the number of persons classified as &quot;wholly unemployed&quot; was, however, only 20 per cent.    Of course in all these figures the miners who were out of work in connection with the coal stoppage were excluded.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR, SANDERSON said that during the last month in Australia there had been good rains which had very much altered the position,  in Queensland particularly.    Of course they wanted still more but it was quite likely that they might get that. All the pastoral areas south of the tropics were doing very well indeed, stock being in first class order,  feed and water supplies ample, and lambing       results satisfactory, while good wool clips had been obtained or were expected. Of course, there was always the risk of bush fires in summer after a season like this, but that would not affect the present wool clip.   With regard to wheat and the agricultural districts, the reports were very good indeed, Eut a great deal would depend on the weather during the next six weeks;   they sometimes got north wind3 with the summer that did a lot of damage, but generally speaking the outlook for the wheat crop was excellent. A record production in wines for export was anticipated. They were expecting to export 2 million gallons more than last year;    that would bo a record,    making 15% million gallons altogether. It was apparently due to the fact that the drought had not affected the irrigation area where the fruit
AUSTRALIAN TRADE (OOFCD.)was grown.    A curious result of the demand from G-reat Britain for Australian wines was that large quantities of fresh currants and other grapes usually absorbed by the dried fruits industry were being converted into wine and spirit.Large works were to be erected in Victoria for the manu-manufacture of asbestos cement sheets, and a company would, it was understood,  be formed to erect a cotton spinning factory in Melbourne.INDIAN TRAPS.MR.  LINDSAY said that the position in India was that the monsoon was now drawing to a clo3e.    It had started rather late, and there were some apprehensions about it at the beginning, but it had also continued late, and that was the important thing.    As a result,  the crop position in India on the &quot;whole was distinctly good,    There had been a record jute crop, amounting to nearer 11 than 10 million bales.    The sowings for the next wheat crop were assured, and the rice crop was normal.    The only crop which appeared to have suffered at all through climatic conditions during the past season was cotton, and this appeared to be hardly as full or of as good quality as usual.    Special interest attached at the moment to jute, because so much depended upon it. Mills were generally short, not only in Calcutta, but in Dundee and on the Continent.    There had been an attempt by the cultivator to hold up the crop, but it was doubtful if he would succeed.    The   &quot;cultivator was bound sooner or later to sell, and, as a matter of fact,  the price now was considered to be very reasonable,  just under  50 a ton. If it went much lower before the mills bought, there was a danger of serious reactions on next year&apos;3 sowings, because the cultivator, in a large proportion of the jute area, had the alternative of growing rice;  so that the present seemed to be the right time for buying.On the import side, the imports of cotton piece goods into India were on the whole fairly well maintained, judging by the purchases of the last few months.    Last year the imports had been distinctly low, and they had -been slightly exceeded this year so far as could be seen aft present, particularly in grey.,  goods.  India had purchased last year 700 million yards of grey goods, and at present indications were pointing to a purchase of about 300 million yards daring the current year.    White and coloured goods had also gone up slightly in quantities.    Mr.  Lindsay was interested in what Sir William Clare Lees had said (see section on &quot;Cotton;i) in regard to the output of white cotton goods in Japan, because he had not noticed any indications from India that Japan was increasing her-exports of white goods to that country.    India had bought last -year about 4-i million yards of white goods from Japan, and apparently was buying about half that quantity this year, on the figures available.    The British proportion of that trade was still being maintained,  - 121 million yards out of a total of 126 million were of British origin.As regards iron and steel, the pre-war imports had been about 11 crores a year; they were now 22.    The United Kingdom-IP..
INDIAN TRADE (COIJTD).and the Continent, pre-war, had practically divided this trade in the proportions Of 2 British to 1 Continental. America came in after the p03t-war slump, and the proportions were then about one-third each, British, Continental and American.    Since that time America had been squeezed out and the proportions were almost exactly the same as they had been before the war, - British 2 to Continental 1.    As regards machinery, India had     bought, pre-war 5i crores a year, and now bought 14 crores - nearly three times as much.   Here America was getting a little of her own back.    She had pushed her way into the market and was now practically equal with the Continent In sales to India, the 3ritish share being nearly 80% with 10/o each to America and the Continent.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. MR. H0S3 wrote&quot;In Argentina, although imports have fallen off somewhat, they are still high in relation to the greatly reduced value of exports,  and there is little hope of a general improvement in trade conditions until a recovery occurs in grain prices.   Prospects for the yield of next season&apos;s cereal crops, however, are encouraging.    The condition of the wheat, oats and linseed crops is everywhere satisfactory,  and the area sown to linseed is well in excess of that of last year. For the moment, shipping facilities are restricted, owing to the fact that, during the continuance of the British coal strike, vessels have been obliged to proceed from Europe in ballast, so that freight rates show a corresponding&apos; tendency to advance.&quot;Trade conditions in general remain dull,  and buyers are still disposed to limit their commitments to those necessary to cover day-to-day requirements. Dealers and department stores have been selling off at drastically cut prices in order to reduce their stocks. It is reported that the Employees&apos; Pensions Law, which was passed in December, 1923, has definitely been abrogated.    This Law occasioned extensive protests on the part of commercial Interests on account of the complicated manner in which it would have operated,  and, in fact,  its provisions have never been fully enforced.&quot;The Argentine Government continues to obtain loan accommodation in New York,  and on 30th September last, an issue was made there of ^16,900,000 External Sinking Fund 6 per cent. Gold Bonds, maturing by 1st October, 1960, at 98? per cent., and was promptly over-subscribed.    Argentina has recently taken extensive measures with the object of consolidating the Floating Debt,  and the long-term nature of the latest bond issue may be regarded as being in accordance with that policy.&quot;The Commercial situation In Chile shows a slight improvement, and retailers are making every endeavour to reduce their stocks.    The credit situation is easy,  and commercial failures are light.    The chief adverse factor at the moment is the difficult outlook in the nitrate industry, and, until conditions in that direction improve, a substantial
CONFIDENTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE; (CONTD Uamelioration in general trade can hardly be expected. Cable advices received from a private source, however, indicate that expenditure under the provisions of the 1927 Budget will be fully covered by revenue, any possible reduction in the receipts from export duties on nitrate being offset by the yield of new taxes.   Folitical conditions in the Republic remain tranquil, although the Tacna-Arica problem remains unsolved.&quot; Brazilian conditions show some slight tendency towards improvement,   although the tone in tha    principal commercial markets remains nervous^  and the outlook somewhat uncertain. Failures have recently been less serious and, in some directions, means have been found to relieve the credit stringency. The Bill to increase import duties has been shelved by the Chamber of Deputies, and no action has been taken in Congress with regard to the petition of the Textile Associations for duties to be  advanced with the object of protecting the national Industries.&quot;TRADE WITH CHIN A.MR, LAND ALE believed that the considerable volume of trade that was being done in China was chiefly Japanese and local trade.  It was certainly extraordinary how,  in the parts of the country where there was no fighting,  trade was flourishing.    The country continued, generally, in a very disturbed state and btxsiness was much hampered by the uncertain outlook. In spite of these conditions,  the Customs returns continued to increase, and it is understood that the amount collected to the end of August constituted a new record. It was to be feared, however, this did not mean an Increase in British trade. The fall in the price of silver had inter-fared with the import business in China from all gold-using countries.. The  Indian Currency Commission&apos;s report had con-tributed to this and had had a very adverse effect on the silver market;    and the stabilisation of the rupee had proved a very expensive operation for the China trade. The depreciation in the value of the Indian Government&apos;s holding of silver must amount to a very large sum,Traffic on the railways was increasing in several places inhere fighting had ceased, but their earnings were still being diverted to military war chests. At Canton the situation \&quot;jas still obscure.    The merchants were frightened to resume trade until the proclamation promised before tho ICth October had been Issued.  It was thought that while active hostilities might cease,  the boycott might continue. The British Consul-General was, however, very optimistic.
