J 3 oiHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNTC&apos; MAJESTY1&apos;S--4X)VERN1IENT). CMT.C A B I NET. I, 361 (26). ;Polioe (Appeals) Bill,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.I I refer to the Memorandum (c.P.358/26) hy th* HomaSecretary on tho subject of an appeal tribunal for members of police forces who are dismissed or required to resign as an alternative to dismissal,I do not dissent from tho view that the time has probably arrived when some such appeal should be allowed.     So far as Scotland is concerned I would propose to accept the reoomnenda-tion of the Deaborough Committee that the appeal in Scotland should be to the Sheriff.I have recently had occasion to institute an inquiry into the dismissal of two police constables of the Kilmarnock Burgh police force.     The enquiry in that; case was held by the Sheriff and the result has been quite satisfactory.I note that the Home Seoretary proposes to extend the right of appeal to cover the case of a chief constable who ia dismissed by his police authority.     Here again the position is different in Scotland and I do not think that such an appeal is necessary there.     The Chief Constable of a burgh police force cannot be dismissed or have his salary reduced by the town counoil (the police authority) unless with the approbation of the chief magistrate and the sheriff, or, if they &quot;differ in opinion, of the Secretary of State.     This seems amply t6 safeguard the position of a burgh Chief Constablet .   Aa regards County police forces,-the Chief Constable may be dismissed by the Standing Joint Committee (the police authority), a body which consists as to one-half of county councillors and as to the other half of Commissioners 6f Supply (persons with a oertain property qualification) with the Sheriff as a member jxx offielo.I would propose to amend tho law so as to secure that a resolution by a Standing Joint Committed dismissing a Chief Constable or reducing his salary should not be effeotive unless the Sheriff or the Secretary of State concurs, which would give a County Chief Constable a like security of tenure to that possessed by a Burgh Chief Constable.Reverting to the form of the tribunal, I am strongly of opinion that it is undesirable that the appeal should be to a Minister, if this oan be avoided.     I recognize that the difficulty of avoiding this ia greater in England than in Scotland in view 6f the fact that there is not in England a functionary quite analogous to the Scottish Sheriff, and the speoial responsibility of the Home Secretary in relation to the Metropolitan Polioe force has also to be taken into account.     I am, of course, impressed by the considerations, as stated in the Home Secretary&apos;a Memorandum, whichhave/
have led him to reject the form of tribunal for England reoommcnded by the Desborough Committee, but I fear that if the Minister is the tribunal of appeal the inevitable result will be that the decisions of the Minister will form tho subject of debates and. divisions in the House of Commons. In my opinion, the risk of injury to the discipline of the forces through Parliamentary discussion and agitation in these cases is much greater than any danger which is likely to arise from failure on the part of a properly selected, independent tribunal to understand the nature of police discipline or the essential importance of safeguarding the reputation of the service.With a view to Overcoming the difficulties the Home Secretary has suggested tli&amp;t the situation might be met by passing a Eill for England and Walias giving appeal to the Minister and subsequently passing a Scottish Bill providing for an appeal to the Sheriff.     With great regret I am forced to the conclusion that this course would not be satisfactory because (l) the arguments to be usod by the Home Secretary in support of the principle of appeal to a Minister during the passing of the English Bill may seriously embarrass the passing of the Scottish Bill based on the oontrary principle, and (2) even if we succeeded in passing a Bill providing for an appeal to the Sheriff in Scotland the encouragement given by the proposed English legislation to debates and divisions in the House of Commons would re-act adversely on the working of the Scottish system.     The position might be different if the possibility of Parliamentary debates and divisions on the Secretary of State&apos;3 decisions could be excluded.     But such exclusion, in rry opinion, is not fes.sible in practice.While, therefore, I fully appreciate the difficulties and risks attaching to the constitution of an alternative form of tribunal in England and Wales I venture to urge that they are less formidable than the consequences of accepting either for England and Wale3 or for Scotland the prinoiple of appeal to a Minister.cotti Bh Office , 27th October, 1926.
