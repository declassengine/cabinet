[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1926.SECRET. Copy No. LO.P. 368 (26).CABINET.GAS WARE ARE.PLEASE put together for my information and use all the international (treaty or other) condemnations of gas warfare.How far have we charged gas as a special crime against Germany 1^ &quot; A. C-Foreign Office, October 15, 1926.International Condemnations of Gas.1. Declaration of the 29th July, 1899, made at The Hague Peace Conference, to which Great Britain was a party : &quot; The contracting Powers agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases.&quot;2. Article 23 of the Regulations respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, annexed to The Hague Convention of 1907, to which Great Britain was a party : &quot;In addition to the prohibitions provided by special conventions, it is especially forbidden &quot; (a.) To employ poison or poisoned weapons.&quot; (b.) To  employ  arms,   projectiles  or  material  calculated  to  cause unnecessary suffering.&quot;3.   Declaration of the 18th October, 1907, made at The Hague Conference : &quot;The undersigned, plenipotentiaries of the Powers invited to the Second International Peace Conference at The Hague, duly authorised to that effect by their Governments, inspired by the sentiments which found expression in the declaration of St. Petersburgh of the 29th November (the 11th December), 1868, and being desirous of renewing the declaration of The Hague of the 29th July, 1899, wdiich has now expired.&quot;4. Reply of Allied Governments in March 1918 to a proposal by the Geneva Red Cross that the use of gas should be given up : &quot; The Governments of the Allied Powers, signatories of The Hague Con-vention, have received in a spirit of sincerest sympathy the appeal which the Committee of the Red Cross has addressed to them with the praiseworthy object of putting an end, if possible, to the use as a means of war of poisonous and asphyxiating gases.&quot; More than any, the Allied Powers associate themselves with the generous and truly humane ideas which in this as in other cases inspire the Geneva Com-mittee; they fully share the committee&apos;s sense of horror and sadness at the realisation that science, instead of being applied to the relief of human troubles, is daily prostituted to the pitiless work of increasing general destruction.....&quot; At the beginning of the present war the Allied Powers believed, and had the&apos;right to believe with the whole world, that barbarous methods of refined cruelty in war were done with as between civilised nations. Explicit and solemn pledges had been taken that no use should ever be made of poison or of arms, projectiles or other means of war aiming at the infliction of needless suffering. With the Committee of the Red Cross, the Allied Powers consider that poisonous and asphyxiating gases are clearly indicated in this prohibition.3670   [1443 x-1]   [15264]
&quot;The pledge figured in the convention of which various Governments  notably the Imperial German Government-guaranteeed loyal execution. If any value was to be attached to the word of honour of sovereign States, no conviction seemed better established than that of the Allied Powers that their troops would not be subjected to the tortures of deadly gas and need not be furnished with any equipment to protect them against it.&quot; This was the situation when in April 1915 the Allied forces were assailed by a new enemy in the shape of deadly gases, first asphyxiating, then poisonous. The appalling sufferings caused by this insidious and treacherous attack have been only too accurately described by the committee. The German Empire had recourse to methods it had expressly undertaken not to use, and had again broken its word.For months it became &quot;the duty of the Allied Powers to seek and to discover means of protecting their troops against these dastardly abominations and to furnish them with the power of resisting their adversaries with equal arms.  this task is now accomplished.....&apos;&apos; In spite of all, if the German Government to-day declares that it adheres to the committee&apos;s proposal and offers new detailed and effective guarantees that an agreement to discontinue the use of gas will be observed, the Allied Govern-ments will not refuse to examine its proposals in the most liberal spirit. But without such guarantees the Allied Governments would fail in their duty in not having recourse to every means of depriving their opponents of their power to harm.&quot;5.   Article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles : &quot;The use of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and all analogous liquids, materials or devices being prohibited, their manufacture and importation are strictly forbidden in Germany.&quot;6. Article 5 of the second Washington Treaty of the 6th February, 1922, signed and ratified by Great Britain : &quot; The use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices, having been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world, and a prohibition of such use having been declared in treaties to which a majority of the civilised Powers are parties,&quot; The signatory Powers, to the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of international law binding alike the conscience and practice of nations, declare that assent to such prohibition, agree to be bound thereby as between themselves, and invite all other civilised nations to adhere thereto.&quot;7. Protocol attached to Arms Traffic Convention of the 17th June, 1925, signed by twenty-eight States, including Great Britain, but not ratified by any State &quot;Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world; and&apos;&apos; Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in treaties to which the majority of the Powers of the world are parties ; and&apos;&apos; To the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of international law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations;&quot; Declare:&quot; That the high contracting parties, so far as they are not already parties to treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare, and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration.&quot;Extent to which the Use of Gas has been Charged as a Special Crime againstGermany.The use of gas by the German troops on the 22nd April, 1915, was regarded with horror by the whole of the civilised world, and British propagandists naturally took the opportunity of vilifying Germany for this fresh breach of international obligations and for the inhumanity of their methods.
Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be said ever to have pressed this particular charge against Germany, possibly hecause they had decided to use gas themselves in retaliation. Shortly after the Germans had used gas for the first time Sir Edward Grey made the following statement in Parliament: ,c This breach of the rules of warfare and of international engagement has clearly been committed by the enemy with deliberate purpose and after careful preparation. The German authorities are evidently quite aware of what they are doing, and it is unnecessary to call their attention to it. Time will be more usefully spent in taking steps to counteract this practice.&quot;After the war the use of gas by Germany was considered at the Peace Conference. In the summary list of offences committed by the authorities or forces of the Central Empires and their allies against the Laws and Customs of War and the Laws of Humanity, drawn up by the Committee on Responsibilities, there is included, as No. 26, &quot; Use of deleterious and asphyxiating gases.&quot; The only instance of this given is the use of asphyxiating gas on the 22nd April, 1915. There is no record in the Foreign Office as to whether or not the report was communicated in any form to the German Government, but Professor Headlam-Morley is almost certain that it was not.In their reply to the German note of protest against the peace terms, the Allies recited the various misdeeds of Germany, and included the following sentence : &quot; They (the Germans) were the first to use poisonous gas, notwithstanding the appalling suffering which it entailed.&quot;These are the only official references to the matter which can be traced by Professor Headlam-Morley. His impression is that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not treat the use of gas by Germany as an offence of the same gravity as atrocities in Belgium, ill-treatment of prisoners, frightfulness at sea, &amp;c. It was doubtless con-sidered preferable to concentrate on offences which we had not ourselves committed even as a measure of retaliation.I. KIRKPATRICK.October 21, 1926.
