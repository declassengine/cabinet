This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;&amp; Government.Printed for the-Cabinet,, July, 192G.SECRET. Copy No.  3 0CP. 307 (26).THE CABINET.THE RE-SETTLEMENT IN CIVIL LIFE OF EX-REGULAR SAILORS, SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.At present the annual number of men who are passed from the Army alone into civil 19life, either by discharge or transfer to the Reserve, is about 30,000, of whom some 7,000 Employ-*                                         -                                                                             &apos;  nun it.68leave the Army in circumstances that do not call for re-settlement measures.   The problem is to find civil employment for the remaining 23,000 or so men. This total number falls into two main categories (a) Skilled men (i.e., tradesmen, including clerks), say 3,000. \b) Unskilled men, about 20,000.As regards the tradesmen, these men are skilled at their respective trades, but as a rule have not Trade Union tickets and&apos;find difficulty in getting into their trades in civil life.About 2,000 of the unskilled men receive vocational training, and of the total number who receive such training it has been found possible in the past to place about 90 per cent., i.e. about 1,800.   There remain 3,000 skilled and 18,200 unskilled.I consider that the principle should be accepted that the Government should provide employment for as many of these men as possible, and the possibilities are roughly as follows : 1. Vacancies for Skilled Men.The annual number of these in Government Departments generally has not yet been ascertained, but there must be a considerable number of such vacancies under the Post Office and Office of Works to mention two Departments only which would be suitable for ex-service tradesmen either with or without additional training. The problem of placing at any rate a substantial proportion of the remainder in Government service should not prove insoluble. It involves much detailed work and clearly cannot be stated in terms of gross numbers of vacancies and applicants.2. Vacancies for Unskilled Men.The number of posts annually falling vacant in and under Government departments which are suitable and might be earmarked for these men is probably between 3,500 and 4,500. These posts exclude clerical posts and include for the most part such posts as messengers, porters, caretakers, watchmen, &amp;c. There are many similar posts under county and municipal authorities who receive grants from the Exchequer.It will thus be seen that, even if a high proportion of Government vacancies were reserved for ex-regular soldiers, this would absorb only a fraction of the total number jto be placed. But it is of importance that the Government Service as a whole should set a good example in this respect to civilian employers, and I have hopes that if we work out a good re-settlement scheme in the Government Service, it will have its effect outside and lead to a more rapid absorption of ex-service men in the civilian labour market.(326/171   100   7/26   W.O.P.   2769
It is of great importance that a career should be offered to a soldier not less attractive than that which is open to him in civil life ; the present want of system top frequently results in a soldier losing the time in which he could learn, a trade by joining the&apos; Army and being turned out as an unemployed unskilled labourer, a living advertisement of a nation&apos;s ingratitude or carelessness.I ask for the co-operation of my colleagues in, charge of employing departments to seek out the appointments within their jurisdiction&apos;which may be reserved for ex-service men of the Regular Forces.I suggest that a strong inter-departmental committee should be set up to ascertain what openings exist and to advise how they can be reserved for ex-service men.L. W.-E.The War Office, 29th July, 1926.
