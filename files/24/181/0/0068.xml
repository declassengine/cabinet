Mr. Neville Chamberlain&apos;s paper (CP. 362/26) shows that since the 1st May Boards of Guardians in England and Wales have borrowed, in addition to any money raised by increase of rates, over Ml millions sterling, of which  5i millions have been supplied by the banks and  2 millions by the Exchequer the latter only doubtfully recoverable. The advances from the Exchequer ai*e now nearly  250,000 a week. No doubt the bulk of this money has gone to the mining&quot; districts and this is the explanation of the protraction of the dispute with consequently increasing injuries to the nation. These reliefs, turned to the best advantage by communal kitchens, enable the married miner to live upon the food of his family. No wonder the struggle continues! It is difficult to see why it should not continue indefinitely, the miners adhering&quot; to their principles while subsisting&quot; on the outdoor relief of their families and becoming gradually habituated to an indigent idleness.2. The owners also are seeking to demonstrate &quot; a principle &quot; which was not asserted when the dispute first began, viz., that there should be no national negotiations or settlement. They have even unwarrantably refused the invitation of the Government to come to a joint conference. They have invariably been wrong in their predictions about the return of the miners. A very large number of owners are heavily in debt to the banks, and now feel that the banks must carry them to the end. There-fore the incentives to settlement are on both sides simultaneously weakened.3. Sooner or later the Government will have to face the question &quot; Is this the end of the story? Is there nothing for it but to go on like this week after week and month after month; keeping the process alive on the one hand and reckoning up the monthly impoverishment of the nation on the other ? Is that to be the last word which the Government can speak ?  Or if not, for how much longer must it continue to be our position ?(15270)
4. Is it not clear that a certain point will be reached when the Government ought to say &quot; This thing has got to stop, and we are going to stop it immediately.&quot; I am not for the moment examining whether that point has yet been reached. But on the assumption that the moment had come when we decided to act in that spirit, how should we act ?   I propose for discussion the following outline.5. (a.) Override the owners by passing the Compulsory Arbitration Bill already submitted to the Cabinet covering all agreements in the coalfields, and set up the Arbitration Tribunal.(b.) In the meanwhile, until the arbitrations are concluded, prescribe by law the interim conditions of immediate resumption of work, to wit, not more than 7i hours except where men are already at work on an 8 hours basis and the wages of last April.(c.) No employer shall be allowed to open his pit in the interim period except on these conditions; nor after the arbitration except in accordance with the award. In any case where the men are willing to return on these conditions and the conditions are refused by the owners, the men to be considered as unemployed and eligible for full scale of benefit. Where the employers open the pits on the prescribed terms and the men or any men refuse to return, all relief to their families to cease within one week of the passage of the Bill.The Cabinet must balance the exertions and dangers of such a policy against the really frightful injuries to national wealth and character inherent in indefinite prolongation of the stoppage over very large portions of the coalfields.W. S. C.November 2, 1926.
