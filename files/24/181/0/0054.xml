(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS    BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT).CABINET. f 0&quot;POSTMARK    ADVERTISEMENT    SCHEME. (Memorandum by the Postmaster General) .The Economy Committee, after considering my memorandum N.E.44 dated 3rd March, 1926 (copy annexed), decided that an attempt should be made to start this scheme, and a clause  (clause 17) was embodied in the Economy Bill, and became law. deolaring that postmarks may consist of such words or devices as the Postmaster General may in his discretion think proper, including revenue - earning advertisements.I accordingly proceeded to attempt to develop this scheme, and on the 30th of July last I placed with Messrs. Mason, who had made the best offer for the exclusive right to obtain commercial orders for postmark advertisements, a contract to come into operation four weeks later.    Messrs. Mason are one of the leading firms in the trade and were prepared to work for 15fo on gross revenue.At first the prospect was encouraging.    The Contractors had numerous enquiriesj    an order from the L.M.&amp;.S.Railway for  2,000 was obtained almost at once; and orders for larger amounts from the White Star Line and the Daily Mail seemed on the point of signature, while the Times was negotiating for a small order, and Mr.  Gordon Selfridge was making personal enquiries as tj terms and dates.But the Press took fright at the threatened competition, and opened a vigorous campaign against the new scheme.The
The effective parts cf   this were firstly,  the stressing of the injustice to a firm of having rival goods advertised on the envelopes of its own circulars and,  secondly,  the reiterated assertion that in the opinion of named advertising experts and of large advertisers, such as Harrods, the advertisement offered was not only ephemeral and expensive/ but likely to do actual harm to the business of any firm using it, because the public, resenting the defacement of its correspondence, would boycott any firm guilty of thi3 breach of taste.The result wa3 at once apparent in the attitude of advertisers.    All the firms which had been actively negotiating for advertisements declined to proceed, explaining that they feared a boycott of their gp^ds by the public and of their advertisements by the Press.The Chairman of the L.M.&amp;.S.Railway personally took steps to secure   cancellation of his Company&apos;s order, though under pressure from my Department he agreed that if large orders could be obtained from two or three other advertisers of first-rate standing, to appear simultaneously with his order&quot; or before it, he would allow his to stand.My Department then supplemented the contractors&apos;  efforts by special efforts to secure orders from firms with, which it has large dealings and friendly relations, viz.  the British Petroleum Company, the Dunlop Tyre Company, and the Morris Motor Company.    It also endeavoured to obtain an order from the Empire Marketing Board.All alike have refused;    nor did any success attend the contractors&apos; efforts to obtain orders from Selfridge&apos;s and other large retailers by an offer at a low rate of a com-bined advertisement of their own business and the Cash-on-Delivery Service.    In fact Mr. Gordon Selfridge now declares that he will never allow his firm&apos;s name to appear on such advertisements.
The Contractors themselves have made every effort to secure business, but have succeeded only in obtaining four orders so small that to carry then out by themselves would render the Government ridiculous - they cover only 7 of our 250 machines for one week, and represent a revenue to the Department of about  120.Chambers of Trade and Commerce throughout the country, as well as the Associations of large advertisers and those of the large retail traders, have passed resolutions strongly condemning the scheme;    moreover recognised experts on advertising, who control the advertisement expenditure of practically all the important firms, have so strongly and publicly committed themselves to condemnation of the scheme that they oould not now with any regard for their reputation advise an advertiser to use it.I do not therefore think there is now any prospect of obtaining appreciable revenue from the scheme, and this view is shared by the contractors.Accordingly I recommend that the scheme be abandoned and the contract with Messrs. Mason cancelled.    I have reason to believe that they will a,gree to cancellation without compensation for the expenses they have incurred,  if cancellation be granted quickly.It will of course be necessary to make some public announcement and I suggest the following communique:The enquiries made by the Postmaster General^ at the direction of the Cabinet Economy Committee, into the probable revenue to be derived from commercial advertisements on postmarks have now been completed. The evidence goe3.to show that at present the probable revenue in small and that many important commercial bodies are strongly opposed to the adoption of such a
scheme.    It has accordingly been decided to continue to ooiif ire postmark legends to matters of national or public interest.&apos;(liltId)  W.  LJ.-T.lERAL POST OFFICE. 18th October,  1926.
TSJ300UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).CABINET STANDING COMMITTEE GIT EXPENDITURE. (Memorandum by the Postoaster General).1. As requested by the Economy Committee I circulate the following memorandum on the question of utilising Post Office date stamps for commercial advertisements,,2. The Law Officers have recently advised (.see Appendix) that &quot;the Postmaster General has no legal right to use as a post mark a device containing a commercial advertisement of any description without the consent of the sender of the letter&quot;.    If it be decided to adopt the policy of commercial advertisement, a clause in the Economy Bill will be required.5. Up till now advertisements of various objects in which the Government was directly or indirectly interested have been admitted,  such as British Empire Exhibition, British Industries Fair;, National Savings Certificates, Imperial Cables, etc.    The legality of these is perhaps debatable -but it seems hardly necessary to seek amendment of the law, so long as the legends are confined to advertisements of this character.   The expediency of an extension to include paid advertisements was discussed by my Advisory Council at a recent meeting and opinion was fairly equally divided, the bias being perhaps slightly against.4. I have no material upon which to form a reliable estimate of the revenue obtainable, but there is some reason to think that it might&apos; reach  250,000 per annum. Probably the most productive method would be to divide the country into geographical areas and to lease the date stamps in each area for short periods,  either by competitive tender or by employing one of the large advertising contractors.ORE I.
5. There can be no doubt that the admission of commercial advertisements will excite widespread opposition, which may be classified under four heads(a) People who object, on grounds of dignity and taste,to their letters and British postage stamps being defaced with advertisements.    It will be argued that letters passing through the post are not the Postmaster General&apos;s property and that any marks which he puts upon them should be confined to those required for postal purposes.(b) People who object to their own letters being utilised as a means of advertising the goods or services of their rivals, e.g. Harrods would resent their advertising circulars being impressed with a statement that &quot;Selfridge&apos;s goods are best&quot;, and the L.M.S. Railway would protest at their letters being covered with an exhortation &quot;Travel to Scotland by the East Coast&quot; .(c) Persons who object to their letters being   used as propaganda in aid of causes or objects which they abhor and which the contents of the letters may be specifically directed to crush; e.g,,- to take two formulae which are in regular use-&quot;Read the Daily Herald&quot; or &quot;Drink Black and White Whisky&quot; would be offensive to large sections of the community.(d) The Press, who&apos;will doubtless resent the advent of this new competition for advertisements.6. The Postmaster General must clearly retain power to reject any advertisement tendered without giving reasons, and the exercise of this censorship will be an extremely difficult matter.    Such questions as the following will certainly arise:-(a) Presumably political propaganda would be barred. This is difficult enough to enforce in the case of Broadcasting;  it will be more than difficult in the case of date stamps,(b) Would advertisements of foreign, manufactured goods be barred and, if so, would this apply to goods partly manufactured abroad? .  .
(o) Can the Government escape all responsibility for statements included in these advertisements, e.g., if an advertisement &quot;Put your savings. in the XIZ Bank&quot; is accepted :; and the Bank comes to grief, will not the State have laid itself open to criticism?7. It is arguable that the use for advertising of letters which are entrusted to the Post Office for the purpose of transmission stands on an entirely different footing from the use of Income Tax and similar forms. The State has assumed a monopoly of postal transmission and , though I  am attracted by the prospective revenue, I confess I cannot view without considerable misgiving a policy which would compel the sender of a letter to become an unwilling advertiser of his commercial rival and might indeed result in the advertisement impressed by the State upon the envelope neutralising the sender&apos;a advertisement within.8. I may add that while many foreign countries have adopted general advertisements and propaganda in favour of particular health resorts, Exhibitions etc, I cannot find that any have admitted advertisements in favour of individual firms or specific articles of commerce.W. Mitchell-Thomson.^GENERAL POST OFFICE, 3rd March,  1926
A P P E N D I X.USE OF POSTMARKS FOR THE DISPLAY OF COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENTS.OPINION.OF TEE LAW OFFICERS OP THE CROWN.1.    In our opinion the Postmaster-General has no legal right to use as a post mark a device containing a commercial advertisement of any description without the consent of the sender of the letter.fl.   We think such a regulation   would he ultra vires. The general wurds at the end of section 12 do not extend, in our opinion, to matters outside the necessary arrangements for the transit of postal packets.3.    In our opinion either the sender or the addressee of a letter hearing such a post mark might take proceedings against the Attorney-General as representing the Crown for a declaration that the use of such a post mark was illegal... We are also of opinion that an action by the sender, and probably by the addressee, for damages and an injunction would lie against the Postmaster-General as an individual (though not in his official capacity)  subject to proof of his personal responsibility for the post mark complained of,    A similar action would lie against any Post Office Official who actually affixed the post mark.-4.    We have nothing to add.(Sgd) DOUGLAS MCGAREL HOGG. &quot;      T. W* H.- INSKIP,&apos; LAW OFFICERS&apos;  DEPARTMENT * 4th February,  1986.*- i,e.,  a regulation under the Post Office Act taking power t use date stamps for advertising purposes.
