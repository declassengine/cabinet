[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1920.SECRET. Copy No.    31CP. 334 (26).CABINET.CANDIDATURE OF THE DOMINIONS FOR SEATS ON THE COUNCIL OFTHE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum, by the Secretary or State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a report of the proceedings at two conferences of the principal members of the delegations of the Empire held in my room yesterday and to-day.The Cabinet will observe that we were unexpectedly confronted with a problem of great difficulty. The first discussion showed a remarkable measure of agreement as to the list of candidates which it was desirable to support for the Council. On the assumption that an extra seat was to be given to Asia, Lord Cecil and I had found it difficult to decide between the merits, or perhaps I should rather say the demerits, of China and Persia. The Indian delegation warmly supported the idea of a Persian candidature, since it would bring a Mahometan Power to the Council table. The rest of the dominions felt that neither China nor Persia deserved the honour of a seat or would contribute to the strength of the Council, but if one of the two were to be chosen the general opinion was in favour of Persia. In any case, in regard to foreign candidates no difference of any importance betrayed itself; but Mr. Fitzgerald indicated a strong wish to put forward the candidature of the Irish Free State, not so much, as I gathered, because he had much expectation of being elected, nor indeed because he cared much how many or how few votes he received, but because he wished by this act to assert the rights of the dominions and to prevent new vested interests growing up as a result of the scheme of reform adopted by the Assembly and of the understandings and engagements which had been the basis of the compromise. His declaration gave rise to a marked divergence of opinion. The representative of New Zealand held that it was not in the interest of the Council that the British Empire should ever have two votes upon the Council, which might on some critical occasion be given in support of opposite points of view. He was, therefore, opposed (as I understood him) even to the assertion of a dominions right to propose its candidature. Mr. Latham held that it was desirable to assert this right, but probably not in any circumstances to exercise it unless the interests of a particular dominion gave some special force to the claim and could be pleaded in support of the necessity for the presence of that dominion on the Council at that particular time. All the dominions, except New Zealand, were desirous of asserting the right by a declaration to be made by Sir George Foster, as the representative of the senior dominion, in the public discussion at the Assembly. Canada and South Africa further contemplated that one or other dominion should presently stand for the Council, but they held it inexpedient that any dominion candidature should be put forward at this moment.Without expressing any opinion as to the advisability of a dominion candidature .at another time, I, after consultation and in agreement with Lord Cecil, strongly deprecated such a candidature now. I urged that it would be put forward in most mifavourable conditions, that, as was shown by the discussion, even the British Empire delegations would not be agreed in its support at this moment, and that to go to the poll under such circumstances would weaken rather than strengthen the claim of the dominions, to which I gave my full support, that they were as eligible as any other State member of the League.No decision was taken and none was sought, but we all left under the impression that Mr. Fitzgerald would not proceed with the Free State candidature in the [15074] b
circumstances. This morning each delegation received a notification that, alter reflection, and whilst greatly regretting to differ from colleagues, he had decided that it was his duty to maintain the Free State candidature. At the request of Sir G eorge Foster and Mr. Latham, I summoned the second meeting, which was held this afternoon. Though the action of the Irish delegation was the subject of much criticism by the other delegations in private, the discussion throughout was again of the most friendly character, but it left the position unchanged. Mr. Fitzgerald informed us that, after carefully considering the objections wnich had been urged, he had felt it his duty to advise his Government that he thought it would be right that Ireland should go to the poll. The Free State Government had expressed their concurrence, and he could not alter his decision. In these circumstances, Mr. Smit seemed to think it the lesser evil to support the Free State candidature. The other delegations felt unable to do so. Lord Cecil and I feel that we, in particular, are so bound by the understandings which arose out of the committee&apos;s discussions, on which Lord Cecil represented us, that we cannot make a place on our list for the Free State. Even apart from this, we feel that until the Imperial Conference has had an opportunity to consider the question it would be wrong to commit ourselves to a departure which may have far-reaching consequences to the Empire.I had, therefore, intended to propose at the close of our discussion that, as suggested yesterday by Sir Francis Bell and Mr. Smit, the whole question should be reserved for discussion at the Imperial Conference, but Mr. Fitzgerald&apos;s declara-tions were so explicit that, though I mentioned that this had been my first idea, I felt it impossible to press the Free State any further.It is a great misfortune that on such a question the British delegations should be divided, as it undoubtedly gives rise to misunderstanding among the delegates of foreign countries, who cannot comprehend how any unity can exist where so much freedom is taken and allowed. The subject must, I think, in any case be discussed at the Imperial Conference, where it is not unlikely to be raised by both New Zealand and Australia, and I have thought it right at once to inform the Cabinet as fully as possible of what has passed.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.Geneva, September 15, 1926.Report of Proceedings.A meeting, lasting two hours, took place with the dominion representatives on the afternoon of the 14th September to discuss the question of the most suitable candidates for election to non-permanent seats on the Council.After Sir Austen Chamberlain had explained his views with regard to the claims of the various foreign candidates, Mr. Fitzgerald raised the question of a dominions seat. The position had been altered (since the last meeting) by the definite withdrawal of Spain, and if a seat was going begging he felt that a dominion ought to put forward a claim to it, for the sake of establishing the principle of the right of the dominions to a seat equally with all other members of the League, and in order to prevent claims being staked out to the exclusion of the dominions&apos; claim.Sir Austen Chamberlain then called upon the various delegates in turn to express their views. Sir George Foster said that on behalf of Canada he entirely agreed as to the importance of maintaining the principle of the right of the dominions to a seat equally with all other members of the League. The principle had been admitted in Paris in 1919, and indeed, there could be no question in regard to it. He was prepared to make a statement maintaining the general principle on a suitable opportunity at the Assembly, but if a suitable European candidate could be found, he did not think the present occasion opportune for one of the dominions to become a candidate for the seat.Mr. Latham agreed on behalf of Australia, but thought that nothing should be said or done which could be construed as in any way impairing the unity of the Empire, the maintenance of which in all international affairs was the first plank in Commonwealth policy. He saw no objection to such a statement as that proposed by Sir George Foster, so long as it was confined to the statement of the general principle and made no reference to any actual candidature.Sir Francis Bell, on behalf of New Zealand, was entirely satisfied with her representation on the Council by the delegate of Great Britain, and did not desire any change. In any case, he suggested that the proper place to discuss any alteration in the present representation of the dominions on the Council was the
Imperial Conference, when the whole matter could be discussed by the Prime Ministers of the Empire.Mr. Smit, on behalf of South Africa, supported Sir Francis Bell&apos;s opinion that the Imperial Conference was the proper place to discuss the matter. He had, however, rather altered his view of the situation since the withdrawal of Spain, which left one place more or less begging. He would, personally, much rather give his vote to Canada than to one or two of the Powers which had been mentioned (and, indeed, to India rather than to Persia), but on the whole, he thought the time was not opportune for the dominions actually to put forward a claim to a seat, especially in view of the forthcoming Imperial Conference, and he would be satisfied with sucii a. declaration as had been proposed by Sir George Poster.Sir William Vincent and the Maharajah of Kapurthala, on behalf of India, agreed generally to the views which had been expressed by the previous speakers. India was not yet a self-governing dominion, but when the time came for her to reach dominion status, she would have a claim to a seat equally with the &quot;other dominions.Mr. Fitzgerald still maintained that if the dominions desired to reserve their rights for the future, their proper course was definitely to put forward a candidate now. He was ready to support Canada or South Africa, and if nobody else would enter the lists, he was prepared to put forward the Irish Free State as a candidate.Lord Cecil observed that if Czechoslovakia was put on the Council for one year on the present occasion, a vacancy might occur next year, for which it might be possible for one of the dominions to compete with a considerable prospect of success. Put this argument did not convince Mr. Fitzgerald, who urged that his sole object was to maintain the right of the dominions equally with all other members of the League to a seat, and that the longer we acquiesced in the claim of particular interests to representation, the more difficult it would become to establish this principle.At this point Sir Austen Chamberlain begged leave to make certain general observations. All discussions of the matter must start on the basis of the right of the dominions to separate and independent representation in the Assembly. NO question arose as to their right to express their opinion or to vote, or, indeed, to become a candidate for a seat on the Council, if they thought fit. There might be advantage in the various delegates taking an independent line in matters that were not of vital importance (Sir George Foster here interposed to say &quot;so long as it was not done to show independence &quot;). In matters of vital importance, however, it was Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s view and in this he was speaking for the British Government that it was most important that the various delegations should preserve a united front before the world.As to the point now at issue, no question arose as to the right of the dominions to become a candidate for, and if elected to hold, a seat on the Council. The principle was generally admitted; the sole question was the practical one whether the time was opportune to put forward such a claim. So far as Sir Austen Chamberlaiiis information went, if a dominion became a candidate, it wrould only obtain a very small number of votes even if all the British delegations voted for it. Would this help to maintain the principle which Mr. Fitzgerald desired to assert ? Would it not rather have exactly the contrary effect ?The other delegates supported Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s view, Mr. Latham especially observing that, in view of the discussions which had taken place, it seemed very doubtful whether the Irish Free State would obtain the support of all the british  votes.   Such a division of opinion before the world would be most deplorable.Mr. Fitzgerald said that he had always been able to agree with his colleagues in the British Empire delegation on all important matters hitherto, and that he was sorry that he could not do so now.The meeting concluded without his expressing his final decision in the matter.In the evening, after the conclusion of the meeting, the Irish Free State delegation decided that as there would evidently be no other dominion candidate they would themselves put the Irish Free State forward, and so informed Sir Austen Chamberlain and the other dominion delegates by letter received on the morning of the 15th, at the same time circularising the foreign delegations.At the Assembly meeting on the morning of the 15th, Sir George Foster made a speech in wmich, as agreed at the meeting on the previous day, he referred to the position of the dominions in the Assembly and asserted their right to election equally with all other members of the League. Sir Austen Chamberlain took occasion to express his assent to what was stated by Sir George Foster, Not having yet seen the [15074] B 2
Irish Free State delegation^ letter at the moment of mounting the rostrum, Sir George Foster stated in his speech that he did not know that any of the dominions intended to stand as a candidate. He was compelled to correct this statement when the passage was being translated, and stated that he now understood that the Irish Free State intended to become a candidate.Mr. Fitzgerald followed in a speech in which he expressed his sense of the dangers whicn might arise from the establishment of a prescriptive claim on the part of certain countries or groups of countries to a non-permanent seat and amrmed. the equal right of all members to election. Jtie refrained, however, from definitely stating that tne Irish Free State intended to become a candidate.At the request of tiie Canadian and Australian delegates, Sir Austen Chamberlain convoked a further meeting of the dominions representatives immediately after the Assembly on the afternoon of the 5th September to discuss the position which had arisen.Sir Austen Uhamoerlain, after referring to the letter which he had received from Mr. Fitzgerald, the friendly tone of wmch he most warmly appreciated, felt compelled to express his regret at the decision that the Irish Free btate delegation had reached, because apart from the reasons which he had stated at the meeting on the previous day, it might lead foreigners to suppose that there was a lack of unity in the Empire on this important matter. In particular, he desired to express his profound regret that he, who had been one of the signatories to the treaty which had brought the Irish Free State to Geneva, should be compelled to abstain from giving his vote for her.Sir George Foster said that after the meeting on the previous day he had hoped that the Irish Free State would abandon their intention, and he was exceedingly disappointed that they had not done so. He outlined the conditions which he thought ought to be fulfilled before a dominion actually stood for election for a non-permanent seat previous discussion and agreement between the various parts of the Empire, a suitable opportunity, a choice of candidate unanimously approved and unanimously supported by Great Britain and the dominions and some previous canvassing to ensure a definite prospect of success. None of these conditions, he ventured to think, had been fulfilled in the present case, and he made a strong appeal to Mr. Fitzgerald, if it were not too late, to reconsider his decision.Mr. Latham associated himself entirely with the remarks made by Sir Austen Chamberlain and Sir George Foster. In addition, he thought that it might have a deplorable effect in the United States if, at the first election after the introduction of the new scheme in the formulation of which the British delegates had borne so prominent a part, a dominion put forward a claim to a seat, thereby giving a handle to those in the United States who criticised the League on the ground of the number of votes which the British Empire controlled. He further thought that the recent incidents with regard to Brazil and Spain tended to weaken Mr. Fitzgerald&apos;s argument as to the danger of certain countries establishing a prescriptive claim to a seat; as he read the events of the last two months, the tendency now lay towards greater freedom on the part of the membere of the League in the choice of candidates rather than the reverse.These arguments failed to move Mr. Fitzgerald. He said that, in his judgment, the only sure way to establish the right of the dominion to election to a non-permanent seat was actually to put forward a candidature. He was entitled to his judgment as much as the other delegates. It was his duty to his Government to put forward his view of the matter, which he had done in a telegram on the -preceding day. He had now received the approval of his Government, and it was too late to go back now. He most profoundly regretted that he should find himself in disagreement with, his colleagues, but he felt bound in duty to act as he had done. He was glad to think that there was no difference between them as to the principle of the right of the dominions to a seat on the Council, only a division of opinion as to the opportuneness of seeking to exercise that right now. He appreciated the very kind words which had been spoken by Sir Austen Chamberlain and the other speakers, and he hoped that the present incident would not impair the amity of their relations and the spirit of co-operation in which they had always worked together.Sir Austen Chamberlain enquired whether any of the other delegates desired to express their views. Mr. Sm.it stated that, as he had said on the previous day, the withdrawal of Spain had caused him somewhat to revise his opinion. Fie still thought that it would have been better for a dominion not to have come forward as a candidate on the present occasion, but as the Irish Free State had come forward he would prefer to vote for her rather than Czechoslovakia.
Annex 1.Mr. Fitzgerald to Sir Austen Chamberlain.Irish Free State Delegation, 35, Quai Wilson, Dear Sir Austen, Geneva, September 14, 1926.MY delegation has very carefully considered the position reviewed at the meeting this afternoon, and, on the grounds that I did my best to set out at that meeting, they have decided to let Ireland&apos;s name go forward for the Council election.We regret exceedingly that in this decision we differ from the opinion of the British and other dominion delegations, even though it is only on the question of the opportuneness of candidature this year rather than next.I think I need hardly tell you, Sir Austen, that we should not take this step if we thought that it would in any way jeopardise the spendid work which you have undertaken, and have now brought to completion.We are moved entirely by what we conceive to be the best interests of the dominions.We hope that, appreciating our motives as we appreciate your difficulties, you will at least extend to us your goodwill, if you cannot do more.Yours very sincerely,DESMOND FITZGERALD.Annex 2.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Mr. Fitzgerald.British Delegation, Hotel Beau Rivage, Dear Mr. Fitzgerald, Geneva, September 15, 1926.YOUR letter dated the 14th has this moment reached me in the Assembly Hall. I appreciate the very friendly terms in which you communicate to me the decision of the Free State Delegation, and I am deeply touched with the fresh proof which you give me of your kind consideration for me. You will not, I know, be surprised when I say that I nevertheless very much regret your decision. We hold as strongly as anyone that every State member of the Assembly has an equal right to seek election in the Council, and if we thought that that right wras challenged in the case of the dominions or India we should be among the first to uphold it. But the question does not so present itself to our mind at this moment. To us it seems to be not a question of the right which is not challenged, but solely of the expediency of a dominion candidature at this particular election. On this point, as you know, we share the view expressed at our conference yesterday by the representative of every other dominion, that the moment is inopportune for such a candidature, which we cannot but fear may set back rather than advance the position of the dominions. We profoundly regret that in these circumstances we cannot give you our vote for this election, but I need not, I hope, assure you that we fully appreciate your motives and share your confidence that a momentary difference on the question of expediency cannot interrupt orTmpair the harmony of our relations.In thus writing I speak for Lord Cecil as well as myself. He has seen this letter and concurs in its terms.Yours very sincerely,AUSTEN&apos; CHAMBERLAIN.sir William Vincent stated his entire concurrence in the views expressed by Sir Austen Chamberlain.Sir Francis Bell did not desire to give any further expression of his opinion. His views had been sufficiently stated on the previous day.The meeting, the tone of which had been very friendly throughout, then broke up on the understanding that, in the circumstances existing, the various Empire delegates must be free to exercise their vote at their discretion, having regard to any commitments which they might have made and which, in the case of the British delegation, arose out of understandings reached in the Preparatory Committee.Geneva, September 15, 1926.
