J^X^^^dmeni is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government-P/TEHALL.&quot;confidential.1S55) ADURING the special meeting of the Assembly in March last, the Prime Minister of Luxemburg addressed me a note stating that the Luxemburg Government had under consideration the question of the participation of Luxemburg in the work of Locarno, and enquiring whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to enter upon an examination of the manner in which such an agreement might be reached between the Governments of Great Britain and Luxemburg. The question raises many points of con-siderable complication, and I have accordingly caused a memorandum to be prepared in this Department regarding the whole question of the inter-. national status of the Grand Duchy. I circulate the memorandum to my colleagues herewith. Copies have also been sent to the Committee of Imperial Defence, whose observations have been invited in regard to the strategic issues involved.A. C.Foreign Office, August 28, 1926.[C 9506/112/18]INTERNATIONAL STATUS OF THE GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBURG.I. Request of Luxemburg for Participation in Locarno Treaties and for Guarantee of Neutrality.On the 14th January last Lord Crewe reported that M. Prum, the Minister of State for Luxemburg, had recently visited Paris and Brussels in order to suggest(a) that Luxemburg should be permitted to participate in the Locarno treaties, and(b) that France and Belgium should guarantee Luxemburg&apos;s neutrality. M. Prum&apos;s proposals had, however, according to Lord Crewe&apos;s informant, been so contradictory and vague that they had not been, fully understood either by the French or Belgian Governments, who had returned equally non-committal replies to them.2. During the League meeting in March the matter was broached with tlis Majesty5s Government by the Prime Minister of Luxemburg, then in Geneva, who forwarded to the British delegation a note (Annex (A)) stating that the Luxemburg Government had under consideration the question of the participation of Luxemburg in the work of Locarno, and enquiring whether His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to enter upon an examination of the manner in which such an agreement might be reached between the Governments of Great Britain and of Luxemburg. The Secretary of State returned an interim reply, to the effect that he must postpone con-sideration of the question until after his return to London, when he would address a further communication to M. Prum. A second interim reply has since been sent to the Luxemburg Government stating that His Majesty&apos;s Government are studying the question.3. The status of Luxemburg had already in the previous month (February) come up for consideration in the Foreign Office on another issue, and, as a result, Sir C. Hurst, the Legal Adviser, was authorised to discuss the question with M. Fromageot, the Legal Adviser to the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs, whom he was about to meet in connection with other matters. Before recording their con-elusions, it may be well to summarise the past and present status of Luxemburg and to consider the interests in the question of the various States involved.IT. Status of Luxemburg in the Past.4. By article 67 of the Congress Treaty of Vienna of 1815 (Annex (B)) Luxemburg was united to Holland by a personal tie, the King of Holland becoming Grand Duke of Luxemburg. By the same article Luxemburg became a State, and a fortress, of the Germanic Confederation.5. The underlying purpose of many of the provisions of the Treaty of Vienna was to erect a barrier against future French aggrandisement. In accordance with the same principle, Austria, Russia and Great Britain, by article 10 of the Protocol of Paris of the 3rd November, 1815 (Annex (C)), undertook to employ their best offices in order to obtain for the King of Prussia the right of garrisoning the fortress of Luxemburg, conjointly with the King of the Netherlands, as well as the right of nominating a Governor to that fortress.   By articles 4 and 5 of the Prussian-Dutch3602   [14998] b
Treaty of Frankfort of the 8th November, 1816 (Annex (D)), Prussia obtained the sole right to appoint the Governor, and the garrison was to be composed as to three-fourths of Prussian troops.6. After the outbreak of the rebellion in the provinces of Holland whence the Kingdom of Belgium ultimately emerged as the result of the treaties of 1839, the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg was divided; part of it went to Belgium, and in return some territory was added to Holland in Limburg. The King of Holland continued to be the Grand Duke of Luxemburg, and the Grand Duchy, thus reduced, continued to form a part of the Germanic Confederation.7. In 1867, after the war between Austria and Prussia, the Germanic Con-federation was abolished and the status of Luxemburg was altered. By the Treat&apos;.&apos; of London of 1867 (see Annex (E)) between Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, France&apos; Italy, Prussia, Russia and the Netherlands, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, within the limits laid down in 1839, was made a perpetually neutral State under the collective guarantee of the signatory Powers with the exception of Belgium, which was itself a neutral State. By the same treaty the Prussian garrison disappeared, the fortress was dismantled, and no military establishment was to be maintained in the territory except for the maintenance of order.8. In 1890 the position of Luxemburg was still further changed in effect but not in law, as, by reason of the death of the old King of Holland, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg ceased to be united to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This left Luxemburg a small and impotent State, powerless to defend itself and with nothing to trust to but the collective guarantee of the Powers, deprived of the right to maintain or establish fortresses and able to maintain only a number of troops necessary to provide for the maintenance of order. At the same time, she had been a member of the German Zollverein since 1842, and her railways were under German management. As the population is largely German-speaking, she was thus, in fact, largely a client State.of Germany.9. This was the position of Luxemburg when the Great War broke out in 1911 and her neutrality was violated by Germany. On that occasion His Majesty 1 Government held that, as the guarantee they had given in 1867 was a collective one (not an individual one, as in the case of Belgium) they were not called upon to intervene in defence of Luxemburg&apos;s integrity. The arrangement of 1867 having thus broken down, one of the many questions which awaited solution, after the war wras its replacement by some new regime.III. Treatment of Luxemburg at the Peace Conference.10. At the Peace Conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government strongly supported Belgium in her demand to be allowed to annex Luxemburg, or at any rate absorb her into some sort of union. It was felt that it was in the interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government to strengthen Belgium territorially; that the only way of doing so effectively and Avithout violating either ethnographic or economic principles was to give her Luxemburg; that the latter, not being a practical national unit, its continued existence might, owing to its geographical situation, easily become a source of embarrassment. But for various reasons, shown in Mr. Headlam-Morley&apos;s memo-randxim of the 9th May, 1921, and more particularly owing to the opposition offered by the French Government, this policy came to nothing, and in the end all that was done was to insert article 40 in the Treaty of. Versailles. The relevant passage of this article reads as follows : &apos;&apos; Germany .... adheres to the termination of the regime of neutrality of the Grand Duchy, and accepts in advance all international arrangements which may be concluded by the Allied and Associated Powers relating to theGrand Duchy.&quot;It was thus clearly the intention of the Powers to terminate the neutrality of Luxemburg, and to conclude some new arrangement to take its place. No steps, however, have since been taken to clear the matter up by any further international act, and the 1867 settlement must therefore be considered as still technically in force.IV. Entry of Luxemburg into the League of Nations.11. At the same time the position was modified in 1919 by Luxemburg&apos;s application for membership of the League of Nations. In the original application she asked that she might preserve her neutrality under the guarantee of the League, but the League refused to recognise the status of neutrality as compatible with membership.   This request was accordingly withdrawn and an undertaking given
that the Luxemburg Constitution should be modified so as to bring the constitutional laws of the country into harmony with the obligations involved in admission to the League of Nations. Luxemburg was thereupon admitted to the League without opposition, but she has never yet altered article 1 of her Constitution, which provides that &quot;The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg is an independent, indivisible, inalienable and perpetually neutral State.&quot;V. Present Status of Luxemburg.12. Thus the legal position to-day is full of paradoxes. Luxemburg is a member of the League of Nations, and the maintenance of her neutrality is contrary to the terms of admission. The Treaty of Versailles, on the other hand, did not by, itself abolish or end the neutrality of Luxemburg; it merely committed the signatory PoAvers to the principle that that status should be terminated. The neutrality and guarantee treaty of 1867 must therefore be regarded as still in force. Assuming, as we must, that it requires some formal instrument to abrogate it (even though all parties to the Treaty of Versailles are committed to such abrogation, and though the treaty of 1867 is itself incompatible with Luxemburg&apos;s membership of the League), it is clear that Luxemburg would have to be a party to any such instrument. She was a party to the treaty of 1867, which was signed by the King of Holland as Grand Duke of Luxemburg. Without Luxemburg&apos;s concurrence it is not easy to see how the 1867 treaty could be abrogated. It contains no clause enabling the parties to it to denounce it, nor is there any stipulation as to the period for which the treaty shall endure. The mere abrogation of the treaty of 1867 would certainly leave Luxemburg in a worse position than she enjoys at present. The territory which she lost in 1839 cannot be restored to her, and, though she might well be given once more the right to fortify the town of Luxemburg, neither she nor any other State would be willing to see the foreign garrison which disappeared in 1867 reinstated.VI. Desire of Luxemburg Government to replace pn-esent Status by some more effective Arrangement.13. The Luxemburg Government having now approached the British, French and Belgian Governments with a view to safeguarding Luxemburg&apos;s position, it is desirable to analyse as far as possible the probable standpoint of the various interested Governments towards the question.14. The Luxemburg Government would clearly like to keep their neutrality, but. as that is incompatible with their membership of the League of Nations, they may be presumed&quot; to be seeking some quid pro quo in its place. This they may hope to obtain in the form of an effective and definite guarantee by the Locarno Powers in the place of the abortive joint guarantee of 1867. Public opinion in Luxemburg, which was undecided immediately after the war, has recently grown in favour of mdependence under the present dynasty. A regularisation of Luxemburg&apos;s inter-national position would consolidate the dynastic and independence party still further. No doubt, also, the Luxemburg Government feel that an effective guarantee would strengthen their hands against any attempt to force them into political dependence on either France, or Belgium.VII. Interests of Limitrophe States.1.5. As regards the French point of view, the absorption of Luxemburg has often been an object of French policy in the past, and there is no reason why the ide^i should not revive. At the same time, judging from the history of the last five years, the French Government may well have&apos; given up for the moment any idea of either political or economic union with Luxemburg. In 1920, after Belgium&apos;s claim to annex Luxemburg, a plebiscite was held in the Grand Duchy, to decide, among other things, whether an economic union should be negotiated with Belgium or France. The majority favoured France, but nevertheless the French Government let the matter drop. Indeed, they even allowed an economic union to be negotiated between Belgium and Luxemburg, and this union (which came into force in July 1921) exists at the present time. It was said at the time that this renunciation on the part of the French Government was part of the bargain made with the Belgian Government in return for Belgian support in the occupation of Frankfurt in 1920. On the other hand, for the last five years the French and Belgian Governments have been bringing continuous pressure to bear on the Luxemburg Government in order to obtain control of the Luxemburg railways, which before the war were controlled by Germany. [14998] &apos; b 2
Last year a compromise was at last agreed upon whereby the control was to be divided between Belgium and France. This, however, broke down owing to the Luxemburg Parliament withholding its ratification. A modus vivendi was finally arrived at in November 1925 terminable at six months&apos; notice whereby the Luxemburg-Guillaume Railway is to be managed by the Alsace-Lorraine railway system. It is this Luxemburg-Guillaume Railway which, in the eyes of the French, is of particular strategic importance. Hence their anxiety to complete their control by making sure it will apply in war as well as in peace time. Thus they would certainly insist, in return for giving any guarantee to Luxemburg, upon having control of the railways in the case of a war in which Luxemburg would not, under article 16 of the Covenant of the League, be automatically obliged to allow the passage of French troops across her territory. The French Government, however, have hitherto shown no great interest in the guarantee question, and may well prefer to leave it open and to have a free hand in case of need.16. In the case of Belgium, it has already been seen (paragraph 10) that the Belgian Government hoped at the end of the war to annex Luxemburg. In this they failed, but they succeeded some years later in obtaining an economic union. No suggestion of annexation is heard to-day either in Belgium or in Luxemburg ; indeed, the effect of the economic union has rather been to estrange the two countries. Never-theless, it may be reasonably supposed that the Belgian Government would welcome the ultimate conversion of the present economic union into some sort of political union with the Grand.Duchy. If that estimate is correct, it follows that any effective guarantee by France, Great Britain or Germany to maintain the integrity of Luxemburg might be unpalatable to Belgium.17.   Germany would, of course, have to be a party to any effective guarantee How the idea would appeal to her it is difficult to say.  It seems hardly likely that she would welcome such an extension of her existing obligations, nor is it evident how it Avould be to her interest to do so.VIII. British Interests.18. As to Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government from the moment the Treaty of Versailles was signed abandoned, the policy of encouraging the political union of Belgium and Luxemburg. Our object now is that the status quo laid down in the Treaty of Versailles shall not be called into question, and this principle applies more particularly in the neighbourhood of the Rhineland. That does not, however, necessarily mean that British interests require His Majesty&apos;s Government to give Luxemburg any special guarantee. She already possesses the general guarantee provided by the Covenant. At the present moment our obligation in respect of Luxemburg is of a twofold nature: in the first place, there is the general obligation devolving from article 10 of the Covenant, though exactly how article 10 of the Covenant would be applied is at least a matter of some doubt; and, secondly, there is the treaty of 1867 (assuming that it is still in force), which is merely a collective guarantee in which Great Britain, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Russia all participate. That the 1867 treaty does not necessarily impose any material burden upon His Majesty&apos;s Government was proved in 1914. The Locarno guarantees are very different; they are not collective, but individual, and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend anything in the nature of the Locarno guarantee to the territory of Luxemburg would be to increase the British commitment and to tie their hands in the future, when it might be to their advantage to have them free. In these circumstances, extremely good reasons must be forthcoming to justify His Majesty&apos;s Government in assuming for an indefinite period more direct obligations in respect of Luxemburg&apos;s integrity than those already provided by the Covenant and the treaty of 1867.19. The only reasons for the assumption of such an additional and definite obligation seem to be (1.) An urgent appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government by the other Locarno signatories to join them in regularising the status of Luxemburg, and thus round off the Locarno system, which is technically incomplete as long as Luxemburg is left as the one gap in the chain of guaranteed frontier between Germany and her western neighbours. No such appeal has yet been made, and, even if made, would not necessarily be acceded to.(2.) The argument that by assuming this definite obligation His Majesty&apos;s Government could obtain from Luxemburg the right to send troops through Luxemburg territory in those cases, not covered by article 16 of
the Covenant, where under the Locarno Treaty His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will be involved in war either with France or Germany. This, however, is surely a matter of greater importance in practice to France than to this country, for by article 2, paragraph 3, of the Treaty of Locarno, France has the right of going to war with Germany under para-graph 7 of article 15 of the Covenant (viz., to take arms in defence of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the event of their being attacked by Germany), whereas the guarantee given by this country would be unlikely to come into play except in cases where article 16 of the Covenant was applicable. In such cases Luxemburg would already be bound, as a member of the League, to allow the passage of troops through her terri-tory, and no question would arise of getting any special permission. There is, however, another possible set of circumstances in which we might wish to take action without article 16 of the Covenant coming into play  that is (see article 4 of the Treaty of Locarno) , where Germany had committed a breach of article 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, but not actually invaded French territory. This would not necessarily amount to a resort to war in the sense of article 16 of the Covenant, which might not, therefore, apply and oblige Luxemburg to permit the passage of troops. The question therefore resolves itself into this: Do we, in order to carry out that particular obligation under Locarno (article 4), need to ensure in advance the use of Luxemburg territory for the passage of our troops? This raises the purely military issue of how great a strategic importance attaches to the use of Luxemburg railways and territory in the case of a British expeditionary force sent to repel a violation of article 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.20. Should military considerations be sufficiently strong to render necessary a further consideration of the political side of the question of Luxemburg&apos;s adhesion to the Treaty of Locarno, it may be of assistance to analyse more precisely what additional responsibilities and obligations His Majesty&apos;s Government would be assuming if they guaranteed Luxembnrg&apos;s integrity. The Luxemburg Government, be it noted, have not so far made any concrete proposals as to what form of guarantee they have in mind. It seems on the face of it unlikely that they merely contemplate becoming parties to the Treaty of Locarno. They probably aim at much more than that, for by so doing they would only obtain a guarantee of their German frontier, which, owing to the demilitarised rhineland already established by treaty and the arrangements made at Locarno, is already blanketed from German attack; no further guarantee on that side therefore seems required in practice. What they more probably have in mind is a guarantee against violation from either side  east or west.21. Perhaps sufficient has already been said to show that this idea of including Luxemburg in the Locarno system has little politically to be said in its favour. But if it be decided on military grounds to proceed further and to study how in practice it could be actually carried out, wre may perhaps take as a convenient basis for discussion the Hurst-Fromageot tentative scheme already referred to earlier in this paper (see paragraph 3).IX. Hurst-Fromageot Scheme.22.   This scheme runs as follows :  &quot; (a.) An engagement by the Principal Powers or by such or such Power (France, Belgium, Great Britain) to guarantee the territorial integrity of Luxemburg.&quot; (6.) An engagement by Luxemburg to allow the passage and quartering of troops on her territory when such troops are acting in conformity with the terms of Locarno.&quot; (c.) A declaration of inalienability of the territory of Luxemburg.&quot;23. Now as regards point (a), the guarantee here given to Luxemburg is more extensive than that to which wre are committed as regards the Franco-German and Belgo-German frontiers by article 1 of the Locarno Pact, (1) in that it guarantees not only Luxemburg&apos;s German frontier, but also her French and Belgian frontiers; (2) in that wdrereas the guarantee of the French and Belgian frontiers in article 1 of the Locarno Agreement operates only when His Majesty&apos;s Government are obliged to intervene in defence of the Rhineland, the proposed guarantee of Luxemburg [14998J b 3
b&apos;operates in every case. (The question is dealt with in detail in a minute by Sir C. Hurst : see Annex (F)). Further, a guarantee such as is suggested in the FIurst-Fromageot scheme by its very precision must clearly impose a greater obligation than does article 10 of the Covenant, the interpretation of which is still in doubt.24. As regards (&amp;), France clearly intends that this right of transit through Luxemburg shall be exercised, even in the case of a war when under Locarno Great Britain and/or Belgium is not called upon to intervene (as, for instance, under paragraph 7 of article 15 of the Covenant, i.e., &quot;legitimate &quot; private war); in short, when article 16 of the Covenant does not apply. This may be a concession larger than the Luxemburg Government may wish to give. It commits them to a definite obligation beyond that already imposed on Luxemburg as a member of the League by article 16. Are we prepared to buy this right for France at the price of our guarantee of Luxemburg&apos;s territorial integrity ?25. As regards (c), it would surely be of doubtful wisdom to exact from Luxemburg an undertaking which would preclude the Luxemburg people from ever joining up with one or other of their neighbours if they later wanted to do so.26. To complete this study of the arguments for and against the Luxemburg application, some comparison of the obligations and responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Government at present existing and those which would result from the Hurst-Fromageot scheme seems necessary :  I. Let us first take the case when under the Locarno Treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government are not bound to intervene (i.e., paragraph 7 of article 15 of the Covenant) : (a.) Under present Conditions. Luxemburg could not be called upon to grant passage to French troops by the League of Nations, for article 16 of the Covenant would not apply. France, however, would in practice be almost certain to march her troops across Luxemburg territory, and at the end of the Avar the integrity and, indeed, existence of Luxemburg might be destroyed by the conqueror. The invasion of Luxemburg in such a case or a menace to her integrity might create an embarrassing international situation supposing Luxemburg appealed to the League in virtue of article 10 of the Covenant. The liberty of action of His Majesty&apos;s Government AA^ould not be fettered by any but their engagements under the Covenant.(b.) Under the Hurst-Fromageot Scheme. France, by Luxemburg consent, would have the right to march her troops across Luxemburg, and Luxemburg Avould have the right to appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Government to defend her integrity if at the end of the Avar the conquering State tried to annex her territory or infringe her sovereignty. In fact, His Majesty&apos;s Government might find themselves involved in -Avar in defence of Luxemburg.II. Let us noAv take the case when under the Locarno Treaty His Majesty&apos;s Government do have to intervene : (a.) Under present Conditions.-Oxsx ally, Avhether Germany or France (but more particularly France for geographical reasons), would, on military grounds, almost certainly insist on moving their troops across Luxemburg territory. If the case were such that article 16 Avas applicable, the Luxemburg Government could raise no objection by the express terms of article 16 itself. But there is the possibility (see paragraph 19 (2)) that cur guarantee under the Locarno Treaty might come into play without article 16 being applicable. In such an event, we might find ourselves forced to condone Avhat an arbitration tribunal Avould probably hold to be a violation of Luxemburg territory.(b.) Under the Hurst-Fromageot Scheme. Our conscience would be clear as Luxemburg would be bound to allow our troops to cross her territory, Avhether article 16 applied or not, and at the end of a victorious Avar* the guarantee Avhich both our ally and we Avould have given to Luxemburg would presumably act as a check to any attempt to annex Luxemburg. On the other hand, at the end of such a war it might conceivably be to our interests that Luxemburg should be annexed by one of our allies, in which case our hands would be bound by our guarantee.* A war ending&apos; in defeat is not worth considering-, as we should presumably be compelled to repudiate our guarantee.
27. The upshot of this analysis is that by entering into an arrangement on the basis of the Hurst-Fromageot scheme we should be exchanging our present indefinite commitments under article 10 of the Covenant for a precise undertaking, the fulfilment of which might well prove embarrassing and even dangerous. As such it seems difficult to justify to British public opinion unless our military authorities can make out a really convincing case for the military necessity of having permission in advance to send troops through Luxemburg in the one case where, so far as we are concerned, a violation of the Treaty of Locarno does not ipso facto involve the application of article 16 of the Covenant.28.   The general conclusion seems therefore to be this : (a.) The present paradoxical status of Luxemburg inconveniences no one except perhaps the Luxemburg Government themselves. In any case, none of the Locarno Powers has shown any desire to change it.(6.) While His Majesty&apos;s Government might when the case arose be opposed to the absorption of Luxemburg by another Power, yet they would be ill-advised to bind themselves in advance (except in so far as such obligation may result from article 10) to withstand by force of arms such absorption if it took place.(c.) His Majesty&apos;s Government migh  conceivably have an interest in guarantee-ing Luxemburg&apos;s integrity (1) if His Majesty&apos;s Governments military advisers hold it to be essential that in order to implement our obligations under article 4 of the Locarno Treaty we should have a definite legal right to move British troops across Luxemburg territory, even in the case where article 16 of the Covenant is not applicable; and even in that case only if (2) the Luxemburg Government will not concede that right save in return for a guarantee of Luxemburg integrity.(d.) The Hurst-Fromageot scheme would appreciably increase His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s commitments; and might easily prove embarrassing and difficult to justify to British public opinion or to reconcile with the public interest.Central Department, August 21, 1926.Annex (A).Note from the Grand Ducal Government of Luxemburg to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Translation.)The Grand Ducal Government contemplate participating, in a form to be determined, in&apos; the work of Locarno, of which they highly appreciate the happy results in the interest of the peace of the world. They would be grateful to learn if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to enter into relations with them with a view to examine in what manner an agreement on these lines might be reached between the Governments of Great Britain and of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.Geneva, March 17, 1926.Annex (B).Article 67 of the Congress Treaty of Vienna of June 9, 1815.That part of the old Duchy of Luxemburg which is comprised in the limits specified in the following article, is likewise ceded to the Sovereign Prince of the United Provinces, now King of the Netherlands, to be possessed in perpetuity by him and his successors, in full property and sovereignty. The Sovereign of the Nether-lands shall add to his titles that of Grand Duke of Luxemburg, His Majesty reserving to himself the privilege of making such family arrangement between the princes, his sons, relative to the succession to the Grand Duchy, as he shall think conformable to the interests of his monarchy and to his paternal intentions.The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, serving as a compensation for the principalities of Nassau-Dillenburg, Siegen, Hadamar and Dietz, shall form one of the States of the Germanic Confederation; and the Prince, King of the Netherlands, shall enter into the system of this confederation as Grand Duke of Luxemburg, with all the prerogatives and privileges enjoyed by the other German princes.
The town of Luxemburg, in a military point of view, shall be considered as a fortress of the confederation; the Grand Duke shall, however, retain the right of appointing the Governor and military commandant of this fortress, subject to the approbation of the executive power of the confederation, and under such other conditions as it may be judged necessary to establish, in conformity with the future constitution of the said confederation:Annex (C).Article 10 (Extract) of the Protocol of Conference between Great Britain, Austria, Prussia and Russia respecting the Territorial Arrangements and Defensive System of the Germanic Confederation.   Paris, November 3, 1815.The fortresses of Mayence, Luxemburg and Landau are declared fortresses of the Germanic Confederation, with the exception of the territorial sovereignty of the fortresses.Their Majesties, the Emperor of Austria, the Emperor of all the Russias, and His Majesty the King of Great Britain, will employ their best offices in order to obtain for His Majesty the King of Prussia the right of garrisoning the fortress of Luxemburg, conjointly with His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, as well as the right of nominating the Governor of that fortress.Annex (D).Articles 4 and 5 of the Treaty between Prussia and the Netherlands, Signed atFrankfort on November 8, 1816.Article 4.Article 3 of the treaty concluded at Vienna, the 31st May, 1815/, and article 67 of the Act of the Congress of Vienna, having stipulated that the fortress of Luxemburg should be considered a fortress of the Germanic Confederation, this stipulation is maintained and expressly confirmed by the present Convention. Nevertheless, His Majesty the King of Prussia, and His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, acting in his quality of Grand Duke of Luxemburg, wishing- to adapt the remaining dispositions of the said articles to the changes resulting from the Treaty of Paris of the 20th November, 1815, and to provide in.the most effectual manner for the combined defence of their respective States, have agreed to keep a joint garrison in the fortress of Luxemburg; but that arrangement, made solely for a military object, shall not affect in any respect the right of sovereignty of His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, Grand Duke of Luxemburg, over the city and fortress of Luxemburg.Article 5.His Majesty the King of the Netherlands, Grand Duke of Luxemburg, concedes to His Majesty the King of Prussia, the right of appointing the Governor and the commandant of that fortress, and agrees that the garrison in general, as well as each particular description of force, shall be composed of three-fourths Prussian and one-fourth Belgic troops; thus relinquishing the right of appointment secured to His Majesty by article 67 of the Act of Congress of Vienna. These troops shall be equipped and paid at the expense of their respective Governments, and victualled in like manner, unless the fortress should be declared in a state of siege, in which case the garrison shall be victualled from the magazines of the fortress, and be supplied with provisions according to the principles established by article 14.
Annex (F).In so far as it guarantees the Belgian-Luxemburg frontier and the Franco-Luxemburg frontier, the Hurst-Eromageot scheme in theory involves a more exten-sive commitment than Locarno, because those frontiers are not guaranteed by the Treaty of Locarno.In practice the extension of the commitment is not very great. The wording of the Hurst-Fromageot draft is defective; it was not a plan worked out in detail. Presumably, the idea was only to give to Luxemburg the same guarantee as was comprised in the Locarno Treaty.Annex (E).Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Treaty between Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Prussia and Russia.   May 11, 1867.Article 2.The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, within the limits determined by the Act annexed to the Treaties of the 19th April, 1839, under the Guarantee of the Courts of Great Britain, Austria, France, Prussia and Russia, shall henceforth form a perpetually neutral State.It shall be bound to observe the same neutrality towards all other States.The high contracting parties engage to respect the principle of neutrality stipulated by the present article.That principle is and remains placed under the sanction of the collective guarantee of the Powers signing parties to the present treaty, with the exception of Belgium, which is itself a neutral State.Article 3.The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg being neutralised according to the terms of the preceding article, the maintenance or establishment of fortresses upon its territory becomes without necessity as well as without object.In consequence, it is agreed by common consent that the City of Luxemburg, considered in time past, in a military point of view, as a federal fortress, shall cease to be a fortified city.His Majesty the King, Grand Duke, reserves to himself to maintain in that city the number of troops necessary to provide in it for the maintenance of good order.Article 4.In conformity with the stipulations contained in articles 2 and 3, His Majesty the King of Prussia declares that his troops actually in garrison in the fortress of Luxemburg shall receive orders to proceed to the evacuation of that place immediately after the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty. The with-drawal of the artillery, munitions and every object which forms part of the equipment of the said fortress shall commence simultaneously. During that operation there shall remain in it no more than the number of troops necessary to provide for the safety of the material of war, and to effect the despatch thereof, which shall be completed within the shortest time possible.Article 5.His Majesty the King, Grand Duke, in virtue of the rights of sovereignty which he exercises over the City and Fortress of Luxemburg, engages, on his part, to take the necessary measures &quot;for converting the said fortress into an open city by means of a demolition which His Majesty shall deem sufficient to fulfil the intentions of the high contracting parties expressed in article 3 of the present treaty. The works requisite for that purpose shall be commenced immediately after the with-drawal of the garrison. They shall be carried out with all the attention required for the interests of the inhabitants of the city.His Majesty the King, Grand Duke, promises, moreover, that the fortifications of the City of Luxemburg shall not be restored in future, and that no military establishment shall be there maintained or created.
Neither Germany on one side nor France and Belgium on the other are going to make war on Luxemburg alone. If Luxemburg is the victim of acts of war from either the one side or the other, it will be because the two parties are engaged in conflict and Luxemburg stands across the path.If Germany is attacking France in breach of article 2 of the Locarno Treaty and violates the territory of Luxemburg, she will necessarily have broken articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno guarantee will thereby have come into operation.If France is attacking Germany in circumstances which are. permitted by the Treaty of Locarno, the provision in the Hurst-Fromageot scheme, under which Luxemburg is to allow France to cross Luxemburg territory, would prevent such invasion of Luxemburg territory constituting a hostile act against her.The above, however, does not cover the whole ground. There is first the case where Germany makes war on France without violating article 2 Of the Treaty of Locarno, and secondly the case where France makes war on Germany in violation of the Treaty of Locarno.A guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the frontier of Luxemburg, operative in either of the above two cases and coming into play by reason of a violation of Luxemburg territory, would involve a commitment more extensive than that of Locarno. As regards war on France by Germany which involved no breach of article 2 of the Treaty of Locarno, I do not think the question was ever thought out whether and to what extent such action by Germany would be consistent with article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles. For instance, a French attack on Spain bringing article 16 of the Covenant into play, and an appeal by the Council to the members of the League to take coercive action against France: does article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (a) justify, (6) compel, a German refusal to participate in any such action?A French attack on Germany in breach of the Locarno Treaty, coupled with an attempt to pass troops, &amp;e, across Luxemburg in the same way as if the attack on Germany were consistent with the Locarno Treaty, would, under that treaty, impose no obligation on His Majesty&apos;s Government until the French attack reached the German frontier, but then it would involve a French invasion of Germany and bring the Locarno guarantee into play. In this case, therefore, a guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Luxemburg frontier would involve but a small increase in the British commitment. It would merely bring the guarantee into play a little earlier.C. J. B. H.April 20, 1926.
