CHINA - PIRACY IN BIAS BAY,(Note by trie Secretary).The Prime Minister has directed that the attached Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee should be circulated for consideration at the next Meeting of the Cabinet,  since,  owing to pressure of work in connection with the Imperial Conference,  it is not possible to convene a prior meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence.(Signed) M.P.A. HAHKEY.42.  Whitehall Gardens,   S.W.I. 3th November,  1926.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.SECRET. Copy No.  3 2521-M.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.OVERSEA DEFENCE COMMITTEE.CHINA.Piracy in Bias Bay. Memorandum by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.THE Colonial Office have referred to the Oversea Defence Committee for their consideration a despatch, dated the 30th Jane, 1926, from the Governor of Hong Kong requesting approval for certain proposals for dealing with piracy in Bias Bay.The Governors despatch, with four enclosures, is reproduced as Appendix I.2. The Governor proposes that, when next a piracy in Bias Bay is reported, two companies of a British regiment should be immediately despatched with such naval escort as may be available to Bias Bay, where pirated ships are usually moored, and that the troops should land and endeavour to waylay the pirates while removing their loot.   The troops would also search the pirate villages and, if necessary, destroy them.These proposals go much further than the Admiralty standing instructions for the suppression of piracy in Chinese waters, and partake of the nature of a minor punitive expedition. The present Admiralty instructions are summarised in Enclosure No. 3 to Appendix I.3. Appendix II is a copy of a further despatch from the Governor of Hong Kong, dated the 28th August, 1926, reporting two further piracies in Bias Bay, and again urging that approval should be given to the recommendations contained in his previous despatch (Appendix I).-4. Appendix III is a copy of a telegram, dated the 6th October, 1926, from the Governor reporting yet another piracy. In this telegram the Governor states that the pirates probably scattered at once amongst the villages and seaplane reconnaissance failed to locate them.5. A telegram from Peking giving the views of the Acting Consul-General, Canton, is reproduced as Appendix IV. The Acting Consul-General suggests that the proposals in Appendix I, if carried out, might result in a charge of barbarous treatment to innocent villagers, and prefers as an alternative that Bias Bay should be occupied by a small garrison, Canton at the same time being given a public under-taking that the garrison will be withdrawn as soon as it is replaced by Chinese troops. If this is not possible, the Acting Consul-General considers that the Hong Kong; scheme is better than taking no actiou at all. He suggests that in either case action should be taken immediately after the piracy of a British ship. In this connection it may be noted that in- all the cases of piracy mentioned in Enclosures Nos. 1 and 2 to Appendix I the ships concerned were not British owned.6. In a telegram from Peking (Appendix V) the British Minister concurs generally in the view of the Acting Consul-General, Canton.[15276] &quot; - b
 -7. This question was considered by the Oversea Defence Committee at their 272nd Meeting held on the 29th October, 1926. The Committee are unanimously of opinion that, from the point of view of Hong Kong, it is very desirable that some steps should be taken to deal with the Bias Bay pirates, who are inflicting much injury on the trade of the Colony.They recognise, however, that it is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whether British forces should be permitted to take action for this purpose on Chinese territory.8. The Committee are informed that the Foreign Office, while concurring in the desirability of checking piracy in Bias Bay, take the view that everything possible should be clone to force the Chinese authorities to take action in the matter and to avoid action by British troops on Chinese soil, since the latter might result in propaganda throughout China to the detriment of British interests. The Foreign Office suggest, therefore, that action should be considered in three stages. First, the Canton Government should be informed that unless they take immediate action for the suppression of piracy in Bias Bay, His Majesty&apos;s Government may be forced to do so; secondly, in the event of no action being taken by Canton, naval action, not involving actual landing on Chinese soil, should be attempted ; and, thirdly, if naval action is ineffective, a plan on the lines suggested by the Governor of Hong Kong, or as amended by the Acting Consul-General, Canton, should be considered.The. Foreign Office have submitted to the Committee the draft of a telegram (Appendix VI), which it has been suggested should&apos;be sent to the British Minister, Peking.: 9. The Admiralty take the view that the Foreign Office proposals for the Navy to patrol Bias Bay would involve a large operation owing to the extent of the Bay ; that probably three craft would have to be permanently employed on the patrol, and that even then the plan was unlikely to be effective While recognising that it might not be possible to capture the pirates themselves, they are of opinion that the destruction of their headquarters and organisation might produce the desired result, and for this reason they consider that a plan on the lines suggested by the Governor of Hong Kong is the only solution to the problem. ;10. The War Office, while agreeing that the naval patrol of the coast (which the Foreign Office considered should not involve bombardment of the piratical villages), is unlikely to be effective, take the view that owing to the limited military resources of Hong Kong and the very large extent of the coast line of Bias Bay, the occupation suggested by the Acting Consul-General, Canton (Appendix IV), is not practicable. The area that could be occupied would be so small that it would probably have no effect whatever on the operations of the pirates. In this connection the Committee note that in paragraph 5&apos;of his despatch dated the 28th August, 1926 (Appendix II), the Governor of Hong Kong suggests that steps must be taken to make the pirate bases in Bias Bay and in the Canton River &quot;delta unsafe as centres for piratical Operations. It would, therefore, appear that the Governor does not contemplate limiting his action to Bias Bay alone.&quot; The&apos; War office also doubt whether the combined naval and military expedition suggested by the Governor does not involve an alteration of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to China described in OLD. Paper No. 727-B, dated the 15th October, 1926, as follows :-. *      ,   &quot;The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is therefore to avoid being drawn into intervention, in Chinese affairs on a large scale, and to pursue as far as \&apos;[   possible a policy of patience and conciliation.   This being so, they consider that ^,    armed action should be confined to the defence of British lives, property and interests by whomsoever attacked, provided that such action is easily practicable and will not involve extensive and incalculable military commitments.&quot;11. The Air Ministry are strongly opposed to air action against the pirate villages, as suggested by the Commodore, Hong Kong, in Enclosure No. 3 to Appendix I. They are of ihe opinion that it would be impossible to avoid inflicting damage on innocent persons, and suggest that this would result in charges of barbarous and inhuman conduct which might damage our prestige.The Committee are fully in agreement with this view. ... ...
12. Tn conclusion, the Committee submit that it is for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whether. British forces may-undertake punitive action against Chinese pirates on Chinese soil, and whether representations to the Canton Government regarding piracy in Bias Bay need be dependent on the preparation of a plan for such punitive action.&apos; .       .  - v -:They further suggest that, if the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government is favourable to action by British forces, the following suggestions should receive consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence : (1.) That before any action by British forces is undertaken the Canton Government, should be requested to take immediate and effective steps for the suppression of piracy in Bias Bay, and should be informed that if this is not done His Majesty&apos;s Government may be forced to take action. They further suggest that the nature of the action contemplated should not be divulged, and that in view of the fact that many ships, though not British owned, have British masters and serve British interests, action should be permissible in any case where British interests are known to be involved.(2.) That if the above course is agreed to, it is essential that a plan of British action should be framed by the local authorities in Hong Kong and approved by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry without delay. Further, it is suggested that the plan adopted must conform to the existing naval and militaiy resources of Hong Kong, and should be such as to cause as little adverse comment as possible among responsible Chinese authorities.(3.) That, occupation of Bias Bay being impracticable owing to the area involved, purely naval action being unlikely to be effective, and air action being undesirable owing to the risk of damage to innocent persons, the only plan that might produce the desired result is one generally on the lines suggested by the Governor of Hong Kong in his despatch of the 30th June, 1926.(4.) That the presence of Chinese troops and authorities when the operation takes place is hardly feasible, as swift action would appear essential if success is to be achieved. In this connection the Committee invite attention to the telegram from Peking (Appendix V), in which the British Minister suggests that co-operation by any Northern Chinese man-of-war would be more likely to antagonise Canton than isolated action taken by ourselves.(5.) That the Foreign Office draft telegram (Appendix VI) should be considered in the light of the decisions reached on the points mentioned above.((i ) That, as the Foreign Office consider that the most careful consideration should be given to qriestions of international law and general policy that might be affected by punitive action by British troops, in China, any plan that may be considered feasible should not be finally approved without further reference to that Department. &apos;.&apos;(Signed) G.

APPENDIX I.Governor, Hong Kong, to Secretary of State for the Colonies. (CO., No. C. 15383.)Sir, Hong Kong, June 30,I HAVE the honour to invite your attention to my secret despatch of the 20th January last,* concerning the capture of steamship &quot; Tung Chow &quot; by Bias Bay pirates, and particularly to the sixth paragraph, from which you will see that on the 9th January Mr. Fu Peng-sheung, then Commissioner of Foreign Affairs at Canton, wrote that this outrage &quot; should be dealt with by the Nationalist Government them-selves, who would certainly be able to exterminate these, pirates. Moreover, they had already begun to move in the matter, and there was no need for foreign assistance.&quot;2. Not only has no attempt whatever been made from that day to this by the Canton Government to exterminate the Bias Bay pirates, but, since the seizure of steamship &quot; Tung Chow,&quot; three more piracies have been committed by the Bias Ray gang. I attach a report (Enclosure No. 1) by Mr. T. Ii. King, deputy-superintendent of police, describing these piracies. Bias Bay is a sort of &quot; No Man&apos;s Land,&quot; in which the writ of the Canton Government does not run, and which is dominated by pirates and brigands from, the large village of Fan Lo Kong at the north-east corner of the bay.3. In view of the fact that a French vessel, the steamship &quot; Jade,&quot; was captured, by Bias Bay pirates in February last, I was fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of the French naval commander-in-chief, Admiral Basire, with the British naval commander-in-chief, Admiral Sir E. Alexander-Sinclair, in a scheme whereby it is now arranged that, as a matter of routine, all British and French men-of-war on their way xrp and down the China coast between Hong Kong and Shanghai put into Bias Bay and steam round it, and, further, that they carry out their gunnery and torpedo exercises, as often as occasion permits, in this bay. The&quot; object of this scheme is that the pirates should so frequently see men-of-war in and about Bias Bay that they may be forced to consider it a hazardous place from which to organise piracies or to which to bring vessels which they have seized. I have endeavoured to interest the United States navy in this scheme through the United States Consul-general at Hong Kong and through the Counsellor of the United States Legation at Peking, who was recently on a visit to Hong Kong. But I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with Admiral Williams, the United States naval commander-m-chief in these waters, and I -do not know what view lie takes of the proposal.4. 1 regard it, however, as most important that these Bias Bay pirates should not be allowed to commit any further outrage with impunity. They have a long record of successful crime behind them, and I attach a precis (Enclosure No. 2) of piracies committed by them since 1921. The pirates, I may say, are led by daring men with a good knowledge and experience of ocean-going ships. I therefore took advantage of the recent presence in Hong Kong of Mr. 6&apos;Malley, Counsellor of His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Peking, to arrange for a. visit of inspection to Bias Bay on the 16th June in H.M.S. &quot; Despatch.&quot; Our party, in addition to Mr. 0&apos;Malley and myself, consisted of Commodore Stirling, Colonel Montague-Bates (at present officer commanding the troops in Hong Kong), Colonel Coates, Mr. W. T. Southorn (Colonial Secretary) and several military and naval officers. We had also with us Captain H. F. Bloxham, acting assistant-superintendent of police, and Lieutenant-Commander Ingham, Royal navy, who had both participated in the raid made upon the Bias Bay pirates in -co-operation with the Chinese authorities in January 1925, and described in Captain Bloxham&apos;s report, which forms an enclosure in my predecessors despatch No. 81 oi the 3rd March, .1925.*5. We made a careful inspection of Bias Bay, noting especially the anchorage to which the pirates take captured vessels, and viewing the village of Fan Lo Kong from the waters of the inlet on which it is situated. Consequent on this inspection, I have received the attached letters (Enclosures Nos&apos;. 3 and 4), dated- the 24th and 25th instant, from Commodore Stirling and Colonel Montague-Bates respectively, indicating the nature of the operations which would be necessary, if a punitive expedition were to be undertaken. It is clear from these letters that prior authority from the Admiralty and War Office will be needed, and I. have the honour to suggest that the consent of those* Not reproduced.
Departments and also of the Foreign Office should be obtained .to action on the following lines : When next a piracy in Bias Bay is reported, it is proposed that two companies of a British regiment should be immediately despatched with such naval escort as may be available in accordance with a plan which is being prepared by the naval and military authorities. The expedition would proceed at once to the anchorage in Bias Bay, where pirated ships are moored, and would there land and endeavour to waylay the pirates while removing their loot. The troops would also search the pirate villages, and, if necessary, destroy them.6. Such a punitive expedition would, of course, be a warlike operation undertaken in Chinese waters and on Chinese soil. If, therefore, the co-operation of a Chinese cruiser, should one happen to be in or near Hong Kong at the time, could be obtained, this would be a great advantage. But it is not unlikely that no Chinese cruiser might be at hand, and the essence of a punitive expedition into Bias Bay is that it should follow immediately upon the report of a piracy. In such case, having regard to the fact that the Bias Bay area is outside the effective control of any administration in Canton, and having regard also to the numerous depredations committed by Bias Bay pirates in recent years, the de facto Canton Government when presented with the fait accompli might, of course, loudly protest against it as an act of war carried out by British armed forces in Kwangtung, but would, I believe, secretly rejoice at the extermination of this nest of pirates, and might even be encouraged thereafter to exert its own authority by stationing troops in this area and driving out the brigands who infest it. The result, as a whole, would I feel sure be salutary, and would not be misunderstood by the Chinese people either in Canton or in Hong Kong. It would certainly be welcomed by the Cantonese seafaring folk, and it would serve to vindicate British prestige.7. I have shown this despatch in draft to Commodore Stirling and to Colonel Montague,-Bates, who concur in the practicability of the proposed punitive expedition. Accordingly I have the honour to request that, if these recommendations meet with the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the necessary instructions may be sent fto Ilong Kong by telegram.8. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking and His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton.9. I enclose a chart showing Bias Bay and its contiguity to Hong Kong waters,* and I have indicated on the chart the anchorage to which pirates have in the past taken the vessels which they have seized.I have, &amp;c.C. CLEMEN IT, Governor.Enclosure No. 1 Precis of Piracies committed by Bias Bay Pirates, 19261. Steamship &quot; Jade.&quot; Shun Cheung Steamship Company, 6, Connaught Road, Central, 2nd floor, running between Haiphong, Kwong Chau Wan and Hong Kong. Was pirated on the 8th February, 1926, eight hours out from Kwong Chau Wan on her way to Hong Kong. She is a cargo ship, and was carrying 100 tons general cargo and bullion valued 82,900 dollars. There were ten third-class passengers. Seven of these were the pirates. They took the ship to Bias Bay and arrived off Fan Lo Kong at 10 a.m. on the 10th February. The ship was taken right up the creek, where it was in 3  fathoms of water and about 500 yards from the shore. The pirates called two sampans, which took off all the pirates and the bullion. The pirates boarded the ship at Kwong Chau Wan.2. Steamship &quot; Hsin Kong.&quot; China Merchants&apos; Steam Navigation Company. Was pirated on the journey from Shanghai to Canton, when she was near Swatow on the 25th March, 1926. The pirates took the ship to Bias Bay and transferred ashore cargo and loot from the passengers by means of a boat which was lying in readiness at an arranged spot. (&quot;South China Morning Post,&quot; of the 1st April, 1926.) (Hong Kong police have no report or details of this piracy.)* Not reproduced in possession of Colonial Office.

Chiusan Company, Swatow, states: On the 6th March, 1926,1 sailed, from Tax Sam Mi, about 6 p.m\, with forty-seven passengers and about eighty baskets of salt fish as cargo. When leaving Tai Sam Mi, six Chinese males, who had hoarded the ship before leaving as passengers, produced revolvers and seized the ship, They tied up myself, compradore and chief officer and then ransacked the ship, taking all the money from the passengers. They took the ship to Fan Lo Kong (near glass factory), where they left at about 7 a..m. to-day, the 7th March, taking all the money and some clothing with them. When leaving they told us; to leave at once and go full speed or other pirates would catch us. 1 have never seen any of. these men before and could not recognise them again.&quot;This launch is on the Sunmei-Swatow run.(Initialled) T.

Steam Launch &quot;Kung Hong.&quot;-On the 22nd January, 1921, on the run between Hong Kong and Shan Mei. Pirated at 2-.3Q p.m. between Sa Mun and Shan Mei by about twelve men armed with revolvers Hakkas. Launch taken to Fan Lo Kong Creek, booty loaded into junks. Arms carried on board at Hong Kong and concealed in buckets with false bottoms. Property to the value of 22,000 dollars stolen. Money, jewellery and clothing stolen no cargo stolen. (Fishing junks in and around Fan Lo Kong undoubtedly are in league with the Bias Bay pirates )2. Steamship &quot; Kwong Lee.&quot; China Merchants&apos; Steamship Company on Shanghai, Hong Kong, Canton run. Was pirated off Amoy at approximately 12T5 p.m. on the 13th December, 1921, while on a voyage from Shanghai 1o Hong Kong carrying 230 Chinese passengers. The ship was taken to Tai Sam Bay, where the pirates le(t the ship in a junk and made for Fan Lo Kong. Pirates to the number of approximately thirty-five boarded the ship in Shanghai. Property, money and jewellery to the value of about 1.20,000 dollars was stolen. The pirates were probably mostly natives of Fan- Lo Kong and Nim Shan districts, some of them could speak English. They were armed with revolvers. One Chinese passenger was shot dead and his body thrown into the sea.   Information was later given that the names of the leaders were : (1.) Tsang Chiu Man of Wai Chau. (2.) i\&apos;g Tai Kim of Fan Lo Kong. (3.) Ng Tai Hi of Fan Lo Kong.All these had previous military experience.3. Steam Launch &quot; Wah Sun.&quot; Pirated between Ma Kvtag and Shan Mei at about 6T5 p.m. on the 18th December, 1921, by about ten men armed with revolvers, on. the Hong Kong-Shan Mei run- Ship taken to Fan Lo Kong Creek. Money, jewellery and clothing to the value of 21,000 dollars stolen. Pirates came on board at Ma Kung as passengers-spoke Hakka.4. Steam Launch &quot; Wah Sun,&quot;-, Also on Hong Kong-Shan Mei run. Pirated again while at anchor in Ping Hoi Harbour on the 22ud May, 1922, by several men who came alongside in sampans. Ship taken to Sam Liu, where the robbers left in sampans. Money, jewellery and clothing stolen to the value of over 5,000 dollars, f 5 Steam Launch &quot; San On.&quot;^- Pirated between Tai Po and Sha Yu Chung on the 4th October, 1922, at about 9 30 a.m. On the Tai Po-Sha Yu Chung run. Taken to Ngo Kung, where the robbers disembarked in a junk and sailed to Tau Tau Shan, near San Liu (Bias Bay East). Nine men spoke Hoklo and other dialects armed with revolvers which they brought on board at Tai Po concealed in a clock. Money, jewellery and clothing stolen.   No cargo stolen.6. Steamship Sui An.&quot; Hong Kong, Canton and Macao Steamboat Company. River steamer on Hong Kong-Macao run. Pirated on the 19th November, 1922, about 10 miles from Macao, while on a voyage from Macao to Hong Kong, carrying, approximately, 60 saloon passengers, 135 second-class and 220 third-class passengers. Pirates about 60 in number boarded the ship in Macao.   They shot dead 2 Indian
guards and wounded-the captain, 2 guards and 2 passengers. Ship taken to Tsang Chau Island, north east of. Bias Bay. Pirates ,left in ,sampans which came from the shore. Money, jewellery and clothing stolen to the value of over 34,000 dollars. Pirates spoke Hakka and Hoklo and were all armed with revolvers or rifles. Some of them had a knowledge of English. They were probably mostly natives of the villages in the Bias Bay area. Subsequently on information one man was arrested in a Shanghai boarding-house in possession of fifteen revolvers. He was supposed to have participated in the &quot; Sui An &quot; piracy. He was banished from Hong Kong for a period of ten years and handed over to the French authorities in Shanghai. Several informers came forward after the&apos;piracy with information regarding the identity of the pirates, but it is doubtful if any of the information was really accurate and no useful results were obtained from the information given. The piracy was reported to General Chan&apos; Kwing Ming, who&apos;was then in power in Canton, and a Chinese gunboat carrying troops was sent to Bias Bay. A party of police under Inspector Boulger embarked on the gunboat to watch the proceedings. The troops landed, but made little effort to locate the pirates and no useful results were obtained.7. Steamship &quot;Sunning.&quot; River steamer, Shiu Iiing Steamship Company, on Hong Kong-Kongmoon run. Was pirated at 815 p.m. on the 23rd October, 1923, off Castle Peak while on a voyage from Hong Kong to Kongmoon. She was carrying about 300 passengers. Pirates numbered about thirty-five men. The ship was taken to Tsang Chau Island, Bias Bay North-East, and the pirates left in the ship&apos;s boats. The captain, chief officer and one Indian guard were wounded. The pirates spoke Hakka, Hoklo, Mandarin and Punti, and were armed with revolvers which they smuggled on board in Hong Kong. Property, jewellery and money to the value of over 20,000 dollars was stolen. Tt was later reported by General Hung Shiu Lun that the pirates leader&apos;s name was Tin 0 Tau, a native of Waichau. An informer also reported the names of several persons who were supposed to have taken part. Most of the persons mentioned came from Waichau or the Fan Lo Kong and Nim Shah districts.S. Steamship &quot; Hydrangea.&quot; On Hong Kong-Swatow run. Was pirated at about 6-40p.m. on the 27th December, 1923, off Single Island, near Bias Bay, while on a voyage from Hong Kong to Swatow. She was carrying about 500 passengers and was taken to Bias Bay. The pirates numbered, approximately, 45 and spoke Hakka and Hoklo dialects. They were armed with revolvers and rifles. Money, jewelery and clothing to the vame of 23,369 dollars was stolen, also part of the cargo, i.e., ten cases of piece-goods to the value of 10.000 dollars. The pirates who came from Fan Lo Kong and Nim Shan districts went ashore in the ship&apos;s boats. As a result of representations made to the Chinese authorities, Commander Wong Fuk Chi, under the orders of General Chan Kwing Ming carried out two expeditions against the pirates in the Nim Shan, Shan Mei and Ping Hoi districts, as a result of which seven men believed to have taken part in this piracy were subsequently shot. One of these was a pirate named Tin Ah Wong, the brother of Tin 0 Tau, mentioned in connection with the Sunning piracy. Another pirate leader shot was named Tsang Kong. Several villagers who opposed the military in the raids in the districts. mentioned were also shot and their houses were burned. One of the pirates shot, named Lo Kam, admitted1 participation in this piracy, and gave the names of several of his confederates ; he also stated that the pirates were not all acquainted with each other but were collected together by several sub-leaders. His particular sub-leaders were Chu Cheong, a native of San Yu, and a man named Cheung Mau Sang, also of San Yu. He further stated that 39 men took part in the piracy. The arms used were presumably smuggled on board in Hong Kong. Three revolvers used in above piracy were recovered by Commander Wong Fide Chi in his operations and returned to the Hong Kong police. Later Commander Wong Fuk Chi carried out a raid at Ping Shan, as a result of which five men believed to be pirates were shot.9. Steamship&quot; Ning Shin.&quot; Shanghai-Foochow run. Was pirated at approximately 3 p M. on the 3rd October, 1924, one clay out of Shanghai, while on a voyage from Shanghai to Fooehow. The ship was carrying 30 cases of silver bars consigned to the American Oriental Bank, Foochow, valued approximately 97,000 taels. Thirty-four pirates boarded the ship at Shanghai as passengers. About 250 Chinese passengers were on board. , One quartermaster was killed and one sailor wounded. The ship was taken to a place off Tree Point, Bias Bay, where sampans came alongside. The pirates then discharged the silver and other cargo, together with the loot taken from the passengers, into the sampans, which then made for Sun Liu. The pirates, who were armed with revolvers, presumably smuggled their arms on board at^ Shanghai; They came from the Nim Shan and Fan Lo Kong districts.   Communication was at
once made with General Ip Kui at Waichau, who sent an expedition to Nim Shan under a commander named Yung Fai Ting. It was later reported on fairly good authority that this commander succeeded in rounding up many of the pirates and recovering most of the silver bars stolen, but the pirates were released on payment of a large sum and the silver bars were appropriated by his troops. However, another expedition was later sent under the orders of General Hung sulphuric Lun with Commander Wong Fuk Chi in command. The latter corroborated the statement above regarding Yung Fai Ting, and further stated that the silver had been melted down and made into silver coins. In February 1925 Commander Wong Fuk Chi succeeded in effecting the arrest of one Sun Mau at Tai Pung. This man admitted participation in this piracy, and stated that Lam Tsoi Sau (a notorious pirate), a Hakka, a native of Cheung Pai village in Fan Lo Kong district, was the leader in this piracy. He also gave the names of several of his confederates. His story was to the effect that the pirates went to Shanghai via, Hong Kong in a B. and S. steamer. He stayed with others at the Hung On Boarding House in Hong Kong before leaving for Shanghai (this statement was verified and found to be true). The arms were purchased in Shanghai. Eighteen men accompanied him via Sha Yu Chung to Hong Kong. His share of the loot was 40 pieces of silver, 40 dollars in one dollar coins and some serge clothing. The pirates known to him came from the Bias Bay area. There were several other pirates unknown to him in this gang. This ship did not come under the Hong Kong Piracy Prevention Ordinance.10. Steamship &quot;Hong Hwa^-Ro Hong Steamship Company, of Singapore. Running between Rangoon, Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong, Swatow and Amoy. Was pirated six days out from Singapore in latitude 14Q 53&apos; N., longitude 110&quot; 24&apos; E., on the 13th January, 1925, at 8&apos;40 A. ad;, while on a voyage from Singapore to Hong Kong. She was carrying 357 passengers. The pirates, numbering about 30 (armed with revolvers) took the ship to Tsang Chau Island, Bias Bay, and left the ship in the ship&apos;s boats, taking with them money, jewellery and clothing to the value of 53,300 dollars. From information received it would appear that the pirates came mostly from Nim Shan or Fan Lo Kong and travelled to Singapore, where they procured arms and boarded the ship as passengers. The leader of this gang is said to be a man named Lo Ah Chiu, a native of Fan Lo Kong. The ship carried wireless, which was immediately put out of action by the pirates. Hakka and Hoklo was mostly spoken by the pirates, but some spoke Fukien and a few Punti. This ship did not come under the Hong Kong Piracy Prevention Ordinance. At the time this piracy was committed, General Hung Shiu Lun and Commander Wong Fuk Chi happened to be in Hong Kong. On the suggestion of the Captain Superintendent of Police an expedition was organised consisting of members of the navy, army and police in Hong Kong and headed by Commander Wong Fuk Chi. The party left for Ha Chung Bias Bay, in a naval tug, where a party of some 120 of Wong Fuk Chi&apos;s soldiers were embarked and taken to Fan Lo Kong Bay. A landing was effected and raids were made on Kwai Chau, Hai Chau, Nim Shan and Fan Lo Kong. The police were present at these raids. As a result, sixteen men were arrested. They were in possession of . various articles of property obviously illegally obtained. Some Singapore money was also found. The sixteen men were sent to Waichau for trial, and some of the houses occupied by them were burnt, but twelve of these were released after enquiry. The four remaining prisoners were kept in custody for several months at Waichau, but after the city fell into the hands of General Chueng Kai Shek, these four were released. At Fan Lo Kong a man in one of the houses raided fired on the troops who had come to search. This man was summarily shot. He was in possession of a revolver and an automatic. He turned out to be a man called Chau Shui Wai, alias Yeung Ah In, a well-known robber and pirate.General.In dealing with the Bias Bay pirates, it has always been very difficult to get reliable information as to the identity of the pirates concerned, possibly because the whole area is more or less infested with pirates and their families, who appear to be able to keep their movements a secret. There are undoubtedly many gangs still operating (there are three well-known gangs), but these gangs are split up into sections under sub-leaders, who each recruit a certain number of men when it is decided that a piracy is to be committed. In this way it, often happens that a member of a gang only knows his sub-leader and a few of the men with whom he is operating-This is au added difficulty in securing reliable information.

Stirling, Commodore, Hong Kong, to Governor, Hong Kong.Your Excellency, Hong Kong, June 24, 1926. .With reference to the proposals made recently for dealing with piracies which may occur in future in Bias Bay and adjacent Chinese territories, the following are briefly some of the instructions issued by the Admiralty to Naval Officers for dealing with such incidents.These regulations apply to piracies on the inland waterways on the coasts of China, as well as on the high seas.2. Generally, His Majesty&apos;s ships may co-operate for the suppression of piracies when so requested by local authorities (through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consuls), with the exceptions hereafter mentioned : (a.) His Majesty&apos;s ships are not to be despatched to localities along the coast within Chinese jurisdiction to obtain indemnities for robberies committed, or to secure the release of persons held &quot;to ransom. In all such cases local authorities are to be called upon, through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul, to take immediate measures &quot;for redress,&quot;and should the means at their disposal not be sufficient to effect the object in view, the question of co-operation should be decided by the Senior Officer.(b.) Landing in pursuit of pirates within Chinese jurisdiction is strictly forbidden.(c.) The landing of armed parties to obtain information is objectionable ; the enquiries should be made, when possible, by the Officer in Command.(d.) Parties are on no account to&apos; be landed from His Majesty&apos;s ships within. Chinese jurisdiction to destroy houses or villages, or even search them, on the grounds of their inhabitants being engaged in acts of piracy. The. Chinese officials who accompany His Majesty&apos;s ships on these expeditions have no authority to request that such measures should be adopted.(e.) It will, however, be the duty of Officers in Command to report the information that may reach them of piratical villages and depots, with a view to His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul calling upon the Chinese authorities to take steps for their suppression, in which case our co-operation may be afforded if solicited through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul.(/.) Officers may use force  (i.) When fired upon.(ii.) When a piracy is actually seen to take place, for the destruction orcapture of the pirates, (iii.) To prevent undoubted robbers from making their escape.3. It will be observed, therefore, that on no account can any officers or men be disembarked in Chinese territory to search for or to attack pirates, and that when pirates are once on shore fire can only be opened on them at the request of Chinese officials through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul and in co-operation with Chinese authorities.4. Under these special circumstances I would recommend drat the most effective fire which could be opened from Naval resources in co-operation with Chinese would be salvos of incendiary bombs from aircraft, the object being to burn out the villages.Before such action could be taken, however, it would be necessary to receive a request from the Pekin or Canton authorities, through His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Pekin or His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Canton, and it would be essential for a number of Chinese officials and troops to be present during the operation.(.15276] obeen entrusted with, the suppression of piracy have made little or no attempt to clear this area ; in fact, it is strongly suspected that the military have on more than one occasion acted in collusion with the pirates (many of whom have seen military service), and have been friendly disposed towards them. Effective co-operation has therefore been impossible. The most noted pirate nests in this area are: Nim Shan, FahLo Kong, flai Chau, Kwai Chau, Cheung Pai, Ha Chung and Tai Pung City.(Signed) L. H. V. BOOTH,Assistant Director of Criminal Intelligence.
5. This method would, it is considered, be the most effective for the work and act as the greatest deterrent against future piracies.6. As regards a combined Naval and Military operation, this could be arranged if authorised by his Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and as far as the Navy is concerned would entail (a.) Transport for troops.(b.) Disembarking and re-embarking them on and from the beaches.(c.) Covering their landing and supporting them with gunfire as may be required.The details of this could be arranged after consultation between the Naval and Military staffs as to landing-places and objectives after landing.7. The craft which would be available would depend on the season of the vear, and during summer months it is improbable a cruiser would be available.8. I am discussing this question of a combined punitive expedition with his Excellency the General Officer Commanding, China Command, with a view to formulating a suitable plan, but it would not be possible to put such a plan into operation until the present Standing Instructions issued for the guidance of Commanders-in-Chief, and Senior Officers on the China station, issued by the Admiralty are materially altered.9. It is appreciated that the unstable conditions in China at the present time render the present instructions impractical to a certain extent, but in view of the principles underlying these instructions, it is not possible to make any radical departure from them unless authorised by their Lordships.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) A. J. B. STIRLING, Commodore.Enclosure No. 4.[Officer Commanding Troops, Hong Kong, to Colonial Secretary, Hong Kong.&apos; Sir, Hong Kong, June 25, 1926.In the event of another piracy taking place against a British ship at Bias Bay, or in the vicinity of Hong Kong, I understand it is the intention of his Excellency to deal summarily with the matter. I have the honour to state that from a military point of view the operation would appear to be simple, subject to1 a cruiser or a commandeered ship being available to take the troops without delay to t e scene of the piracy.So far as one can foresee, the number of men necessary for this operation would be roughly two companies of British troops, strength 220. Two days&apos; rations would be carried, and it would be advisable to have the support of Naval fire in case the landing was opposed.British troops at Hong Kong (East Surreys) have already been trained for this type of operation and would be ready to embark fully equipped, &amp;c, within two hours of the warning being issued either by day or night.The authority of the War Office is necessary for this operation, and to avoid any hitch if at any future time a piracy takes place, it would appear advisable to obtain War Office authority without delay.I have, &amp;c.(Signed) F. S. MONTAGUE-BATES, Lieutenant-Colonel.
APPENDIX II.Governor, Hong Kong, to Secretary of State for the Colonies.(CO. No. 0. 187690.)Sir,Hong Kong, August 28, 1926.WITH reference to my secret despatch4&quot; of the 30th June on the subject of the Bias Bay pirates, I have the honour to inform you th&amp;t two further outrages have recently been committed by these pirates.2. The Norwegian steamship &quot; Sandviken,&quot; chartered by the Soviet Trading company, known locally as the &quot; Bolshy Company,&quot; which some time ago opened offices in Canton and Swatow, left Canton for Swatow at 9 a.m. on the 21st August with about 120 passengers and general cargo. At about 7T5 p.m. on the same day, when south of Hong Kong, some forty pirates, who came aboard the vessel at Canton disguised as passengers, and who were armed with revolvers and knives, took forcible possession of the ship, cut the wireless apparatus, obliged the captain to proceed to Bias Bay, and there looted the ship and the passengers. The pirates released the ship at 6 a.m. on the 22nd August, and she then proceeded to Swatow, where she arrived at 6 p.m. on the same day with crew and passengers all safe.. The first news of the affair received in this Colony was a telegram despatched from Swatow by steamship Sandviken&quot; to Messrs. Wallem and Co. in Hong Kong at 6 p.m. on the 22nd August; but this news was not transmitted by Messrs. Wallem and Co. to this Government until the 24th August. The steamship &quot; Sandviken &quot; is registered in Bergen, Norway.3. The steamship &quot; Hoinam,&quot; a small Chinese-owned steamer, which plies between Canton and Swabue (Shanmei), left the latter port at noon on the 23rd August, and after the usual stop at Ma Kung, when off Bias Bay, she was seized by some thirty armed pirates, who had come aboard as passengers, taken into Bias Bay and looted. The pirates left the ship in small boats, which they met at a pre-arranged spot, and released her. The steamship &quot; Hoinam &quot; then continued her voyage, passing south-ward of Hong Kong, direct to Canton, whence the first news of the affair reached Hong Kong on the 27th A\igust.4. Another recent piracy, which took place quite close to Hong Kong, was that of the steamship &quot; Kwong Lee,&quot; owned by the China Merchants&apos; Steam Navigation Company. She was en route from Shanghai to Canton, and passed south of Hong Kong in the morning of the 13th July. When she was entering the Canton River a number of pirates, disguised as passengers, seized her and took her to Ngai Mun, in the delta, where they looted and disabled her. The ship, after the pirates left her, managed to get under way again at 6 p.m. on the 15th July and proceeded direct to Canton, where the first report of the occurrence was made.o. Lu none of these cases has the Canton Government taken any steps to trace the pirates or to act against the pirate bases, which are well known; and it is clear that, if piracies of ever-increasing number and daring are not to be committed in and around the waters of this Colony, we must ourselves take steps to make the pirate bases in Bias Bay and in the Canton River delta unsafe as centres from which these operations can be planned and executed. I trust, therefore, that the recommendations made in my secret despatch of the 30th June, if not yet acted upon when this despatch reaches you, may be approved as early as possible and that telegraphic instructions on the subject may be sent to me.I have, &amp;c.(Signed)C. CLEMENT!Governor, &amp;c.* Appendix I.[15276]d
APPENDIX III.Para-phrase Telegram from the Governor of Kong Kong to the Secretary of State for the Colonies dated October 6, 1926.(Secret.)I REQUEST reply as soon as possible to my secret despatch of the 30th June.* See also my secret despatch of the 28th August t It is very necessary that action should be taken to suppress pirates from Bias Bay who have committed yet another piracy.The steamship &quot; Hsin-fung &quot; (China Mail Steamer Navigation Company), which sails under Chinese flag, but has several European officers, left Shanghai on the 1st October for Tientsin and Chefoo. Pirates who had embarked as passengers took possession of the vessel after leaving Shanghai and forced the captain to make for Hong Kong and later for Bias Bay. On arrival at the latter place the pirates landed taking with them the ship&apos;s compradore, an old man. Ship reached Hong Kong yesterday. It appears that there was a belief that the vessel carried bullion (which had not in fact been shipped) ; hence the pirates searched passengers and luggage and took whatever money and valuables they could find. Pirates probably scattered at once amongst the villages for seaplane reconnaissance failed to locate them.APPENDIX IV.Telegram from British Minister, Peking, October 14, 1926.MY immediately preceding telegram.JFollowing received from Canton, No. 90, begins :  &quot; Hong Kong scheme to be effective would entail destruction of villages and native craft as actual pirates could probably not be identified. This would lay us open to charge of barbarous treatment of innocent villagers.&quot; I suggest as an alternative that we occupy Bias Bay with small garrison, at the same time giving Canton Government public undertaking to withdraw it as soon as it can be replaced by a permanent garrison of Chinese troops.&quot;If this is not feasible, then I think Hong Kong scheme is better than doing nothing.&quot; In either case action should come immediately after piracy of a British ship by this gang. I recommend, however, that I be authorised to inform Canton Government forthwith that action decided on will be taken after next piracy unless they act in the meantime. I&quot; I have already urged in vain that Canton Government should seek British co-operation in dealing with this menace, but threat of independent action may have some effect.&quot; I have asked Governor of Hong Kong to send you information regarding Hsin-fung.&quot;APPENDIX V.Telegram from British Minister, Peking, October 14, 1926. YOUR telegram No. 284.Hsin-fung piracy is dealt with in Hong Kong telegram^ to Colonial Office of 6th October.As regards action for dealing with Bias Bay pirates, I concur generally in view expressed by Acting Consul-General contained in my immediately following telegram.H* Appendix I. f Appendix TI. J Appendix V.I Appen iix III. II Appendix IV
APPENDIX VI.Draft Telegram to British Minister, Peking.YOUR telegrams Nos. 374 and 375 : Proposed action against Bias Bay pirates.I concur generally. Mr. Brenan should, however, in the first place, make every effort to induce the Canton Government to take the necessary action themselves. With this object in view, he might certainly give them clear warning that, unless they will themselves at once take steps to deal with pirates in Bias Bay, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be compelled to take independent action immediately after next pirate outrage directed against a British ship or endangering British lives. He need not specify too definitely nature of such action, which, rather than landing of or occupation by military force suggested in Canton telegram No. 90, should preferably take the form of patrolling of coast by naval forces.Repeat to Canton and Hong Kong.oUnder existing political conditions, co-operation of any northern man of-war, possibility of which was contemplated in despatch from Government of Hong Kong of 30th June, would be more likely to antagonise Canton than isolated action by ourselves.(Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 374 ; repeated to Hong Kong and Canton.)
