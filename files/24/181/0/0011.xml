IS DOCTOHBITT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS SRI TAHITI C MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERHHEHT).I C R B T . I, 311 (36)COPY NO ._*60 A B IJE T .CHEMICAL WARFARE POLICY.POSITION OF THE DOMINIONS .Memorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.1.     The general historjr of this matter is given in C.I.D* Memoranda Kos. 535-B and 708-B.2.     In the Treaty &quot;between the United States of America, the British Empire, France, Italy and Japan in relation to the use of submarines and noxious gases in warfare, signed at the Washington Disarmament Conference, Article 5 provided -&quot;The use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices, having been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world and a. prohibition of such use having been declared in treaties to which a majority of the civilised Powers are parties:The Signatory Powers, to the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of international law binding alike the conscience and praotice of nations, declare their assent to such prohibition, agree to be bound thereby as between themselves and invite all other civilised nations to adhere thereto.&quot;The Dominions, excepting the Irish Free State which did hot then exist but which is in fact included in the instrument of ratification, agreed in 1922 to the ratification of this and the other Washington Treaties by His Majesty, but the ratifications/
ratifications were not deposited at once owing to the unwillingness of the United States Government to receive them until a date could be fixed on which all p0wers could deposit their ratifications simultaneously.Although ratifications in respect of the Naval Disarmament Treaty, the Pour-Power pacific pact and the Supplementary Agreement respecting Insular Possessions were deposited in August 1923, and those in respect of the two Treaties relating to China were deposited in August 1925, nothing more has yet been done in the matter of the Gas Treaty.     It is understood from the Poreign Office that the actual instrument is at the Embassy at Washington, but that apparently Prance and Italy are not yet prepared to ratify. The Treaty is, therefore, not in force.     The position as regards the Irish Pree State is that the Treaty when ratified will apply unless or until it is modified.3.      The Arms Traffic Conference held at Geneva under the auspices of the League of Nations in May and June 1925,adopted inter alia a protocol for the prohibition of the usein war of asphyxiating, poisonous or ^other gases, and ofbacteriological methods of warfare.     The main portion of thisProtocol read as follows:-&quot;WHEREAS the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world;    andWHEREAS the prohibition of such use has been declared in Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are Parties;    andTo the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations;declare that the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already parties to Treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration.&quot;It/
It will be observed that with the exception of the insertion of baoteriological methods of warfare, the wording is almost identical with that of the Washington Treaty.The protocol was signed on June 17th, 1925, by Lord Onslow on behalf of the British Empire with a declaration that his signature did not bind India or any British Dominion which is a separate member of the League of Nations, and does not separately sign or adhere to the Protocol.     It was also signed by Mr. Walter A. Riddell on behalf of Canada and by Sir p. Cox on behalf of India.     The Irish Free State representative,  the only other Dominion representative at the Conference, did not sign the protocol, and no information is available that he has since done so.     The protocol, however,  contains a space for the Irish Free State signature, and at the moment the position appears to be that the Irish Free State can either sign or accede.It may be noted that the Protocol provides that the &quot;High Contracting Parties will exert every effort to induce other States to accede to the present Protocol&quot; .     The position of the other Dominions which are members of the League of Nations, i.e., Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa seems to be that they can only accede to the Protocol after it has been ratified.      Ho communication has been sent to these Dominions on the subject, but they have presumably received their copies of the Protocol direct from the League.The position as regards ITewfoundland and Southern Rhodesia is that they have been sent copies of the Protocol for information.4.     A despatch has just been received from Southern Rhodesia (copy annexed), asking whether they could use gas in the event of a native rebellion, but as both the Treaty and the protocol would only be binding as between the Contracting Powers,  such use of gas would not, presumably, affect Southern Rhodesia&apos;views/
views on ratification.5.     Put shortly the position is:-(a) that this country and all the Dominions are techincally hound by the earlier international agreements;(b) that all the Dominions (except the Irish Eree State, which is in fact included in the instrument of ratification) agreed in 1922 to ratification of the Washington Gas Treaty, but this has not yet been effected;(c) that the Dominions have not yet been consulted as to ratification of the Geneva Gas Protocol and that only Canada and India have signed it.6.      It would, however,  seem essential for military reasons that this country and the Dominions should adopt a common policy with regard to the Geneva Gas Protocol, and hence it is suggested that before His Majesty&apos;s Government press foreign I Powers to ratify the protocol, they should consult Canada asj to whether they are prepared to agree to ratification and alsoascertain the views of the other Dominions (including for this purpose, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia) .(initialled)     L.S.A.pinions Office,      S.W. 1., I   31st July,  1926.
DESPATCH PROM THE ACTING GOVERNOR OF SOUTHERN RHODESIA TO THE SECRETARY OP SffATS POR DOMINION affairs&quot;Governor&apos;9 Office, Salisbury,Ho. 145 .Southern Rhodesia 25th June, 1926.Sir,At the instance of ray Ministers I have the honour to enquire if, having regard to the international agreements concerning the use of gas in war, the use of gas in native rebellions would be permissible.2.     In the past the suppression of native rebellions has been rendered more difficult by the natives taking refuge in caves in the hills.     During the Rebellion of 1896 the only available and effective method of expelling natives from such caves was the use of dynamite;   but this necessarily inflicted suffering on non-combatants.     My Ministers have been informed that in such circumstances a mild form of gas would be most effective, both physically and morally.3.     Should there be no objection on general grounds to the use of gas against natives in rebellion, my Ministers would be glad if the Chemical Research Department of the War Office would be good enough to give advice on the methods ofproduction/The Right HonourableL.C.M.S. Amery, P.C.,M.P.,Dominions Office.
production of gas and of its use in conjunction with the weapons available to the Defence Force of Southern Rhodesia.4.     My Ministers desire me to add that the natives of this Colony are peaceable and well-disposod towards the Government, and that they have no reason to anticipate a native rising. In view, however, of the large preponderance in numbers of natives over Europeans, not only in Southern Rhodesia, but also in the countries lying&quot; to the north and east, it is desired to be prepared for such eventuality, however remote it may seem at present.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient,humble servant,(Signed)      MURRAY BISSET.Acting Governor.
